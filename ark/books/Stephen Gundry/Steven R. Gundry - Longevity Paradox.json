I first met Edith shortly after I moved mypractice from Loma Linda University to Palm Springs, California. When she walkedinto my examination room, I encountered a thin, tall, erect, beautiful womanwith a gorgeous head of hair who was dressed to the nines. To my eyes, sheappeared to be about 65 years old. But a quick glance at the chart started myhands shaking. Forget 65 or 75 or even 85. She was in her nineties! The womanstanding before me in three-inch heels (I kid you not) appeared shockinglyyoung, yet her chart revealed that she was, in fact, quite old.In Loma Linda, California—one of the world’s best-known “Blue Zones”—I hadencountered many healthy centenarians. Nevertheless, I was singularly unpreparedto meet Edith. She exemplified a seeming paradox: chronological old age wrappedup in an implausibly youthful, vital physical form.Edith told me she had attended one of my recent speaking engagements and that Ireminded her of someone else she’d heard speak about nutrition more than seventyyears ago, when she was just 20 years old. That person was the nutritionistGayelord Hauser, whose advice she’d been following to the letter ever since.She’d bought and read each of his books, adopted his dietary protocol, and stuckto her guns even when her husbands (she buried two in her time, including onewho was a doctor) had told her she was crazy. After a lifetime of followingHauser’s advice, she was still fit as a fiddle.I couldn’t believe my good fortune in meeting her. I peppered her withquestions, wanting to know more about what exactly she’d learned from Hauser andhow she’d maintained her health and vitality for so many years. Though I becameher doctor and remained so until the day she passed, I can say for certain thatI learned more from her than she learned from me. She showed me that thelongevity paradox I’d imagined—the ability to die young at a ripe old age—wasindeed a possibility that was available to us all.As I gained more insight into Edith’s (and, by extension, Hauser’s) nutritionalpractices, I took a deep dive into the research of longevity and discoveredanother paradox that defines aging—that nonhuman ancient genes actually have thepower to keep us young. How is this possible? Buckle up—we’re about to embark onquite an adventure.In The Plant Paradox, I asked you to hop into an imaginary time machine and takea journey with me back 450 million years, to a time when plants were the onlylife-forms on Earth. They ruled the land for about 90 million years untilinsects showed up and started eating them. That was a tough time for the plants,but they were not about to go down without a fight. Plants are amazing organismsthat can transform sunlight into matter, a feat we have yet to master. Theyweren’t going to let a little thing like the sudden appearance of millions oftiny predators stop them from growing and reproducing, so they developed complexdefense mechanisms to protect themselves. These included chemical compounds thatpoisoned, paralyzed, or entrapped their predators and others that made them sickor disoriented. In The Plant Paradox, I argued that many of the health crises wehumans are facing today are a result of unwittingly consuming those plantcompounds. (If you haven’t read that book, don’t worry—it’s not a prerequisiteto reading and understanding anything and everything that follows here!)Now I want you to climb into a new time machine with me and go back evenfurther, to a time long before even plants existed: about 3 billion years ago.We would find ourselves in a vast empty space where the only living things arebacteria and other single cells that can grow and divide without oxygen. Infact, as hard as it is to believe, oxygen is often deadly to these single-celledorganisms. As a prelude to something you’ll read more about later, theseorganisms could thrive on what we consider a toxic gas called hydrogen sulfide.But something important is happening in the atmosphere: oxygen levels arerising. These bacteria evolved in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment. Tothem, oxygen is lethal, and the world is suddenly becoming a very dangerousplace.Like all living things, these bacteria, which belong to the class of organismscalled prokaryotes, have a biological imperative to survive and pass on theirDNA, so they come up with a very clever plan to protect themselves in thishostile new environment. They hop inside other single-celled organisms and makea deal that will dramatically change the course of life on Earth. In exchangefor food and a stable, protected home, the bacteria will give their host cellextra energy to fuel its functions and survival. It was that arrangement thatresulted in the advanced cells, called eukaryotes, which constitute the cells ofalgae, fungi, plants, and all animals, including you and me.Now let’s get back into our time machine and zoom forward to the twenty-firstcentury. What if I told you that in the present day, these engulfed bacteriastill reside in your cells? As the saying goes, truth is often stranger thanfiction. The engulfed bacteria are called mitochondria, and their job is to usethe oxygen you breathe and the calories you eat to create energy for all of yourcells. But not every type of bacteria made the same deal with those single cellsall those billions of years ago. So what happened to the rest of them? As thebacteria in the cells created energy and enabled them to evolve intoincreasingly more complex creatures, oxygen levels in the atmosphere continuedto rise. The remaining bacteria escaped the deadly oxygen by moving into theanimals’ colons, which resembled the anaerobic environment in which they’dthrived for billions of years.Would it be too “out there” to suggest that bacteria actually created animals,including humans, so they could avoid oxygen and live safely on Earth? And talkabout “out there”; suppose I told you that the bacteria in your gut keep inclose contact with their relatives, the mitochondria inside your cells, in orderto communicate with them about how things are going on the “other side”? We’lldiscuss all of this and more in the pages that follow.Now, you may be asking yourself, what does any of this have to do withlongevity? In a word, everything. Because as your bacteria’s home, what happensto you depends on what happens to them. It may be hard at first to accept thefact that your fate is in the hands of the trillions of bacteria that liveinside, on, and around you. Here’s the thing: you’re not actually who you thinkyou are. The real you—or, more accurately, the whole you—includes all thosebacteria, and the “you” that you are familiar with is actually only a small partof the whole. In fact, 90 percent of “your” cells are not actually human cellsat all. They are the cells of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and worms that live onyou and inside you, commonly referred to as the microbiome, or as you astutePlant Paradox readers know, your holobiome.So your longevity is paradoxically tied to the fate of these ancientorganisms—the oldest parts of you have the power to help keep you young. It allgoes back to the bacteria’s need to survive and pass on their DNA. Your body isessentially a condominium for your microbiome or, as I like to call them, yourbugs. You are their home. And as you’ll soon learn, if you provide a nice,hospitable home for them, they will be exceptionally good tenants. They’ll keepthe utilities running efficiently, the plumbing in tip-top shape, and even theexterior paint fresh. On the other hand, if you feed them foods they do notthrive on, allow squatters to move in and take over, and let the foundation rot,they’ll give up and let the rest of you decay right along with it. Ourrelationship with our bugs has always been, and continues to be, symbiotic; inother words, their health is dependent on you and vice versa. You take care ofthem, and they’ll take care of you—for the long term.In addition to being made up of 90 percent foreign cells, we humans arecomprised mostly of foreign genes. Believe it or not, 99 percent of all thegenes that make up “you” are bacterial, viral, and protozoal genes, not humangenes at all. Humans actually have very few genes, and the ones we do have arevirtually identical to those in our primate cousins, chimps and gorillas. Infact, the popcorn you may be eating as you read this (that was a test; youwouldn’t dare eat corn after reading The Plant Paradox, would you?) has 32,000genes, while you have a measly 20,000.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_1] How can thatbe? you say. Corn has more genes than we do? We’re so much more complex than adumb plant! Okay, fine, maybe corn’s got us beat, but surely we have the mostgenes of any animal, right? Wrong! The water flea, Daphnia, has the most genesof any animal, coming in right behind corn at 31,000.2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_2]If we humans have so few genes, how did we become so complex? What makes usdifferent from other animals? In a word: bacteria. When humans evolved, ourbacteria changed, and it was our bacteria, rather than our genes, that made ushuman.3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_3] As shocking as it may seem, most of what hashappened to us, and what will continue to happen to us in the future, isdetermined by the state of the bacteria in our gut, mouth, and skin. So let’sstop focusing on taking care of the 1 percent and start paying closer attentionto the 99 percent of the genes that make up you.You might be feeling a little bit uncomfortable with the idea that we don’t havefull control over our own bodies. But in actuality, the opposite is true. Whenwe learn how to be a good host to our microbes, we can gain a lot of controlover how well we will age and how long we will live. Your fate does not lie inyour genes at all—it lies in your microbiome, and many of your daily decisionsabout food and personal care products influence how happy or unhappy they willbe in their home. Paradoxically—and here’s the point to remember goingforward—whatever happened to your parents or grandparents, your Ancestry.com oryour 23andMe results contribute very, very little to your fate and longevity.Much more of your fate resides with the trillions of organisms living in and onyou.Those microbes have invested a great deal in their condo—they want it to stay ingood shape for a long time. Their survival literally depends on you, and yourson them. We know this from experiments with germ-free mice (which are bornwithout contact with the bacteria that would normally populate their gut), whichlive shorter lives and are more susceptible to disease than mice with normalbacteria, because without communication from those germs, their immune systemsnever develop properly.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_4] Your microbes (or “gutbuddies,” as I like to call them) are there to help you. You are in the driver’sseat of your health and longevity if, and only if, and when, and only when, yougive over your fate to them—the other you, or the unseen you within.In the following pages, I’m going to give you a complete guide to the care andfeeding of your gut buddies. In fact, I’m going to give you a veritable GoogleMaps tour of the entire neighborhood that your holobiome inhabits. The problemis that, like all neighborhoods, yours has its share of bad guys. And if you’vebeen following a standard Western diet and lifestyle, chances are that those badguys have taken over. They’ve broken down the all-important gut border wall thatseparates your other inhabitants from you, put their own needs first, hijackedthe supply lines, and deprived your human cells of food and critical informationto keep things humming along. And your poor gut buddies, with danger lurking onthe streets, have gone into hiding.But here’s the good news: if you starve out the bad guys and throw the good guysa lifeline, the good guys will reemerge, reinforce the border, and revitalizethe neighborhood. What’s more, those good bacteria will start asking you formore of what they need to succeed.Your gut bacteria are not only largely in charge of your health and how well youage—they also influence your behavior. With the mapping of the human microbiomein 2017, we’ve discovered that complex animals such as humans, who have fewergenes than plants and fleas, have uploaded most of their information processingto what I like to think of as our “bacterial cloud,” which has vast computingpower over our fate and health. Since this genome has so many genes and dividesand reproduces incredibly rapidly, your holobiome has immense power to tell“you,” your immune system, and the organelles in your cells how things are goingin the outside world. Though the genome of a bacterium is only one-tenth of ahuman cell’s genome, National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers recentlyshowed that the microbiome contributes 8 million unique genes to human bodies.This means there are 360 times as many bacterial genes as human genes within youor me!5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_5] Since bacteria replicate (divide) so quicklyand have that much genetic “computing power,” our gut buddies are capable ofalmost instantaneous information processing and communicating, even to the pointof influencing our thoughts and actions.I’ve been gratified and a little amused through the years when my junk-foodaddicts or meat-and-potatoes guys come back to see me after a couple of monthson my Longevity Paradox program and tell me that they’ve started to crave saladsand other green things. They are shocked by their own behavior, which is nowbeing remotely manipulated by a new set of microbes, their gut buddies, whichare sending a loud and clear message to take care of their home. You will seethis principle in action throughout this book: give your gut buddies what theywant, and they will return the favor.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_6] Best of all,the bad bugs that are responsible for your junk-food cravings will leave thebuilding and finally stop torturing you.Now, perhaps you’re thinking, how is it possible that bad bugs have taken overif humans are living longer, healthier lives than ever before? Not so fast.There are a lot of misconceptions about aging that we will soon address, and thefirst and foremost is that we’re doing better than ever in terms of longevity.Yes, the average life expectancy has increased over the last five decades. In1960, the average life expectancy of American men was 66.4 years; by 2013, itwas a full ten years longer.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_7] For women, the averageages were 73.1 and 81.1, respectively. But much of this extended life span canbe attributed to the fact that we’ve developed vaccines, antibiotics, andhygiene protocols to beat the main causes of a shortened average life span,namely infectious diseases that disproportionately affected young children.Perhaps we’ve come to an end in terms of what modern advances can accomplish.Sadly, life expectancy has now declined for the last three years!8[Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_8] And never forget, people have lived into very old agesince recorded time. One of my favorite documented cases is that of LuigiCornaro, whose treatise How to Live 100 Years, or Discourses on the Sober Lifechronicled his 102 years of living in the 1400s and 1500s! (And never fear; his“sober” life included a prescription for a daily ration of 500 milliliters—abouttwo-thirds of a bottle—of red wine.)Today we’re starting to see both a decreasing life span and a horribly reducedhealth span, the length of time people maintain full function. Most people nowsee their health begin to decline at age 50.9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_9] Yetwe’ve gotten very good at extending our life span with a host of medicalprocedures, drugs, and treatments. So we’re living longer, but we’re not livingbetter. This, dear reader, is another paradox of aging, and it’s probably whyyou picked up this book. This paradox has become so pervasive that many of usassume we’re meant to spend the second half of our lives in a state of steadydecline. We think it’s somehow normal to be on several prescription medications,undergo invasive surgeries, and require joint replacements. In many cases, weeven plan ahead for it—moving our bedrooms to the first floor of our homes as apreemptive measure even when we can still climb the stairs, for example, as ifthere were some sort of deadline on stair climbing! Tell that to the Sardinians,who regularly live to over 100 and climb the hilly pastures until their finaldays.As a heart surgeon, I have done my part to extend the lives of tens of thousandsof individuals. I’m proud of the fact that I’ve helped so many people livelonger lives, but I quit my job as professor and head of cardiothoracic surgeryat Loma Linda University School of Medicine when I learned that much of what I’dbeen taught about health and longevity—information that many leading doctorsstill believe is true—was simply wrong.For the past nineteen years, I’ve been treating my patients with a combinationof nutritional therapy and conventional medicine, and over and over I’ve seenincredible results. When my patients treat their gut buddies right, they areable to dramatically increase their life spans. As my patients and regularreaders know, I’ve seen dramatic reversals of diseases that many doctors stillbelieve are irreversible, changes that we can track with sophisticated bloodwork and that my patients can feel and see. Many of these changes are directlylinked to alterations we’ve made to their gut bacteria.10[Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_10],11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_9_11]Between the results I’ve observed in my patients, my analysis of an enormousamount of recent research on the gut biome, and my own studies of the world’slongest-lived communities, I now know that your gut bacteria to a great extentinfluence both how long you’ll live and how well you’ll live. And with the helpof my amazing patients, I’ve put together a program that will drive out the badguys and make the good guys feel safe and happy in their home so they’ll becompelled to completely revitalize their neighborhood both inside and out.Some elements of the Longevity Paradox program may be familiar, such as eatinglots of certain vegetables and getting the right amounts of exercise and sleep,while others, such as tricking your body into thinking it’s winter year-round tostimulate your stem cells and spacing out your meals to “wash” your brain atnight, are brand-new. These strategies have helped my patients lower their bloodpressure and cholesterol markers, significantly reduce symptoms of arthritis andother joint issues, resolve MS, lupus, and other autoimmune conditions, improveheart health, and slow or reverse the progression of cancer and dementia—not tomention lose weight and look decades younger! And they accomplish this withoutstarving, eating twigs, counting calories, or putting in hours at the gym.It doesn’t matter how old you are, how old you feel, or how sick or healthy youmay be right now. As on all of the best home-makeover shows, renovations happenquickly when the people in charge have the right materials and are motivated toget the job done. If you follow my plan, within just a few weeks you’ll havemore gut buddies and far fewer squatters, and you’ll start to see and feel adifference in your energy levels, in your lack of symptoms of many of the mostcommon diseases of aging, on your skin, and on the scale.So let’s start transforming your body into the most desirable oceanfront suiteon the market for your gut bacteria. They’ll be sure to thank you with a longand healthy life."},{"pageContent":"ITHE AGING MYTHS [nav.xhtml#ni:3]Before we get into exactly how to best take care of your gut buddies, let’s takea closer look at how they operate in your body and why they’re such a criticalcomponent of your health and longevity. While we’re at it, we’ll clear up someconfusion, misinformation, and downright falsehoods about how and why we age.When it comes to your gut bacteria, you have two priorities. First, you need tomake the good ones so happy that they’ll want to stick around and keep theirhome lovely and well cared for and make the bad ones so unhappy that they’llflee the premises for good. This will give you the ideal population anddiversity of gut buddies that you need for a long life span and health span.Second, it’s just as essential to have a strong gut lining, which I and otherresearchers refer to as the border or mucosal barrier, to keep those gut buddieswhere they should be (in your intestinal tract) so they can protect you fromforeign invaders and avoid being mistaken for invaders themselves. A strong,impermeable barrier is the key to avoiding many of the diseases we associatewith “normal” aging.Let’s start with your gut bacteria: what they are, what they do, and why theyare such an important piece of the Longevity Paradox."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1ANCIENT GENES CONTROL YOUR FATE [nav.xhtml#nch4]I always assumed that I would age much like my dad. As the years passed, he grewoverweight and suffered from heart disease and other complications that we oftenassociate with getting older, such as stiff joints, lack of mobility, anddecreased muscle mass. And for a while there, I did age almost exactly like him.For many years, I was obese, suffered with migraines as he had every day, andhad such bad arthritis that I had to wear braces on my knees to run. Yet I ranthirty miles a week, went to the gym for an hour every day, and ate what I hadbeen taught was a healthy diet. I was doing everything right—or so I thought—andso I figured that my poor health and rapid aging were clearly a case of badgenes. I shared the same DNA as my dad, I reasoned, so I was fated to be fat andsick just like him.To put it bluntly, I was dead wrong. Thankfully, I figured it out before eitherof us was actually dead.Sure, I had certain things in common with my dad, in particular many of the samehealth issues that he struggled with. But what I’ve learned since then is thatwe shared those health problems not because we shared the same DNA, but becausewe had similar habits and lived in similar environments, both of which hadshaped our holobiomes (the trillions of microbes in our bodies, on our skin, andeven in a cloud around us) in remarkably similar ways. And it was thoseholobiomes and their genes that were making us age so quickly, not our humangenes.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_1]This may seem hard to believe, but recent research suggests that this phenomenonis very real. A statistical analysis published in Nature in 20182[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_2] revealed that our gut microbiome (the part of theholobiome that lives in our guts) is shaped by many factors and that “hostgenetics” (that’s right, you are merely a host for your gut buddies) plays arelatively minor role in determining your health and longevity. Now read thatsentence again and really let it soak in. Your human genes have very little todo with your fate. So when a new patient recounts his or her family history now,I know that what I am really hearing is a summary of his or her family’s eatinghabits and lifestyle. In fact, people who are not genetically related but livetogether in the same household have strikingly similar gut microbiomes.Even more compelling, for the individuals in the analysis published in Nature,the makeup of an individual’s gut bacteria was a better predictor of many healthoutcomes—including blood glucose level and obesity—than genetics. In otherwords, you have a better chance of sharing the same health conditions as yourroommate or your spouse than your biological parents, and that’s not because ofluck or coincidence. It’s because you have similar gut bugs.Those gut bugs don’t just impact a few health outcomes; they directly influencethe health and longevity of every part of your body, from your skin to yourhormones to your cellular energy levels. And they play a huge role indetermining how well and how long you’ll live.A recent study from the China Institute collected and analyzed gut bacteria frommore than 1,000 healthy Chinese participants ranging in age from 3 to over 100.They found that a healthy gut is a key indicator of individuals who live pastage 100.3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_3] The study participants who were over 100years old possessed gut buddies that were strikingly similar to those ofindividuals who were up to seven decades younger. The centenarians had the gutmicrobes of a 30-year-old!Meanwhile, a groundbreaking study in 20174 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_4] was ableto pinpoint for the first time the specific types of bacteria (in theRuminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Bacteroidaceae families) that are dominantin healthy people between the ages of 105 and 109 but normally decrease inabundance with age. These particular families of bacteria support health duringaging, but most of us lose them as we get older. People who live to be 105 yearsold, however, hold on to specific gut buddies that keep them young.Still not convinced that your gut buddies play a key role in determining howwell and how long you’ll live? Consider this: when researchers take feces fromobese rats and feed them to skinny rats, presto change-o, the skinny rats becomefat. The reverse is also true: eating a skinny rat’s poop makes fat rats thin.Need a human example? In the 1930s, psychiatric patients suffering from severedepression were given laxatives to clean out their colons and then given enemaswith fecal matter from people who were not depressed. The result: the patientshad a marked improvement in mood.When I was a medical student at the Medical College of Georgia in the 1970s,many patients who had taken broad-spectrum antibiotics—which, at the time, wereconsidered a new class of drugs—developed a severe colon infection calledClostridium difficile (also known as C. diff.) colitis. We now know it wasn’t acoincidence; the antibiotics wiped out the patients’ gut bacteria, leaving themmore susceptible to the infection. But the truly amazing thing is that many ofthose patients were cured by fecal enemas made with the poop of healthy medicalstudents, including yours truly. Little did we know then that the gut buddies inour feces restored those patients’ health by driving out the overgrown bad guys,C. diff.So having the right gut buddies can make you thinner and happier and even cureyou of deadly disease. Would resetting your microbiome to become youngeractually make the rest of you younger, as well? It certainly seems so. But how?For the answers, let’s take a look at exactly what your gut buddies do.GUT BUDDIES AT WORKUnbeknownst to you, the inhabitants of your microbiome are quite busy day andnight. They are involved with regulating major aspects of your immune system,your nervous system, and your hormonal (endocrine) system around the clock. Butperhaps their most important role is in supporting your digestive system—yourgut buddies digest the foods you eat and manufacture and deliver vitamins,minerals, polyphenols, hormones, and proteins to where they are needed in yourbody.For years we had no idea how important the microbiome was for digestion, letalone the manufacture of vitamins and hormones. Now we know that if the bacteriain your gut can’t process the food you eat, you don’t benefit from the nutritionor the information in that food, no matter how good for you it may be. This istrue for all animals. Even a termite cannot “eat” wood; bacteria in its tiny gutactually do the work of digesting the wood and converting it into absorbablecompounds. Without them, the termite would starve no matter how much of yourhome it ate. As a 2016 study on the impact of diet on longevity concluded,“Nutrient uptake depends on your microbiome.”5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_5]In my practice, I have seen many patients who are deficient in several vitamins,minerals, and proteins when they come to me—not because they aren’t consumingthem but because their microbiome isn’t manufacturing and/or allowing absorptionof them. When we drive out the bad bugs and motivate these patients’ gut buddiesto revitalize the neighborhood, lo and behold, the deficiencies disappear. Youcan think about it this way: you are not what you eat; you are what your gutbuddies digest. And they can digest only the specific foods they have evolved torecognize and process for you. On the Longevity Paradox program you’re going tostart eating for your gut buddies instead of for yourself, and they will repaythe favor in spades.To add a note of levity here, one of the greatest long-lived health gurus of thetwentieth century, Jack LaLanne, whom I had the pleasure of knowing, used togive this advice on eating: “If it tastes good, spit it out!” What he wasactually saying without knowing it at the time was: eat for them, not for you!And cheer up; the food you are going to eat for them will taste great for you, Ipromise.But your gut buddies have plenty of other jobs, too. They keep yeast, or candida(which is a normal inhabitant of every gut), in check and fight against theovergrowth of other harmful microorganisms. They also act as bouncers, manningthe door to your gut and actually educating your immune system as to which foodsand substances are beneficial (or at worst harmless) and should be let in andwhich ones may harm you and should be barred from entry. This particular job hasbecome increasingly demanding over the years as our diets have becomeincreasingly complex (more on this later).Your gut buddies also create the precursors to many important hormones andcommunicate with the rest of the cells in your body about how life is going downin the gut. How exactly do they do this? Among other things, by signalingdirectly to your mitochondria, of course! Did you think I’d forgotten aboutthose very savvy ancient dealmakers that hopped into our cells for a betterplace to live and protection and in exchange do the important job of producingall of the energy we need for our cells? Of course not. In fact, I believe theyrepresent a missing link in most discussions about longevity.THE SISTERHOOD OF BACTERIAYour gut buddies and your mitochondria have a lot in common besides the factthat they both evolved from ancient bacteria. While your gut buddies digest thefood you eat, your mitochondria break down (or “digest”) nutrients in order toproduce energy. You can think of this as your cellular digestive system. Is it acoincidence that descendants of bacteria control both types of “digestion”? Idon’t think so, and hopefully by the time you’re done reading this book youwon’t, either.You inherited both your gut buddies and your mitochondria from your mother. As arefresher, mitochondria are engulfed bacteria that live in all your cells. Theycontain their own mitochondrial DNA (genes) that actually divide separately fromthe rest of the cell’s DNA contained in the nucleus. (Didn’t you just love highschool biology?) All mitochondrial DNA is transmitted through the female eggfrom mother to child. So all mitochondria and their DNA are female. Likewise,your mother initially populated your gut microbiome at birth with her bacteriaas you traveled down the birth canal and were exposed to the bacteria in hervagina.This elegant system continued even further when your mother nursed you for thefirst time. Amazingly, her milk contained specific sugar molecules calledoligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides that you couldn’t digest but werethe exact type of food the gut buddies she’d just passed onto you liked best. Inother words, Mom was feeding two infants at once: you and your newly introduced(from her) microbiome. She needed to get the two of you off to a great start—afact that’s not only mind blowing but, as you’ll soon learn, mind enriching!Therefore, I like to think of your gut buddies and your mitochondria, which bothcame from your mother, as sisters. And like all the best sisters, they areconstantly talking to each other. (At least that’s the case with my own twodaughters.) Your gut buddies report to their sister mitochondria about what’shappening in their corner of the condo, and the mitochondria respond to thosereports by taking one of several actions. In addition to creating energy foryour cells, mitochondria are in charge of cell signaling, cellulardifferentiation (what kind of cell a given cell should become), cell death, andcell growth. In other words, the mitochondria decide if a cell should growrapidly, slowly, or not at all. We will see this again later when we talk aboutcancer cells.This means that mitochondria play a crucial role in the aging process. In astudy conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, when researchersinduced a chromosomal mutation in mice that led to mitochondrial dysfunction,the mice developed wrinkled skin and extensive, visible hair loss within amatter of weeks. When the mitochondrial function was restored, the mice’s smoothskin and thick fur returned.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_6] Moreover, new researchsuggests that mitochondrial damage—and whether the damage is repaired—is largelydependent on messages the mitochondria receive from their sisters living in thegut. Are you paying attention yet?You may be wondering how these messages are sent. Well, I like to jokingly referto them as “text messages,” but they are actually hormonal and chemical signals.We used to believe that the nucleus (also known as the command center) of a cellwas in charge of all cellular communication, but you can take the nucleus out ofa cell, and that cell will do just fine and respond to information withouthaving a control center. This is because communication takes place at the cellmembrane or the mitochondrial membrane, not in the nucleus. You can remove thehot spot and still have Wi-Fi. Your gut buddies produce hormonelike substancesand fatty acids that enter your blood or lymphatic circulation and then attachto the cell membrane or a mitochondrial membrane of other cells and exchangeinformation.It’s helpful to look at simple creatures such as worms for evidence of thiscommunication system. The roundworm C. elegans is a time-tested (excuse the pun)model for longevity, as its primitive gut behaves (in miniature) just like thatof a human. A 2017 study7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_7] looked at the effects of aparticular compound called polysaccharide colanic acid (CA), which the worms’gut bacteria produce. When my colleagues conducting the study gave the wormssupplements of CA, they lived longer than their counterparts that were not giventhe compound.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_8] How was that possible? Themitochondria in the roundworms’ other cells responded to the signal from CA. Theextra CA promoted mitochondrial fission, meaning that the existing mitochondriaeach divided into two separate mitochondria in order to produce extra energy.The study showed that the makeup of the bacterial microbiota could influenceaging in the host organism.It appears that our gut buddies have a remarkably similar process. When ourmitochondria receive a message from their sisters in the gut, they, too, respondin ways that increase the number of mitochondria and improve their function.This is a process called hormesis, best summed up by Nietzsche’s famous quote“That which doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.” You’ll learn more aboutactivating hormetic signals later. This is precisely why a major component ofthe Longevity Paradox program involves fostering the kind of bacteria that willsend their sisters longevity messages. They will respond by getting stronger andproducing more energy while working more efficiently.Your gut buddies truly influence every aspect of your health and well-being. Ifthey are happy with how you’re treating them, they communicate that to theirsisters, and in turn you, by making feel-good hormones such as serotonin.9[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_9] They even protect your arteries from harm.10[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_10] If they are hungry or stressed for any reason,they’ll send an alert about that, too. These sisters work together prettyseamlessly. Let’s hear it for the sisterhood!However, this can all change if you do something to drive off the good bugs orlet too many bad bugs in. Those bad bugs haven’t invested in their home the wayyour gut buddies have, and they have no interest in taking care of you. They’reonly out for themselves. And they serve their own needs by hijacking thecommunication system between your gut buddies and their sisters. This makes youcrave the foods that they need, which are the sugars, fats, junk foods, and fastfoods that leave you overweight, inflamed, sick, tired, and more prone to heartattacks, autoimmune conditions, musculoskeletal problems, Alzheimer’s disease,and even cancer. Meanwhile, these bad bugs do nothing to protect you from theresulting damage. If anything, they incite more and more of it until they’vedestroyed their own neighborhood. As in a good Marvel Avengers movie, the badguys threatening your world must be stopped.Want to Live Forever? Look to the Naked Mole RatNaked mole rats have garnered a lot of attention in the scientific community fortheir extreme, and even bewildering, longevity. These small, ugly, hairlessrodents don’t seem to die of old age. They are not immortal, of course, but whenthey do die, it appears to be random instead of based on age. On the surface,their longevity is perplexing and just downright weird. In fact, there are lotsof weird things about naked mole rats. (Even their appearance. Go ahead, googleit.) They can live without oxygen for up to eighteen minutes, almost never getcancer, and on average live about ten to fifteen times as long as other rodentstheir size.My colleagues in longevity are hot on the trail of the naked mole rats, tryingto uncover their secret. How do they seemingly defy the aging process? Many ofus now believe the answer lies in what they eat or, more precisely, what theyfeed their gut buddies. These rodents live in vast subterranean tunnels, wherethey eat primarily roots and tubers that are extremely hard to digest. Theirmicrobiome aids with that digestion and in doing so produces compounds thatmassively extend the life span of these rats compared to their short-livedgrain-eating cousins.Among those compounds is hydrogen sulfide.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_11](Remember that those ancient bacteria lived on this instead of oxygen? Well,your mitochondria can do the same!) This may explain why naked mole rats can goeighteen minutes without oxygen: they use hydrogen sulfide to fuel theirmitochondria. And where do they get the hydrogen sulfide? From all the tubers,onion- and garlic-like bulbs, roots, and soil fungi that they eat. The fungi aresuperb sources of compounds that promote longevity. We’ll have a full discussionof these guys soon.Finally, naked mole rats have extremely high levels of hyaluronic acid, thoughtto make their bodies extremely flexible for maneuvering in their undergroundtunnels. And where did they get all that hyaluronic acid? Again, from thetubers. In fact, many long-lived people get very high amounts of hyaluronic acidfrom their sweet potato– and taro root–based diet. (Care to guess what some ofthe food choices in The Longevity Paradox might be?)The impact of this diet on longevity is reflected in the naked mole ratmicrobiome. In 2017, a group of my fellow researchers from Italy, Germany, andEthiopia looked at the fecal matter of naked mole rats and compared their gutbacteria makeup and diversity to that of humans and other rodents. They foundthat the microbiota of the naked mole rat was approximately as diverse as ahuman one and significantly more diverse than that of a wild mouse. Thisexplains why naked mole rats greatly outlive other rodents their size: their gutbiome more closely reflects those of animals with far longer life spans. Butwhat’s more interesting for you and me is the fact that naked mole rats are theonly rodents that eat tubers and roots, which are some of the most importantsources of food for gut buddies. You can see where this is going, right?Also of note, the naked mole rats in the study had an abundance of a specificfamily of bacteria (Mogibacteriaceae) that are also found in humans with extremelongevity (over 105 years old).12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_12] Read that again!Super old naked mole rats and super old humans have the same species of gutbugs! Coincidence? Not on your life. Want some more “coincidences”? Naked molerats also have an extremely low metabolic rate, and in times of drought orfamine, their metabolic rate drops by an additional 25 percent. This is anotherkey to their longevity that you will learn to duplicate on the Longevity Paradoxprogram.GUT BUDDY EVOLUTIONBut before we stop the bad bugs (and I promise we will), let’s take a look athow and why they have taken over so many of our bodies in the first place. Thisrequires another quick trip in the time machine to a much more recent period ofhistory, only about 40 million years ago. It may be hard to believe, but backthen we were tree dwellers. We mainly ate tree leaves and other two-leafedplants (known as dicots), along with the fruit of those plants. The otheranimals in existence were grazers. Grazing animals ate single-leafed plants(known as monocots), such as grasses and their seeds. Our intestines and themicrobes within them evolved very differently from those of grazers, andtherefore we were each uniquely able to tolerate the plant compounds, includingproteins called lectins, that comprised the majority of our diets. In otherwords, the microbiome of a grass eater evolved to digest the lectins and othersubstances in monocots, while a tree-leaf eater evolved to digest the lectinsand other substances in dicots.We know that the longer you are exposed to a compound, the more you becometolerant of it. Think of how allergy shots give you a tiny dose of an allergenuntil eventually you are no longer allergic to that food or substance. In thiscase, the time frame necessary for us to gain the ability to tolerate certaincompounds wasn’t weeks or months; it was millennia. Over the course of 40million years, the microbes that now call your body home and can easily digesttwo-leafed plants were passed down from generation to generation.13[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_13],14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_14]Likewise, the predecessors of cows, sheep, antelope, and other grazers have hadmillions and millions of years to develop and pass on gut buddies that arecapable of handling single-leafed plants. By handling, of course, I meandigesting and eliminating them, and if they can’t digest them, then at leastsignaling to their sister mitochondria and the immune system that all is well,the compounds are familiar and don’t pose a threat. After all, they’ve beenencountering them for millions of years. But if your gut buddies didn’t evolveto grow accustomed to a particular compound, they will see it as a threat andlet their sisters know that trouble is brewing. This is where a great deal ofunnecessary and avoidable aging begins.So what are the compounds in single-leafed plants that are so troublesome forhuman gut buddies? If you’ve read The Plant Paradox, you already know theanswer. If not, don’t worry—you’re going to get up to speed quickly. Thecompounds that create the most problems for your gut buddies are called lectins.They are a type of “sticky protein” that plants produce as a defense againstbeing eaten. Remember, just like you (and your gut buddies), plants want to livelong enough to pass their DNA along to the next generation. So they producelectins as part of their survival strategy. Before humans existed and insectswere the main predators that plants had to look out for, lectins paralyzed thebugs that ate them—a pretty effective defense mechanism.Now, we’re a lot bigger and stronger than a little bug—and we have our owndefense mechanisms, such as mucus, which you’ll read more about later. So weoften don’t experience any immediate problems after eating lectins. But,importantly, our gut buddies do, and the more lectins we eat, the less happythose gut buddies will be. And as you now know, if your gut buddies are unhappy,they will let their home sink into a state of disrepair. And what that means foryou is becoming overweight, tired, achy, and sick.When we look at mice and rats, which are grain eaters, it’s easy to see howtheir microbiomes have evolved to better handle the lectins in grains as aresult of having eaten single-leafed plants and their seeds for millions ofyears. Compared to humans, rodents have hundreds of times more of an enzymecalled protease in their gut, which breaks down lectins and other grainproteins. Like rodents, the longer you have been eating a particular plantlectin, the more time your gut buddies have had to develop ways to defusethem.15 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_15]Our gut buddies and enzymes don’t have the same mechanisms as those of grazinganimals, but that wasn’t a problem until about ten thousand years ago. That’swhen we began to cultivate grains and other single-leafed plants. These plantsare totally different from the foods that your gut buddies evolved the capacityto eat—the ones that make them happy so they will keep you young.As I said in The Plant Paradox, ten thousand years may seem like a long time,but developing an immunological tolerance to a new lectin within that time frameis like speed dating in terms of evolution. And over the last fifty years or so,things have gotten much, much worse for your gut buddies as humans have largelyabandoned traditional methods of eating and preparing lectin-rich foods, such assoaking and fermenting, opting instead for quick, cheap options. We’ve alsotaken to eating food that has no basis in nature: genetically modified organism(GMO) foods and meat and dairy products from animals that were fed foods (anddrugs) that their gut buddies aren’t equipped to digest, either! Our diets havechanged more rapidly over the last half century than ever before in history. Wenow eat far more wheat, corn, and other grains, as well as soybeans—often in theform of processed foods—than unprocessed foods such as leafy greens and othervegetables.16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_16]During this same time period our food system has been compromised by anonslaught of herbicides, biocides, drugs, fertilizers, and food additives. Andchemicals from personal care products, factory-produced furniture, and householdcleaners have invaded our homes. Collectively, exposure to these toxins hasthrown our holobiome for a loop. A new study out of the University of Coloradoat Boulder shows that when people are out and about, they leave plumes ofchemicals behind them, not just from their car tailpipes but also from theproducts they put onto their hair and skin. During rush-hour traffic, emissionsof siloxane, a microbiome-destroying ingredient in shampoos, lotions, anddeodorants, are found in comparable levels to vehicle exhaust.17[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_17] Just one more reason to dread your daily commute.Even our healthy vegetables are not being raised with the help of soil bacteria,which have been wiped out by modern farming practices. Soil levels of zinc andmagnesium, which both help prevent diabetes and metabolic syndrome, have droppedsignificantly.18 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_18] There is simply no way for your gutbuddies to catch up and adapt to all of these changes so quickly. And thatchemical overload, along with drastic changes to our diet, is sending our gutbuddies away in droves and making it possible for the bad guys to take over.GUT BUDDY POISONBut wait—it gets worse. Over the last fifty to sixty years, we’ve also seen anumber of new drugs and medical technology “advances.” Many of these discoveriesare helping us live longer, but this has come at the expense of our microbiome.And therein lies another paradox.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, broad-spectrum antibiotics arrived on thescene. These drugs are unique because they are capable of killing multiplestrains of bacteria simultaneously, and—don’t get me wrong—they have savedcountless lives by eliminating bacteria that cause diseases such as pneumoniaand septicemia (blood poisoning). However, to your gut buddies, theseantibiotics are basically the equivalent of a bomb going off in the middle ofthe condo. They wipe out everyone without bothering to target the bad guys. As aresult, the bad guys are killed off, but so are most of the good guys, throwingoff the delicate balance of your inner bacterial population.I’m grateful that we have antibiotics for instances when we really need them,but they have become so popular that doctors prescribe them when they’re notwarranted, often even when their best guess is that the patient is sufferingfrom a virus, which an antibiotic won’t cure. Before you accept a prescriptionand head off to the pharmacy, think about this: every course of broad-spectrumantibiotics you take affects your gut biome for up to two years. Some of the gutbuddies that get killed may never feel safe enough to return. Lest I be accusedof being overly dramatic, here is some evidence of the devastating effects ofantibiotics: studies show that every time you take a course of antibiotics, youincrease the likelihood of developing Crohn’s disease, diabetes, obesity, orasthma later in life.19 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_19]But even if you’ve never filled a prescription for antibiotics (which wouldgreatly surprise me), you’ve still most likely consumed enough of them to killoff large numbers of your gut buddies. How so? Conventionally raised livestockare fed antibiotics in shocking quantities to prevent them from getting sick andto fatten them up for slaughter, and you consume those drugs when you consumemeat, milk, and other animal products. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are also givento pigs, chickens, and other animals because they help them grow faster, larger,and fatter. And guess what? They do the same thing to you by killing off the gutbuddies that keep you lean and flexible well into your old age. In fact, obesityin humans is marked by a decrease in bacterial diversity in the gut.20[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_20] Too many antibiotics will make you fat and ready forslaughter. Is it any wonder our culture’s version of old age doesn’t look soinviting?I hate to tell you this, but you’ve also likely consumed plenty of “antibiotics”even if you’ve been a vegan your entire life. That’s because glyphosate, themain ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, patented by the agriculturalbiochemistry giant Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) as an antibiotic, is sprayed onnearly all GMO crops and on many conventionally grown crops as well. Andglyphosate destroys your microbiome and disrupts the gut border just as if youhad swallowed a prescription!21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_21] It’s found in themeat and milk of animals that are fed grains and beans, as well as in the cropplants you eat and the products made with them that line grocery store shelves.In other words, your vegan bean or pasta dish is most likely loaded with thisantibiotic.In 2015, the cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaredglyphosate to be a “probable human carcinogen.”22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_22] Asa result, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and the Feed the World Project(now the Detox Project) teamed up to offer the public the opportunity to havetheir urine tested for glyphosate. The response was so overwhelming that theyhad to suspend testing because their lab wasn’t big enough! But the results fromthe first group of more than a hundred individuals who submitted specimens werestaggering—93 percent of the urine samples tested positive for glyphosate.Despite what the manufacturer of Roundup may say, glyphosate is clearly in ourfood supply in large amounts.In 2018, researchers at Indiana University and the University of California, SanFrancisco, teamed up to conduct the first-ever study of its kind, testing theurine of seventy-one pregnant women. The results were shockingly similar: theyfound detectable levels of glyphosate in 93 percent of the urine samples. Thatis truly alarming considering that glyphosate exposure during pregnancy isassociated with shortened gestational length and lifelong health consequencesfor the child.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_23]When you consume glyphosate, it doesn’t just kill your gut buddies, it alsodisrupts their ability to produce the essential amino acids tryptophan andphenylalanine, which make up serotonin, the “feel good” hormone, and thyroidhormone. Is it any coincidence that a large percentage of our population istaking antidepressants and thyroid medication?These are just some of the reasons you’ll be avoiding conventional animalproducts on the Longevity Paradox program. The lectin load and the glyphosateload in grains and beans—which are heavily treated with glyphosate—are a doublewhammy.In addition, there are now estrogen-like agents in most of our plastics, scentedcosmetics, preservatives, and sunscreens. Exposure to these agents is linked toobesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases, as well as reproductiveproblems, women’s hormone-sensitive cancers (such as breast and ovarian cancer),thyroid problems, and impaired development of the brain and neuroendocrinesystems.24 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_24] Many of these diseases and issues areassociated with “normal” aging but are not really normal at all. Remember, yourgut buddies produce the precursors to many hormones. This is a primary way theycommunicate with their sisters in your cells. So compounds that disrupt yourhormonal system are hijacking this ancient and essential line of communication.For proof of the connection between your microbiome and your endocrine system,look no further than antibacterial chemicals such as triclosan that are found inhand sanitizers, soaps, deodorants, toothpaste, and countless other personalcare products. They kill off your gut buddies, act like estrogen in the body,and have been shown to stimulate precancerous cells to continue toproliferate.25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_25] Your mitochondria decide which cellsshould live and which should die based on hormonal messages from your gutbuddies.26 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_26] When estrogen-like substances hijackthose messages, cancer cells can grow unchecked.There is yet another troubling problem with chemicals such as glyphosate in yourfood and the other chemicals in many personal care products: they reduce yourliver’s ability to convert vitamin D to its active form so it can do its job ofabsorbing calcium and promoting healthy bone growth, which, if blocked, sets thestage for osteoporosis as you age. Vitamin D deficiency is now incrediblycommon. I have observed that around 80 percent of my patients have low levels ofvitamin D in their blood and that men with prostate cancer have particularly lowvitamin D levels.27 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_27] (You’ll read more later aboutthe safe and effective personal care products your gut buddies will love.) Before we move on, you need to know about one more enemy of your gut buddies,and this one might hurt: sugar. Bad bugs love simple sugar; it’s what they liveon. Your gut buddies need complex sugar molecules called polysaccharides (“manysugars”) to grow and flourish, but the bad bugs thrive on the simple sugar youput in your mouth every day. This is one of the main reasons that sugar is suchan absolute disaster for health and longevity.Sugar substitutes aren’t any better. Many people (including me when I wasoverweight) turn to artificial sugars to quell their cravings without packing onthe pounds. Back then I would have happily performed heart surgery with a DietCoke in my hand if only I could have found a way to sterilize it! Butironically, although these products are supposed to aid in weight loss, they dojust the opposite. That’s because products such as sucralose, saccharin,aspartame, and other nonnutritive artificial sweeteners kill your gut buddiesand allow the bad bugs to multiply. Believe it or not, a Duke University study28[Notes.xhtml#endnote_11_28] showed that a single Splenda packet kills 50 percentof normal intestinal flora!It’s sad but true: if you eat too much of anything sweet, your gut buddies willstarve to death, and your bad bugs will live long and prosper—and multiply. Evenfructose, the sugar in fruit, has been shown to be a mitochrondrial poison!There goes the neighborhood.This may all sound pretty bleak, but rest assured, it is possible to undo thedamage these bad guys have wreaked on your inner condo association and get yourproperty back to its youthful, gleaming state. But before we do that, it’s timeto learn how to keep the bad bugs where they belong."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2PROTECT AND DEFEND [nav.xhtml#nch5]Hopefully by now I’ve convinced you of just how significant a role yourholobiome plays in both how long and how well you live. Fostering the right mixof microbes in your gut, in your mouth, and even on your skin is essential notonly to preventing disease but also to living a long and joyful life. And if youhave a plentiful and diverse majority of gut buddies residing in your innercondo, they will keep you young.This seems simple enough, right? Just starve out the bad bugs while feeding thegood ones plenty of the foods they need to thrive, and you and your gut buddieswill ride off into the sunset together. And I can stop writing and you can stopreading.Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Having the right gut buddies in yourmicrobiome is only half of the equation. The second half is making sure theystay on their side of the intestinal border. When pieces of their cell wallscalled lipopolysaccharides (LPSs, which we will talk more about in a minute)cross the border from your gut to your organs, tissues, lymph, or blood, itdoesn’t matter if they’re gut buddies or bad bugs. Any bacteria, LPSs, or otherinvaders lurking where they don’t belong trigger an immune response thatgenerates widespread inflammation and lays the groundwork for accelerated agingand illness.As Hippocrates famously and wisely said, “All disease begins in the gut.” Thegood news is that all disease can be stopped there as well.THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKSTo better understand how inflammation leads to aging—a concept that has come tobe known as inflammaging1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_1]—let’s first take a closerlook at how the gut wall functions. Your intestines are lined with a singlelayer of mucosal cells (called enterocytes), which are locked tightly togetherto prevent material from entering or escaping. Though this intestinal layer isonly one cell thick, its surface area is equivalent to the size of a tenniscourt.2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_2],3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_3],4[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_4] The immune cells (specialized white blood cells)positioned along and interspersed within that lining play an immensely importantrole in maintaining the integrity of the wall—in fact, about 60 percent of allyour immune cells are concentrated along the lining of your gut. These immunecells are responsible for deciding what can leave the GI tract and what muststay contained.Your stomach acids, enzymes, and gut buddies break down the food you eat intoindividual components: amino acids (from protein), fatty acids (from fat), andsugar molecules (from sugars and starches). Your mucosal cells then literallybite off a single molecule of these digested amino acids, fatty acids, andsugars, pass it through the body of the cell, and release it into your portalvein or lymph system. When all is working well, everything besides these singlemolecules remains outside the intestinal barrier, where it belongs. There is alot of truth to Robert Frost’s poem that says, “Good fences make goodneighbors.” If your mucosal cells are lined up tightly side by side, your gutlining functions as a “good fence” that keeps everything except single moleculesof digested amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar on the other side. But if yourfence gets worn down and becomes rife with microscopic holes, it will allowother compounds to leak through, and your health will begin to suffer. This isthe definition of “leaky gut,” also known as intestinal permeability, and it isat the heart (or shall I say gut?) of most of the common diseases we associatewith aging. In fact, as you will soon see, it’s the gradual breakdown of thisbarrier that accelerates the aging process.That’s because when the wrong molecules or even bacteria cross the border, theimmune system kicks into high gear. It’s helpful to think of the immune systemas the police force of your internal condo. When they learn that someone hasbroken in, the cops flood the scene and call for reinforcements by releasinginflammatory hormones called cytokines. It’s great to have these “cops” aroundwhen you really need them. For example, if the “bad guy” that breaches yourintestinal lining is truly dangerous, such as a bacterial infection, they cansave your life. When you have an injury, inflammation can help you heal. Butproblems occur when the cops get called over and over for every little thing.The result is chronic inflammation, the ultimate cause of the common diseases ofaging, from Alzheimer’s to cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.To reiterate, aging is so closely linked to inflammation in the body that myfellow longevity researchers have coined the term inflammaging (I wish I’dthought of it!) to describe the fact that human aging is characterized bychronic, low-grade inflammation.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_5] Though this is acatchy term, paradoxically I have observed that inflammation is actually asymptom and not the root cause of what really ages us. Instead, aging is theresult of a lack of the right bacterial population in your gut, along with aleaky gut that allows bacteria and other particles to pass through theintestinal border between you and them. When I help my patients heal their gutwall and balance their gut buddies, their inflammation levels (which I canmeasure based on the amount of cytokines in their blood) decrease dramatically,and their bodies rapidly repair the damage, just like restoring an old housewith “good bones.”But what can damage your gut wall in the first place, inciting a constantinflammatory attack by the cops? One such culprit is lectins, which pry apartthe tight bonds between the mucosal cells that line your intestinal wall.Hopefully lectins never make it to your gut in the first place, either becauseyou didn’t eat them or because the mucus (collectively calledmucopolysaccharides, meaning “many mucosal sugars”) in your nose and mouth andesophagus bound and trapped them before they could travel down to your gutlining. Those sugars exist for this very purpose; lectins like to bind tosugars. If lectins do make it to the gut lining, the mucosal cells there are thenext line of defense, hopefully producing plenty more mucus to bind and traplectins before they can breach the gut wall.But for most of us, that protective layer of mucus is in short supply or doesn’texist at all. If your diet is high in lectin-containing foods, that mucus isconstantly used up binding those lectins. What’s worse, without mucus, themucosal cells that produce mucus are then open to direct attack by acids,bacteria, and more lectins. The result is less protective mucus.Unfortunately, without mucus to trap them, lectins bind with receptors(organelles that respond to a signal) along the gut lining and produce acompound called zonulin, which breaks the tight junctions that hold togetheryour border wall, just like that kid in a game of “Red Rover” who broke open theinterlocked arms of you and your friends. Imagine this happening on a largescale across your tennis court–sized border, creating spaces between the cellsso foreign invaders (including more lectins) can forge through and reach yourtissues, lymph nodes, and bloodstream.Once across the border, these foreign proteins are recognized as foreign bysophisticated bar code scanners called toll-like receptors (TLRs) located onyour immune cells, especially your T cells. Off go the air-raid sirens, anall-points bulletin is called out, and the race is on for the cops to apprehendthese interlopers! Now imagine this happening every minute of every day, andpresto: chronic inflammation!When lectins poke holes in the fence, they’re not the only ones that can make itthrough—they also clear the way for other invaders, including the bad bugs inyour gut. One particularly harmful example, which will be familiar to you ifyou’ve read The Plant Paradox, is lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), molecules thatmake up the cell walls of certain bacteria in the microbiome. Though I’m usuallynot one for cursing, I can’t resist calling these guys “little pieces of shit,”because that’s exactly what they are! LPSs are fragments of bacterial cell wallsthat your bacteria produce as they divide and die in your intestines. They areproduced in the trillions every day, and when your gut border is breached, theytravel through your gut wall and into your body. But you don’t even need a leakygut wall for them to gain access into the rest of you, as they can also hitch aride on specialized saturated fat–carrying molecules called chylomicrons. Moreon that later.Now, here’s the problem: LPSs are not living bacteria; they are just the outersurface of bacteria. Since your TLRs on your immune cells cannot tell thedifference between LPSs and living bacteria, they assume the LPSs are the realthing and call in the troops. After all, the existence of bacteria in your bodycould mean a potentially deadly bacterial infection. The cops have to be on highalert. So every time an LPS slips past the border, the cops flood the scene, andthe result is more and more inflammation.It gets worse. Lectins have a molecular pattern that is similar to that of LPSsand are foreign proteins, so when they cross the border, the TLRs light up, andthe cops come running yet again. My friend and colleague Professor Loren Cordainof Colorado State University (the “father” of the paleo diet) first describedthis phenomenon as “molecular mimicry”: lectins mimic the proteins on many ofour important organs, nerves, and joints. The immune system mistakes these partsof our own bodies for foreign invaders and launches an inflammatory response.This “friendly fire” process is the root of all autoimmune disease. It is theresult of trespassers getting across the gut wall and latching on to parts ofyour body while your immune system attacks without asking questions first, andit all arises from a disruption of the complex ecosystem that is our microbiome.The latest studies conducted on mice prove that this inflammatory response isalso a major cause of aging. In 2018, researchers at the Yale School of Medicinecorrelated a microbe that was present in mice with a lupuslike autoimmunecondition that crossed from the gut into the mice’s organs. The result was gutwall disintegration and immune cells (which you can think of in this case asmouse cops) in the same organs as the invading bacteria. Notably, the same badbugs were found in liver biopsies of human patients with autoimmune diseases,but not in healthy control subjects.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_6] In other words,a leaky gut that allows bacteria to cross the border of the gut lining causesautoimmune disease in both mice and humans.But do not despair. As I recently published in the journal Circulation, of the102 patients with biomarker-proven autoimmune diseases who followed my program,95 (94 percent) were disease-free, off their medications, and had negativebiomarkers after six months.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_7] Many of my colleaguesand I now believe that this disruption of the gut wall barrier is at the heartof inflammaging, as well as the multitude of diseases that accelerate aging.You might be thinking that leaky gut is a condition that affects only a few“canaries in the coal mine”—but sadly, this is not the case at all. I’ll admitthat when people first started talking about leaky gut, I was skeptical. If youhad asked me about it fifteen years ago, I would have dismissed it as fancifulthinking for the most part. But there is no denying that it is real and it isubiquitous. As my treatment program for thousands of patients has shown, a leakygut (and that includes a “leaky” mouth and nose and skin) is the root cause ofaging and disease. As my colleague Dale Bredesen has shown, abnormal bacteriaentering the brain from the nose and sinuses can cause Parkinson’s disease,while still more studies have implicated bacteria and other microbes as causingatherosclerosis. Other researchers and I now believe that 100 percent of thepopulation has some degree of intestinal permeability.8[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_8]SPACE INVADERSEliminating lectins is an important step in healing your gut and slowing (andreversing) the effects of aging, but lectins aren’t the only molecules that pryapart the mucosal layer and cause intestinal permeability. One of the mostcommon causes is, ironically, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Aleve, Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic.These drugs were introduced in the early 1970s as an alternative to aspirin,which was known to damage the stomach lining. However, we now know that NSAIDsdamage the mucosal barrier in both the small intestine and the colon. A greatdeal of research published over the last half century reveals that theseapparently “harmless” drugs actually blow gaping holes in the intestinalbarrier. As a result, lectins, LPSs, and living bacteria are able to flood intoyour body. Inundated by these foreign invaders, the cops that make up yourimmune system do what they do best: attack, producing inflammation and morepain. Having holes in your gut lining is painful in and of itself.This pain in turn prompts you to down another NSAID, promoting a vicious cycleof pain and inflammation. For years, doctors like me were clueless about thereal effects of NSAIDs (although it appears that the pharmaceutical companiesknew about them all along). In fact, these drugs were viewed as so dangerousthat when they were introduced, they were available only by prescription andonly for two weeks. Unfortunately, the available technology limited physicians’ability to fully assess the damage. Because our gastroscopes didn’t reach allthe way to the small intestine, we had no way to see the damage these drugs werecausing. It wasn’t until we had microcameras that patients could swallow, givingus 360-degree views of their digestive systems, that we were able to see whatwas really happening—and by then, NSAIDs were being popped like candy. NSAIDsare now both the number one pharmaceutical seller and the number one cause ofinflammation—the very thing they’re meant to treat!Another class of drugs that is disastrous for your gut is proton pump inhibitors(PPIs) and other stomach acid reducers such as Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, andProtonix. Stomach acid is important and necessary. It kills off most of the badbugs you swallow before they make it to your gut. Without enough of it, badbugs—including those that can cause infectious diseases—can take over. This iswhy people who regularly use acid blockers are three times more likely to getpneumonia than those who don’t use them;9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_9] stomachacid is one of the best defenses against bad bugs getting into you, as one ofits main purposes is to kill bacteria. Also, remember that lectins are plantproteins; stomach acid is designed to digest proteins. So by using stomach acidblockers, you inadvertently wipe out one of your major defense mechanismsagainst lectins!But back to our gut buddies: most of them hate acid. And some of our mostimportant microbes live in the colon, where there is no oxygen and no acid. Whatkeeps them there is referred to in medicine as “the acid gradient.” Stomach acidgradually reduces as food moves along the intestines, where the liver andpancreas add other alkaline digestive enzymes. This transition to a low-acidenvironment happens where your small bowel meets your colon. But with no stomachacid to keep them in their place, bacteria can easily crawl from their home inthe colon into your small intestine, where they don’t belong. There they disruptthe gut barrier, causing leaky gut and laying the groundwork for a conditioncalled small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Here these bacteria reallywreck havoc by living in a place without much defense against them, therebylaying waste to the absorptive surface of your gut and producing the proteinwasting and muscle loss so often seen in the elderly. What’s worse, SIBO andirritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are associated with an increased risk ofdementia, as shown in a recent Taiwanese study.10 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_10]Stomach acid is so important to protect your gut barrier that my colleagues atthe Medical College of Georgia (where I went to medical school) are starting touse baking soda as a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoidarthritis. When patients drink a baking soda solution, it stimulates theproduction of more stomach acid. Among other things, this additional acid helpsto keep the gut bacteria where they belong and prevents inflammation—andtherefore helps to reverse autoimmune disease.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_11]Moreover, their research shows that baking soda actually sends a signal to theimmune cells lining your gut to “chill out” when confronted by foreign proteins.Proton pump inhibitors do more than neutralize acid and generate inflammation.These medications are aptly named: they paralyze proton pumps, which yourmitochondria (hello again, sisters!) need to generate energy. When PPIs wereintroduced years ago, we were naive enough to think that they worked byparalyzing only certain proton pumps in the stomach lining that make acid andnot the proton pumps throughout the rest of the body. Unfortunately, that is notthe case. So, every time you swallow that Prilosec OTC to enjoy your corn dogheartburn free, it doesn’t stop at the stomach but actually poisons your brain’smitochondria (and the mitochondria throughout the rest of your body as well),making it impossible for them to produce energy.Sure enough, a long-range study published in 2017 that looked at nearly 16,000healthy people aged 40 and older found a significant association betweencumulative PPI use and the risk of dementia.12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_12]Meanwhile, a German study from 2016 showed a 44 percent increased risk ofdementia among 74,000 people aged 75 and older who used these drugs, compared tothose who did not.13 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_13] Other studies have linked theuse of PPIs to chronic kidney disease.14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_14] Notsurprisingly, these diseases can all stem from mitochondrial dysfunction. Nowonder the FDA issued warnings on their use and package inserts advise not totake these drugs for longer than two weeks. How long have you been on them?Because you need stomach acid to break down dietary protein into amino acidsbefore they can be absorbed in your gut, people who take these drugs are alsolikely to be protein malnourished. This is not because they aren’t eating enoughprotein. Rather, it is because they have no stomach acid to digest it into aminoacids! Couple that with a leaky gut from SIBO and lectins, and it’s no wonderthat you hear doctors telling their older patients that they need to eat moreprotein. But when protein isn’t broken down and absorbed, it leads to musclewasting, called sarcopenia, a health crisis among the aging population. I mean,why live to 100 if you don’t have the strength to walk to the kitchen (or worse,the bathroom!)?Okay, okay, enough, you’re saying. What am I supposed to do about my heartburn,Doc? I get it. I used to have horrible heartburn, or gastroesophageal refluxdisease (GERD). I refused to use PPIs, but there was an ever-present supply ofTums and Rolaids on my nightstand and in my suitcase. It’s now been more thanseventeen years since I’ve had heartburn, because I don’t eat the lectins thatwere the cause of the heartburn in the first place. Rest assured that the foodsyou’ll eat on the Longevity Paradox program will not cause heartburn. Manyhundreds of my patients have been able to throw out their PPIs to protect theirgut buddies (and their homes) without suffering any negative consequences.Indeed, several of my patients with the precancerous condition Barrett’sesophagus were completely cured by stopping their PPIs and removing lectins fromtheir diet.AND YOU THOUGHT GLUTEN WAS BADThough most lectins, like gluten, are too large to get through the gut wallunless it’s already been breached, there is a lectin called wheat germagglutinin (WGA) that is very small. So even if the gut mucosal barrier has notbeen compromised, WGA can pass through the walls of the intestine and causeinflammation, notably in the kidneys.15 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_15] But WGA alsocauses many other problems in the body, particularly because of its ability tomimic insulin.Bear with me for a moment while I take a quick detour to explain how insulinnormally works in the body. It’s critically important to understand thisscience, as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have become the norm amongthe aging population and having diabetes dramatically increases your risk ofdeveloping cancer and other diseases of aging.16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_16] In2018, the American Diabetes Association reported that more than 84 millionAmericans had prediabetes and therefore an increased risk of developing type 2diabetes as they aged, along with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.(And as I tell my prediabetes patients, diagnosing someone as “prediabetic” islike telling a woman she is a little bit pregnant!) At the same time, a full 25percent of Americans over the age of 60 had full-blown diabetes.17[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_17] That’s one in every four older Americans. So nomatter how old you are, it’s important to learn how to avoid diabetes and stopprediabetes in its tracks.Here’s what you need to know. Normally, when the cells in your gut bite off asingle molecule of sugar and pass it into the bloodstream, the pancreas respondsby secreting insulin, a hormone that regulates the amount of sugar (glucose) inyour blood. Insulin works by opening the door to your cells and allowing glucoseto enter. The mitochondria in both muscle cells and neurons then “digest” theglucose, using oxygen to create energy. When there is more glucose availablethan your muscles need (and if you are sitting all day, they don’t need much!),insulin attaches to a docking port on the cell membrane of fat cells and flipsan enzymatic switch called lipoprotein lipase that tells the fat cell to convertthat glucose to fat and store it in the cell. No matter what type of cell, oncethe insulin has done its job of ushering glucose inside, the insulin separatesfrom the docking port so the cell is ready to receive the next hormonal signal.This system goes completely awry when WGA is absorbed after you eat whole wheatproducts. WGA locks onto the insulin hormonal docking port on the cell membrane,but unlike a “normal” hormone, which would dock, release its information, andleave, WGA doesn’t let go. Instead, it keeps the switch open. This causes fatcells to continue ushering in more and more sugar to store as fat. In contrast,in muscle cells, real insulin cannot dock at the port because it is blocked bythe WGA. This means that your mitochondria can’t get the glucose they need tocreate energy. Without energy, your cells die. Many people assume that musclewasting is a normal part of aging, but that is not the case. This insulinmimicry is one of the main causes of muscle wasting as we age because musclecells die when they cannot get glucose for energy. But don’t panic; muscles andthe rest of you have a backup power supply that we’ll get to shortly.Worst of all, WGA locks onto the docking port of nerve cells, starving them ofenergy, too. Your brain needs a lot of energy to function. So when sugar islocked out of your neurons, your brain responds angrily, demanding that you eatmore food. Of course, your brain cells don’t understand that the sugar from anyfood you eat will just continue to go straight into your fat cells because theinsulin docks on all of your other cells are being blocked. No matter how muchyou eat, your muscle and brain cells will starve and your fat cells will feast.Hardly a recipe for youthful longevity! In addition to fat gain and reducedmuscle mass, over time this can cause brain cells and peripheral nerves to die,resulting in dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and peripheral neuropathy.18[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_18] Wow, consider that the next time you order wholewheat toast in an effort to live longer!ONLY THE STRONG SURVIVESo besides avoiding WGA, how can you maintain your gut wall integrity? You maybe surprised to hear that this goes back to the idea of hormesis. As you read inchapter 1 [Chapter_1_Ancient_Genes_C.xhtml], hormesis is the favorable responseof an organism to low doses of stress that would be harmful in larger doses. Andit actually plays a big role in activating longevity. This is because of howyour gut buddies and their sisters, your mitochondria, respond to stress.Remember the example of the roundworms that lived longer when they were givensupplements of a compound that is normally released by gut bacteria? The sameidea applies to you. When your gut buddies believe there is an incoming threat,they initiate a response that protects against infections, tumors, and evendeath. This is why, in one study, mice that were subjected to low levels ofradiation throughout their lives lived an average of 30 percent longer thantheir unexposed siblings.19 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_19] Other experiments usingenvironmental stressors such as heat, cold, lack of nutrients, ultravioletlight, and toxins all came to the same surprising conclusion: at the right dose,these potentially lethal factors can actually promote survival.Alcohol is another great example of a hormetic stressor (a type of stress thatstimulates hormesis). All studies that look at the effects of alcohol over timeshow a classic hormetic curve, which simply means that drinking some alcohol isgood for health and longevity and drinking a lot of it is bad. One study thatfollowed more than five hundred healthy men for a sixteen-year period found thatthose who had an average of two small servings of alcohol a day lived longer andhad lower rates of heart disease than those who abstained, consumed alcoholrarely, or overindulged.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_20]I first studied the impressive benefits of hormesis when performing heartsurgery. Before stopping the heart for a prolonged period of time to repair it,I briefly shut down the flow of blood to the patient’s heart. This period ofstress alerted the patient’s heart cells that trouble was on the way, activatinga complex series of events ushered by a compound called heat-shock protein,which caused the heart muscle cells to hunker down and protect themselves untila better time (in this case, better blood flow) arrived. Weak cells in that areathat could not survive the stress were either eaten by white blood cells orinstructed to die in processes called apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. Theresult was that only strong cells remained and weak ones were eliminated,enhancing the patient’s chance of survival during and after surgery.In the Longevity Paradox program, you will take advantage of a hormetic stressorcalled calorie restriction, which significantly extends life span in allcreatures studied to date, including our cousins rhesus monkeys. Wait a minute,I can hear you say, you want me to eat less food? No, thank you!Before you put the book down, hear me out. I’ve been practicing this method formore than seventeen years now, and if you have ever dined with me, you know thatI eat a lot! What I’ve learned from experiments on thousands of patients andfrom following the research of my colleagues studying longevity is that thereare actually ways of tricking the body into thinking that you are fasting orseverely restricting calories even when you are eating plenty. You’ll read muchmore on this later. But for now let’s look at how calorie restriction promoteslongevity.Self-Devouring CellsAutophagy is your cells’ recycling program, the process by which they get rid ofweak or dysfunctional parts of the cell to make it stronger overall. The Latinautophagy means “self-devouring”: the cell literally eats the pieces that itwants to get rid of. Autophagy is a natural process that is triggered bycompounds in certain foods. It also happens when you stress your cellstemporarily. When they get the signal that tough times are on the way, yourcells develop an “only the strong survive” mentality and toughen up to help youand them endure the impending challenge. When the cells lining your gut gothrough this process, the gut barrier is actually reinforced so that fewerinvaders are able to make it to the other side. The result is less inflammationand disease and a longer, healthier life.In 2018, the results of a ten-year study in France offered the first conclusiveproof that calorie restriction extends the lives of primates—in this case, agray mouse lemur that shares many physiological similarities with humans. In thestudy, the life span of the calorie-restricted lemurs increased by almost 50percent, and best of all, so did their health span. The aged lemurs had the samemotor abilities and cognitive performance as much younger animals, withoutsuffering from other common diseases associated with aging such as cancer ordiabetes.21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_21]How does this work? Well, one of the first things to happen when you restrictcalories is that you dramatically decrease bacterial growth and reproduction.Hey, if you give your bugs less to eat, they make fewer offspring. This meansfewer LPSs. A second bonus of eating less is that you aren’t eating as manyfoods containing lectins. These two factors dramatically decrease the amount ofbacteria, LPSs, and lectins crossing the gut wall, which automatically reducesinflammation. Calorie restriction also improves gut wall function by stimulatingautophagy in the gut,22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_22] thinning the herd of gutbacteria down to the strongest and fittest ones that will work the hardest tomaintain your gut wall integrity.Now pay close attention, because this is where things get really interesting.Remember, the cells lining your gut produce mucus. There is a family of bacteria(called Akkermansia muciniphila, which literally means “mucus loving”) living inthat mucus layer that love to eat the mucus lining. In other words, these gutbuddies will never starve because even when you restrict calories, they happilylive off that mucus. Now, that sounds like a real problem. You need that mucusto protect you against lectins and other bacteria, and these guys are eating it!But here’s the shocker: amazingly, when they eat the mucus, they send a signalto your enterocytes to produce more mucus. So, even though they are eating someof it, the net effect is an increase in mucus.The more mucus you have, the thicker your wall of protection from invaders,which means that calorie restriction works in part by improving the integrity ofthe gut wall.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_23] As you know, the breakdown of ourgut border unleashes mischief and is a main cause of aging. Thus, thesemucus-loving gut buddies are one of the keys to your longevity. Indeed, micethat are given supplements of Akkermansia muciniphila show a decrease ininflammation and heart disease, because the muciniphila keep the gut barrierstrong and impermeable.24 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_24]Further, having plentiful muciniphila is inversely correlated with obesity,diabetes, and inflammation.25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_25] When researchers fedmuciniphila bacteria to fat mice, the mice quickly lost weight and showed adecrease in blood sugar levels.26 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_26] This suggests thatthese mucus-loving gut buddies can help prevent type 2 diabetes. And amazingly,it turns out that the popular antidiabetes drug metformin actually works bychanging the gut biome.27 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_27] In fact, a study fromColumbia University that tracked 459 participants who took the drug revealedthat metformin modified their gut microbiota, leading to a higher relativeabundance of none other than the muciniphila bacteria!28[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_28]Back to our friend Akkermansia muciniphila. There’s only one problem: yourpopulation of this important gut buddy declines naturally with age.29[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_29] So in the Longevity Paradox program, you are goingto give them what they want and, in doing so, ensure that you have plenty ofthem around for the long haul. As a teaser, we have known for centuries that acertain type of fermented green tea called pu-erh, which is popular in China,has many health benefits. Sure, you know that tea is good for you, but pu-erhtea? Go to the head of the class if you guessed what it does: it promotes thegrowth of Akkermansia muciniphila bacteria!30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_30] Eatingand drinking foods like these and periodically practicing (or mimicking) calorierestriction can dramatically increase your Akkermansia muciniphila population tostrengthen your gut barrier.Your cells also respond to calorie restriction by becoming more efficient atproducing energy. They do this by growing more mitochondria in a process calledmitogenesis. Since mitochondria have their own DNA, they can divide and multiplywithin a cell, without the cell itself having to divide. Simply put, the moremitochondria you have, the more energy you have and the more efficiently yourcells function. Think about how fuel economy standards forced carmakers toproduce more horsepower with less fuel. Thanks to turbocharging andsuperchargers, a four-cylinder engine can produce the horsepower of a V-8 on athird of the gas (energy). When your cells think that food is going to be inshort supply, they essentially transform themselves into turbocharged enginesthat are packed with mitochondria, which produce more energy with less food.STEM CELLS AND LONGEVITYMany of my fellow longevity researchers view stem cells, undifferentiated cellsthat have the potential to become pretty much any type of cell when they divideand multiply, as the holy grail of longevity. Indeed, when you recruit stemcells from the body, you can regenerate aging tissues. Seeing this, many doctorshave developed stem cell therapies that involve pulling stem cells out of apatient (from his or her fat or bone marrow, both places where stem cells areplentiful), spinning them in a centrifuge, and reinjecting them. Many claim tohave experienced wonderful results from these treatments, but I believe you canget similar (or better) results without having to spend thousands of dollars andrecover from a procedure. After all, you have plenty of stem cells in your bodyalready. So how can you make them perform the way you want them to?As we age, our stem cells start to lose their ability to regenerate—unless youactivate them by creating a signal that turns on the switch and tells them to doso.31 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_31] Temporarily stressing your cells activatesthat switch and recruits stem cells from all over your body to regenerate. Weknow from mouse studies that when mice fast for twenty-four hours, their cellsbegin to use fat for fuel instead of glucose. This process is called ketosis, aterm you are likely familiar with given the popularity of the keto diet. Ketosiscreates stress in the body and signals stem cells to regenerate.In a study conducted by my friend and colleague Dr. Valter Longo at theUniversity of Southern California, participants who underwent a five-day vegancalorie-restricted diet once a month or a few days of water-only fastingsuccessfully shifted their stem cells from a dormant state to a state ofself-renewal.32 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_32] Longo also found that the fastingprocess triggered autophagy in immune cells. As old and damaged immune cellswere killed off, stem cells swarmed in and differentiated themselves intohealthy new immune cells.These findings are promising because having healthy immune cells is a pillar ofyouthful longevity. Your immune cells protect you against everything from cancerto bacteria, so you need them to be as strong and robust as possible as you age.As a general rule, the older you live, the weaker your immune system becomes.This is why the elderly are at an increased risk of dying from common infectionssuch as the flu—their immune system often just isn’t up for the fight. On theLongevity Paradox program, we will give your immune cells what they need to stayhealthy and vital as both of you age.Stem cells are also located in your gut. On that tennis court–sized surface areaof your intestines are millions of tiny hairlike projections called microvilli.At the base of each of these microvilli are crypts, and living inside thesecrypts are bacteria and stem cells.33 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_33] Now, theintestinal surface grows and dies incredibly quickly. The stem cells in your gutconstantly repopulate the microvilli with new enterocytes (intestinal cells), asenterocytes, because of the “heavy lifting” involved in nutrient absorption, areconstantly being shed into the lumen of your intestines. As I like to tell mypatients, think of this process as akin to the lines of soldiers doing battle inthe Revolutionary War or Civil War. As the first line of soldiers is shot andwounded and fall, the next line of soldiers behind them steps up to take theirfallen comrades’ place.On those stem cells in the gut are docking ports called G-protein receptors—Icall them G-spotters for short. These receptors receive chemical signals thatcause them to activate and keep up healthy new intestinal wall growth. One ofthose signals is called R-spondin, which is generated by—you guessed it—your gutbuddies!34 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_34]I like to think of these crypts as hardened bunkers for your condo association.In case of a disaster, the population will survive because of these few key gutbuddies that are hidden away. And when your body needs more stem cells to repairyour gut wall or other parts of your body that are degenerating, the gut buddiesin the crypts will send a signal to activate the stem cells that are in hidingwith them. When you restrict calories and the mucin-loving bacteria startchomping away at the gut lining, the gut buddies in the crypts send the signalthat reinforcements are needed up at the front line. This causes stem cells toproliferate and migrate up the microvilli to repopulate the gut lining. So atits core, fasting is good for you because it’s “bad” for you.Another signal that activates the stem cells in your gut is vitamin D3. Withoutadequate levels of this essential vitamin, the stem cells remain inactive, evenwhen your gut lining is being degraded. If the lining degrades too much, itshrinks down to the size of a Ping-Pong table rather than a tennis court. This,in turn, can cause malnutrition.35 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_35] You simply can’tabsorb as much nutrition through a surface that small no matter what you eat.In one remarkable new study, severely malnourished children were administeredextremely high doses of vitamin D3—200,000 IU—a day in an attempt to help aidnutrient absorption. Happily, the result was that the children all rapidlygained weight despite not consuming any more calories. With a rejuvenated gutwall, they were able to absorb the nutrition in the food they ate.36[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_36] Is it any wonder that we naturally seek the sun?Maybe our gut stem cells and our gut buddies are asking for a little help downthere?There is also a little-known connection between stem cells and telomeres, theendcaps of our DNA that protect our precious genetic material against damage or“fraying” as we grow older. Telomeres have lately become a hot topic in thefield of longevity, with many people positing that shortened telomeres are thecause of cognitive decline and accelerated aging. We know that as we age, ourtelomeres shorten and our chromosomes have less protection against damage—andthat damage (aka genetic mutations) can lead to diseases such as cancer andAlzheimer’s. But I believe the science is still out as to whether telomereshortening causes aging—or vice versa. We do know that telomeres within anorganism can have differing lengths and the longest telomeres occur in thecolonies of stem cells living in the crypts. In one study in mice, shortening oftelomeres in specific crypts paralleled a decline in stem cell functionality.37[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_37]This suggests that telomere length and stem cell activation go hand in hand. Andyou already know that stem cell activation is dependent on your gut buddies. Sothere is a pretty clear link between a happy population of gut buddies and yourability to maintain healthy, long telomeres as you age. Moreover, humans withthe highest levels of vitamin D3 in their blood, compared to those with thelowest levels, have the longest telomeres and vice versa.38[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_38] Hmm . . . vitamin D helps stem cells, and vitamin Dpromotes long telomeres . . . I guess we better make sure to get lots of vitaminD! Don’t worry—vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare. In fact, one prestigiousstudy suggested that 40,000 IU a day can be consumed without producing toxicity.That same study found that the average person would need 9,600 IU a day to havean adequate level of vitamin D.39 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_39]THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF LONGEVITYYour gut buddies evolved to endure cycles of growth and regression. That’sbecause we, their host organisms, evolved to eat in tune with the seasons—toconsume different foods in different quantities at different times of the year.Eating seasonally is more than just a culinary trend: it is embedded in our DNA.In fact, when a large group of researchers from California, London, and Canadaworked together to study one of the few remaining hunter-gatherer populations inthe world, the Hadza tribe of Tanzania, they found striking differences in theirgut microbiomes among seasons, in a cyclical configuration.40[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_40] Specific types of bacteria grew and flourished intheir gut based on which foods were available to them. The researchers comparedthis to people living in a modern urban setting, who had access to any type offood they wanted any time of the year. They had no such variability in their gutbuddies among seasons.The microbiomes of chimpanzees and gorillas, too, fluctuate with seasonalrainfall patterns and diet, changing markedly from the dry summer period, whenthere are plenty of fruits in season, to the rest of the year, when they eat amore fiber-rich diet of leaves and bark.41 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_41] Indeed,all great apes gain weight only during fruit season, and they don’t have 747stransporting fruit from Chile in February. We are meant to live in sync withseasonal shifts. Spring and summer are periods of growth and reproduction (andthus call for a higher energy intake), while fall and winter are times ofregression and retrenchment (and thus call for a lower energy intake). But inour modern society, we live in a 365-day growth cycle with abundant calories ofall kinds and no natural opportunity to reset. As a result, our population ofgut buddies stays relatively the same all year long.Part of eating for longevity means reestablishing our connection to thisall-important cycle. And that means changing up the types of foods that you eatand periodically limiting the amount of calories you eat. A lot of my patientsinitially fear this part of the program, worrying that they’ll be uncomfortablyhungry if they go more than a few hours without a snack. (You can thank thejunk-food marketing companies and the US Department of Agriculture for the ideathat you need to eat every two hours . . . but I digress.) The truth is thathumans are really good at fasting, or at least limiting food intake. It’s whathas allowed us to endure periods of famine or traveling immense distances insearch of food. During times of food scarcity, our mitochondria rev up as ourentire immune system hunkers down and kills off any cells that are odd,inefficient, dysfunctional, or weak.It’s also during times of scarcity that our fat stores are used. Before weinvented domestic refrigerators, only about a hundred years ago, we storedglucose and excess protein as glycogen, a form of sugar we can store in ourmuscles and liver, and used that sugar for energy until more food was available.If we used up all of our glycogen before we got more food, our mitochondria wereable to switch from “digesting” glucose for energy to “digesting” a fat-derivedfuel called ketones. This is a critical part of our beautiful human design. Butour 365-day growth cycle has caused most of us to lose this ability. We neverrun out of food and we eat foods in no relationship to the seasons, so ourmitochondria don’t have a chance to switch from burning sugar to burning fat.This may not sound like a big deal, but I assure you it is. It takes yourmitochondria only half of the effort to utilize fat (from ketones) and turn itinto energy as it does with sugar. Your mitochondria prefer fat as a fuelsource. But they rarely have the opportunity to burn fat because most of usrarely experience periods of scarcity anymore. Instead of getting to use thetype of fuel they want, your mitochondria are busy trying to process all of thesugar that’s constantly getting dumped into your cells.Remember, insulin ushers sugar into muscle cells; if those cells are “full”(think of your muscles saying that they couldn’t eat another bite), any excesssugar or protein that you are eating is shunted for storage as fat into fatcells, for use, hopefully, during a future famine. But if you eat yet more sugarand protein before that famine hits (which of course you will), your pancreaswill keep releasing insulin, trying to get that sugar out of your bloodstreamand into your cells. Over time, this leads to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, ashortened life span, and a greatly reduced health span. Even more distressing,that excess sugar in the bloodstream is the ideal food source for cancer cells,which are able to reproduce easily during this constant growth cycle.In addition to the seasonal cycle, the day/night cycle is also a key factor inlongevity and health span. All animals have a twenty-four-hour circadian rhythmof sleep and wake cycles based on periods of darkness and light; animals thatare exposed to artificially shortened or lengthened periods of daylight haveshorter life spans. To better understand this phenomenon, we need to look at howand why animals go to sleep. Most of us are well aware of how vital sleep is,but just like seasonal variations, the circadian rhythm of sleep is essentialfor activating longevity. In a study in 2012, when humans were restricted tofive hours of sleep for four nights, they began to develop insulin resistance(prediabetes).42 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_42] Why does this happen?Humans and many other animals have a pair of neuron clusters within the braincalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which receive light input from theretinas of the eyes.43 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_43] Amazingly, when old animalsreceive SCN transplants from younger animals, their life span increases. But wecan use other techniques to promote longevity via the SCN. Diet, caffeine, andresveratrol, found in red wine, all influence the SCN. Calorie restriction maybe so effective at promoting longevity by the actions we described above becauseit helps synchronize the SCN. This further proves that we are meant to spendsome time in a calorie-limited state.Another benefit of cycling between lots of food and not much food is that whencalories are restricted, an essential gene called the SIRT1 gene is activated.This gene is also activated during sleep, because you’re (hopefully) not eatingwhile you’re asleep. And guess what the SIRT1 gene controls? The suprachiasmaticnucleus! When researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)blocked the SIRT1 gene activity in young mice, their circadian rhythm controlwas impaired, and aging was accelerated. Eating automatically shuts off theSIRT1 gene, and a deficiency of this protein interferes with your ability tosleep. Yet when animals were given supplements of the sleep hormone melatonin,their SIRT1 gene protein production was enhanced.44 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_44]And guess how melatonin is made naturally in your body? By your gut buddies, ofcourse. What goes around comes around!Your body is designed to be a part of a beautifully orchestrated dance betweenperiods of sleep and wakefulness, eating and fasting. By prolonging the periodbetween waking and eating (in other words, extending the “fast” before“breaking” it with our morning meal—break-fast, get it?), we can extend ourhealth span by continuing to activate our all-important survival genes.STRENGTHENING THE GATEIn addition to melatonin, your gut buddies produce other important hormonalsignals that help offset the 365-day growth cycle and help strengthen the gutwall. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, is one example. Only certain gutbuddies produce butyrate, which improves mitochondrial function, modulates fatand glucose metabolism in the mitochondria, and has anti-obesity andantidiabetic effects.45 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_45] Butyrate can therefore helpcounteract some of the negative effects of living in a 365-day growth cycle.Butyrate also protects you from cancer by inhibiting cancer cell growth,46[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_46],47 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_47] and there is strongevidence to suggest that it promotes brain health by increasing mitochondrialactivity in the brain.48 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_48] For example, when mice withadvanced Alzheimer’s disease were given butyrate, it significantly enhancedtheir learning abilities.49 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_49]And guess what else? Butyrate produces ketones in the liver, which you alreadyknow your mitochondria love.50 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_50] So your gut buddiesactually do their sisters a favor by producing butyrate for them! The moreprebiotics (foods that are beloved by specific beneficial gut buddies) youeat—and you’ll be eating plenty on the Longevity Paradox program—the morebutyrate your gut buddies will produce.There are other organic compounds that help protect the gut wall—in particular,polyamines, which are produced by your gut buddies and rely on your gut buddiesto transport them into your cells, where they play an important role in cellgrowth, differentiation, and survival. In addition to protecting the gut wall,polyamines have strong anti-inflammatory properties, promote autophagy, regulatebrain function, and have been shown to promote longevity in many animals.51[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_51]Studies have consistently shown that higher levels of polyamines are linked toincreased autophagy and longevity. For example, when researchers in Japan gavemice supplements of polyamine-producing gut bacteria, the mice showed suppressedinflammation, improved longevity, and protection from age-induced memoryimpairment.52 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_52] In another study, rodents givensupplements of polyamines throughout their entire lives had a 25 percentincrease in life span. Even rodents that were fed polyamines only late in lifeexperienced a 10 percent life span increase. The researchers credited this topolyamines’ role in stimulating cell autophagy, which kills off weak andabnormal cells and strengthens the overall organism53[Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_53],54 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_54]—and I couldn’t agreemore.Sources of PolyaminesJust to get your juices flowing, take a look at some of these good nutritionalpolyamine sources: * Shellfish such as squid, oysters, crabs, and scallops * Fermented foods such as sauerkraut * Cruciferous vegetables * Leafy greens * Mushrooms * Matcha green tea * Nuts and seeds, including hazelnuts, walnuts, and pistachios * Chicken liver * Aged cheeses * LentilsIt is also possible to supplement with polyamines, which we will discuss ingreater detail later.In addition to feeding your gut buddies polyamines so that they will protectyour gut wall, on the Longevity Paradox program you will be eating plenty ofpolyphenols, plant compounds that nourish gut buddies and stimulate beneficialprocesses such as autophagy. The best-known and most powerful polyphenol isresveratrol, which is found in grapes, red wine, and berries and is the reasonred wine is protective against heart disease. Resveratrol stimulates autophagythrough a different pathway than polyamines do,55 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_12_55] soit is essential to get plenty of both types of compounds to make sure that yourcells recycle themselves as efficiently as possible.As we conclude this chapter, remember that the integrity of your gut lining isessential to your health span and longevity, and it is under attack at alltimes. On the Longevity Paradox program you are going to protect it from allangles by: * Feeding your gut buddies the foods they love, which will help them create compounds that support your mitochondria * Tricking your body into thinking you’re fasting so it will prune your gut buddy population and all of your cells down to the strongest ones * Thickening your protective gut lining and mucosal lining to keep invaders outWith the hordes stopped at the gate and the residents happy as clams, your innercondo association will become a peaceful community. Ready to get started? Beforewe begin building that community, let’s make sure you’re 100 percent clear onwhat is aging you and what is not. Here’s a hint: it’s probably not what youthink."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3WHAT YOU THINK IS KEEPING YOU YOUNG IS PROBABLY MAKING YOU OLD [nav.xhtml#nch6]When new patients first arrive in my office, many are suffering from multiplediseases that we associate with “normal” aging. Oftentimes they are perplexed bytheir illness—they think they are already doing everything right to live a long,healthy life. But commonly the very things they think will keep them young areactually causing them to age more quickly. There are a lot of popular theoriesof aging out there, and many of them are flat-out wrong. Yet they are deeplyingrained in our culture and in fact may seem completely logical on the surface.I call these the Seven Deadly Myths of Aging, and it’s time to debunk them onceand for all.THE SEVEN DEADLY MYTHS OF AGINGMYTH 1: THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET PROMOTES LONGEVITYWe can learn a lot about how to age successfully from people who live in theso-called Blue Zones, a term coined by the journalist Dan Buettner to describefive parts of the world where people live the longest. Yet many discussionsabout what sets these communities apart and what they have in common are rifewith half-truths and flat-out myths. So let’s take a look at what is reallygoing on in these extraordinary places where people live to the age of 100 atten times the rate of the US population.These locations are the Ogliastra region on the Italian island of Sardinia;Okinawa, Japan; Loma Linda, California (where I once lived and worked as aprofessor at Loma Linda University); the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica; and theGreek island of Ikaria. Not included in Buettner’s list are a few otherlocations whose residents are famously long lived: the Kitavans in Papua NewGuinea and the residents of Acciaroli, a small town south of Naples, Italy. Manyso-called health gurus look at the list of Blue Zones and, seeing that two ofthe longest-living cultures are found on islands in the Mediterranean, advisetheir followers to simply follow the Mediterranean diet, which includes grains.But a closer look at those cultures reveals that cereal grains are actually anegative component of the Mediterranean diet,1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_1]meaning that these folks live long, healthy lives despite eating so many grains,not because of it. In fact, because of their reliance on grains, Italiansoverall have significantly high rates of arthritis,2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_2]and Sardinians in particular have a high proportion of autoimmune diseases.3[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_3] Our gut buddies, even in these long-livedcommunities, still haven’t adapted to eating grains, and that includes the new“in” grains such as quinoa and farro. As many of my Peruvian patients tell me,their mothers taught them always to pressure-cook quinoa to remove the toxins;and farro is just wheat, plain and simple, but with a gussied-up name.Although there is some overlap among the nutrition patterns in these groups, infact the populations of the Blue Zones have wildly different diets. Let’s take acloser look. * The Seventh-Day Adventists in Loma Linda eat a lot of nuts and soybeans in the form of textured vegetable protein (TVP). This meat substitute is made from high-heat and high-pressure-extruded defatted soy meal—and having lived there and eaten these for many years, I can tell you that TVP can be made into any “mystery meat” you care to name, including a look- and taste-alike for Spam called Wham! You bean lovers out there, take note: TVP is pressure-cooked soy; pressure-cooking destroys lectins. Those clever Adventists! The majority of Seventh-Day Adventists are vegetarians or vegans, yet—spoiler alert—their diet (even the vegans’) is made up of 50 percent fat. Apparently a 50 percent fat diet promotes longevity; more on that later. * The Nicoyan staples include corn tortillas, beans, and rice. * The Sardinians with extreme longevity live in mountainous areas away from the coast, so they eat little fish, but they have goat cheese and goat meat, eat a bread made from buckwheat and wheat, and consume enormous amounts of olive oil. * Ikarians also consume a lot of olive oil, as well as herbs such as rosemary, a weed called purslane, which you can see growing along any sidewalk in the United States (the summer annual moss rose or portulaca is the same plant), and regularly drink wine at breakfast! * The Okinawans eat very little fat (what fat they do eat comes from pork lard) and almost no tofu or rice. And the rice that they do eat is white, not brown. Roughly 85 percent of their diet is made up of the purple sweet potato, a carbohydrate.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_4] * The Kitavans smoke like fiends and eat huge amounts of taro root (a carbohydrate) and coconut (a saturated fat). Yet they are very skinny, have never had a documented heart attack or stroke, and regularly live into their nineties—without medical care, I might add. * The Acciarolesi eat anchovies and huge amounts of rosemary and olive oil, drink a lot of wine, and eat no bread or pasta but love lentils.So what do these people all have in common? Surprisingly, it’s not what theyeat—it’s what they don’t eat. But before I reveal what that is, let’s look atthe type of carbohydrate that two of these populations (the Kitavans and theOkinawans) consume in extremely large amounts.Purple sweet potatoes and taro root (as well as plantains and yams) are notregular carbohydrates. They are resistant starches, a subset of starches thatbehaves differently in your gut than other carbohydrates, such as corn, rice, orwheat, or fruit. Instead of being quickly converted to glucose, which as youknow is either burned for energy or stored as fat, resistant starches simplypass through your small intestine mostly intact. These foods are resistant tothe enzymes that break down complex starches—hence their name. So eatingresistant starches, even in large amounts, generally doesn’t raise your bloodsugar or insulin levels. This, of course, is key to avoiding type 2 diabetes,obesity, and inflammation as you age. And because they don’t cause a blood sugarspike, resistant starches keep you feeling fuller longer than regular sources ofstarch.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_5],6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_6],7[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_7]But the best thing about resistant starches is that your gut buddies absolutelylove them! When they eat resistant starch, your gut buddies multiply and producelarge amounts of the short-chain fats acetate, propionate, and butyrate. As youread in chapter 2 [Chapter_2_Protect_and_Def.xhtml], these create the ideal fuelsource for your mitochondria and the enterocytes that line your gut wall.Resistant starches therefore increase your gut buddy population, enhancedigestion and nutrient absorption,8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_8] and foster thegrowth of the gut buddies that nurture the all-important mucus layer lining yourgut.Is it possible that the Kitavans and Okinawans avoid many of the diseases weassociate with normal aging simply because the increased levels of butyrate helptheir gut linings remain intact? Though we don’t have conclusive proof of this,it makes perfect sense to me, especially when you consider the fact that many ofthe other Blue Zone communities consume foods such as olive oil, purslane, androsemary that also nourish their gut buddies.But as I said, I believe that the true secret of these long-lived people liesnot in what they do eat but in what they don’t eat. And what they don’t eat islarge amounts of animal protein. With apologies to my friends in the paleo andketogenic communities, the facts don’t lie. Not a single one of the Blue Zonepopulations consumes significant amounts of animal protein, and I believe thatthat is their secret to a longer, healthier life. In a randomized eight-weekhuman trial, participants were placed on a 30 percent calorie-restricted diet(in other words, they ate 30 percent fewer calories than they normally would)and then divided into two groups: in one group, 30 percent of their caloriescame from animal protein, and in the other group, only 15 percent of theircalories came from animal protein. Both groups experienced about the same amountof weight loss (fifteen pounds). However, the blood work of the two groupsrevealed striking differences. The group that ate less animal protein had lowerinflammation markers than the group that ate more animal protein, and both totalprotein consumption (plant and animal based) and animal protein (except for fishprotein) consumption were correlated with more inflammation.9[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_9]Let’s review that Blue Zone list again with this knowledge in mind. TheSardinians eat meat only on Sundays and special occasions. The Okinawans eat aplant-based diet that includes only small amounts of pork. Most Seventh-DayAdventists in Loma Linda are vegetarians, and many are vegan. The Nicoyans eatmeat only once a week. In Ikaria, a family slaughters one animal per year andthen eats the meat in small quantities over the course of several months. Andthe Kitavans and Acciarolesi eat very little protein, most of it from fish.Humorously, as told by Tracey Lawson in her book A Year in the Village ofEternity: The Lifestyle of Longevity in Campodimele, Italy, an elderly mandescribed his relationship with his pig like this: “For a year I feed the pig,then for a year he feeds us!”Now compare this to the fact that the average American ate twenty-two pounds ofred meat and poultry in 2018, more than ever before in history.10[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_10] And that doesn’t even include other animal productssuch as eggs, milk, cheese, and so on. Is it any wonder that we’re aging morerapidly than ever before as well?Am I saying that consuming protein from animal products directly ages you? Yes,I am, and that leads me to the next myth.MYTH 2: ANIMAL PROTEIN IS ESSENTIAL FOR STRENGTH AND LONGEVITYI hope the information you just read about the dietary habits in the Blue Zoneshas begun to convince you that most Americans now consume far more protein,particularly animal protein, than they need. Don’t get me wrong—you needadequate protein to power your body and build muscle to avoid muscle wasting asyou age. But there is a big difference between the amount of protein you’ve beenled to believe you need and the amount you actually need. This, frankly, isbecause of commerce, not health.Animal protein was once the rarest and most expensive type of food and still isin most of the Blue Zones. But in the West, it has become ridiculouslyinexpensive thanks to government subsidies of the corn, other grains, andsoybeans that are fed to industrially farmed animals, poultry, and even fish.The result is that many Western societies vastly overconsume animal protein,leading to higher blood sugar levels, obesity, and a shorter life span.11[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_11],12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_12]Still not convinced that you should limit your consumption of animal protein?Don’t worry; it took me a while to get there, too. As a boy from Nebraska, Igrew up eating lots of “healthy” red meat. But my time at Loma Linda Universitytaught me otherwise. My former colleague at Loma Linda Dr. Gary Fraser hasconducted a study of the long-lived Seventh-Day Adventists and run ameta-analysis of six other studies.13 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_13],14[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_14] His results clearly show that vegan Seventh-DayAdventists who eat no animal products live the longest, followed by vegetarianSeventh-Day Adventists who eat limited amounts of eggs and no dairy products.Vegetarian Seventh-Day Adventists who consume dairy products come next, andSeventh-Day Adventists who occasionally eat chicken or fish bring up the rear interms of longevity.Sadly, animal protein is simply not a necessary ingredient for a long healthspan. As Dr. Fraser has demonstrated, completely avoiding animal proteinproduced the greatest longevity among an already extremely long-lived people.Further, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease correlates directly with theamount of meat consumed.15 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_15] For example, when theJapanese made the nutrition transition from the traditional Japanese diet to theWestern diet, containing far greater amounts of animal protein, Alzheimer’srates rose from 1 percent in 1985 to 7 percent in 2008.But why is animal protein so mischievous when it comes to aging? It goes back tothe fact that we are meant to thrive in an annual cycle that includes periods ofgrowth and regression. During periods of growth, your cells communicate with oneanother via a pathway that sends signals for cells to grow and proliferate. Thispathway, which is known as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), helps toregulate cell metabolism, and mTOR itself is a sensor for energy availabilitywithin the body. So if mTOR senses that there is plentiful energy in your body,it assumes that you are in a growth cycle. It then activates the production of agrowth hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (or IGF-1), which sends asignal to your cells to grow, grow, grow. On the other hand, if mTOR senses thatthere is little energy in the body, it assumes you are in a period ofregression, there’s little food, and it’s time to batten down the hatches, so itlimits production of IGF-1.By measuring your IGF-1 level, we can therefore assess how much mTOR is beingstimulated in your body. Most of us nowadays stimulate mTOR constantly becauseof our plentiful food supply. We always have excess energy in the body for mTORto sense, so our IGF-1 levels are routinely high. This leads to disease andrapid aging. When cells are told to grow indiscriminately with no period ofregression, it paves the way for cancer cells to proliferate. Your cells alsonever get the signal to cull the herd and recycle old or dysfunctional cellsthrough autophagy. I’ve been measuring my patients’ IGF-1 levels for years as amarker for aging.16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_16] And sure enough, both animal andhuman studies show that the lower your IGF-1 level, the longer you live, and theless chance you have of developing cancer.But what does this have to do with animal protein? Good question. It turns outthat when mTOR is scanning the body for energy availability, it keeps an eye outfor certain amino acids more than others. These are the amino acids that aremost necessary for growth—methionine, cysteine, and isoleucine—which areprevalent in—you guessed it—animal protein. These amino acids are very deficientin most plant-based proteins. So if you avoid animal protein, you can eat asmuch plant protein as you want and still trick your body into thinking you’re ina regression cycle, so it doesn’t stimulate production of IGF-1. This allows youto have your cake and eat it, too—as long as that cake isn’t made with animalprotein!17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_17]There is even evidence to suggest that the reason calorie restriction promoteslongevity is that it naturally leads to a reduction in animal proteinconsumption. Researchers at Saint Louis University looked at IGF-1 levels inmembers of the Calorie Restriction Society, who consume about 20 to 30 percentfewer calories than is considered normal. (If a normal man consumes between2,000 and 2,500 calories a day, he would consume 1,700 to 2,000 if he were amember of the CRS.) Despite consuming significantly fewer calories, their IGF-1levels were about the same as those of people who followed a normal diet. Theresearchers then recruited vegans who were not restricting calories, measuredtheir IGF-1 levels, and found that they were much lower than those of theCalorie Restriction Society folks. Finally, they asked several CRS members tocut their animal protein consumption to zero without changing their totalcalorie intake, and their IGF-1 levels went down to the same level as thevegans’.18 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_18]In addition, mouse and rat studies have shown definitively that avoiding theamino acids most prevalent in animal protein extends life span at levelscomparable to those that result from calorie restriction.19[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_19] Dr. Valter Longo of the Longevity Institute at theUniversity of Southern California recently received a patent for his ProLon™protein products, which are based on greatly reducing the amino acids found inanimal protein and substituting those found in plants.Still worried you’ll have a protein deficiency if you cut out meat? Don’t be.There are plenty of good protein sources—in particular, most nuts and allvegetables—that provide all the nutrition your body needs without the dangerousamino acids it doesn’t. Also consider the fact that a 2018 study of men aged 65and older revealed that higher protein intake had no meaningful health benefit.It did not increase the men’s lean body mass, muscle performance, physicalfunction, or any other measure of well-being.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_20]Your protein need is probably much lower than you think. Dr. Longo and I agreethat most people require only 0.37 gram of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_21] One kilogram equals 2.2 pounds. So a150-pound man needs about 25 grams of protein a day and a 125-pound woman about21 grams. You can calculate this for yourself by dividing your weight in poundsby 2.2 to get your weight in kilograms and then multiplying that number by 0.37to get your required daily grams of protein.Keep in mind that every day your body recycles about 20 grams of its ownprotein. Mucus (including that in your gut lining) contains protein, and yourenterocytes are primarily protein, and when your enterocytes are shed daily, youdigest these proteins and reabsorb them. Talk about efficient and eco-friendly.As a result, it is nearly impossible to be truly protein deficient as long asyour gut buddies are able to digest and help you absorb the protein you do eat.And just a reminder, you use the same metabolism as a bear that fasts for fivemonths and lives off its fat. It emerges from the den every spring very skinnybut with its muscle mass intact. If it used its muscles for fuel, it wouldn’t beable to hunt come spring. The same applies to you!And don’t worry, you can still take advantage of the benefits of abstaining frommeat even if you’re not quite ready to give up your steak and eggs. Dr. Longohas shown that doing a five-day modified vegan fast of approximately 900calories per day once a month produces the same results in terms of IGF-1reduction and other markers of aging as a whole month of a traditionalcalorie-restricted diet.22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_22] You’ll be takingadvantage of this “cheat” in the Longevity Paradox program to sidestep mTOR andtrick your body into thinking that you’re hunkering down for the winter in acave even when you’re flourishing in the daylight.But maybe now you’re thinking, isn’t growth a good thing? Why are we trying toavoid natural growth hormones such as IGF-1? This is another excellent question,which leads me to the next myth.MYTH 3: GROWTH HORMONES PROMOTE YOUTHFULNESS AND VITALITYThink, for a moment, of a poodle. A standard poodle typically lives to be about10 years old. A miniature poodle or a Yorkshire terrier, on the other hand, canlive to be about 20. Now consider the fact that a miniature poodle and astandard poodle have the exact same genes. The miniature version was simply bredover time to become smaller.Indulge me in a quick sidetrack. Dog breeding actually began in medievalEngland, where only landed gentry were allowed to own large dogs. In secret,peasants bred large dogs down to a smaller size so they could afford to own dogsthat didn’t have to eat much and could catch vermin for food. Of course, thesmaller the dog, the fewer calories it needs. So is it possible that small dogslive longer than their larger genetic twins simply because they consume fewercalories and are in essence calorie restricted?It may sound strange, but I think this idea holds a lot of weight (no punintended). Most of the people who live in the Blue Zones are far shorter thanthe average height.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_23] Think about this, too: it’swell established that women have lower rates of coronary heart disease than menand on average live about seven years longer. Women are also an average of fiveinches shorter than men. Of course, correlation doesn’t prove causality, butconsider this: an analysis of 1,700 deceased people found that men and women ofthe same height actually had the same average life span.24[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_24]Yet somehow we as a society hold on to the belief that the taller we are, thebetter. I couldn’t disagree more, and I personally find the fact that we’regetting taller as a species to be pretty darn scary. Between the end of thenineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, the averageheights of both men and women increased by four inches.25[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_25] To put it bluntly, this growth is overrated.So why are we getting taller? There’s no doubt that what and how much we eatplays a critical role. In societies where children consume large amounts ofvegetables, they tend to be shorter in stature as adults and begin reproducinglater in life than children who eat fewer vegetables. But when those populationsswitch to more animal and refined-grain sources of food, their growth rates andstature increase. For example, after Western food was introduced in Japan, thepopulation grew significantly taller within just fifteen years.26[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_26] Since the 1960s, people in India and Singapore havealso been eating more processed Western food and have grown considerably taller,and their rate of coronary heart disease has shot up in step with their height.One of the major downsides of constant growth is that it promotes early puberty,particularly menarche (a girl’s first menstruation). The early humans’ diet,which included cycles of growth and regression, prompted slow growth and latepuberty. In 1900, the average age at which a girl began to menstruate was 18.Now it is much younger, with some girls maturing sexually as young as age 8.This very precocious puberty often causes concern for parents, even before theylearn that early puberty is linked to a greater risk of breast cancer, heartdisease, diabetes, and death from any cause.The numbers don’t lie. Studies of US war veterans, deceased professionalbaseball players, and French men and women (an odd grouping of folks, but bearwith me) all show an inverse relationship between height and longevity.27[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_27],28 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_28] Many studies alsoreveal a connection between height and cancer. In one study, rapid growth duringadolescence resulted in an 80 percent increased risk of cancer fifteen yearslater.29 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_29] Stop right now and read that statisticagain—an 80 percent increased risk of cancer! Want another chilling fact? When Iwas in medical school in the 1970s, children’s cancer wards contained only ahandful of beds; now they occupy whole towers or even entire hospitals.My colleagues conducting another study divided more than 22,000 healthy maledoctors in the United States into five categories based on height and followedup with them twelve years later. Even after adjusting for the doctors’ ages, theresults indicated a positive association between height and the development ofcancer.30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_30] This is terrifying, but it makes sensesince high IGF-1 levels, caused by mTOR sensing energy in the body, promotescell growth. This includes growth of both the cells that help us grow tall andthe cells that become cancerous. Our shorter ancestors didn’t live in a 365-daygrowth cycle, so IGF-1 wasn’t constantly being stimulated the way it is today.Dr. Longo’s studies have also profiled a group of people in Ecuador called theLarons (named after the researcher that originally studied them, Zvi Laron). TheLarons, who have absent growth hormone receptors, are unable to make IGF-1.These short adults are free from cancer and diabetes, similar to another groupwith the same syndrome in Brazil.31 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_31] What’s even moreintriguing is when you block the IGF-1 receptor in mice, creating “Laron mice,”they live 40 percent longer than normal mice. Restrict the calories these miceconsume, and they live even longer, yet giving them growth hormone abolishes thelongevity effect of calorie restriction.32 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_32],33[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_33] This confirms the need to maintain a low level ofIGF-1 if cancer-free longevity is your goal; it certainly is mine! Another wayto look at this is that if consuming sugars and animal proteins increases yourIGF-1 level, then lessening your consumption of them generally (but at leastperiodically) is the way to go. In other words, periods of promoting regressionby lessening food intake in general and sugars and animal proteins in particularnot only regulate growth but are important for reducing your metabolic rate.What’s that? You thought that having a high metabolic rate is a good thing? Inthat case, keep reading.MYTH 4: A HIGH METABOLIC RATE IS A SIGN OF GOOD HEALTHRemember our friend the naked mole rat, who has confounded scientists by neverdying of old age? These hairless creatures have an extraordinarily low metabolicrate, something that most of us have probably been told is a bad thing. But theidea that increasing your metabolism will keep you young and trim is an all-outmyth. A high metabolic rate is not a sign that you are burning calories morequickly at all; it is a sign that your metabolism is inefficient and workingmuch harder than it should have to in order to burn fuel. Indeed, as detailed byone of my heroes Professor Robert Sapolsky in his book A Primate’s Memoir: ANeuroscientist’s Unconventional Life Among the Baboons, alpha baboons with a lowmetabolic rate get all the chicks and lead a leisurely, low-stress life, whilethe males with higher metabolic rates have elevated stress hormones and expendfar more energy in finding food, and quite frankly, their love life sucks! Thefemales know a loser, guys!Earlier you read that during times of stress, your cells become more fuelefficient by stimulating the birth of new mitochondria—in essence turbochargingyour cellular engines. A high metabolic rate is the exact opposite—like a carthat gets only ten miles to the gallon. Your internal condo wants to be asenergy efficient as possible. That’s why it turbocharges your cells whennecessary and recycles everything in your body from the protein in the mucuslining your gut to other usable pieces of dead cells. In fact, the ability ofcells to efficiently recycle pieces of dead cells via autophagy and othercellular processes, rather than letting them build up as debris (think landfillsin your brain and heart!), is an important recent discovery in longevityresearch.34 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_34]In addition to stimulating IGF-1, the main reason consuming animal protein agesyou so rapidly is that it requires a lot of energy to metabolize—and if youconsume large quantities of meat on a regular basis, your metabolism never getsa chance to slow down. This is why true carnivores spend much of their daysleeping—to conserve their energy and slow their high metabolic rates.Just watch your carnivorous dogs and cats for a day, and you’ll see what I mean.(You have my permission to take the day off to conduct the experiment.) Theysure sleep a lot! Now join me for another day at my nearby San Diego Zoo towatch the giraffes. Nope, not a lot of sleeping going on. The leaf-eatinggiraffe is the animal equivalent of a high-efficiency, low-polluting engine.Recently, I’ve seen a lot of patients jump on board the craze of thehigh-protein “ketogenic” or carnivore diets as a weight loss strategy. Yes, ifyou’re looking to lose weight quickly, consuming a lot of protein will work, butit works in much the same way that a twelve-cylinder sports car works. If yourobjective is to empty your wallet at the gas station every few miles, it’s agreat strategy. The sports car will get you up to speed in a heartbeat. But aPrius will get you a lot more heartbeats in the long run!In the early 1900s, researhers first posited the idea that longevity isinversely related to metabolic rate. They called it the “rate of living.” Inother words, if you consistently burn energy at a high rate, you will quicklyburn out. This is akin to burning the candle at both ends. On the other hand, alow metabolic rate is the “slow and steady” approach to living. It correlateswith our naturally cyclical nature of energy production: alternating periods ofgrowth and regression.I understand that this may be hard to accept at first because it goes againsteverything you’ve been taught to believe. Many of my patients initially fearlowering their metabolic rate and along with it their levels of thyroidhormones, the main drivers of your resting metabolic rate. But I have seen thatthe healthiest centenarians consistently have basal temperatures in the range of95 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit, not the 98.6 that’s considered normal. You useenergy to generate heat, among other things, and as you’ll see below, runningcooler wins. To put it simply, your body wants to conserve energy instead ofwasting it revving up your metabolic rate and generating heat.Some of my colleagues believe that one reason a low metabolic rate promoteslongevity is that a slower metabolism reduces the amount of oxidative stress inour cells. When mitochondria use oxygen to manufacture energy, by-products knownas reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are produced. These have the potential todamage cells owing to the resultant oxidative stress. One prevailing theory isthat oxidative stress is the major cause of aging. Yet when researchers lookedat the metabolic rates and markers of oxidative stress in people ranging in agefrom 20 to over 90, they found no correlation between metabolic rate and levelof oxidative stress.35 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_35] There is also no evidencethat people in the Blue Zones experience any less oxidative stress than those ofus living elsewhere. ROSs may have an aging effect, but they’re a very smallpiece of the puzzle. I suspect that the heat generated by a high metabolic rateis a much larger piece.The heat generated by a high metabolic rate ages you quickly. This is becausewhen a glucose molecule bonds to an amino acid in a chemical process known asthe Maillard reaction, compounds called advanced glycation end products (AGEs)are produced. This reaction is not called AGEing by coincidence! This is one ofthe strongest chemical bonds known, and heat is required to catalyze thereaction. You can think of it as browning a protein and sugar together, as thatis literally what it is. When you char a steak on a grill, the crust that formsis made of AGEs. Have you ever noticed that the higher the heat, the crispierthe meat? Well, the exact same thing happens in your brain, in your heart, andeven on your skin. The brown “age spots” that show up as you get older and othersigns of skin aging are the results of the Maillard reaction.36[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_36]Many of my patients are delighted to see this hyperpigmentation go away whenthey begin following the Longevity Paradox program. In fact, several years ago,a couple in their late seventies returned to Palm Springs in the fall for theiryearly “snowbird” migration from Oregon, driving their large RV as usual. Duringtheir office visit that fall, the wife told me that her husband had nearlykilled them on the road on the drive down. While he was driving, she had noticedthat the multiple dark “liver spots” on the backs of his hands holding thesteering wheel had disappeared. She exclaimed, “Harry, look at your hands!” Withthat, he turned the steering wheel sharply to look at his hands and nearlyswerved off the road!We had a good laugh at how witnessing his deaging had nearly ended his newlyextended life. But a word of caution: when you witness this Longevity Paradoxhappening on your own hands (as it did on mine, too), admire it withoutendangering yourself or others!In a 365-day growth cycle, glucose, protein, and heat are always present, so youare producing these chemical bonds all the time. The study results are clearthat this metabolic state is one of the underlying causes of aging anddegenerative diseases.37 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_37] Lowering the heat bystrategically lowering your metabolic rate is the best way to reduce thesereactions and therefore the rate at which you age. Moreover, since protein,sugar, and heat are required for this action to occur, cutting down onconsumption of sugars and proteins is a key component of the Longevity Paradoxprogram.In fact, your health care provider has probably shown you how fast you are agingwith a lab test called hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This routine test for diabetesactually measures the crusty bits of sugar and protein attached to your redblood cells. Since red blood cells are recycled about every two months, yourHbA1c level gives you an indirect measurement of how fast or slow you arebecoming a giant brown spot. In my clinics, anyone who has an HbA1c level lessthan 5.0 earns a gold star (really). What’s yours? If it’s above 5.6, you are inbig trouble in the longevity race.There’s one more reason that animal protein is incredibly aging, but it’s soimportant that I saved it for its own myth . . .MYTH 5: IT’S IMPORTANT TO GET PLENTY OF IRON AS YOU AGEPeople develop anemia and become weak and frail as they age because they aredeficient in iron, right? After all, Geritol, an iron-rich tonic, was wildlypopular in the 1950s and ’60s for the treatment of “iron-poor blood.” Not sofast. Iron accumulation in the body actually plays a significant role inaccelerating the aging process. When researchers in Denmark and Sweden studiedmillions of blood donors to see if frequently donating blood would lead todangerously low iron levels, they found that, after adjusting for age and otherhealth conditions, those who donated blood the most frequently livedsignificantly longer than those who donated blood less frequently.38[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_38] This is because giving blood reduced the amount ofiron in their body. (Similarly, one not-so-obvious reason that women live longerthan men is that for a good half of your lives, ladies, you part with asignificant amount of iron every month.)In another study that looked at the function of iron, four-day-old roundwormswere fed iron and quickly aged to resemble fifteen-day-old worms.39[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_39] At first glance, that may seem insignificant, but aroundworm’s entire life span is only about four weeks. So the additional ironactually shortened the worm’s life span by approximately one-third! Iron ages usbecause it interferes with mitochondrial function. As you probably know, iron isa component of hemoglobin, a substance in your red blood cells that transportsoxygen throughout the body. And your mitochondria use oxygen to “digest” eitherglucose or fat molecules to produce energy. So on the surface it would seem thatthe more iron you have in your blood, the more oxygen can get into themitochondria and the more energy they can produce. But the opposite appears tobe true.In a 2018 study at the University of Wyoming, researchers looked at themitochondria of mice and found that those with high iron levels had oxygendeficits in the mitochondria. And when they studied mice with Huntington’sdisease, which causes neurons in the brain to die, their mitochondria, too, hadan overaccumulation of iron. Those neurons died due to a lack of mitochondrialfunction. If your mitochondria cannot access oxygen and produce energy, the celldies. This provides us with a pathway for understanding other neurologicaldiseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophiclateral sclerosis, or ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease).40 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_40]Indeed, studies on humans show that having increased iron in the blood as aperson ages increases his or her risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.41[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_41] And in those without Alzheimer’s, brain-imagingtechnology has revealed a consistent correlation between cognitive dysfunctionand iron deposition.42 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_42] There is even a newlyrecognized form of cell death called ferroptosis that is linked to too much ironin the brain!43 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_43] Yet another study on the effects ofiron on brain function showed that when Parkinson’s patients reduced their ironlevels by donating blood, their symptoms were dramatically reduced.44[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_44] Iron is incredibly aging, and it’s found in a hugesupply, of course, in animal protein.But here’s something interesting: when researchers in Brazil gave rats with highiron levels and signs of memory impairment a single systemic injection of sodiumbutyrate, their memories improved.45 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_45] Now, remember,if you feed your gut buddies the right foods, they produce butyrate and use itas a signal to tell their sisters, the mitochondria, to rev up energyproduction. So is iron accumulation in the mitochondria a sign that the line ofcommunication between the sisters has been hijacked, or does it mean that havinghappier, healthier gut buddies can help protect you from some of the agingeffects of iron? Amazingly, it’s probably both.This boy from Omaha really is sad to have to tell you to reduce your beef, pork,and lamb consumption, as well as your consumption of other animal proteinsources, but hopefully by now you’re convinced of the benefits of limiting yourintake of animal protein. So let’s move on to some myths about another source ofnutrition that is most people’s favorite: fat.MYTH 6: SATURATED FAT SHOULD NOT BE DEMONIZEDYou’ve seen on the cover of Time magazine and you’ve read in bestselling booksthat our fear of animal fats is based on fake news and fake studies. Well, I’meager to debunk the long-held myth in the paleo and keto communities thatsaturated animal fats such as butter are good for you. The whole idea that thesefats were bad for you originated decades ago with the legendary Ancel Keys. Incase you’re not familiar with him, Keys was a scientist from the University ofMinnesota who was tapped by the government to work on issues related tonutrition for soldiers during World War II. Keys invented the K ration, thepackaged meals that fed our troops during the war. When President Dwight D.Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the 1950s, Keys was brought in to consulton the president’s diet. Ever since the war, he had been busy studying theimpact of diet on health, longevity, and heart disease. He became well known forhis Seven Countries Study, which was an analysis of the eating habits of peoplein seven different countries and their rates of heart disease. The studyindicated a correlation between animal fat consumption and heart disease.Keys presented his findings to the World Health Organization, and thus thepopular belief that fat (particularly saturated fat) was a leading cause ofheart disease took root. The McGovern Commission (yes, the presidentialcandidate George McGovern) used Keys’s data to guide the creation of the newgovernment food pyramid that for the first time demonized saturated fats. Thusbegan the low-fat food craze. Food manufacturers tried to remove the fat fromtheir food products while still making them palatable, so what did they add? Youguessed it: sugar! Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration and theDepartment of Agriculture, headed by my fellow Nebraskan and “Cornhusker” EarlButz, created policies to subsidize the production of corn, wheat, and soybeansand promoted eating whole grain carbohydrates as the cornerstone of a healthydiet. This was the start of the downward spiral we are witnessing in our healthand life spans today. Just to refresh your memory, for the first time inhistory, our life span has now decreased for three straight years.In recent decades, Keys was roundly criticized and even demonized for allegedlycherry-picking his data. He started out with far more than seven countries inhis study, and many people believe that he simply threw out the data that didn’tconform to his hypothesis that fat intake causes heart disease. The backlashagainst Keys led many people to reembrace the saturated fat found in animalproducts and gave rise to the popularity of paleo and ketogenic eating plans.But I believe that Keys got an unfair shake. More recent analyses of his datashow that he did not cherry-pick at all and that even when the data from therest of the countries are added back in, there is still a clear connectionbetween animal fat consumption and heart disease.One place where Keys went wrong was in failing to distinguish between saturatedanimal fat and fat from plants. Follow-up studies have clearly shown that plantfat is negatively associated with heart disease while animal fat is positivelycorrelated.46 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_46] But to his credit, Keys did say thatsaturated fat (which comes primarily from animals) was worse for longevity thanmonounsaturated fat (which comes primarily from plants such as olives, nuts, andavocados).Dear reader, if you’ve been following closely, you might have already caughtwhat he really missed in his research. Where is animal fat usually found? Yes,it’s found in animal protein. Whether it’s a juicy steak, pork ribs, salami, orchicken, where there’s fat, there’s protein, and where there’s protein, there’sfire! Heat! I have read all of his studies countless times, and he never, to myknowledge, teased out this important connection.But I came here, unlike Marc Antony, to praise Dr. Keys, not to bury him. Dr.Keys retired to the south of Italy and lived in a village next to Acciaroli, thehome of more centenarians per capita than anywhere in the world, where theyconsume a lot of olive oil. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting his formerhousekeeper, who confirmed that the ultimate antifat crusader loved his oliveoil! Dr. Keys thrived well into very old age, dying just shy of his 102ndbirthday—making him the reigning champion in nutritionists’ life span. Sadly,the track record for longevity experts having extended life spans is poor, tosay the least.Herman Tarnower of Scarsdale Diet fame was murdered by his lover at age 69.Nathan Pritikin of the low-fat, plant-based diet that bore his name committedsuicide at age 69 after suffering from two forms of leukemia. Robert Atkins diedat age 72 from a fall on the ice in New York City; as confirmed by his coauthor,he died obese. The mentor of Valter Longo, Roy Walford, who was the true fatherof calorie restriction, a member of the Biosphere 2 experiment, and the authorof multiple books on longevity, including Beyond the 120 Year Diet: How toDouble Your Vital Years, died of Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) at 79. My personalhero, Gayelord Hauser, made it to 89, curing himself along the way oftuberculosis of the hip. The Kellogg brothers, Will and Harvey, both made it to91, and my friend Jack LaLanne made it to just shy of 97. But Robert Cameron,the aerial photographer turned diet expert, with his Drinking Man’s Diet, alow-carb forerunner of the Atkins Diet of the 1960s and ’70s, made it to see thefiftieth-anniversary edition of his book published and passed onward at 98 yearsold. Not bad for a guy Harvard nutritionists accused of being a “mass murderer”!In the interest of fair play, still going strong are T. Colin Campbell andCaldwell Esselstyn, both 84 at the time I write this and both advocates oflow-fat vegan diets. And my friend in Santa Barbara Patricia Bragg, of applecider vinegar fame, is 89. But the big winners in the longevity race fornutritionists are Ancel Keys and Luigi Cornaro, the author of How to Live 100Years, or Discourses on the Sober Life, published in 1550, who died at 102. Bythe way, I realize that writing this book is risky, as some of my critics willbe waiting with bated breath for me to kick off soon and prove myself wrong!So let’s look at some of the fat sources that are best for longevity. Notcoincidentally, they all come from plants. And Dr. Keys, who was no dummy, choseolives and olive oil. Olive oil’s main fat is a monounsaturated fat, oleic acid,but it’s not this fat that protects against heart disease, cognitive decline,Alzheimer’s disease, and neurological inflammation. It’s actually all thepolyphenols that are contained in olive oil that make the difference.47[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_47] This is primarily because these plant compoundsstimulate autophagy, your cells’ recycling program.48[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_48]Don’t forget what sends the signal to your cells to stimulate autophagy—your gutbuddies, of course. Our gut buddies love the polyphenols in olive oil, and I tryto consume a liter of it a week, as people in many of the Blue Zones do. Nutsare also exceptionally high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat and areremarkably protective against heart disease. Why? Because they, and theprebiotic fiber they contain, are also beloved by your gut buddies! Eatingpistachios, walnuts, and almonds (peeled, please) increases your level ofbutyrate-producing bacteria,49 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_49] with walnuts andpistachios beating almonds in a landslide.50 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_50],51[Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_51],52 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_52]Some of my friends in the paleo community are also excited about the remarkableeffects of butyrate and try to get more of it by eating additional butter (funfact: butyrate is named after butter). Butter is indeed a tiny source ofbutyrate, but, sadly, it is not a good idea to eat a lot of dairy products ifyou want to live a long and healthy life. And that leads me to our seventh andfinal myth.MYTH 7: MILK DOES A BODY GOODDid you notice in our discussion of the Blue Zones earlier that not only dopeople in all of those cultures eat meat very rarely, but they also consume goator sheep milk products rather than cow? Call this luck or intuitive wisdom (orflavor preference). Whatever it is, it is clearly one factor that has helpedthose people live such long and healthy lives.Here’s why. About two thousand years ago, a spontaneous mutation in northernEuropean cows changed the type of protein in their milk from casein A2 to caseinA1. During digestion, casein A1 can turn into beta-casomorphin-7, an opioidpeptide53 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_53] that attaches to the pancreas’sinsulin-producing cells and prompts an immune attack (and thus inflammation).This is likely a primary cause of type 1 diabetes.54 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_13_54]The most common breed of cows worldwide is the Holstein, whose milk containsthis problematic protein. Many people notice that milk gives themgastrointestinal problems or causes them to overproduce mucus, which as you knowby now is one of our body’s major defense mechanisms against other foreignproteins such as lectins, but in most cases, it is the casein A1 protein that’sto blame, not the milk (or the milk sugar, lactose) itself.Furthermore, conventionally raised livestock and their dairy products are lacedwith antibiotics and Roundup, which will send your gut buddies running for thehills. With some important exceptions that we will discuss later, consumption ofdairy products simply is not conducive to a long life and health span. If youchoose to eat dairy products, take a note from our friends in the Blue Zones andopt for products made from goat or sheep milk rather than cow. Goats, sheep, andwater buffalo were not affected by the mutation, so their milk still containsthe healthier casein A2 protein. And good news: most cows in Switzerland,France, and Italy make casein A2, but please realize that most “Swiss cheeses”don’t actually come from Switzerland!And please stay away from plain old milk as a beverage, particularly for yourchildren. Cow’s milk is loaded with insulin-like growth factor 1, or IGF-1(after all, it’s designed to make calves grow quickly). Human milk has far loweramounts of IGF-1, as we are designed to be very slow growing. As we mentionedearlier, fast growth is problematic in so many ways. So, no, milk doesn’t do abody good. If you’re beginning to panic that I’m about to take away your dairy products,your animal protein, and all of your favorite sources of animal fat, cheer up.You can follow the Longevity Paradox program without becoming a vegan or avegetarian (although you certainly should head toward that if you want to). Butbefore we get to the program, I want to show you how everything we’ve discussedso far is connected. Each part of your body—from your heart to your brain toyour musculoskeletal system and, yes, even your skin—ages and regenerates forthe exact same reasons and via the same mechanisms. And, of course, it all goesback to your gut."},{"pageContent":"IITALKIN’ ’BOUT MY REGENERATION [nav.xhtml#nii7]You now know that much of the decline we attribute to the “normal” aging processis actually the result of the deterioration of your gut wall and yourmicrobiome, as well as the Maillard reaction of heat gluing together sugars andproteins inside you. But this decline is not inevitable. If you treat your gutbuddies well, you can get younger as you age. Best of all, your focused effortson this one area of your body will effect systemic changes. In the chapters thatfollow, we’ll look at how gut health impacts each individual system in the body.When you treat your gut buddies right, you will improve not only your gut healthbut also your heart health, your brain health, and your joint health, not tomention your weight and your skin. When we’re done, you’ll have a gleaming newcondo that’s full of happy, productive inhabitants both inside and out."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4GET YOUNGER FROM THE INSIDE OUT [nav.xhtml#nch8]I often tell my patients that in the end, one of two things is most likely toget them: heart disease or cancer. While other aspects such as mobility andalertness may factor more greatly into health span, it’s impossible to enjoyyour old age fully if you’re dead. So first we are going to tackle the internalorgans that tend to age the most quickly.As a heart surgeon, I have had plenty of opportunities to see firsthand howclosely heart health is linked to the health and maintenance of every other partof the body. There is no doubt, in my now vast experience, that if you haveheart issues of any kind, you also have major problems throughout your entireinner condo.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_1] So, dear reader, we’ll start with theheart—why it ages and how you can begin to repair and regenerate this most vitalof organs.HEART DISEASE IS AN AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONWe often think of heart disease as an inevitable part of aging. We’re taughtthat just like the rest of us, the heart gets weaker and weaker as we age, andafter a while you’ll probably need to go on medication or undergo a few surgicalinterventions—maybe have your valves replaced and your arteries opened up—until,at last, your heart simply gives out. This is normal, right? After all, when Iwas in medical school I was taught that heart disease is progressive and thatall we can do as physicians is try our best to slow it down. The idea that heartdisease is not an inevitability, and that it can actually be reversed withoutsurgery or medication, goes against everything I once believed as a heartsurgeon and cardiologist and everything many people and their doctors stillbelieve. But what if I told you that just about everything you’ve ever been toldabout heart disease is dead wrong?After decades of having a front-row view of this organ, I’ve gotten to know theheart pretty well. And what I’ve seen with my own two eyes disproves everythingI was taught not only about the heart but also about our entire bodies and ourhealth in general. In essence, it all goes back to the immune system—and hencethe gut.Early in my career, many of the adult humans I operated on were smokers who hadplaque (blockages) that usually occurred in the first or proximal part of theircoronary arteries. My fellow surgeons and I always found that beyond thoseblockages, these smokers’ blood vessels were gorgeous. It made our jobrelatively easy. We just had to jump past those blockages with a new artery orvein that we could sew onto a nice juicy blood vessel downstream. Plus, most ofthose smokers, bless their hearts, were skinny and easy to operate on!As time progressed, more and more of the people with coronary artery diseasethat I operated on were not smokers. Instead, they had metabolic syndrome, type2 diabetes, and high insulin levels and for the most part were overweight orobese. And almost all of them, both men and women, had a large amount ofabdominal fat.The degenerative processes we saw in the blood vessels of the nonsmokingpatients with metabolic disorders looked completely different from those of thesmokers. Instead of beautiful clear blood vessels beyond a blockage, thosepatients had multiple plaques throughout their blood vessels. Even worse, all oftheir coronary blood vessels were horribly inflamed. In the places where we weregoing to place our downstream bypass, the lining of the vessels was full ofmushy plaque. In fact, finding a place that looked clear and healthy was theexception rather than the rule. Instead of being enjoyable, doing bypass surgeryon these poor folks was downright harrowing.Later on, I started working in infant heart transplant surgery with my partner,Dr. Leonard Bailey, the founder of this specialty. Dr. Bailey reasoned that ifwe did heart transplants in babies that were just days old and had no otherhope, their immature immune systems might accept foreign hearts as their own,lessening the need for the use of the powerful immunosuppressant drugs we usedin adult transplants. (As a quick aside, you see these agents and many of theircousins advertised nightly on television as an easy fix for the autoimmunedisease you suffer from. All I will say about that for now is that if you don’thave a transplant, why would you take those drugs?)Well, we were pretty naive back then. As the babies who received the hearttransplants grew up, we’d have them come in for routine cardiac catheterizations(where we snake a catheter through a large artery that leads to the heart andcan see the heart and the coronary arteries on a screen) to make sure everythingwas functioning properly. Lo and behold, the blood vessels of those kids lookedjust like those of my adult diabetic patients! They had plaque all up and downtheir inflamed coronary arteries.That was my first clue that all coronary heart disease is immunologic in nature.Even though we thought that we were doing a good job of preventing rejection ofthe heart muscle itself, the kids’ immune systems had recognized that the bloodvessels, which were lined with cells from the heart donor, were foreign bodiesand had attacked their surfaces. The thickening was a sign of the war going onbetween the immune system and the foreign proteins lining the blood vessels.Now, that made perfect sense in the transplanted kids because the blood vesselsreally were foreign. Of course their immune systems did not recognize them asfriendly and went on the attack. And the thickening was a manifestation of thatwar, if you will.But what was causing the diabetic patients’ arteries to look like transplantkids’ arteries? Were those patients’ immune systems attacking their own bloodvessels? If so, why? My search for the answer to that question led me todiscover much of the information in this book and turned everything I thought Iknew about coronary artery disease completely on its head.I found my next clue when performing heart valve replacements on survivors ofrheumatic heart disease, a condition that stems from rheumatic fever and resultsin inflammation of the heart, blood vessels, and joints. Rheumatic feverdevelops as a complication of the common childhood illness strep throat, whichis caused by an infection of beta-hemolytic streptococcus. If you’ve ever beeninfected by this form of streptococcus and you developed rheumatic fever, youprobably recovered after some time and things seemed to quiet down. Butunbeknownst to you, your immune system formed antibodies to the cell wall of thestrep bacterium and is keeping a constant lookout for its presence in yourblood.You can think of this as the police rendering of a suspect on a “wanted” signthat’s hanging on every post office and community pin board. Police renderingsusually give you a decent idea of what a bad guy looks like, but they’re not 100percent accurate. And this particular rendering happens to look pretty similarto the drawing of the cells composing your heart valve. As I explained earlier,you have toll-like receptors (TLRs: tiny little radars), which are constantlyscanning the body for patterns in proteins or foreign substances such as LPSsthat match what they are looking for. The cells in your heart valves just happento contain a pattern that looks almost but not quite like that on thestreptococcus cell wall.So what do you think happens when the cops are on the lookout for that bad guyon the wanted poster and come across someone who looks a lot like him? Youguessed it . . . a case of mistaken identity. In survivors of rheumatic fever,this happens day after day, year after year, until slowly but surely the heartvalve deteriorates and needs to be replaced. That’s where I come in. As Iperformed those surgeries over and over, I realized that the contents of thedysfunctional heart valves looked suspiciously like the mushy, calcified bloodvessels in my overweight, diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome. Cue thelightbulb appearing over my head! In both types of patients, “heart disease” wascaused by an immune response, or a police response based on a case of mistakenidentity.Okay, the valves were destroyed in rheumatic fever patients because their cellslooked a lot like foreign bacteria, but what was going on with the blood vesselsin my diabetics? My next clue, much to my surprise, came from elephants. In thewild, where they eat only the leaves of trees, African elephants have no knowncoronary artery disease. Due to habitat destruction, however, herds of elephantsnow graze on grasslands or are fed hay and grains. These animals now have a 50percent rate of severe coronary artery disease. Could a simple change in dietreally cause such a significant uptick in disease? In a word: yes. Remember,when your microbiome and immune system are confronted with new foreign proteinssuch as the lectins in single-leafed plants like grasses and grains (which aretotally different from the lectins in two-leafed plants), your gut bugs don’thave the ability to “eat” these lectins, nor do they have the ability to educateyour immune system to tolerate them.Okay, fine, maybe the elephants’ diet was making them sick, but could the samebiological phenomenon apply for those of us mammals who weigh several tons less?Well, humans and elephants have more in common than you may think. We bothpossess a particular sugar molecule that causes lectins to bind to arteries.This lectin-binding sugar, called N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), sits on thelining of blood vessels and the absorptive cells on the gut wall (theenterocytes). Most other mammals have a different sugar molecule, calledN-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), on the lining of their gut wall and bloodvessel walls. But elephants do not have this molecule and humans lost theability to make it about 8 million years back, when our gut buddies evolved andwe diverged from chimps and gorillas.Lectins, and particularly grain lectins, bind to Neu5Ac but cannot bind toNeu5Gc. This explains why captive chimps eating a grain-based diet(appropriately named “monkey chow”) don’t get atherosclerosis or autoimmunedisease but the poor grass-eating elephants do. The chimps lack thelectin-binding sugar molecule, but elephants and humans possess it—and it laysthe groundwork for heart and autoimmune diseases in spades when we, like thosepoor elephants, eat grasses and seeds.TELL PROTEIN TO STOP CALLING 911The presence of Neu5Ac on our blood vessel and gut lining is yet another reasonthat consuming large amounts of some animal proteins is so terribly aging.Remember, the animals we eat (cows, pigs, lamb) do not have Neu5Ac on theirblood vessel walls. They have Neu5Gc instead. When you eat Neu5Gc, your immunesystem senses foreign invaders and calls in the defense. But Neu5Gc and Neu5Acare molecularly very similar. So the “cops” often mistake them for each other.When they’re out searching for an invader (Neu5Gc) to attack, they sometimesrelease their weapons on the unsuspecting Neu5Ac that lines your blood vessels.This is another example of friendly fire that can lead to developing heartdisease. But cheer up; fish, shellfish, and poultry all carry our sugarmolecule, Neu5AC.I have seen proof of this immune attack in many of my patients since I’ve begunusing a new blood test that has been clinically validated to predict your chanceof having a heart attack or developing angina within the next five years. Thetest works by assessing biomarkers for damage and repair happening inside yourblood vessels. Simply put, if you have an autoimmune disease or lectinsensitivity, this test reveals an autoimmune attack on your blood vessels thatis called in by a cytokine called interleukin 16 (IL 16).If your immune system is the police force of your inner condo, you can think ofinterleukin 16 as a 911 operator with the assistance of GPS. It alerts the copsto an exact location. This test allows me to see that a high level ofinterleukin 16 in a patient’s blood is a sign that the cops are constantly beingcalled to the blood vessels to find invading Neu5Gc or lectins (or both) and endup attacking the blood vessels themselves.I’ve asked many of my patients with markers indicative of impending heart attackissues to remove beef, pork, and lamb from their diets and to limit high-lectinfoods—and when I have retested their blood, I’ve found that their levels of IL16 have fallen dramatically. In some patients, it has been reduced by half. Thismeans that their chances of developing heart disease within the next five yearsdecreased simply as a result of reducing their intake of certain animal proteinsand lectins. Researchers at the University of Paris-Saclay and Loma LindaUniversity had similar results with a much larger sample size. When they lookedat the protein consumption of more than 81,000 people over the course of fiveyears and then followed up nine years later to track their rates of heartdisease, they found that the people who ate more animal protein were more thanone and a half times likely to have died from heart disease over the course ofthe study than those who consumed protein from vegetarian sources, primarilynuts and seeds.2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_2]Pretty compelling, isn’t it? I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating: I’mjust a boy from cattle country. I wouldn’t have reduced my own animal proteinintake so dramatically if the evidence weren’t so strong that consuming animalprotein creates dangerous inflammation, which is an utter disaster forlongevity. In fact, a 2018 study by my colleagues at the Medical College ofGeorgia at Augusta University found that consuming a single milkshake caused animmune response similar to one provoked by a severe infection.3[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_3]Furthermore, in 2018, a study confirmed the link between inflammatory boweldisease (IBD, an umbrella term for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, bothautoimmune conditions) and heart disease.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_4] Thethree-year study of 22 million patients found that those with IBD were almosttwice as likely to have heart attacks as those without IBD. After adjusting forage, race, sex, and even traditional heart disease risk factors, the researchersfound that the patients with IBD still had a 23 percent higher chance of havinga heart attack than patients without IBD.These data evidence not only the link between heart disease and autoimmunity butalso the fact that all disease—even heart disease—really does begin in the gut.When your gut buddies signal for the cops to attack invaders, the result isautoimmune conditions such as IBD and an increased risk of heart attack. Sureenough, a study of more than six hundred middle-aged women at UniversityHospitals Cleveland Medical Center found that the more gut bacteria diversitythey had, the less stiff their arteries were.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_5] Whenthe bad bugs take over, they cause your arteries to become rigid, dramaticallyincreasing your chances of developing heart disease.There is an old saying in cardiology circles that you are only as young as yourarteries are flexible. And there is new evidence that specific chemicals made byyour gut bacteria (trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO; p-cresyl sulfate, p-cresylglucuronide; and phenylacetylglutamine, to be precise) actually causeatherosclerosis by stimulating inflammation.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_6]Thankfully, there are polyphenol compounds in red wine and olive oil thatremodel and reeducate the gut biome so it stops making these chemicals. Allalong, we thought that red wine and olive oil protected against heartdisease—and they do, but not at all in the ways we suspected. It turns out thatthey protect you by making changes directly to your gut.CHOLESTEROL IS AN INNOCENT BYSTANDERWhen I explain to my patients that heart disease begins in the gut, the mostcommon response I hear is “But Dr. G., what about cholesterol? Isn’t that whatcauses heart disease?” Well, let’s take a look at the real connection (or lackthereof) between cholesterol and heart disease.Back in the early twentieth century, a Russian scientist named Nikolai Anichkovfirst put forth the idea that consuming dietary cholesterol caused heartdisease. After observing that diseased arterial walls contained up to twentytimes more cholesterol than healthy walls, he claimed that consuming cholesterolhad led to those changes. Okay, that makes sense. But does this mean that thecholesterol caused the heart disease? You astute readers will already know theanswer.One of the main voices questioning Anichkov’s theory at the time belonged tonone other than our friend Ancel Keys. Keys believed that saturated fat causedheart disease by raising blood cholesterol levels but insisted that dietarycholesterol was irrelevant. It turned out that he was half right. In hisstudies, Keys found that altering dietary cholesterol levels had relativelyminor effects on blood cholesterol. But he did notice that many patients withheart disease had high blood cholesterol levels, and, in an observation that wasway ahead of his time, that high cholesterol was associated with insulinresistance and diabetes.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_7] He concluded that “allanimals, including man, have a high capacity for synthesizing cholesterol” andthat consuming even large amounts of it in the diet did not increase one’s riskof developing heart disease.More recent studies have proved that there is no direct connection betweencholesterol intake and heart disease. The famous China Study, which looked atthe health and dietary habits of people in sixty-five rural Chinese communitiesback in the 1990s, showed that neither cholesterol consumption nor high bloodlevels of cholesterol were associated with cardiovascular disease. Instead, itwas triglyceride levels in the blood that were positively associated with heartdisease.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_8] (More on this in a moment.)Data from the Framingham Heart Study, a highly reputable longitudinalcardiovascular risk study started in 1948 on the residents of a small town inMassachusetts, which is now in its third generation, shows that the omega-3index (the total amount of omega-3 fatty acids found in the red blood cellmembranes) is a far better predictor of heart disease than blood cholesterollevels. In this study, the risk of death in people who had the highest omega-3indexes (a measurement of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA in the blood for theprevious two months) was a full third less than those who had the lowest omega-3indexes. (Since omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, it makessense that they can protect you from heart disease.) But when researchersanalyzing the data replaced the omega-3 index with total cholesterol levels andlooked at the same statistical models, they found that there was no associationbetween cholesterol levels and heart disease.9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_9]So what is going on here? If cholesterol doesn’t cause heart disease, why dopeople with heart disease have cholesterol in the plaques in their arteries?(And yes, it is in the plaques I see regularly.) I often explain to my patientswhat I learned from Dr. Michael DeBakey, one of the great fathers of heartsurgery, whom I had the pleasure of knowing in his later years. Back in the1950s, Dr. DeBakey said that cholesterol had nothing to do with heart disease;it was an innocent bystander that got caught up in an inflammatory reaction onthe surface of blood vessels.To understand this, let’s take a step back and take a closer look at cholesterolitself. When you eat excess starch or sugars (or protein, which we’ll discuss ina moment) anything you don’t need for immediate fuel is carried to your liver,where it is transformed into a fat called a triglyceride. Then you need movingvans, which are low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), a type of cholesterol, to carrytriglycerides from the liver to cells throughout your body. Once distributedthere, they’ll be stored as fat or used to make hormones. You actually have atleast seven different sizes of these cholesterol moving vans, or LDLs, includingfour professional moving companies with big vans and strong movers.This is yet another of the beautifully efficient systems in your body, butproblems occur during a 365-day growth cycle when you have so many triglyceridesthat the moving vans (big, fluffy LDL particles) get filled up. Then you have tocall in some less professional guys with pickup trucks (small, dense LDLparticles) to strap some more triglycerides onto their backs for transport.These are equivalent to folks heading down the highway with so much stuffstrapped to the roof of their station wagon that a mattress ends up flying ontothe road and creating a hazard for everyone else. The next time you envisionyour coronary arteries, think about that mattress blocking the lane! You get theidea.Now, what about the so-called good cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)?They are recycling trucks. They are sent out empty from your liver to go pick upthe fat you stored. Ideally, during a season of regression (less food), yourbody would need to send out lots of recycling trucks to go pick up all the extrastored fat and bring it back to reuse. In other words, during a growth cyclewhen you’re eating a lot of sugars and proteins, your LDL level increases tohelp carry the triglycerides into storage—but your HDL level drops because youdon’t need those recycling trucks to go pick it up yet.Your body is efficient; it will not waste energy producing HDL if you don’t needit. But during a cycle of regression, it does. Your triglycerides fall whenyou’re not eating as much, so you don’t need the moving vans (LDLs) to take thatfat into storage. What you do need are the recycling trucks to go pick it up forreuse.Very few doctors recognize that the best way to analyze cholesterol data isn’tto compare HDL to LDL or HDL to total cholesterol, but rather to look at theratio of HDL to triglycerides. In fact, in a recent study of more than 68,000elderly people, no connection was found between LDL level and all-causemortality.10 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_10] Did you hear that? None whatsoever. Buta high triglyceride level is indicative of health problems. As a guide, your HDLlevel should be equal to or higher than your triglyceride level, which basicallysignifies that you’re recycling more fat than is being stored. But during ourcurrent 365-day growth cycle, the vast majority of people have the exactopposite ratio.So why do so many people, including your doctor and most of my cardiologycolleagues, still believe that high cholesterol levels cause heart disease?Imagine that you’re an alien circling our planet observing life down below andreporting back to high command. One observation you could reasonably make isthat ambulances cause car accidents. After all, every time you see a caraccident, there’s an ambulance nearby. That’s called an association; it does notprove causality (that one thing caused the other). This may sound foolish, butthe same thing actually happens in describing heart disease. When the copsattack your blood vessels, a war is going on there, and cholesterol, like anambulance, gets caught up in the melee.This is why cholesterol is incorporated into arterial plaques—not becausecholesterol caused the plaque in the first place but because the pickup trucks,the moving trucks, and the recycling trucks all got stuck in the traffic jamfollowing a police attack. In his 1950s wisdom, Dr. DeBakey was right:cholesterol didn’t cause the heart disease; it was an innocent bystander thatgot caught up in the violence.Many of my colleagues point to the success of statin drugs, which do reducecholesterol levels and may slightly reduce arterial plaque, as proof thatcholesterol causes heart disease. But, if anything, I believe this proves theopposite is true. We used to think that statins treated heart disease bylowering cholesterol levels because as cholesterol levels lowered, so didincidents of myocardial infarctions (MIs). But remember, association doesn’tmean causation. We now know that statins actually work by lowering inflammation.With less inflammation, less cholesterol gets caught up in the war zone.Statins work by blocking the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs),11[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_11] which, as you’ll remember, are scanners that yourimmune system uses to identify visitors as friends or foes. TLRs look forpatterns to identify who’s who. In particular, they are on the lookout for LPSsand anything that looks like them. When they find them, they sound the alarm.Statins effectively prevent TLRs from calling the police. The result is lessinflammation, less plaque, and less cholesterol caught up in the mix. Thereduction of LDL cholesterol is just a side effect of statins; it’s not whatmakes them effective in treating heart disease.Oh, and one more shout-out to our old friend Akkermansia muciniphila, thatmucus-loving gut bug. In a study on atherosclerosis in genetically bred mice,Akkermansia prevented heart disease even when the mice were fed a Western diethigh in animal fat.12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_12] Talk about protecting theneighborhood!Many scientists, including me, now believe that when the walls of blood vesselsare damaged during an immune attack, cholesterol is used as a patch to repairthe damaged wall. There is even some important literature that demonstrates thefact that the more LPSs you have in your bloodstream, the more cholesterol youwill have to bind them and prevent them from causing damage.13[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_13] I find this very intriguing, especially in the caseof patients with sepsis (a severe infection), whose cholesterol levels suddenlygo sky high. Does this mean that cholesterol is a built-in system to absorbinvaders?This theory, which I like, suggests that the reason some people have highcholesterol is that they actually have a leaky gut. When invaders slip past thegut barrier, your body produces more cholesterol in its efforts to sop them up.And sure enough, societies that eat the most nourishing foods for their gutbuddies and don’t suffer from leaky gut also tend to have low cholesterollevels.Does this mean that your gut buddies and your gut wall determine yourcholesterol levels? It may sound wild to you now, but just ask the Kitavans, thefamously long-lived people who eat enormous amounts of coconut oil, which youwould think would lead to high cholesterol levels. But the rest of their diet ismade up of taro root, which nourishes and protects their gut. And indeed, theKitavans have extremely low cholesterol levels.14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_14]TRIGLYCERIDES ARE THE REAL ENEMYI tell my patients that I don’t worry about their cholesterol levels, but I docare very much about their triglycerides. Consuming any sugar or simple starchwill raise triglycerides, and yes, that certainly includes fruit! Fructose, themain sugar in fruit, is actually a toxin that can directly injure cells anddisrupt mitochondrial function.15 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_15],16[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_16] To cope with it, your body sends most of it straightto your liver, where it is converted into triglycerides and uric acid. The restof it (about 30 percent) heads to your kidneys, where it acts as a direct toxinto your filtering system.17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_17] So why do we still thinkof fruit as a health food? It is healthy if it is eaten as it was meant tobe—during the summer, when it is fresh and in season and when we are in anatural growth cycle. When we ate fruit only during the summer, we could handleit in small doses because we then had nine months to detox before the nextgrowth cycle. Eating fruit year-round is terribly aging!Grains also raise triglyceride levels. Most people have heard of foie gras, thedecadent, extremely fatty duck or goose liver. Foie gras is produced byforce-feeding huge amounts of whole grains to those unfortunate animals. Theymake so many triglycerides in their livers that all the moving vans in the worldcan’t transport it away fast enough. So it builds up, and voilà—they get fattyliver! If you’ve been diagnosed with fatty liver or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), it’s likely that you developed the condition from eating “healthy” wholegrain goodness and washing it down with fructose-laden juices and fruits.“Well, okay, then,” you might say, “I’ll just go on a high-protein diet andavoid all those sugars and carbs.” Not so fast. Remember, too much protein isnot your friend. And in fact, eating protein also raises triglyceride levels.Believe it or not, you have no real storage system for protein. Your body needsprotein for maintenance of cell membranes and intracellular structures and whenyou are actively building muscle, but it converts any excess protein into sugar,because you do have a storage system for sugar. This process of convertingprotein into sugar is called gluconeogenesis. And if you make too much sugar,bingo!—you simply convert that into fat or triglycerides. This is why manypeople who turn to high-protein diets struggle with high triglyceride levels andinsulin resistance. The real trick is to avoid high triglycerides by avoidingthe consumption of excess animal protein and simple starches.Contrary to everything I was taught in medical school, heart disease is notcaused by high cholesterol levels, as Dr. DeBakey observed so long ago. It isthe result of an immune attack on the blood vessels, ultimately caused byproblems in the gut.It All Goes Back to the GutIt’s not just the heart; your gut buddies control all of your internal organsand capacities. For example, most people believe that alcohol causes cirrhosisof the liver, but in fact you can bathe the liver in alcohol all day long and itwill never develop cirrhosis. What alcohol in excess does cause is a leaky gutby directly damaging the gut wall, which in turn allows bad bugs and LPSs toenter the portal vein, which delivers them directly to the liver. The cops,called Kupffer cells (no, there won’t be a test later), are just waiting forthese troublemakers to arrive in the portal triads in the liver, and the battleensues. When I see elevated liver enzyme levels in a patient’s blood work, Iknow it is a sign of the liver soldiers that have died or been injured inbattle.18 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_18] Likewise, the scar tissue that signifiescirrhosis is really an end-stage sign of this inflammation.Similarly, obese men with fatty liver disease have elevated levels of zonulin intheir blood.19 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_19] Remember, zonulin breaks thejunctions between the cells lining your gut. So fatty liver disease is a resultof a breached gut wall allowing invaders access into your body. New researchshows an even stronger connection between fatty liver disease and the gut biome.Specific bad bugs increase susceptibility to fatty liver disease by stimulatinginflammation, making you more likely to develop cirrhosis and even liver cancer,while the right population of gut buddies can protect you from inflammation andreduce the severity of disease.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_20]If your gut wall is breached, invaders can stimulate dangerous inflammation atany vascular interface. I treat a handful of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, alung disease for which there is allegedly no cure. Pulmonary fibrosis is aninflammatory attack on the blood vessels of the lung. When we fix thosepatients’ guts, they experience tremendous turnarounds. One woman who first cameto see me while hooked up to an oxygen tank was later able to fly to Europe togo on a hiking trip without supplemental oxygen!Even hearing loss, another unpleasant “normal” side effect of aging, can behalted by addressing gut health. When researchers at Brigham and Women’sHospital examined the relationship between diet and the risk of developinghearing loss, they found that women who ate plenty of gut buddy–nourishing oliveoil, vegetables, nuts, and fish lowered their risk of developing moderate tosevere hearing loss by 30 percent.21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_21]It all goes back to the gut. When you stop eating for the 1 percenters and eatfor your gut buddies, they will start taking care of you!THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF CANCERBy now you understand that the diseases of aging stem from the same root causes:damage to the gut lining and bad bugs taking over your internal condoassociation. But you might think there is a notable exception to this rule:cancer.Well, I’ve got news for you: there are no exceptions to this rule. In fact, newresearch confirms that our microbiome plays an essential role in determiningwhether or not we’ll develop cancer and, if we do, how we will respond totreatment. When researchers at the University of Pennsylvania observed that aparticular form of cancer treatment was proving ineffective, they administered adose of antibiotics that eradicated a specific strain of microbes in thosepatients’ intestines (in other words, not a broad-spectrum antibiotic but atargeted one that spared the good microbes) and then reinstituted the cancertreatment. It’s probably not surprising to you by now to learn that once the badgut microbes were eliminated, the treatment became more efficient in killing thecancer cells.22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_22] Similar results have been achievedin animal studies: wiping out bad bugs with antibiotics leaves cancer-riddenmice with fewer and smaller tumors and reduces metastasis to the liver.23[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_23]We also know that patients with pancreatic cancer have remarkably similarmicrobiomes. It is so consistent that it’s been called “the pancreatic cancermicrobiome.”24 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_24] Even more intriguing, these patientshave particular strains of gut bacteria present in large amounts in theircancerous pancreases—there are even more of them in the pancreas than in the gutitself. After the bacteria are killed off, targeted immunotherapies become moreeffective at treating the cancer. This poses the question: What are thosebacteria doing in the pancreas in the first place? Is the pancreatic cancer asymptom of bad bugs slipping past a leaky gut and instigating an immune attackon the pancreas? That’s not what they taught me in medical school, but itcertainly doesn’t seem outside the realm of possibility.Again it goes back to the 365-days-a-year growth cycle in which we currentlylive that is so rich with opportunity for cancer cell growth. When yourmicrobiome and your cells’ energy sensor, mTOR, send the signal that food isplentiful and your cells should prioritize growth, there is no opportunity foryour body to take stock and prune any cells that look odd or dysfunctional. Thisis a deadly problem—literally—because we have abnormal cells all the time. It isnormal to have abnormal cells. What is not normal is constantly encouragingthose abnormal cells to grow by feeding them an endless abundance of energy (akafood). You absolutely must give your body a chance to reset and prune thoseabnormal cells by regularly but temporarily restricting your energy intake.Ironically, it’s restricting energy that allows your mitochondria to moreeffectively produce energy for your healthy, noncancerous cells. Right now, yourmitochondria are constantly working to produce energy from the molecules of foodsent to them by their gut buddy sisters. But it’s very difficult for them tokeep up. Remember, when you eat sugar or protein, your pancreas releases insulinto usher sugar into cells so it can be processed by your mitochondria. But ifeach cell’s receiving dock is already full, insulin has to put the extra sugarsomewhere—and it ends up being stored as fat for later use.This is a great system, but if you keep eating sugar, protein, or WGA (which, asyou read earlier, binds to those loading docks), your pancreas has to keepproducing more and more insulin to convert the sugar to fat. This is the rootcause of insulin resistance, but it also leads to excess glucose molecules thatare free for the taking. And guess who wants to take this sugar and use it togrow? Cancer cells. And guess what stimulates them to grow? Insulin! Insulin isanother growth hormone; it’s Miracle Grow to cancer cells.Many health enthusiasts try to “cheat” this system by cutting back on theirsugar consumption and encouraging their mitochondria to utilize stored fatinstead. As you read earlier, this process (called ketosis) is actually a moreefficient means of energy production for your mitochondria. So in essence it isa good idea, and I’m always in favor of a good cheat. But here’s the rub: yourmitochondria cannot process fat directly from your fat cells. Instead, you needan enzyme called hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to turn your stored fat intothis usable form of fat called a ketone.HSL is sensitive (hence the name) to insulin. It works only when your insulinlevels are low. When your insulin levels are chronically high, insulin blocksHSL from getting fat from your fat storage depots. And guess what? If you arefasting or reducing your carbohydrate consumption when insulin resistant, yourmitochondria sputter to a stop! Water, water everywhere, and not a drop todrink! This is why so many people who try a low-carb diet crash with thelow-carb “flu.”So when are your insulin levels low? When you are not eating any sugar orprotein! This is when your body allows you to finally dip into its fat storageand produce ketones to “feed” your mitochondria. But since sugar and proteinraise insulin levels, a high-protein diet frequently prevents your body frommaking ketones. This is a big problem with many mainstream “ketogenic” dietsthat aren’t really ketogenic at all because they promote excessive proteinconsumption, especially in the form of animal protein. This, unfortunately, isanother recipe for cancer cell growth.CANCER AND IMMUNITYRecall from earlier in this chapter that you have a sugar molecule called Neu5Aclining your blood vessels and your gut wall, while many of the animals we eathave a nearly molecularly identical sugar molecule called Neu5Gc that stimulatesan autoimmune attack against the lining of our blood vessels—including those inour heart. While this immune response leads to heart disease, it alsocontributes to cancer growth. As this immune attack is happening, it produces ahormone called vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF), which attracts bloodvessel growth to cancer cells. Then the very same tumor cells also use Neu5Gc toshield them from the cops so they can go unnoticed.Studies have shown that human tumors contain large amounts of Neu5Gc, eventhough our bodies cannot manufacture it—which clearly links the consumption ofanimal protein to the development of cancerous tumors. A recent study at theUniversity of Leeds offered further proof of this link: after tracking more than32,000 women over the course of seventeen years, researchers noted a significantincrease in the risk of colon cancer among women who ate red meat compared tothose who did not.25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_25]Mitochondria in cancer cells cannot utilize ketones to produce energy the wayyour healthy cells can.26 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_26] Remember, your bodyproduces ketones when insulin levels are low and sugar and protein are in shortsupply—during times of regression—and cancer cells thrive on sugar. Cancer cellsare also unwilling to utilize sugar molecules to produce energy the way regularcells do when insulin levels are high. Strangely, the mitochondria in cancercells create energy only through the extremely inefficient system of sugarfermentation. As a result, the average cancer cell needs up to eighteen times asmuch sugar to grow and divide as normal cells.27 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_27]It’s therefore very easy to starve cancer cells to death. They cannot grow andthrive without lots and lots of sugar.We have known that cancer cells thrive on sugar since the 1920s, when a Germanphysician named Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells have this unique—andtherefore vulnerable—type of energy metabolism, which won him the Nobel Prize.But we are now seeing for the first time that another type of cell has the samemetabolism—and therefore vulnerability—and that is none other than immune cells,the cops that patrol your body looking for invaders and often attack the wrongsuspects. Like cancer cells, immune cells cannot produce energy (and causeinflammation) when insulin levels are low, during times of regression,28[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_28] yet they thrive during a 365-day growth cycle.Is this proof of a connection between cancer and autoimmune disease, or does itmerely show that both illnesses are underpinned by the 365-day growth cycle thatis currently leading our health spans downhill? I’m not certain, but what I doknow is that when you limit sugar and animal protein consumption and trick yourbody into thinking it is in a period of regression with the Longevity Paradoxprogram, you reduce your risks of both cancer and autoimmune disease.Meanwhile, the standard Western diet promotes cancer growth at every turn.Cancer cells love the fructose in fruit, which as you read earlier we are meantto eat only in limited quantities at certain times of the year. Researchers atDuke University have demonstrated that colorectal cancer cells capitalize on thehigh levels of fructose often found in the liver and promote liver metastases.29[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_29] And a diet high in animal fat inhibits our naturaldefense mechanisms against cancer cells. Epithelial cells lining the surfaces oforgans have the ability to sense potentially malignant cells and remove themfrom their midst. But in one study, when mice were fed a high-fat diet that madethem obese, this defense mechanism was suppressed and the incidence of cancerincreased.30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_30]So once again, it’s time to start taking care of the 99 percenters so that youcan prevent cancer and heart disease and start aging in reverse. Here are somegood ways to do it.THE BEST FOODS FOR FIGHTING CANCERWhat can you eat to starve cancer cells without starving yourself? In additionto the Longevity Paradox program you’ll read about in detail later, there arecertain foods that have specific cancer-fighting properties. They include thefollowing.EXOGENOUS KETONESYou know that your body converts stored fat into ketones when your insulinlevels and sugar and protein intakes are low, but you can also consumealready-made ketogenic foods. Several plant fats contain ketogenic fats. Forexample, medium-chain triglycerides (found in MCT oil) can be nearly completelyconverted to ketones, which are the ideal fuel source for your mitochondria.Solid coconut oil (meaning it is solid below about 70 degrees) contains roughly65 percent MCTs, making it another good source for creating ketones, along withred palm oil, which comes from the date or fruit of the palm and is loaded withvitamin E’s tocopherols and tocotrienols and is made up of about 50 percentMCTs. But be wary, palm oil is not red palm oil, and palm oil production isassociated with deforestation.Butyrate, which, as you recall, your gut buddies produce when you treat themright, is a short-chain fatty acid present in small quantities in butter and isalso a source of making ketones. But because of the casein A1 in most Americandairy products, goat butter, buffalo butter, or ghee (clarified butter, whichdoes not contain protein) are better sources of this ketone precursor thanregular or even raw or grass-fed cow milk butter. And remember, sadly, thatthere isn’t much butyrate in butter.But no matter how many ketogenic fats you consume, exogenous ketones are bestused as an energy source when you are transitioning from a diet that is high insugar, protein, and fat (our Western diet) over to the Longevity Paradoxprogram. Consuming lots of extra ketones in the form of fats isn’t going to doyou much good if you’re still eating burgers and bagels. Remember, most of uswalk around daily with high insulin levels that block our ability to convert“love handles” and belly fat into ketones. These dietary ketogenic fat sourcescan prevent you from crashing during the transition, but you don’t need themlong term.NUTSNuts (particularly tree nuts) have amazing anticancer properties. In one recentstudy, researchers at Yale University looked at the rates of death and cancerrecurrence in patients with stage 3 colon cancer. The patients who ate two ormore servings of nuts a week had a 42 percent reduced rate of cancer recurrenceand a 57 percent reduced rate of death.31 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_31] That’sright—cancer patients who ate nuts only twice a week cut their risk of death bymore than half. That’s more effective than most common chemotherapeutic cancertreatments! Notably, there was no reduction in cancer recurrence or death inpatients who ate peanuts—not surprising to me (or you by now) because peanutsare a type of legume that is laden with lectins and not nuts at all. In fact, inanimal studies, the peanut lectin promotes colon cancer.32[Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_32]In another study, mice that were fed walnuts had less than half as many tumorsin their colons than mice that were not fed nuts.33 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_33]To find out why, researchers looked at the mice’s fecal samples and examined thebacteria living in their digestive tracts. They found that the gut microbiomesof the mice that had eaten walnuts were similar to one another and favoredbacterial communities that protected against colon cancer. In other words, themice’s gut buddies thrived and multiplied on a diet of walnuts and in returntook good care of their hosts.But it’s not just colon cancer. In yet another study, this one conducted by theNational Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where I was a researchfellow for two years, people who ate the highest quantities of nuts had a 26percent lower chance of developing lung cancer than people who ate very fewnuts. Amazingly, the benefits were even better for smokers! People who smokedregularly and ate large amounts of nuts had a 39 percent reduced rate of lungcancer compared to smokers who ate very few nuts.34 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_34]This suggests that the nuts actually protected those people from the negativeeffects of smoking. A systematic review showed that nut consumption isassociated with a lower risk not only of cancer but also of death from anycause35 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_35]—and not just by a little bit, either. In onestudy, women who ate large amounts of nuts reduced their risk of death from anycause by half.36 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_15_36]Why are nuts so effective at protecting against cancer? Remember, nuts areextremely low in methionine, the amino acid that mTOR is looking for to detectenergy availability. You can think of the presence of methionine as a sign thatyou are in a growth cycle. So eating nuts, which are low in methionine, sends asignal that you are in a period of regression, which helps you fight cancer inall the ways we’ve discussed. In addition, your butyrate-producing gut buddieslove nuts. And you now know that your mitochondria can use butyrate as a sourceof ketogenic fat! So nuts are really the perfect cancer-fighting food: theystarve cancer cells while supercharging your gut buddies and their sisters, yourmitochondria.On the Longevity Paradox program you’ll be eating plenty of healthy,cancer-fighting nuts, including: * Walnuts * Macadamia nuts * Pistachios * Pine nuts * Hazelnuts * ChestnutsWhether we’re talking about avoiding heart disease, pulmonary fibrosis, hearingloss, or cancer, the health of your gut influences the health of your entirebody. Moreover, the same factors that cause these common diseases of “aging”also cause the other symptoms of aging that we consider “normal”: cognitivedecline, loss of muscle, joint pain, and rapidly aging skin. In fact, I haveseen as a heart surgeon that there is a clear link between heart disease andarthritis. That leads me to the next area of regeneration: the muscles, joints,and bones that you are going to learn how to use to dance your way into old age."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5DANCE YOUR WAY INTO OLD AGE [nav.xhtml#nch9]I first became aware of the connection between arthritis and heart disease backwhen I was performing heart surgeries at Loma Linda University. Within fiveyears of undergoing a stent placement or coronary bypass, half of my patientswould be back in the operating room for a hip or knee replacement. Amazingly,the opposite was also true: half of the people who came in for jointreplacements would be back within five years for a stent or coronary bypass! Istarted to wonder if the same process that produced arthritis could also becausing coronary heart disease.There were other clues, too. Because the heart is located right in front of thespinal column, when I looked at a patient’s coronary angiogram (basically anX-ray of the heart arteries), I could see all of the vertebral bodies lined upbehind the heart on the scan. Early in my career, I noticed that all of mypatients with coronary artery disease—no matter how old or young they were—hadpretty impressive levels of arthritis in their spines. I thought that wasinteresting, but my colleagues seemed to attribute it to the fact that themajority of these patients were old. It was just a coincidence that they hadboth heart disease and arthritis in their spines.But when I started to see people in their thirties and forties with both heartdisease and arthritis in their spines, I knew there was something else going on.I’ll never forget one patient—I’ll call her Angela—who was in her early fortiesand had a devastating case of coronary artery disease. When I operated onAngela, I found that some of her blood vessels were so calcified that I couldn’teven put bypass grafts on them. Angela also had horrible spinal arthritis. Butafter her heart surgery, she became a devoted patient and began following myLongevity Paradox program to the letter.Ten years later, Angela was admitted to our hospital with a terrible case offood poisoning with abdominal and chest pain. Because she had a history of heartdisease, the cardiologist on call performed an angiogram to make sure her heartwas doing okay. It showed that her heart was actually doing better than okay;one of her blood vessels that had previously been so calcified and so completelyclosed that I couldn’t operate on it had opened up on its own! Angela now hadblood flow where she had had none ten years earlier. Even more striking, theangiogram showed that the extensive arthritis in her spine was completely gone.Impossible, you say? This is the type of turnaround I see all the time in mypatients who follow this protocol to the letter. And it’s the same turnaround Iexperienced myself! As I mentioned earlier, I used to have such bad arthritisthat I had to wear braces on my knees when I ran. After following my ownprotocol, that arthritis is history. When you make your gut buddies happy, theywill renovate—and that means regenerate—every part of their home.WHAT REALLY CAUSES WEAR AND TEARFor years, we believed that arthritis was caused simply by “wear and tear”: theolder you get, the more you use your joints, and eventually they just get wornout. But your joints don’t come with a “use by” date. The most recent researchconfirms that arthritis is caused not by overuse but rather by bad bugs in thegut creating inflammation. It’s that inflammation that “wears and tears” yourjoints, not aging itself. For instance, when mice with arthritis are givensupplements of beneficial bacteria, their systemic inflammation decreases andthe breakdown in cartilage in their poor arthritic mouse knees slows down.1[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_1]It’s actually very simple: the combination of bad bugs and a leaky gut releaseslectins and LPSs into your body. Lectins bind onto the sugar molecules on yourjoint surfaces called scialic acid and act like splinters, prompting an immuneattack and inflammation that leads to arthritis (and pretty much every otherproblem that we associate with aging).2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_2] Picture thered swollen area under your skin when you get a splinter; now imagine that goingon inside your joints. Get the picture? Those LPSs make their way into yourjoints as well and incite the same response.3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_3]Remember, your cops view LPSs as real bacteria and attack. Amazingly, when weuse a needle to draw fluid from an arthritic joint, we find LPSs in the fluid!So does the wear-and-tear theory relate to what’s really happening? In a strangeway, it does. Bear with me while I get a little science nerdy here. Thecartilage that lines your joints is constantly being remade by groups of cellscalled chondrocytes and chondroblasts. (You have similar cells that do this foryour bones.) During the war in your joints, cartilage is destroyed and regrown,but this occurs unevenly, resulting in literal peaks and valleys of cartilage.The result is a sandpaper-like lining of your joints. No wonder the surgeontells you that your joint is “bone on bone.”Is all lost at this point? Not in the least. Your gut buddies can come to therescue at any time. They can reinforce the gut barrier, prevent lectin and LPSintrusion, and enable us to heal. Those chondrocytes are still there in your“bone on bone” joints and can grow a new articular surface. This recentlyhappened to a patient of mine named Jerry, who was 67 and planned to have hisright knee replaced. He came to me for other reasons including diabetes, highblood pressure, and—you guessed it—heart disease. His orthopedic surgeon neededcardiac clearance for the operation. Jerry passed the stress test that Iperformed but was intrigued by the findings on his blood tests. He had sixmonths before the surgery and agreed to follow the Longevity Paradox programwhile he waited.The last time I saw Jerry, he was twenty pounds lighter, no longer diabetic, andno longer taking high blood pressure meds. Great news, indeed! But as we werecelebrating, the talk turned to his upcoming knee replacement. “Oh, that,” hesaid. “I canceled it. Why get an operation when my knee doesn’t hurt anymore?”With that, he hopped off the exam table and skipped around the room to prove hispoint.Like Jerry, when my arthritic patients come to see me, they are rarely sufferingfrom only one disease of aging because all diseases of aging stem from the sameroot cause. In fact, when they first come in, even my “healthiest” patients areon an average of seven medications that are actually making the root problemworse! Many arthritic patients take over-the-counter nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve the pain and inflammation. Theproblem, as you already know, is that these drugs blow holes in the gut barrier,making it far more vulnerable to invaders. This all too often becomes a viciouscycle of more pain and inflammation, more drugs, more damage to the gut barrier,more pain and inflammation, and so on and so on until their bodies arecompletely wracked with disease.To break this cycle, you need to heal your gut wall and nourish your gutbuddies. This will quell inflammation and enable you to stop taking NSAIDs orother pain medications. One of the critical steps in this process is to removefoods containing WGA from your diet. As you recall, WGA is small enough to slippast the gut barrier even if it is intact. WGA is found in the wheat bran, so itis in all whole wheat and whole grain products, including pasta, bread, andcrackers, as well as bulgur (cracked wheat), rye, barley, and brown rice.4[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_4]You may have previously been told that all of these foods are healthy, but I amasking you to start thinking differently for the sake of your long and healthylife. I have seen countless patients grow sicker and sicker the “healthier” theyate, including yours truly. Yet when they adopt my Longevity Paradox program,their bodies begin to rejuvenate. Yes, it is wonderful that we have developedartificial joints that you can turn to when yours give out, just as I amgrateful for the surgical interventions that have sustained the hearts of manyof my patients. But there is another way, one that will enable you to avoidthese interventions entirely as you skip through your long and joyful old age.KEEP YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES STRONG, HEALTHY, AND HUNGRYIt’s not just arthritis that leaves so many elders with limited or painfulmobility. Years of chronic inflammation also cause our bones to deteriorate. Theresult is osteopenia (invisible bone loss) and osteoporosis (a condition inwhich bones become weak and brittle). This is a health crisis among the elderly.The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates that 54 million Americans haveosteoporosis and that approximately one in two women and one in four men aged 50and older will break a bone due to osteoporosis.But humans aren’t the only animals that are suffering from osteoporosis inincreasing numbers, and that’s because, sadly, we’re not the only ones eating ahighly inflammatory diet that kills off our gut buddies and allows bad bugs toflourish.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_5] In experimental studies, LPSs haveproduced osteoporosis in mice. Chickens in factory farms that are fedgenetically modified corn develop osteoporosis at alarming rates. Ninety percentof commercially raised birds have a detectable gait abnormality due to bonedefects, and more than 10 percent die prematurely due to lameness (inability towalk). Think about that the next time you eat a “healthy” chicken breast. Thatchicken likely had bone defects due to her diet,6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_6] andwhen you consume the meat you are also consuming the inflammatory feed that willcontribute to your own bone deterioration.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_7] On theother hand, postmenopausal women who eat a diet high in gut buddy–nourishingnuts, vegetables, and olive oil have higher bone density along with lower riskof heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_8]But perhaps the greatest risk to our musculoskeletal systems as we age isinvisible muscle loss. This often happens over time even if we are not aware ofit. If you compare side-by-side CAT scans of patients’ thighs, first when theywere teenagers and then later when they are 40 years old, the scans will looklike a cross section of a large round steak because that’s what a round steakis—the cow’s thigh. In the earlier scans, they show a large amount of muscleswith the bone in the middle. Looking at the same thigh years later, the volumeis the same, but the composition is quite different. On average, a 40-year-old’sthighs have half the muscle mass of the teenager’s. So how does the overallthigh have the same volume? The other half of the muscle mass has been replacedby fat. That’s what we call marbling on a good steak, but unless you aregrooming yourself to be devoured as a tasty meal, marbling is not a desirablequality. And where did that cow’s marbling come from? Its corn-, wheat-, andsoybean-based diet. Where does it come from in the human subjects? The sameplace.This means that even if you’re one of the lucky people who has managed to staythe same exact size as you’ve gotten older, it’s entirely possible that you’vestill lost a good amount of muscle mass and gained a lot of fat. This is anotherparadox, and I see it firsthand all the time when my patients start losingweight and realize they’re all flab! They were fooled into thinking they had thesame body composition as they did when they were younger because they were thesame “size.”Let’s take a moment to look at how muscles grow. It helps to think of yourmuscles as the customer base for insulin, a door-to-door salesman selling apopular product, sugar. When you eat sugar (or protein, which is converted intosugar), insulin goes around to your muscles, knocking on doors and asking “Hey,is anybody hungry?” If the muscles are hungry, they say, “Yes,” and they “eat”the sugar. In this case, insulin has an easy job and can knock on plenty ofdoors throughout one workday. But there are a couple of things that can make thejob more difficult for our friendly salesman. The first is if your musclesaren’t hungry and they send him away before he can make the sale. The second isif WGA (remember, WGA can get through your gut wall even without a leaky gut) isin the body mimicking insulin.When either of these things happens, insulin reports back to headquarters thatit needs support from a bigger sales force. Your body quickly produces moreinsulin to help make the sale. But if your muscles still aren’t hungry and/orWGA is blocking insulin receptors on your muscle cells, your muscles aren’tgoing to buy that sugar no matter how many salespeople pound on their doors.What’s worse, your sales force is blocked by WGA, so sugar can’t get in to feedyour muscles what they need and they literally waste away. Finally, insulingives up so it can finish its workday. But first it has to do something with allof that excess product. So it converts the extra sugar into fat by turning onlipoprotein lipase (yeah, I know, I promised no tests), hoping that one day yourmuscles will be hungrier and it’ll finally be able to make the sale.When this process unfolds consistently over months, years, and decades, thecumulative effect on your body is more fat storage and loss of muscle mass. Andvoilà—we have CAT scans clearly showing more fat and less muscle on thesame-sized thigh. Remember, the second scans were taken when the patients were40. Imagine what their scans will look like in twenty more years if they don’tdo something. In fact, I see it all the time in older patients when they firstvisit me. So many of them suffer from sarcopenia, a severe loss of muscle mass.This is a twofold issue, one of insulin resistance and one stemming from thegut.Remember that tennis court–sized surface area you have in your gut to absorbprotein? Well, after decades of lectins and NSAIDs and bad microbes attackingit, it’s now the surface area of a Ping-Pong table. And remember that acid youneed in your stomach but can no longer produce because you’ve been taking protonpump inhibitors (PPIs)? No acid, no protein digestion, and now your Ping-Pongtable has literally nothing to absorb. There goes your muscle.So what can you do to make your muscles hungrier? You’ve probably alreadyguessed that the answer is exercise—specifically, strength-training exercisesthat grow muscle mass. When you exercise your muscles, they get hungry and startscreaming for food. This makes it easy for insulin to sell them sugar instead ofstoring it as fat. Your insulin level decreases because the salespeople don’tneed as much backup, and your fat mass is reduced. The more your muscle massincreases over time, the larger the customer base grows for the insulinsalesman. He wants all that business for himself, so he reports to headquartersthat he’s got this. And you reap the rewards with heightened insulinsensitivity, larger muscle mass, and less fat. But remember this caveat: eatinglectins and WGA and popping acid reducers can undo much of the benefit conferredby strength training.This coincides with another myth about aging: that we age because as we getolder we have fewer mitochondria creating energy for our cells. Many of mycolleagues believe this is the case because they observe fewer mitochondria inthe elderly. But just as reduced muscle mass is a cause of aging rather than aresult, so is a reduction in mitochondria.Your mitochondria have their own DNA (part of the 99 percent) that divides whencell division takes place separately from the division of your DNA (the 1percent) in the cell’s nucleus. As you read earlier, when your gut buddies sendtheir sisters a signal, your mitochondria divide, even if the cell they supportisn’t dividing. The result is that you have additional mitochondria to extractmore and more energy out of what they expect will be less and less availablefood. Your mitochondria also divide when you are building muscle and need energyto power them.So we see that two types of stress (calorie restriction and exercise) cause youto turbocharge your cells with more mitochondria. But as they get older, mostpeople don’t restrict calories, use intermittent fasting, or do much strengthtraining. The result is less muscle mass and fewer mitochondria for most olderpeople—but this is not inevitable. Slightly stressed cells and hungry muscleswill lead to more mitochondria, lower insulin levels, more muscle mass, andoverall better health for many years to come.No matter how old you are, it’s never too late to reap the benefits of exercise,but those who start exercising when they’re young do have a head start. Onestudy showed that women who exercised at least three times a week as teenagersexperienced significantly less height loss (which really means bone loss) aftermenopause than their peers who did not exercise.9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_9] Andwhat pulls on bones, keeping them strong as you age? You got it, muscles!Stronger muscles, stronger bones. The clear message is to start exercising now,no matter how old you are.USE IT OR LOSE ITAs we get older, it’s all too easy to convince ourselves that it’s okay toexercise less and allow a sedentary lifestyle to creep in. This is what oursociety deems normal, but the truth is that we have it completely backward. Asedentary lifestyle is what causes us to age! People who continue to exercisewell into their ripe old age live longer and stay healthier than those who stopmoving and allow their muscles to waste away.10 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_10]My great-grandmother lived actively until the month before her 100th birthday,and until her death she lived in a bedroom on the third floor of her house.Every day, she walked up and down those three flights of stairs multiple times.As a young boy, I thought she was nuts, but now I see that she was actuallyincredibly wise. Looking back, she reminds me of those centenarians in the BlueZones, which happen to be mostly in hilly areas. The residents of the Blue Zoneswalk up and down those hills long into their old age, maintaining muscle massand dexterity for decades longer than most Americans do.Both of these examples speak to the importance of working against gravity whenexercising. This stresses, and therefore strengthens, more muscles. Hiking,walking up and down hills and stairs, and doing squats and push-ups are allexamples of exercises that force you to work against gravity.If you’re worried that you’re too out of shape to hike uphill, have no fear.When I was in France a few years ago for a conference, I saw a fascinating studythat had been performed in Switzerland by a group of exercise physiologists whowere curious about the effects of vigorous climbing on muscle mass development.(Luckily, there were plenty of mountains in Switzerland to test their thesison.) They split participants in their study into two groups: one group hiked tothe top of a steep hill, where a cable car was waiting to bring them back down.The second group rode the cable car up and hiked down. Everyone wanted tovolunteer for the second group, right? The study organizers’ premise was thatthe uphill hikers would see greater benefits, but they were wrong. Both groupshad the exact same results, while the group that hiked uphill perceived thatthey’d made a greater effort. When you walk downhill, you’re still workingagainst gravity, and your muscles are stressed from constantly having to put onthe brakes.Like my great-grandmother, the people in the Blue Zones stay active because theylack many modern conveniences. I’m old enough to remember what life was likebefore we had electric garage door openers, snowblowers, or even a remotecontrol for the TV. (Although, because I practice what I preach, I like to thinkI look too young to remember such a time!) We had to get out of the car to openthe garage door and use our muscles to shovel the snow. As a boy, I had to getup and walk across the room to change the TV channel! And yes, I did walk to andfrom school (in a foot of snow, in pouring rain, for miles and miles, blah,blah, blah). These may seem like minor things, but they add up to make a bigdifference in the way we live and the way we age. It’s no coincidence that mostof the world’s longest-lived people lack modern conveniences. They have nochoice but to use their muscles as they age, and as a result they age moreslowly.Yet in the West we expect to grow infirm, so we set up our lives to avoid havingto use our muscles even when we still can. This becomes a self-fulfillingprophecy. I’ve seen so many still-nimble folks buy a one-story home or movetheir bedroom down to the first floor to avoid having to climb the stairs inanticipation of getting older and not being able to climb the stairs. And guesswhat happens when these people get out of the habit of climbing stairs? Theygrow infirm, just as they predicted!The idea that there is a certain age at which we have to grow old and infirm iscompletely crazy to me. And it’s simply not true. Just look at the older peoplein Australia who were asked to participate in a “ballet for seniors” class andended up with better flexibility, improved posture, more energy, and an overallincreased sense of well-being.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_11] Or ask RobertMarchand, the 107-year-old French amateur cyclist. Researchers have studied hisphysiology and seen that he is indeed getting fitter as he ages.12[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_12]That’s not the only thing that caught my eye when I first read about Mr.Marchand. He is five feet tall and very wiry, which is consistent witheverything you’ve read so far about how disastrous a 365-day growth cycle is forsuccessful aging and that the small shall inherit the earth in their ripe oldage. Also of note, he did not exercise regularly for most of his life. It wasonly after he retired that he began cycling—the opposite of most people, whobegin slowing down as soon as they hit retirement age. (They call Palm Springs,where I live, “God’s waiting room” for a reason!) Years later, at 107, Mr.Marchand takes no medications and has the aerobic capacity of a healthy50-year-old.It is truly never too late to start building muscle and enhancing your healthspan and longevity. This doesn’t mean that you have to spend hours at the gym.I’ll share an exercise plan in chapter 10 [Chapter_10_The_Longevity_.xhtml] thatis simple, quick, and accessible for anyone of any age at any fitness level. Butfirst let’s take a closer look at what exercise does for the body in addition tothe important job of making your muscles hungry.Exercise is another perfect example of hormesis—limited stress you put on yourbody to make yourself stronger. Like other examples of hormetic stressors suchas calorie restriction, exercise stimulates autophagy, the recycling of old,worn-out cellular components, and a similar process called the unfolded proteinresponse (UPR). In the case of UPR, the cell degrades dysfunctional (misfolded)proteins, restoring the health of the cell.While exercise stimulates both autophagy and UPR, there is evidence that thebenefits of autophagy are stronger the earlier you start building muscle. In onestudy, a group of young men in their late twenties and a group of older men intheir sixties—all of whom had not previously exercised—took up a resistancetraining protocol. Both groups saw an increase in UPR for forty-eight hoursafter each resistance training session, but only the group of younger men alsosaw an increase in autophagy for forty-eight hours after each session.13[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_13] It’s never too late to see benefits of exercise, butthe earlier you can get started, the better. As model and actress Agyness Deynis fond of saying, “If you want to stay young, then you better get startedearly!”This effect on autophagy and UPR explains why exercise has been shown tominimize the risk of cancer. When left to their own devices, worn-out cellularcomponents and misfolded proteins can cause faulty information in cells,prompting cancerous changes. Rejuvenating the cells through autophagy and UPRhelps keep you young and cancer free. It also allows your cells to heal after atrauma, even a heart attack. In a study on mice, exercise was actually shown toproduce new heart muscle cells. This was true of healthy mice as well as thosethat had previously suffered heart damage. Indeed, one reason exercise is sobeneficial is that it increases the heart’s ability to regenerate.14[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_14]Regular exercise also dramatically reduces your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Astudy from 201815 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_15] showed that women who werephysically fit at middle age were a whopping 90 percent less likely to developAlzheimer’s disease even decades later. The few fit women who participated inthe study and did eventually develop Alzheimer’s did so an average of elevenyears later than women who did not exercise, at the age of 90 compared to 79.Now listen up, my female readers. As my good friend Maria Shriver and I bothknow, Alzheimer’s disproportionally affects women, and the cure is prevention,not a long-sought-after but not-yet-discovered drug. Imagine that you read aheadline saying that taking a “drug” would prevent 90 percent of all Alzheimer’sdisease if the treatment is started early. How much would you pay for it? Well,that drug is a combination of exercise and, as you’ll soon learn, simple choicesin food. Another study examined the effects of exercise on patients withearly-stage Alzheimer’s and found that it improved memory performance and evenreduced atrophy of the hippocampus, the memory centers of the brain.16[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_16] We also know that exercise that uses the legs inparticular stimulates brain cells, keeping you alert and healthy long into oldage.17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_17]Remember “Michelle”? I have no doubt that walking her Pomeranian (in her highheels!) multiple times a day helped her stay sharp well into her ripe old age.Meanwhile, “brain training” apps that claim to help you improve your brainactually do nothing for working memory or IQ.18 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_18] Soskip the games and go out for a walk instead.Exercise also has a powerful effect on the immune system. After heavy exercise,antioxidant defense systems are amplified throughout the body.19[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_19] This means that exercise causes you to produce moreof the enzymes that support cellular and mitochondrial function. Exercise alsohelps prevent heart disease, which many of my colleagues attribute to the factthat it reduces inflammation.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_20] But you can probablyalready guess that I attribute it to (drumroll, please) its effects on your gutbiome.That’s right—exercise changes the microbiome. Your gut buddies like it when youexercise, so when you do it, they freshen up their house for you.21[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_21] Mice that exercise have significantly higher amountsof a specific type of good gut bacteria (called Firmicutes) than sedentary micethat are fed the same diet,22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_22] and studies on humansshow that exercise increases gut bacteria richness and diversity.23[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_23] Perhaps most intriguing, one study showed that ratsthat exercised produced more butyrate than rats that did not, all else beingequal.24 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_24]Remember, butyrate protects your gut lining so it is better at keeping outinvaders while simultaneously giving your mitochondria their preferred foodsource. Does this mean that exercise really reduces your risk of cancer,arthritis, and heart disease, all by bolstering your gut wall and yourmicrobiome? I believe the answer is yes. As you’ve likely heard, exercise alsoboosts feelings of happiness due to a release of endorphins, the feel-goodhormones.25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_25] Don’t forget what creates those hormonalsignals for you when you take care of them—your gut buddies, of course! A recentreport from the Harvard Medical School stated that for some adults strugglingwith depression, regular exercise works as well as prescriptionantidepressants.26 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_26]Now, you couch potatoes (wait a minute, you’re not still eating potatoes, areyou?), don’t despair. While the research is clear that exercise is an essentialcomponent of your longevity plan, even short bouts of the right kind of exercisecan dramatically improve both your life and health span. In fact, the planyou’ll find in chapter 10 [Chapter_10_The_Longevity_.xhtml] is actually farbetter for you than spending hours at the gym. This is yet another paradox: alittle bit of exercise is essential, but too much of it has the exact oppositeeffect.CHRONIC CARDIO = CHRONIC STRESSLike everything else in life, there is such a thing as too much when it comes toexercise, especially cardiovascular exercise such as running. Our ancestors ranonly when they needed to avoid becoming someone else’s meal, but somehow we havegotten the idea from faulty calorie math and a misunderstanding of howmetabolism actually works that we need to run for several miles at a time orspin, step, or aerobicize for hours on end, all in the name of being healthy.The calories-in/calories-out rule died a horrible death years ago with thediscovery of the microbiome and the calories they eat. But the Internet andsocial media won’t let the notion go. The result is that you blame yourself foryour unused gym membership.27 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_27]The long-lived people in the Blue Zones would laugh their heads off at thatidea. Back in the 1970s, at the beginning of the jogging craze, researchersinterviewed the Kalahari Bushmen in Africa, who are legendary long-distancewalkers. They walk between twenty and thirty miles a day during hunting season.When asked about the possibility of running twenty-six miles, they thought sucha proposition was ridiculous. They explained that it wouldn’t be worth theeffort to run after an animal for twenty-six miles because they’d probably burnmore calories than the animal contained. And if an animal was chasing you, itwould catch up with you long before mile twenty-six. In fact, evolutionarybiology proves that you will adjust your caloric burn regardless (or in spiteof) your exercise program.28 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_28]Short bursts of speed were useful to early humans when we needed to catch awounded animal or sprint to the nearest tree to avoid being gored by a wildboar. Other than occasional sprints, however, slow and steady has always won therace. Just look at the body composition of sprinters who compete in thehundred-yard dash—they are muscle-bound, with the exact body type that lendsitself to extreme longevity. As I’ve written previously, chronic marathonersoften look as though they are suffering from cancer, and their immune systemsare suffering as well.Besides sprinting, our ancestors’ main forms of exercise were walking as theylooked for food, and then carrying what they found back to a central location.Replicating these types of movement will give you the greatest longevitybenefits. Blue Zone residents are all hikers and walkers, not long-distancerunners. And running marathons impairs your immune system. A paper appearing inSports Medicine in 2007 confirmed this sad news.29 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_29]I’ll stick to hiking and jogging my four dogs for three miles a day, thank you,instead of running my former 10K and half marathons.There is plenty of evidence that acute endurance exercise (such as marathonrunning, which causes you to lose muscle mass dramatically) has a disastrouseffect on longevity. Pretty much every research paper that’s ever been publishedon long-distance running shows that it causes myocardial fibrosis, progressivescarring of the heart muscle.30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_30] It actually damagesthe heart by killing heart cells, particularly in the right ventricle. I seethis in my patients who have been or currently are long-distance runners all thetime. The more you run, the more scarring you produce, and this eventually leadsto arrhythmias or even congestive heart failure. Though temporary stress haspositive effects, long-distance running places too much stress on your heart fortoo long.In fact, the exact benefits of moderate exercise are actually negated by intenseexercise. Exhaustive exercise, exercising to perceived exhaustion, causesoxidative stress by creating free radicals (which as you read earlier are highlyreactive uncharged molecules that cause aging), while moderate exercisestimulates an antioxidant effect that protects your body from the oxidativestress caused by those free radicals.31 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_31],32[Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_32] And here’s the kicker: endurance exercise such asrunning long distances leads to gut permeability.33 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_16_33]Bear with me for a quick sidetrack here. I’m old enough to remember not beingallowed to swim for an hour after I ate because I’d allegedly develop cramps anddrown. My mother actually set a timer for an hour, and I’d sit there eagerlywatching the minutes tick by until I was allowed to swim. The digestion processrequires huge amounts of blood flow, so after you eat, your blood is diverted toyour gut instead of flowing to your muscles and brain. The theory was that ifyou swam, you’d get cramps from lactic acid buildup (as a result of lack ofblood flow) and drown. This has largely been written off as an old wives’ tale,but there is actually some truth to it. Blood does flow to your gut after youeat. During long-distance runs, the opposite happens: so much blood flows toyour muscles and away from your gut that you actually experience ischemia(inadequate blood flow) in the gut. This causes gut permeability, and lectins,LPSs, and bacteria pour into your body. This is precisely why your immune systemtanks for about two weeks after an endurance run. And as any runner knows, yourdigestion gets messed up by long-distance running—a clear sign that your gut isnot happy!I realize that die-hard runners are reluctant to part with their favoritepastime. I used to love running, too, and my wife, Penny, was a passionatemarathon runner, qualifying for and finishing the 100th running of the BostonMarathon, until she took a long, hard look at the data. At that point, she couldno longer deny the negative effects of her hobby, and she hung up her runningshoes for good. She believes (and I wholeheartedly agree) that it was more thanworth it to shorten her marathon-running career in order to lengthen her life.And get this: while running, she had osteopenia (loss of bone density) and wasconstantly getting colds. Now those signs and symptoms of overexercising are adistant memory.But what good is a long life if you can’t remember it? This leads us to the nextchapter [Chapter_6_Remember_Your_O.xhtml], where we’ll look at some simpletechniques for improving your brain health so that you can stay sharp as a tacklong into your retirement. Surprise, surprise, even this aspect of yourlongevity relies on your gut buddies to keep you young."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6REMEMBER YOUR OLD AGE [nav.xhtml#nch10]As you get older, things start to slip. You misplace your car keys, grasp forwords, and forget the name of your longtime neighbor. Your brain feels foggy,and you’re just not as sharp as you used to be. That’s just the way life goes,right?Wrong. Though we think of these symptoms as a normal part of aging, nothingabout them is normal. From those seemingly innocuous “senior moments” to moreserious neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, andAlzheimer’s disease, all cognitive decline stems from the same root cause:neuroinflammation. And where does inflammation start? In the gut.But the gut is also where you can put an end to inflammation so that you willstay smart and alert for the rest of your long life. Recent research revealsthat you do not need to experience cognitive decline as you age—period, end ofstory. You have the ability to birth new neurons (in a process calledneurogenesis) at any time, meaning there is no expiration date on your abilityto learn new skills or grow your cognitive abilities.In 2018, researchers at Columbia University and the New York State PsychiatricInstitute looked at the brain scans of healthy people ranging from 14 to 79years old, the latter well past the age that most of us consider our primelearning years. They found that the oldest participants in the study had thesame amount of the raw materials needed to create new brain cells, or neurons,as the youngest.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_1] So no matter how old you are, youcan make just as many new brain cells as a teenager! What’s more, older adultscan improve their capacity to learn new skills and retain memory, particularlytheir language skills, with increased physical fitness.2[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_2] This means that the fitter you are, the fewer ofthose “tip of the tongue” moments you’ll experience when you struggle to thinkof the right word or name.These results offer a lot of hope that you can remain as sharp as ever well intoyour old age—as long as your gut buddies are motivated to keep you that way.THE BRAIN IN YOUR HEAD IS ACTUALLY YOUR SECOND BRAINThere is now so much evidence of the direct connection between gut microbes andthe brain that many of my colleagues have begun referring to the gut as the“second brain.” I disagree—not with the direct relationship between the two butrather with the gut being relegated to second place. The gut actually controlsthe brain in your head, which you might want to start thinking of as your secondbrain.You already know that your gut buddies send hormonal signals or text messages totheir sisters, your mitochondria, including the ones in your brain. These textmessages travel “wirelessly” via your bloodstream and lymph system. But your guthas another old-school way of sending messages to the “second brain” in yourhead. The gut and brain communicate via the vagus nerve, which is the longestnerve of the autonomic nervous system and is equivalent to the landline or cablesystem in your home. The vagus nerve controls most of your autonomic(unconscious) bodily functions, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, digestion,and so on. The vagus nerve runs between the gut and the brain, snaking aroundthe various organs in your body along the way.When one part of your body needs to communicate with another, it makes a callalong this landline to send the message. For many years, we all believed thatthe vagus nerve existed for the brain (the one in your head) to communicate withand give orders to the rest of the body, including the gut. That was what I wastaught in medical school and believed for much of my career. But we now knowthat it is actually the other way around: for every nerve fiber leading from thebrain in your head to your heart, lungs, and your gut, there are nine nervefibers leading to the brain from the latter. There is therefore nine times asmuch communication going from the gut to the brain than there is going in theopposite direction.To put it simply: your gut buddies are the ones making the calls. Not only that,but there are actually more neurons lining your gut to receive and interpretthese messages than there are in your entire spinal cord. The 99 percenters aretruly in charge of the way you act, think, and even feel. You female readerswill recognize that “gut sense” you are so wisely conscious of. This is trulyyour sixth sense, the interpretation and integration of what is happening inyour inner world, or the other you. Just to refresh your memory (this is thememory chapter, after all), both your gut bugs and the mitochondria that poweryour neurons were inherited from your mother. The sisters are alwaystalking . . .Gut sense works like any of your other senses. Your eyes, for example, arestimulated by photons of light that are converted into electrical signals thattravel along the optic nerve to the back of your brain, where those signals arereassembled into the pixels that you “see.” Similarly, sound waves vibrate tinyhairs in your ears, and, well, you get the idea. But unlike your other senses,which use cable or hard wires, your sixth sense uses not only the vagus nervebut also hormonal “cellular” systems to communicate.With your gut buddies making so many calls to your brain, anytime the gut liningis breached and/or invaders sneak through this barrier and into your body,multiple chemical text messages are sent very quickly throughout yourbloodstream and lymph system. As you learned earlier, the text messages arecalled cytokines, and the ones that alert the immune system and high commandthat an imminent threat or actual attack exists are called inflammatorycytokines. Over the last ten years, sophisticated blood tests have allowed me tomeasure these cytokines in my patients’ blood every three months. As I reportedat the American Heart Association,3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_3] thesemeasurements first opened the window on how often lectins and LPSs routinelybreach the gut wall defenses and both prompt local inflammation in your gut andinvite the same inflammation into structures such as your heart, your joints,and your brain.Inflammation in the brain (which is called neuroinflammation) is terriblydamaging. This is reflected in the latest research, which shows that gutmicrobe–driven neuroinflammation results in the collateral damage of neuronsthat your brain immune system is sworn to protect and causes the cognitivedecline that we think of as a normal part of aging. Neuroinflammation is nowrecognized as the true cause of the serious degenerative diseases such asParkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia.The connection between neuroinflammation and cognitive decline—and evendegenerative disease—is so strong that my colleague Patrick McGeer has begunexperimenting with administering low-dose anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)to people who are at risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. Though his studiesare promising, I worry about the long-term effects of NSAIDs on the gut barrierand prefer a protocol that will reduce inflammation at its source—the gut.KEEP TROOPS AT THE OUTPOSTResearch on mice clearly shows that certain changes to the microbiome lead toneuroinflammation and therefore cognitive decline. In one study, when aged micewere given an abundance of one type of bad bugs (from the Porphyromonadaceaefamily), they developed gut permeability and inflammation, and that led thosepoor old mice to have problems with spatial memory and an increase inanxiety-like behaviors.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_4]Even in humans, we can see how specific bacterial populations contribute toAlzheimer’s disease. When my colleagues looked at the gut biomes of patients whowere cognitively impaired and compared them to the bacteria in patients withoutsuch impairments, they found that the cognitively impaired group had anabundance of proinflammatory bad bugs (Escherichia and Shigella) and a reductionin anti-inflammatory gut buddies (E. rectale).5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_5]Once again, over time, bad gut microbes, combined with the lectins you eat andtheir leakage through the gut wall with LPSs, break down the gut wall and setoff an immune response that creates systemic inflammation.6[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_6] These invaders are directly implicated inneuroinflammation and neurological disease. The neurons in the brain produceessential neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which stimulates neurons, andgamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which calms neurons down. Dopamine has the loftyjob of regulating emotions, moods, and muscle movements, as well as sensationsof pleasure and pain. Dysfunction of this critical neurotransmitter lays thegroundwork for a number of diseases, most notably Parkinson’s disease.Neurons have long, spindly structures—axons and dendrites—that extend out fromthe cell body. The axons send messages to other neurons, and the dendritesreceive messages from other neurons. Your neurons use these structures to createneural networks, and communication among these networks controls most of yourthoughts, actions, and even movements.What does this have to do with inflammation? Bear with me for one more momentwhile I tell you about another special type of cell called glial or microglialcells, which are like bodyguards or secret service agents for your neurons.Neurons are so important that they have their own handlers. You can think ofneurons as the celebrities of your inner condo. And their bodyguards meanbusiness. When they detect (via the inflammatory cytokine text messages sentfrom the border patrol in your gut wall) that invaders have breached the outerwalls or the blood-brain barrier, the glial cells actually prune away theneurons’ dendritic structures in their quest to protect against invaders. Whenthis happens again and again, all that is left is the body of the cell, whichnow has no way of communicating with other neurons. If your neurons can’tcommunicate with one another, of course you begin to suffer from problems withmemory and cognition!Some of my colleagues believe that dementia is caused by dysfunctional glialcells and are developing pharmaceutical interventions to stop glial cells frommunching dendrites. But I (and many others) believe that these bodyguards aredoing their job of guarding the neurons against presumed invaders. Perhaps theyare doing their job too well. Think of it this way: a neuron is a central fortwith outposts (dendritic structures) all over the periphery of the kingdom. Aglial cell (which receives messages) finds out that the enemy (in this case,LPSs and lectins) is advancing, so it calls back to the central fort. Thecommander at the central fort says, “Get out of there! Come back to the fort!”The glial cells then commence efforts to protect the neuron (aka the fort) bycutting off those dendritic structures (outposts) until all that’s left is thecentral fort and they don’t have to worry about protecting the outposts.So the underlying problem is not glial cells gone wild but rather the glialcells being triggered in the first place. Even worse, once the glial cells havegotten the neuron down to the cell body with no dendritic structures, they crowdaround that cell body like the bodyguards they are. Sadly, they protect thenerve so well that even simple nourishment can’t get in, and the neuronultimately dies.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_7] In Parkinson’s disease, a typicalfinding of this disease is called a Lewy body, which is a dead neuron surroundedby glial cells. Glial cells mean well, but they are overeager and end up hurtingthe very thing they are trying so hard to protect.When lectins and LPSs cross the gut barrier, not only do they travel through thebloodstream, but they also climb the vagus nerve from the gut to the brain.8[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_8] There they are deposited into the substantia nigra,9[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_9] an important structure in the midbrain that plays acritical role in motor planning. The neurons in the substantia nigra aredopamine-producing cells, and when inflammation causes a loss of neurons in thispart of the brain, the result is Parkinson’s disease. Indeed, as I explained inThe Plant Paradox, humans who had their vagus nerve cut as part ofnow-antiquated ulcer treatments have only half the incidence of developingParkinson’s as folks with the nerve intact.10 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_10] Thinkabout that: if the phone lines are cut, lectins can’t get in, but, moreimportant, the brain remains oblivious to the fact that there’s trouble headingits way.Moreover, invading lectins and LPSs encounter large numbers of neurons and theirprotective glial cells at the gut border. Now, here’s where it gets reallyinteresting. Parkinson’s patients suffer from constipation, and my colleagues inneurogastroenterology (yes, there is such a discipline) suspected that somethingwas amiss with the neurons in the gut wall that affect gut motility (bowelmovements). Animal experiments found that when the gut wall was breached, Lewybodies, those dead neurons surrounded by their bodyguards, could be found in thegut! Subsequent transcolonic biopsies in Parkinson’s patients have confirmed theanimal studies.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_11]So even this, the second most common neurological disease with more than 200,000new cases diagnosed in the United States each year, stems from changes in thegut, not the brain. Want more bad news? Glutamate, an amino acid produced byyour gut bacteria from glutamine, kills off dopamine-producing neurons.12[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_12] Where do you get glutamine? From MSG, the flavorenhancer present in so many prepared foods. Don’t see it on the label? The FDAconsiders it to be “GRAS” (generally regarded as safe), so its presence in aproduct is not required to be listed on a food label. If you see “naturalflavors” on an ingredients label, run for your life (and your brain’s life)!Would you believe that aspartame, which you may know as NutraSweet (the pinksweetener packet), converts to glutamate in your gut? Think twice next time yousweeten your coffee. By the way, aspartame was the preferred sweetener in dietdrinks until very recently.Pretty scary stuff.But there is plenty of hope. Researchers at the UCLA Longevity Center haverecently completed the first long-term, double-blind study of a bioavailableform of curcumin (found in turmeric), an anti-inflammatory polyphenol. Aftersplitting a group of forty people into two groups, one that took curcumin andanother that took a placebo daily, and correcting for age, sex, and otherbiological factors, the researchers found that the group taking curcumin hadsignificant improvements in verbal memory, visual memory, and attention spanafter eighteen months.13 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_13] Curcumin is one of the fewknown compounds that can pass through the blood-brain barrier to quietneuroinflammation.This is just the tip of the iceberg. Later in the book we’ll talk about manymore foods and supplements you can consume that will nourish your gut buddiesand stave off cognitive decline and illness. But there are a few other issues toaddress first.Multiple Sclerosis in the GutMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease in which the immune systemeats away at the protective lining of nerves, called myelin. The resulting nervedamage disrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body and/orwithin the brain itself. With everything you now understand about the immunesystem and this line of communication, would it surprise you to learn that eventhis disease has its origins in the gut?We now know that there are specific gut buddies that produce molecules you’veheard about before, called polysaccharides, that regulate myelination anddemyelination (the creation and destruction of myelin). Without enough of thesegut buddies producing enough polysaccharides, the immune system attacks themyelin, resulting in MS.14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_14] In one study, mice weregiven supplements of polysaccharide-producing bacteria. The result? Their myelinwas better protected, making them less vulnerable to MS.15[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_15]Does this mean that nourishing that strain of gut buddies can help prevent ortreat the disease in humans? Possibly. This is extremely promising for themillions of people suffering from MS, which is normally treated with drugs thatsuppress the immune system. As my good friend Dr. Terry Wahls has demonstrated,MS is clearly reversible by diet. Dr. Wahls reversed her own MS, which had lefther wheelchair bound, by eating nine cups of vegetables a day and removing thevast majority of lectin-containing foods from her diet.Recently I reported at the American Heart Association EPI/Lifestyle ScientificSessions on 102 patients with biomarker-proven autoimmune disease, includingseveral patients with MS, who went on the Plant Paradox program for six months.Ninety-five of the patients are now biomarker negative, symptom free, and offall immunosuppressive medications.16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_16] I firmlybelieve that in the near future we will be treating this and all otherdegenerative diseases exactly where Hippocrates suggested: in the gut.WASH YOUR BRAIN EVERY NIGHTJust when you thought you’d read the full horror story about gut invaders andtheir role in inducing neuroinflammation, there’s more. For more than a decade,some of my colleagues studying Alzheimer’s disease have been focusing onamyloids, which are dysfunctional proteins that stick together and form fibrousplaques around cells, after they observed that patients with Alzheimer’s diseasehad accumulations of beta-amyloid in their brains.17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_17]The theory was that the brain produced the amyloids, which killed off neuronsand caused Alzheimer’s disease. Pharmaceutical companies have spent tens ofbillions of dollars on developing antiamyloid drugs that would allegedly treatand prevent Alzheimer’s. Sounds pretty good, but all of those drugs have been adismal failure. Why? Because amyloids aren’t coming from the brain at all;they’re coming from the gut.Just as your gut bacteria create LPSs each time they divide and/or die, theyproduce amyloid when their own proteins die or become dysfunctional. They arecalled shed molecules because they literally split off from healthy bacteria andthen travel through the body either by penetrating a vulnerable gut wall or byclimbing the vagus nerve to the brain.18 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_18] Once theyreach the brain, they stimulate the brain to produce more amyloid, thereforebecoming self-sustaining. In addition to disrupting normal cellular function,amyloid proteins then interfere with communication between cells.Two things here. First of all, if you have a healthy population of gut buddies,they won’t make amyloid proteins to begin with. And if they do, as long as theamyloids don’t make it out of the gut, they’ll never cross the blood-brainbarrier. Our bodies are accustomed to dealing with both LPSs and amyloids. These“shed molecules” do not automatically cause problems just because they exist,and they do not automatically need to cause problems as we age, either. Butproblems do occur over time as the gut barrier becomes increasingly permeable.Second, even if they do reach the brain, amyloids don’t automatically causedamage; scans of many patients with no evidence of Alzheimer’s show the presenceof amyloid proteins. The all-important distinction is whether the plaques getwashed out of the brain or are allowed to remain there, where they trigger theproduction of more and more amyloid, becoming self-perpetuating and eventuallyaccumulating in the brain and contributing to Alzheimer’s and other forms ofneurodegeneration.THE BRAIN’S HOUSEKEEPING SYSTEMIn every part of your body, the spaces in between cells must be regularly sweptclean to get rid of junk and debris. Throughout most of your body, yourlymphatic system is recognized as doing this important cleanup work. Lymph, aclear fluid containing proteins and white blood cells (your cops), flows throughthe body and drains away any garbage that hasn’t been properly recycled. Butuntil recently, no one knew whether or not a similar process occurred in thebrain. The blood-brain barrier was thought to keep lymph from reaching thebrain.A few years ago, researchers discovered a system that allows cerebrospinal fluid(that clear fluid that we tap when we stick a needle into your spine) to flowthrough the brain, cleaning out the spaces in between cells, just as lymphaticfluid does in the rest of your body. This is called the glymphatic system. Tomake room for the fluid to wash out your brain, your cells actually shrink insize when you are in a deep sleep. This allows the full “brain wash” process togo twenty times as fast when you are in deep sleep as when you are awake andhelps to explain why a good night’s sleep is so restorative.19[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_19] When you get an adequate amount of deep sleep, youliterally wake up with a refreshed and rejuvenated mind that has been sweptclean of junk and debris.So as long as you’re going to bed at a reasonable hour, you should be gettingthe full brain-wash treatment every night, right? Unfortunately, this is not thecase. You read earlier that when I was a boy I wasn’t allowed to swim for anhour after I ate. That was because of my mother’s fear that all of my bloodwould rush to my stomach to digest whatever food I had eaten, leaving no bloodleft to flow to my muscles and give me the strength to swim. Believe it or not,this same principle relates to your sleep.The glymphatic system is most active during the specific stage of deep sleepthat happens very early in the sleep cycle. And the glymphatic system, just likeyour digestive system, requires a great deal of blood flow. This means that ifyou eat too soon before going to bed, your blood will all flow to your gut toaid in digestion and will not be able to reach your brain to complete theall-important brain wash. In this case, it’s your brain—not your muscles—thatsuffers from lack of blood flow while your body is focused on digesting yourfood. And the results for you can be almost as serious as drowning. If yourglymphatic system cannot wash out your brain effectively, you end up with abuildup of amyloid and other toxins, including lectins and LPSs, in the brain,and you already know what that causes. Sadly, this “wash cycle” is probably thesingle most overlooked and misunderstood aspect of neurodegenerative diseases.Luckily, there is a simple solution: leaving as big a gap as possible betweenyour last meal of the day and your bedtime. As my friend and colleague Dr. DaleBredesen, the author of The End of Alzheimer’s: The First Program to Prevent andReverse Cognitive Decline, has shown, the minimum amount of time betweenfinishing your last meal and going to sleep should be four hours. Remember, theone-hour rule was a bit of an old wives’ tale that held some truth.Unfortunately, it takes more than just one hour for your body to fully digestyour dinner so that you will have adequate blood flow to wash out your brain.This means that if you go to bed at eleven, you should eat nothing after seveno’clock. There is a lot of wisdom in the old maxim “Eat like a king atbreakfast, a queen at lunch, and a pauper at dinner.” Unfortunately, our culturepromotes the opposite—eating a large, late dinner (or, even worse, a snack rightbefore bed) that forces your body to spend its efforts digesting your foodduring the night, when it should be focused on cleaning out the gunk in yourbrain.I understand that it is not always possible to leave a full four hours betweendinner and bedtime. Many of my patients work long hours or go out to latedinners with friends, colleagues, and/or clients, and then they don’t want tohave to stay up for four hours while they finish digesting. To get the fullcleansing effects without sacrificing your schedule or sanity, I haveincorporated a “brain wash” day into the Longevity Paradox program. Once a week(or more), when it is convenient for you, you will skip dinner to make sure yourblood can flow freely to your brain as soon as you fall asleep. Think of it as aweekly deep clean when you’re too busy to tidy up on a daily basis. You’ll alsoget all of the benefits you read about earlier from temporarily stressing yourcells with this brief intermittent fast.Obesity and the BrainMost likely because of its impact on inflammation throughout the body, obesityis a major risk factor for dementia. A new study out of University CollegeLondon that looked at more than a million people in the United States and Europeover a period of thirty-eight years found that people with a high body massindex (BMI) were significantly more likely to develop dementia than people whohad a lower BMI.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_20] In fact, those who had centralobesity (in the gut) were the most affected. So remember my old saying: Fat inyour gut, you’re out of luck! This speaks further to the dangers of living in a365-day growth cycle.You’ll read much more about what actually causes weight gain in the next chapter[Chapter_7_Look_Younger_As.xhtml]. (Spoiler alert: it’s your gut bacteria.) Butfor now rest assured that the Longevity Paradox program will help you safelylose weight to improve the health of your body and mind.EAT FOR YOUR BRAINAmazingly, there is one food that can counteract nearly all of the damage we’vejust discussed, dramatically reducing your likelihood of developing dementia orother neurological diseases, and it’s one that most people enjoy: goodold-fashioned extra-virgin olive oil.21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_21] I’ve oftensaid that the only purpose of eating any food is to get more olive oil into yourmouth. A staple of the Mediterranean diet as well as in the diets of three ofthe longest-lived communities on Earth, olive oil has long been heralded as acure-all for health and longevity. But new studies on olive oil and brain healthare so compelling that it should also be used as a therapy for avoiding orslowing the development of dementia.22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_22]I’d be happy to write you a prescription for olive oil, but hopefully you won’tneed it. Just head to your local Costco or Trader Joe’s and make sure you’rebuying a first-cold-pressing bottle. And no, it doesn’t have to be from Italy.There are many good and reasonably priced American brands, such as CaliforniaOlive Ranch and Bariani.But why is olive oil so good for you, and how does it specifically impact thebrain? Well, we’ve known for a long time that olive oil has anti-inflammatoryproperties, due to its high level of polyphenols.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_23]Remember, your gut buddies convert polyphenols into anti-inflammatory compounds.Moreover, they suppress the ability of gut bugs to produce the vessel-damagingcompounds I mentioned previously that are formed from animal proteins, calledTMAOs.24 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_24] That alone may explain why consumption ofolive oil is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s. But we now know thatolive oil kick-starts autophagy, the highly beneficial cellular recyclingprocess. Indeed, mice that are fed diets rich in olive oil have higher levels ofautophagy than do mice that are fed a conventional diet. Furthermore, oliveoil–consuming mice perform better on memory and learning tests than theirnon-olive oil–fed peers.25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_25]But it’s not just autophagy. Mice that are fed olive oil also have reducedlevels of amyloid plaques in their brains. How can this be? It turns out that anolive oil–enriched diet stimulates neurons within the brain stem to release ahormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which decreases blood sugarlevels and is associated with many benefits, including weight loss and a lowerrisk of developing hypoglycemia.26 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_26] Because ofGLP-1’s effects on blood sugar levels, GLP-1 supplements are also a promisingtreatment option for type 2 diabetes.But GLP-1 also protects synaptic activity (those important connections betweendendrites and axons) in the brain from amyloid toxicity.27[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_27] It does this by stimulating the production ofbrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),28 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_28] anenormously beneficial protein that promotes the growth of dendrites and axonsand supports their connectivity. This means that olive oil actually helps yourneurons repair themselves after glial cells have bitten away their dendriticstructures! But even if your neurons have not been damaged by inflammation, BDNFsupports the growth of new neurons, leading to better long-term memory andcognition.That’s right: simply consuming olive oil reduces inflammation, stimulatesautophagy, supports the growth of new neurons, helps regrow dendritic structuresthat form neural networks, and protects your brain from the negative effects ofany amyloids that don’t get washed out at night. As I said, why bother eatinganything that you don’t pour olive oil onto?In a four-year study recently published from Spain, 447 adults aged 67 wereassigned to one of three diet groups: one group was instructed to consume aliter of olive oil per week (that’s about 9 to 10 tablespoons a day); anotherate 30 grams of walnuts a day; and the third group consumed a similar number ofcalories but followed a low-fat diet. Based on brain function tests administeredbefore the study began and after four years on the diets, the low-fat groupexperienced a significant reduction in memory and cognition, while thenut-eating group showed significant improvements in memory and the olive oilgroup experienced significantly improved overall cognitive function.29[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_29] Attention, class: consuming nuts and olive oil makesyou smarter! From what you’ve learned so far, the bottom line is clear: both ofthese foods change your gut buddies for the better.The benefits of olive oil explain why the Mediterranean diet is consistentlyassociated with healthier aging despite the prevalence of grains. The olive oilin the Mediterranean diet offsets the negative effects of the grains’ lectinsand can help preserve your brain well into old age. This has been proven instudies that look at how the Mediterranean diet impacts gut health. After onegroup of monkeys ate a Mediterranean-style diet and another group ate a Westerndiet for a period of two years, the ones that ate the Mediterranean diet hadsignificantly higher microbiome diversity and a better ratio of gut buddies tobad bugs.30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_30] It’s very simple: if you want ahealthier microbiome (and therefore a healthier brain and body), eat plenty ofolive oil!In another study, researchers in Scotland followed a group of more than fourhundred people between the ages of 73 and 76, analyzed their diets, and thenscanned their brains regularly over a period of three years to see how theirdietary habits impacted their brain health. They found that the people who atemore olive oil and less fried food and red meat had about half the rate of brainshrinkage considered normal for their age group. They concluded that thesubjects’ diet provided long-term protection to the brain.31[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_31]These results are pretty remarkable, but if you think about everything you’velearned so far, it makes perfect sense that a diet high in olive oil not onlywould result in the death of fewer neurons than a diet high in inflammatoryfried foods and animal protein but would actually make new brain cells grow.Another loss for this boy from Nebraska, but a win for aging brains everywhere.SOMETHING’S FISHYThe Mediterranean diet has another component that always drew my attention as Iresearched the omega-3 index and especially after my recent visit to Acciaroli,the town with the largest percentage of centenarians in the world. Thatcomponent is consumption of small fish. A recently published study that followednearly 400,000 men and women for sixteen years showed that those with thehighest fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acid intakes had significantly lowertotal mortality and lower cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Even morestriking, the women with the highest omega-3 intake had nearly 40 percent lessAlzheimer’s disease mortality! Spoiler alert: fried fish consumption didn’tproduce the same results.32 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_32] So back off on thosefish-and-chips!Even more striking are the recent findings from Dr. Daniel Amen using brainSPECT (nuclear imaging) scans: patients with higher omega-3 indexes hadincreased perfusion (blood flow) in regions of the brain associated withlearning, memorizing, and avoiding depression. Those with the lowest levels ofomega-3s had the most diminished perfusion in the same areas.33[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_33] After following more than a thousand women as partof the Women’s Health Initiative Study over eight years and looking at the sameomega-3 index, a study published in the journal Neurology reported that womenwith the highest omega-3 intakes had the biggest brains and the biggest memoryareas (the hippocampus) compared to those with the lowest levels.34[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_34] Your mother was right: fish is brain food!So what are the best sources of omega-3s? In my patient population, the highestomega-3 indexes without supplements are found in those who are daily sardine orherring eaters. Remarkably, my patients from Seattle and Vancouver who eat wildsalmon almost daily have never achieved high levels without additionalsupplementation. All of which takes us back to those Acciaroli centenarians andour old friends the Kitavans: they eat primarily anchovies and other small fish.Hate sardines and herring? Not to worry, there are plenty of other ways to getyour long-chain omega-3s, and no, vegans, it’s not from flaxseed oil.Eat Your Greens!You already know that your gut buddies love it when you eat leafy greens. Andwhen you do, they return the favor by powering your brain. A major study atTufts University on almost a thousand participants aged 58 to 99 over nearlyfive years showed that eating just one serving of leafy green vegetables per dayslowed the aging process in the brain. Specifically, after adjusting for age,sex, education, participation in cognitive activities, physical activity,smoking, and seafood and alcohol consumption, the participants who regularly ateleafy greens slowed their rate of cognitive decline by eleven years.35[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_35] Imagine making your brain eleven years younger justby eating greens every day! That’s exactly what you can accomplish on theLongevity Paradox program.YOUR GUT BUDDIES ARE YOGISIt comes as no surprise that meditation and yoga have many positive effects onthe brain. But I believe that none of these changes actually occurs directly inyour brain. Rather, your gut buddies really like it when you practice meditationand yoga, so when you do, they return the favor by improving your brain foryou.36 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_36] Some of my patients don’t like the idea thattiny one-celled organisms can control the mood, emotion, and willpower of a“higher” creature such as a human being. They want to believe that they are incharge of their own brains. Well, I’m sorry, but you’re going to have to getover it. You are nothing more than a transport vehicle and condominium for yourmicrobiome. You might as well give them what they want.The connection between yoga and/or meditation (yoga induces a state ofmeditation) and the gut all comes down to stress. Unhealthy stress levels (notthe hormetic levels that are beneficial) affect the gut, promoting a higherpopulation of bad bugs than gut buddies and altering gut permeability.37[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_37] In fact, extreme stress in humans leads to exactlythat: bad bugs and a leaky gut.38 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_38],39[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_39]In an experiment on mice, when the mice were stressed, their healthy gut buddieswere reduced and their levels of bad bugs increased, resulting in moreinflammatory cytokines produced in the gut.40 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_40] And ina human study that examined the composition of fecal microbiota in forty-sixpatients with depression and thirty healthy controls, there were significantdifferences between the two groups, with increased populations ofproinflammatory bad bugs and decreased population of gut buddies in the patientswith depression.41 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_41] Your gut buddies are in charge ofyour health, and your mental health is no exception.Think of it this way: if there is a lot of tension in your inner condo or a lackof the foods your gut buddies need, they won’t enjoy living there and will moveon to greener pastures, allowing bad bugs to take over. Then things quickly godownhill. The bad bugs don’t produce as much of the beneficial short-chain fattyacids and hormones that your gut buddies made for you. For example, your gutbuddies produce norepinephrine, which works in the brain by increasingalertness, focus, and attention, and serotonin, the “feel good” neurotransmitterthat increases feelings of well-being. Other gut buddies produce GABA, which, asyou read earlier, calms neurons, promoting feelings of ease.So it goes both ways. Stress alters the gut biome, and changes to the gut biomecreate feelings of stress. No wonder so many of my patients are onantidepressant and antianxiety medications when they first arrive in my office.Their gut buddies have sadly (pun intended) left the building.Of course, the number one benefit of meditation/yoga is a reduction in stress.This in and of itself creates positive changes to your microbiome, which is whatreally provides all the cognitive benefits of these practices. Some of thesebenefits can help prevent Alzheimer’s, while others have the potential togreatly extend your life. Studies on mice show that microbes in the gut areessential to increasing the ability to deal with a stressful situationappropriately.42 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_42] In fact, transplanting nonanxiousrodents with the microbiota of anxious rodents produced—you guessed it—moreanxious rodents!43 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_43] So are my patients’ gut bacteriaactually creating the feelings of anxiety that they suffer from? Many of mycolleagues and I believe so. In other words, your gut microbiome composition hasmore to do with your anxiety levels than with how you “feel” in your brain.Although, of course, external circumstances may play a role in creating yourfeelings, my colleagues at University College, Cork, in Ireland concluded,“Resilience to environmental stress seems to be heavily influenced bymicrobiotal composition.”44 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_44]At the University of California, Davis, researchers compared thirty participantson a meditation retreat at the Shambhala Mountain Center in Colorado with peopleon a waiting list for the retreat and corrected for age and general health. Theparticipants who attended the retreat meditated for six hours per day for threemonths. At the end of three months, the meditators had on average a full 30percent more activity of the enzyme telomerase than the control subjects did.45[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_45] Telomerase is the enzyme that activates telomeres,as discussed earlier, the length of which may be a marker for longevity. Andwhat causes an increase in telomerase activity? Your stem cells, which areactivated by your gut buddies. All that meditation made the participants’ gutbuddies happy, and they told the stem cells to increase telomerase so they couldstay in their pleasant, stress-free abodes for the long term. Sounds hokey, butit’s true.Another study looked at healthy male volunteers from the Indian Navy who weredivided into two groups—one that practiced yoga and meditation for six monthsand one that practiced routine physical training exercise instead. In the yogaand meditation group, glutathione activity increased significantly after sixmonths.46 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_46] Glutathione is the principal intracellularantioxidant that protects you from aging. And guess what powers its production?Butyrate, the beneficial amino acid produced by your gut buddies!47[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_47] In this case, the gut buddies enjoyed themanipulation of the gut by yoga, so they produced more butyrate, which increasedglutathione levels to protect against aging.Additional studies show that yoga and meditation prevent age-relateddegeneration by increasing BDNF levels and therefore protecting your neuronsfrom the effects of inflammation.48 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_48] And where doesBDNF come from? Your gut buddies make it.49 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_49] Otherstudies show that yoga practitioners have significantly greater gray matterconcentration in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus and experiencefewer cognitive failures.50 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_50] This BDNF boost explainswhy even though most people lose brain mass as they age, long-term meditators donot.51 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_51] As a result, they have improved verbal andvisual skills and enhanced global awareness and attention.52[Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_52] A brand-new study at Massachusetts General Hospitalshows that other forms of exercise also benefit the brain by boosting BDNFproduction and cleansing the brain, creating a better environment in which newneurons can grow.53 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_17_53] More on this later.Face it: you are a home for your bacteria, and they like it when you practicemeditation and yoga and want you to stick around into ripe old age to keep doingit. So, try it! See how they, and hence you, like it. But a word of warning:meditation cannot cure everything. If you don’t eat for the 99 percenters andprotect your gut lining, meditation can do only so much.Let me share a recent example. A Japanese meditation expert named Aiko Watanabe,who is Deepak Chopra’s representative and translator in Japan, recently came tosee me. She suffered from lifelong debilitating rheumatoid arthritis, which shehad tried to treat with diet and meditation. But her best efforts simply andtragically hadn’t worked. By the time she came to me, she’d already had two kneereplacements and was on two immune suppressants and in such terrible pain shewas essentially bedridden. She had been following a macrobiotic and Ayurvedicdiet that included a lot of brown rice, a major source of lectins that werebroaching her gut lining and causing inflammation. Since starting my protocol,she’s been off of her medications and pain free for months. She recently walkedinto my office to show me the remarkable changes. Remarkable? Yes. But you, too,can achieve remarkable results when you restore the proper functioning of yourgut.This is not to say that meditation and yoga won’t help combat inflammation. ButI’ve found that unless you couple these practices with a lectin-limited dietthat prevents disruption of the gut wall and supplement with foods that feedyour gut buddies, you are unlikely to experience the full benefits. Make all ofthese changes, and I promise they will thank you with a more youthful body bothinside and out—which leads us to our next chapter . . ."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7LOOK YOUNGER AS YOU AGE [nav.xhtml#nch11]Though my patients’ primary concerns about aging are generally related todeveloping disease, memory loss, fatigue, and limited mobility, let’s face it:we all have a secondary set of concerns about aging—and that is what we see inthe mirror!Some people may think that being invested in your appearance as you age is vain,but I disagree—after all, the way a person looks affects his or her self-esteemand therefore his or her mental well-being, which is a huge predictor of healthoutcomes. And with 80 percent of the population gaining an average oftwenty-three pounds or more since the 1980s and putting themselves at a higherrisk of all the diseases we have mentioned so far, weight is much more thansimply a cosmetic issue.But another reason to focus on the external is that what you see on the outsideof your body is a direct reflection of the state of affairs inside. So if you’vebeen gaining weight over the years and notice your skin getting thinner, moredeeply wrinkled, or discolored as time goes on, you can be sure that somethingis rotten in your core. And although some superficial changes are inevitable, itis entirely possible to maintain soft, supple skin, reverse the damage that’salready been done, lose weight, and get into even better shape as you age.As you learned earlier, the lining of your gut is equivalent to the surface areaof a tennis court in size, covering vastly more square footage than yourexternal skin. Yet in many ways it functions just like your external skin: itprotects you from “the elements,” it feels and senses (remember your sixthsense?), and it separates what you swallow and your microbiome from the rest ofyou. Have you ever wondered why the skin of most older folks seems paper thin?That thinning is directly connected to the gut wall weakening and allowing moreand more unwanted LPSs and bad microbes access into the blood. As your innerskin begins to break down and thin over time, that aging and thinning arereflected in the skin you see in the mirror every day.1[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_1]Think about it this way: when you’re looking to buy a home, the first thing yousee when you pull up at the address on the real estate listing is the exteriorof the house. You can tell a lot about a house from the exterior. Is it wellcared for, with neat landscaping, fresh paint, and no visible signs of water orother damage? Then it’s pretty safe to assume that the inside of the house willalso be clean and welcoming. But if there are overgrown bushes and weeds outsidewith visible mold, broken windows, peeling paint, and rotting wood, the insideof the house is probably just as run down. Any real estate agent will tell youthis is true: to some extent, you can judge a book by its cover.I am evidence of this myself, and so was Edith Morrey (“Michelle”) when I mether at age 90 and mistook her for 65! People are often surprised to learn that Iam 68 years old—and that I haven’t made any dermatologists (or plastic surgeons)rich along the way. In fact, I’ve never gone to one! I simply fixed my diet,healed my gut, and—voilà—my skin got smoother and my weight droppeddramatically. The same thing can happen for you.Remember, 99 percent of your genes are not your genes—they belong to your gutbuddies. And your gut buddies are in charge of your beauty from the inside out.YOUR GUT BUDDIES AND YOUR WEIGHTRecall the maxim you read earlier: You are not what you eat; you are what yourgut buddies digest. When it comes to your weight, this is a crucial truth thatis far too often overlooked. A revealing new study from the University ofChicago Medical Center2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_2] confirms the essential roleof gut microbes in weight management. When researchers analyzed the gut bugsthat live in the upper gastrointestinal tract rather than those that reside inthe large intestine (where much gut research is focused), they found animportant clue as to why we gain weight as we age: a strain of bacteria lives inthe upper GI tract that helps you rapidly digest and absorb high-fat foods. Thescary thing is that they multiply to keep up with the job—so the more fat thatis present, the more of these bugs you will have. If you eat a standard Westerndiet, over time you will gain more and more of these bacteria. The result isthat they quickly and efficiently digest all that fat and send it right intoyour body. Once again, it’s not the calories you eat that makes the difference;it’s the calories “they” make available to you.Say it with me: You are not what you eat; you are what your gut buddies digest.In a study by the same team to prove the mechanism, germ-free mice that did notpossess these fat-digesting gut bugs were fed a high-fat diet and did not gainany weight. Where did all that fat go, then? They pooped it out, quiteliterally. They had elevated lipid (fat) levels in their stool. Even morecompelling, when those germ-free mice were later exposed to the fat-eatingbacteria and fed a high-fat diet yet again, they did gain weight because thistime their gang members digested and passed that fat on to them.What’s that saying? You are not what you eat; you are what your gut buddiesdigest. No, the other one. When you take care of your gut buddies, they willtake care of you. That’s it! Eating a high-fat diet feeds the bad bugs that wantto take over and let their home rot and starves the gut buddies that want tokeep you young and lean. You need to keep your microbiome fueled with the foodsthey love to maximize your curb appeal, and these are the exact foods you’ll beeating on the Longevity Paradox plan.ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS ARE MAKING YOU FATYou read earlier about the dangers of hormone disruptors. In addition topromoting early growth and puberty, these disruptors cause adults to continue togain weight as they age. This is one of the leading causes of the obesityepidemic but one that few physicians are identifying in their patients whostruggle with their weight.The main hormone these chemicals disrupt is estrogen, which we normallyassociate with women but is actually present (in varying amounts) in both sexes.In women of childbearing age, estrogen’s main job is to tell the cells to storefat to prepare for an upcoming pregnancy. This was crucial back when we lived ina yearly cycle of growth and regression. During the growth cycle, a woman wouldgain weight so that she (and her baby) could live off that stored fat during theleaner times to come. In fact, that’s why very thin female athletes sometimesdon’t menstruate. Their internal fat storage counter doesn’t think there areenough fat deposits to nourish a baby and won’t risk wasting a precious egg.But now we live in a 365-day growth cycle, and there is quite frankly no needfor women to store fat ahead of time whether they are planning to becomepregnant or not. Food is always available for both mother and baby. But whentoxins in our environment mimic estrogen in the body of a man or a woman, ourcells get the message to store fat regardless of whether or not we are evenbiologically capable of becoming pregnant. This is why some girls are startingpuberty at the age of eight and many of my male patients first come to me with“man boobs” and a huge gut that looks like a pregnancy belly.The idea that minute amounts of these estrogen-mimicking compounds could causetrouble has been ridiculed even by those at the EPA and the FDA, whose job it is(or, sadly, was) to protect the unsuspecting consumer from such things. But thecumulative effect of the minute amounts of estrogen-like compounds we regularlyabsorb from our environment is more powerful than the hormone itself would be.3[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_3] Instead of hooking up to an estrogen receptor on afat cell, delivering their message, and then leaving the way the regularestrogen hormone does, estrogen-like compounds attach to the receptor and neverleave, keeping the fat cell permanently switched on to keep storing fat. Thisfurther disrupts normal cell messaging. Thanks to the effects of thesecompounds, men, women, boys, and girls are constantly storing fat for anonexistent upcoming pregnancy!To avoid unnecessary weight gain as you age and the health problems that comealong with it, it is essential to avoid these hormone disruptors. Here are someof the most common and harmful ones.BISPHENOL A (BPA)BPA has been used commercially since 1957 in the synthesis of plastics. It isalso used to line pipes and to coat the insides of many food and beverage cans.In the past decade or so, scientists caught on to the estrogen-mimicking effectsof this chemical. The Food and Drug Administration has ended its authorizationof using BPA in baby bottles and cans that store baby formula. BPA is bannedcompletely in Canada and Europe, but in 2015 a lawsuit in the United Statesattempting to force the FDA to ban BPA was defeated, thanks to a large donationby the American Chemistry Council to congressional campaigns that opposed thebill.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_4] Two years later in 2017, the EuropeanChemicals Agency announced that BPA should be listed as “a substance of veryhigh concern” due to its properties as an endocrine disruptor.As a result of public awareness (and therefore market abandonment) of BPA, manycompanies have chosen to stop using it, but others have not. And its “safe”replacement, bisphenol S (BPS), was recently found to have the sameendocrine-disrupting properties.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_5] I recommendlimiting your exposure as much as possible by: * Avoiding canned foods (buy frozen foods if you can’t get them fresh), unless you see a label that says “BPA-free lining” * Using glassware instead of plasticware for food storage * Never heating food in plastic in the microwave (heat causes BPA to leach out of plastics into food) * Using glass or stainless-steel water bottles instead of plastic * Making sure that any plastic toys (especially for young children, who will put them into their mouths) specifically state that they are BPA free * Asking for cash register receipts (which contain BPA) to be placed into your bag or just thrown awayPHTHALATESThese synthetic compounds that are used to soften plastics began to appear inthe early twentieth century and are now ubiquitous in wall coverings, vinylflooring, the gloves you wear to wash dishes, the trays used to package meat andfish, the plastic wrap you cover leftovers with, and even the toys your childrenplay with. Yikes. And thanks to their presence in plastic wraps and plasticcontainers, phthalates are omnipresent in our foods. Phthalates also act assolvents in perfumed items, so they turn up in hair sprays, lubricants, insectrepellents, and thousands of other household and personal care products.Animal and human studies have consistently connected phthalates to endocrinedisruption. In one study, they were associated with smaller-than-usual testiclesin rats.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_6] In humans, the presence of highlyconcentrated amounts of phthalate metabolites in men’s urine has been associatedwith damage to the DNA in sperm.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_7] Being exposed tothese chemicals at a young age may be associated with premature breastdevelopment in girls.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_8] And babies whose umbilicalcords reveal higher-than-normal exposure to phthalates are more likely to beborn prematurely.9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_9]These compounds lock onto estrogen receptors in the brain and permanently attachto the thyroid hormone receptors on cells, blocking the real thyroid hormonefrom delivering its message. I see this all the time in my patients who areproducing plenty of thyroid hormone yet have symptoms (including weight gain) ofhypothyroidism. Although researchers in European countries, Canada, and Chinahave conducted surveys in an effort to establish how much of this class ofchemicals is in their food supply, the first US study10[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_10] did not take place until 2013. It looked at arelatively pristine upstate New York population and found that the major sourcesof phthalates in humans were obtained from grains, beef, pork, chicken, and milkproducts.Gee, I wonder why so many people who come to me who are on a steady diet ofwhole grain foods and boneless, skinless chicken breasts (wrapped inphthalate-laden food packaging) are tired and fat with thinning hair but havebeen assured by their doctor that their thyroid hormone levels are normal. Sure,they are making plenty of thyroid hormone, but it can’t communicate with theircells because phthalates are in the way. Lo and behold, when we remove thephthalate-laden foods from their diets, these patients lose weight and gainenergy and start feeling (and looking!) decades younger.To avoid phthalates: * Avoid most grains, conventionally grown meats, and dairy products. * Use glass or stainless-steel water bottles instead of plastic. * Never heat food in plastic in the microwave. * Read labels of all personal care products. Make sure they specifically say “phthalate free.”Supplement with SunscreenMany conventional sunscreens are loaded with phthalates and other hormonedisruptors. When buying sunscreen, look for products with a titanium oxide orzinc oxide base without preservatives such as parabens. But it’s even better toeat your sunscreen by consuming plenty of vitamin C.There is very good evidence that if we have plenty of vitamin C in our bodies,it will prevent solar damage to the skin. I take a time-released vitamin Csupplement of 1,000 milligrams twice a day and have for years, and I rarely seethe effects of the southern California sun on my skin. Humans are actually theonly animals besides New World monkeys and guinea pigs that don’t make their ownvitamin C and need to rely on foods (or supplements) to get enough of it. Yet wedo have all the necessary enzymes except the final one to produce vitamin C. Sowhat gives?Evolutionary biologists believe that when we evolved, we had so much vitamin Cin our diets that the process of manufacturing it was “edited out” of our genes.Though eliminating our ability to produce vitamin C saved us from wasting energyand using that extra energy to store fat then, now it gets us into trouble whenwe don’t consume enough of it. In 1966, the Nobel Prize winner Linus Paulingdiscovered our inability to make vitamin C after observing that the human bodyuses vitamin C to repair cracks in collagen. Collagen is the most abundantprotein in our bodies, and is used to build connective tissue, skin, and bloodvessels—think of it as like the rebar in concrete. When collagen breaks andisn’t repaired well because of insufficient levels of vitamin C, we getwrinkles. The same is true of UV damage: the sun’s rays harm your skin bybreaking down collagen; vitamin C can knit it back together again—but only ifyou have enough of it.So: vitamin C supplements are a beauty food. The problem with them is that theyare water soluble, so you excrete vitamin C rapidly in your urine. There is alsoan upper limit to the amount of vitamin C you can absorb, and if you swallowmore, not only will you not absorb it, you’re also likely to get diarrhea asyour body excretes whatever it can’t absorb. Since animal studies suggest thatyou need plenty of vitamin C to maintain vital, healthy skin and blood vessels,a time-released vitamin C supplement taken twice a day should provide a lot ofthe sunscreen that you need.ARSENICThis well-known poison is also an antibiotic that kills your gut buddies as wellas a hormone disruptor. Talk about a triple threat! But somehow it continues tobe used to color sickly-looking chicken a beautiful blushing pink.Arsenic is a great example of a toxin that is not beneficial in smaller doses.It will kill you at a dose of 100 milligrams, and smaller doses will simply makeyour life shorter and less pleasant instead of making you stronger.To avoid arsenic: * Stop eating conventionally raised chicken. It is not a health food. * Avoid most grains, particularly rice, as they contain arsenic.AZODICARBONAMIDEAzodicarbonamide (try saying that three times fast) is another endocrinedisruptor11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_11],12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_12] that isused as a foaming agent in the manufacture of synthetic leather products, carpetunderlay, and yoga mats and is also used to bleach flour and condition dough.Most fast-food restaurants, including Wendy’s, McDonald’s, Burger King, andArby’s, use it in some or all of their bread products although the use ofazodicarbonamide in bread has been banned in the European Union13[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_13] and Australia. In this country, Subway hasvoluntarily eliminated it from its products.14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_14]Azodicarbonamide has been shown to provoke asthma and allergies,15[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_15],16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_16] as well as suppressimmune function,17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_17] particularly when it is heated orbaked (which of course normally happens to bread). Additionally, this chemicalhas been shown to break down gluten into two of its individual proteins, gliadinand glutenin, making them more immediately available and therefore moreimmediately irritating to your gut lining. This is one time when efficiency isnot a virtue.To avoid azodicarbonamide: * Never eat fast food. * Avoid most grains. * If you do eat bread, choose organic fermented varieties (such as sourdough) and for now only when traveling outside of the United States, owing to the presence of the herbicide Roundup in most of our wheat. But, spoiler alert! Roundup is now approved for use in Europe. Soon nowhere will be safe.BLUE LIGHTIn addition to the chemicals that disrupt our hormones, we are constantlyexposed to artificial blue light, which does the same thing. How? This goes backto our cyclical nature. For millennia, our ancestors sought and ate food inresponse to changes in daylight, specifically to the blue-wavelength spectrum ofdaylight. And our bodies are still wired to respond to these signals. Long daysand short nights tell your body that it is summer, which stimulates your body toseek out food, especially the sugars in fruit, to store fat for the upcomingwinter, when food will presumably be in shorter supply. Conversely, short daysand long nights tell your body it is winter and you should seek less foodbecause it is scarce and requires more calories to obtain and you can insteadjust live off the extra fat you’ve been storing all summer.Hunting or foraging for food when little is available makes no sense because youwould expend more calories than you are likely to obtain. Your body hates waste.So instead of seeking food in winter, we are designed to burn the fat we’veacquired. The hormone leptin, which makes us feel full, turns on the signal thatwe should stop eating and start burning our stored fat during winter. Thisseasonal cycling between the use of glucose (food) for fuel and the use ofstored fat for fuel is termed metabolic flexibility. And the instructions forthis cycling are mediated by the blue spectrum of light. More blue light tellsus to consume more glucose, while less blue light tells us to burn stored fat.Sounds pretty simple, right? But our lives are now completely dominated by bluelight. Televisions, cell phones, tablets, other electronic devices, and evenmost energy-saving lightbulbs emit light in the blue range of the spectrum,which is also known to interfere with sleep. Blue light suppresses theproduction of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep, and theresulting sleep deprivation is associated with obesity.18[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_18]Blue light also stimulates the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) andawake (cortisol), which of course adds to weight gain. And because our geneticprogramming associates blue light with daylight, this constant exposure tricksour bodies into thinking it’s perpetual summer and that we should keep packingon the pounds in anticipation of the leaner days of winter, which of course willnever arrive. Who knew that light could wreak such havoc on our bodies? For allof these reasons, I recommend that you minimize your exposure to blue light,especially in the evening, as much as possible.To avoid blue light: * Turn off all electronic devices when the sun goes down. * Is that impractical? Put on a pair of blue-blocker glasses as soon as the sun goes down, and wear them until you go to bed. * Use red night-lights so you can see where you’re going if you get up during the night. * Install an app such as f.lux on your computer to reduce the amount of blue light your screen emits; activate the nighttime lighting mode in the settings on your cell phone, tablet, and computer.In addition to avoiding these harmful endocrine disruptors, in the LongevityParadox program you’ll return to the cyclical nature your gut buddies evolvedin, which will make them happy and inspired to keep you trim, energetic, andyoung.YOUR SKIN IS YOUR GUT LINING TURNED INSIDE OUTWe’ve already talked about the fact that your gut lining is, in essence, yourskin turned outside in. What goes on in there comes back around to the surfaceof your skin. But just as your gut lining is in constant contact andcommunication with the gut microbiome, I would be remiss to leave out thetrillions of bacteria living on your skin, especially in a book about aging (orabout not aging, as the case may be). These bugs are commonly referred to asyour skin flora and include more than a thousand different species of bacteria;together with the microbiome, they make up your holobiome.Before you put down this book for your morning shower, give these guys (I’llcall them your skin buddies) a chance. Like your gut buddies, they view yourskin as their home, and as long as you take good care of them, they will takeexcellent care of you. In this case, taking care of you means keeping your skinsoft and supple as you age. Your skin buddies have sworn to protect their home(your skin) at all costs. They will fight to the death against invaders such asbad bugs, mold, and fungi.19 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_19]Different skin buddies act to protect your skin in varying ways. One species ofbacteria secretes antimicrobial substances that help fight pathogenic invaders,while another uses the skin’s lipids to generate short-chain fatty acids to wardoff microbial threats. (Yes, secretion of too much of these lipids by your skinbuddies causes oily skin.) Another species secretes lipoteichoic acid (LTA),which prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines so that your skin does notbecome inflamed.20 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_20] To maximize your skin’sprotection, it is therefore essential to have a richly diverse skin bacterialpopulation. Your skin flora is meant to be even more diverse than your gutbiome.But over the years, we have done our skin buddies a horrible disservice. Weassumed that having bacteria on our skin was a bad thing without paying anyattention to what those bugs did for us, so we started to kill them off indroves with antibacterial cleansers and soaps. As a result, we have far lessdiverse populations of skin buddies in the United States than people incountries where they do not use these harmful products.21[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_21] What’s that? You think that we need antibacterialcleansers to keep away bad bugs and avoid infections? Our skin buddies actuallydo that for us. Some of the bacteria on our skin produce antimicrobial peptidesthat defend against pathogenic bacteria but are not harmful to your skinbuddies. But when we use man-made antibacterial cleansers, we kill off the badbugs as well as the good.What if I told you that the death of our skin buddies and damage to our gutlining are the two predominant causes of skin problems as we age—not sunexposure, genetics, or anything else you’ve been led to believe? Let’s look atthe evidence.First of all, when it comes to sun exposure, your skin buddies can actuallyprotect you against skin cancer despite your levels of exposure to the sun.There is a strain of bacteria that’s common on healthy skin that can inhibit thegrowth of skin cancer. It does this by producing a compound called6-N-hydroxyaminopurine (6-HAP), which kills several types of cancer cells but isnot toxic to healthy cells. When mice with skin cancer received intravenousinjections of 6-HAP every forty-eight hours over a two-week period, their tumorsize was suppressed by more than half.22 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_22] Prettyremarkable, isn’t it? What if the current uptick in skin cancers (with more thana million new cases diagnosed in the United States each year) is being caused bythe death of our skin buddies and the resulting lack of 6-HAP to protect usagainst skin cancer?Furthermore, when patients with eczema, a painful skin condition that causespatches of skin to become red and inflamed, were treated with a type of bacteriathat is normally present on the skin, they saw a significant reduction insymptoms.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_23] Seeing these results, researchers beganlooking more closely at the skin flora of patients with eczema and found thatthey generally have a higher-than-normal population of bad bugs. In fact, animbalance in skin flora is a sign of disease. Research shows that patients withprimary immune deficiency conditions actually have altered skin flora. They tendto have more permissive skin, meaning that their skin flora includes species notnormally found on healthy adults.Just like your gut buddies, your skin buddies can trigger an immune response toa perceived threat. Normally, their ability to ring the alarm is helpful—thinkof any time you’ve gotten a cut and the skin around the injury became swollen.That’s the result of your skin buddies inciting your immune system to attack anybad bugs that are trying to invade. Without such an immune system, bad bugs cantake over the skin. But just like your gut buddies, sometimes your skin buddiesoverreact and create chronic inflammation—and skin conditions such as eczema canresult.Throughout your entire life, your internal and external skin function as the twofront lines, where your gut and skin buddies fight off invaders (as long asyou’ve been treating them right). When the bacteria in your gut are out ofbalance and allow bad bugs to permeate the gut barrier, your skin flora suffers,allowing bad bugs to take over. If your gut and skin buddies have left thebuilding, you’ll see it right there in the mirror—in the form of thinning skin,age spots, wrinkles, acne, and eczema. And if you’re seeing those things in themirror, it means the hordes at the gate have invaded and the war is on.On the Longevity Paradox program, you’ll nourish your skin buddies through thefoods you eat and the products you use to care for the residents both inside andout. This is why my patients very often start to look younger after we’ve begunnourishing their gut buddies, even though we’ve made no changes to their skincare or cosmetics routine. This does not mean that skin care doesn’t play a rolein the program. But instead of products that kill off skin buddies and mimichormones, you can make a few simple swaps that will support the health of yourentire holobiome.Here are some of the most beneficial ingredients, not for your skin itself butfor your all-important skin buddies.BONICEL (BC30)We’ve known for a long time that BC30 is a beneficial spore-forming bacteriumthat, unlike most probiotics, is not digested by stomach acid. (Yes, that meansthat most of those other probiotics you’ve been taking probably haven’t made itto your gut, but that’s another story.) Ganeden, the probiotic company thatpatented Bonicel, began applying BC30 to skin cells in a petri dish and foundthat the skin cells suddenly became fatter. The bacteria actually plumped up theskin cells. Ganeden developed a product called Bonicel, which is producedthrough a fermentation process and contains metabolites of BC30 yet is shelfstable for use in cosmetic products. In clinical trials, it has been proven todecrease coarse skin lines and skin shadows and increase skin hydration, skinsmoothness, and skin elasticity.I am such a big fan of Bonicel that I buy it to use in my own skin careformulations, but you don’t have to get it from me. It is available in a widerange of antiaging skin creams, gels, masks, serums, body lotions, cosmetics,and hair care products.POLYPHENOLSPolyphenols are important plant compounds found in many natural foods such asfruits, vegetables, grains (particularly lectin-free cereal grains, such asmillet), tea, coffee, and wine. They give fruits and vegetables their vibrantcolors and determine their flavor and aroma. Technically, polyphenols arecharacterized by the existence of more than one phenol unit—or buildingblock—per molecule. That’s what makes them “many”—or “poly”—phenols. Butpolyphenols aren’t just the building blocks of plant-based chemicals; they alsohave a lot of incredible antioxidant properties with antiaging benefits.24[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_24] In addition to stimulating autophagy and boostingcognitive performance,25 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_25] they fight the freeradicals that can enter your body every day if you’re exposed to air pollution,cigarette smoke, or significant amounts of alcohol. But most polyphenols takenorally are absorbed poorly and not made into their bioactive compounds unlessthey are first eaten and transformed by the microbiome.Your gut buddies absolutely love polyphenols. Resveratrol, which you read aboutearlier, is a potent polyphenol, and one of the reasons that olive oil is sogood for your gut and brain health is its own high levels of polyphenols. Butthese compounds are equally beloved by your skin buddies. The polyphenols inpomegranates, for example, have a photo-protective effect on skin cells, meaningthey can help your skin cope with molecular damage caused by sunlight.26[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_26] One study showed that skin treated with pomegranateproducts experienced less collagen loss and skin protein breakdown and wasbetter able to maintain its elasticity and youthful appearance.27[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_27] Further studies have revealed that another type ofpolyphenol, ellagic acid, found in raspberries and blackberries, to name twosources, helped reduce hyperpigmentation (sunspots) on the skin when takenorally.28 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_28]One of the best sources of polyphenols for your skin is cranberry seed oil, theresult of cold-pressing cranberries, which are filled with various polyphenols,each of which benefits your skin in its own unique way. The catechins incranberries, for example, help fight signs of aging in the skin such as wrinklesand sagging by preventing cell stress and death. They also haveanti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.29 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_29]Meanwhile, proanthocyanidins help protect the skin from the sun’s harmful UVAand UVB rays30 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_30] and help your skin buddies fightagainst viral skin infections.31 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_31]Other polyphenols found in cranberries include quercetin and myricetin.Quercetin, with its anti-inflammatory properties, helps soothe irritated skin,32[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_32] while myricetin hydrates skin cells, keeps skinsmooth and firm, prevents skin cell death, and combats damage from sunexposure.33 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_33]Of course, the anti-inflammatory actions of cranberries make them just as goodfor your gut as they are for your skin buddies. Each part of the cranberry, fromits seeds to its juice, is packed with compounds that work to keep you healthyboth inside and out. You don’t have to wait until the festive season to embracethese little berries. Though they’re seasonal, you can still reap their benefitsthrough the many supplements and cold-pressed oils available on the market. Whenit comes to eating the berries themselves, it is always best to do so when theyare in season and in moderation to avoid consuming too much sugar.Polyphenol supplements are widely available, and many skin care brands are nowincluding them in their products. Polyphenols are also present in largequantities in many of my favorite foods, including: * Spices: Cloves, star anise, capers, curry powder, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg * Dried herbs: Peppermint, oregano, sage, rosemary, thyme, basil, lemon verbena, and more * In-season dark fruits: Cherries, strawberries, cranberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, huckleberries, pomegranates * Natural beverages: Cocoa, green tea, black tea, red wine * Seeds: Flaxseed (ground only), celery seeds, poppy seeds, black sesame seeds, Nigella sativa (black cumin or black caraway seed) * Nuts: Chestnuts, pistachios, walnuts * Wine, particularly red wine * Oils: Extra-virgin olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil * Dark chocolate (70 percent cacao or more), cacao nibs (raw cocoa)WILD YAM EXTRACTIf you read the labels of your favorite skin care products and see Dioscoreavillosa, know that it is simply the scientific term for wild yam. Yep, that’sright. A potato’s not-really-related cousin (wild yam is not to be confused withsweet potato) can help you achieve better-looking skin. Wild yams containmultiple compounds that can benefit several different parts of the body. They’refilled with saponins, naturally occurring molecules in plants, that haveanti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties.34[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_34] In addition, they’re able to dig easily into cellmembranes, enabling them to work.35 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_35]The wild yam is best known for its high quantity of a compound known asdiosgenin, a specific type of saponin. Diosgenin is used as ananti-inflammatory36 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_36] and enhances DNA synthesis inhuman skin to restore skin cells.37 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_37] Diosgenin isalso believed to be effective as a skin depigmenting agent, helping protect youagainst nasty age spots.38 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_38] It is used in cosmeticsfor its ability to fight the loss of collagen in skin.39[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_39] Since collagen is the rebar in your skin, it plumpsthe skin, helping it maintain its youthful appearance and fresh look whileholding everything together. Irritated and sensitive skin may reap benefits fromthe collagen-boosting effects of diosgenin.40 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_40] Itsanti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties come into play here as well,soothing skin while giving it the healthy nutrients it needs.41[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_41]Just like polyphenols, wild yam extract benefits both your skin buddies and yourgut buddies with its powerful anti-inflammatory properties.42[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_42],43 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_43] Internally, diosgeninhelps stabilize your gastric and intestinal fluids. And just as it penetratesyour skin cell membranes, diosgenin can penetrate your gut wall, which can helpease gastrointestinal discomfort stemming from inflammation more quickly.44[Notes.xhtml#endnote_18_44]Wild yam is most commonly found as a supplement (dried as an herb in a capsuleor tablet form) or as a 12 percent wild yam cream. It can also be bought as aliquid extract, which some people make into a tea. It’s available in plenty ofskin care products as well. So now that you are up to speed on most of the residents that make up yourholobiome, you’re probably eager to find out exactly how you can begin takingbetter care of your tenants. That’s exactly what we’re going to cover next."},{"pageContent":"IIITHE LONGEVITY PARADOX PROGRAM [nav.xhtml#nii12]There is literally a life-and-death struggle constantly being waged between thegood guys in your holobiome, which are dedicated to keeping you young until theday you (and they) die, and the bad guys, which desperately want to take overand run you into the ground. So the question is this: Which are you going tofeed and nourish, and which are you going to starve out? This is a factor inaging that is entirely within your control. Every meal you eat and when you eatit, how and how much you exercise, the products you use in the shower, thesupplements you take each day—all of these small choices add up to have a realimpact on your life span and your health span.For many, the conflicting advice out there—eat this, don’t eat that; exercisethis way, not that way—is frustrating and overwhelming. Many of us just throwour hands into the air and say, “Enough! I don’t care how long I live; just giveme what I need to feel good in the moment!” Well, I’m here to tell you thatliving for the present is not a winning strategy.Recently I received a phone call from a good friend whose husband (let’s callhim Fred) has been a patient of mine for years. Fred was fit, a greatbusinessman, and the life of the party. Fred’s wife is a wonderful cook, and sheand Fred regularly enjoyed many of the foods I advise against eating. For years,looking at his lab work, I warned him that trouble was brewing. Despite hisbeing thin, his insulin levels were always high, which meant his brain wasstarving to death. His markers for damage to his arteries were always high, yethe easily passed the nuclear stress tests I performed on his heart.Now Fred is in his early seventies and suddenly gave up tennis, a sport heloved, in the past six months because he began tripping on the court, falling,and bruising himself. Well, what the heck, he was getting old. Time to slowdown, right? But in the last few months, his wife says, he has been searchingfor words and just sits in his chair all day long, watching TV. Last month,during his office visit, I detected that “faraway look” in his eyes and referredhim to a local neurologist who specializes in dementia. So I was, sadly, notsurprised when his wife called me to say that Fred had been diagnosed withAlzheimer’s disease.If Fred had changed course a few years ago, I would not be telling you about hiscurrent outcome. You have gotten this far in the book because you have decidedthat Fred’s fate is not the fate you want. Let me assure you, you are not alonein this journey, and in the following pages you’ll learn exactly how to make thebest choices for your gut buddies—and therefore for you."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8THE LONGEVITY PARADOX FOODS [nav.xhtml#nch13]Imagine that you went to the hardware store, bought some grass seed, spread itout on your lawn, and then just left it there without any water or fertilizer.Obviously, the grass wouldn’t grow. This may seem foolish, but many of mypatients make the same mistake, but instead of their lawn, they do it with theirmicrobiome. When they learn how important their gut buddies are to their healthand longevity, they go out and buy expensive probiotics, swallow them, andexpect their gut buddies to flourish and multiply. But if you don’t fertilizethose gut bugs with the foods they like to eat, they will quickly die off justlike that grass seed.To regrow a healthy, robust population of gut buddies, you must fertilize them!One of the many wonderful things about your holobiome is that its population ofgut buddies can multiply rapidly. If you’ve read The Plant Paradox, you knowthat when you choose the foods your gut buddies like to eat, you candramatically shift the bacterial population in your gut in a matter of days.1[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_1] In this chapter, we’ll cover exactly which foods yourgut buddies love the most and which ones feed the bad guys. A full list of foodsappears in the next chapter [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml], but here we’llfocus on the very favorites of both categories of gut bugs.THE BEST FOODS FOR GUT BUDDIESThese are the foods that you should focus on eating as much as possible toensure that your gut buddies will want to make your body their forever home.PREBIOTICSThere is a lot of confusion about the difference between probiotics andprebiotics, but it’s actually quite simple: whereas probiotics are the gut bugsthemselves, prebiotics are the fibrous long-chain sugars they eat. Back to ourgardening scenario: probiotics are the seeds you plant in your gut garden, andprebiotics water and fertilize them. They do this so well because they areindigestible by you. You can’t digest them, so they stay in your gut, where yourgut buddies can happily chow down on them. Remember our friends the naked molerats and their steady diet of tubers, roots, and fungi? Well, tubers, roots, andfungi are wonderfully rich in prebiotics, which is why those mysteriouscreatures have such plentiful and diverse gut buddy populations that enable themto defy aging.In addition to tubers such as yams, jicama, and tiger nuts, rutabagas, parsnips,sweet potatoes, mushrooms, taro root (cassava), yucca, celeriac, Jerusalemartichokes (sunchokes), chicory, radicchio, artichokes, and Belgian endive areall good sources of prebiotics, the last four also rich in our old friendAkkermansia’s favorite food: inulin. As a reminder, Akkermansia feeds on theprotective mucus lining your gut wall and helps produce more of it. The moreAkkermansia bacteria you have, the younger you will be into ripe old age. Hereare a few more of my favorites.GROUND FLAXSEEDFlaxseed has been around since 3000 BC, which means your gut buddies have had along time to adapt to it. Remember, your gut buddies are creatures of habit.They prefer the foods they are most familiar with, and flaxseed definitely fallsinto that category. In fact, way back in the 700s, Charlemagne, the Holy Romanemperor, was so impressed by the health benefits of flax that he required hissubjects to eat it. Of course, that was over 1,300 years ago, but he may havebeen onto something.Flaxseed is beneficial because it contains not only prebiotic fiber but also asignificant amount of lignans, a type of polyphenol. Flaxseed also has plenty ofB vitamins and is one of the most significant sources of plant-based omega-3fatty acids. Specifically, it contains a large amount of anti-inflammatoryalpha-linolenic acid (ALA),2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_2] which supports the gutlining but, importantly, is not the same as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), anotheromega-3 that you need for brain health. Many of my vegan patients trysupplementing with flaxseeds to get their omega-3s, but humans simply cannottransform ALA into DHA. So flaxseeds are great for your gut lining, but youstill need fish oil or algae DHA oil for your brain.When flaxseeds are in their whole form, you cannot digest their beneficialcompounds, so always choose ground flaxseeds, flaxseed meal, or flaxseed oil,which all have a slightly nutty taste and go virtually unnoticed in a smoothieor mixed into some coconut yogurt. But a word of caution: once ground, flaxseedsgo rancid (oxidize) rapidly, so buy them whole and grind them in a coffeegrinder, or buy the ground meal refrigerated. That goes for the oil as well:once opened, it will go rancid unless kept cool.Because your skin buddies love flaxseed, too, you can use ground flaxseeds tomake your own body scrub or use flaxseed oil to moisturize your skin and hair. Ilike combining flaxseed oil with various essential oils to create my ownmoisturizer that nourishes my skin buddies instead of killing them off.ARTICHOKESEach one of these has more than 10 grams of prebiotic fiber. Not only that, butartichokes are also packed with vitamins: A, B, C, and E, as well as theminerals calcium, potassium, and magnesium, to name a few. Another benefit ofadding the artichoke to your diet is its high antioxidant content and polyphenolcontent, which helps your liver. Plus they’re delicious and fun to eat. You canprepare them whole and eat them that way, but if you want to make your lifeeasier, I suggest buying frozen artichoke hearts, which brings the prep workdown to nothing.LEEKSThese cousins of the onion are loaded with polyphenols and allicin, a compoundthat increases your blood vessels’ flexibility and reduces cholesterol using asimilar mechanism as statin drugs but without the side effects. Popular inEurope but not so much here, they are tasty and easy to prepare. Just make sureto slice them in half the long way and rinse them thoroughly or soak them incold water before using—they have a lot of hidden dirt in between their layers.After that, use them in salads and soups, or grill them and then toss them intoa salad. Delicious!OKRAI know this is one of those foods that you either love or hate. For most people,it comes down to one thing: the texture. Sure, okra can be a little slimy, butit’s a wonderful source of prebiotic fiber as well as vitamins C and A, iron,phosphorous, and zinc. In fact, fully half of its carbohydrates are prebioticfiber. And I promise it’s delicious when prepared correctly. My suggestion?Sauté it over very high heat, or roast it until it’s crispy. And good news: ifyou can’t find it fresh, don’t worry; frozen okra is available in most grocerystores, and it’s just as nutritious. Make sure to thaw it and pat it dry beforecooking to cut down on the slime factor. Another fun fact: the mucus in okrabinds to lectins!JICAMAThis delicious, slightly sweet, crispy vegetable tastes like a cross between anapple and a potato. And it’s incredibly high in the prebiotic fiber inulin.Looking for more vitamin C in your diet? A 100-gram serving of jicama supplies40 percent of your daily needs. Skip the orange juice, and eat some jicamasticks instead! You can cook with jicama—it actually stays nice and crisp in astir-fry or sauté. But in my opinion, jicama shines when it’s raw. It’s goodshredded into a slaw, chopped with cilantro and onion in a salsa, or—myfavorite—cut into matchsticks or “chips” and used to scoop up guacamole.CRUCIFEROUS VEGGIESThese vegetables, particularly broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, haveprofound gut buddy benefits. Brussels sprouts have tons of fiber as well asvitamins B1, B2, B6, C, and K. They are also rich in antioxidant andanti-inflammatory properties. Overall, Brussels sprouts are one of the mostgut-friendly veggies out there. Meanwhile, broccoli has only slightly less fiberthan Brussels sprouts, and a cup of cooked broccoli will give you as muchvitamin C as a whole orange. It’s also chock full of beta-carotene. And did youknow that broccoli contains vitamins B1, B2, B3, and B6? How much more B couldyou ask for? It’s also a great source of iron, potassium, zinc, and magnesium.Furthermore, there is evidence that broccoli can help heal a leaky gut. In onestudy, mice that had symptoms similar to those in humans who struggle with leakygut and colitis saw a reduction in symptoms after eating a diet that includedplenty of broccoli.3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_3] Mice with the same symptoms thatdid not eat broccoli weren’t so lucky. Why did that happen? Cruciferous veggies,including broccoli and Brussels sprouts, contain a chemical compound known asindolocarbazole (ICZ) that binds with a receptor in the gut called the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is responsible for helping the body react totoxins. When AHR and ICZ bind together within the gut, the gut barrier andimmune system are both strengthened.Ironically, many of my patients with a leaky gut have previously been told bytheir doctors to avoid “roughage” such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, butthese vegetables can actually help heal their guts. If you suffer from a leakygut or IBS, go slow and cook them to almost mush or use a pressure cooker whenfirst introducing them to avoid diarrhea or cramps.THE CHICORY FAMILYThough it’s not a household word in the United States, chicory is in almost allof the salads that I am served in France and Italy. In fact, those cleverlong-lived Italians have a tricolore salad consisting of Belgian endive,radicchio, and arugula. The first two are forms of chicory, while the latter isa cruciferous veggie. A gut buddy’s dream food, the inulin in chicory feedsAkkermansia. Try all the forms available, such as escarole, curly endive,radicchio, Belgian endive, and more.NUTSYou read earlier that certain nuts nourish the gut buddies that produce butyrateto support your gut lining and your mitochondria. But when it comes to nuts,you’ve got to be careful. It’s a little-known fact that some “nuts” are reallyjust seeds. Take cashews, for example: they are seeds, and they are full oflectins. Other “nuts” such as peanuts are actually legumes. And legumes arelectin bombs. It’s best to stay away from peanuts, even if you’re not allergicto them.But real nuts can do wonderful things for your gut buddies and as a resultsupport heart health, reduce your chances of developing gallstones, help protectagainst diabetes, regulate blood pressure levels, and protect againstinflammation. The nuts your gut buddies like best are walnuts, macadamia nuts,hazelnuts, and pistachios. Peeled almonds and blanched almond flour are fine,but many of my autoimmune patients react to the brown peel on almonds. Irecommend eating a handful of nuts every day. Your gut buddies will thank you.MUSHROOMSMushrooms have long been touted for their health benefits, but for the firsttime, my fellow longevity researchers have pinpointed two important antiagingcompounds—ergothioneine and glutathione—that are plentiful in mushrooms.Mushrooms are the highest dietary source of these two antioxidants together, sothey protect you from free radicals and help you stay young.4[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_4]Of all the mushrooms tested, porcinis had the highest levels of polyphenols byfar. (Is it a coincidence that this species of mushrooms is popular in Italy,home of some of the world’s longest-lived people?) The second runner-up was thepopular white button mushroom. Mushrooms contain huge amounts ofpolysaccharides, which feed your gut buddies, which, in turn, tell your immunesystem to “chill out.” It’s this feature that gives them their ability toenhance the immune system. Best of all, unlike some foods that lose theirnutritional value after cooking, exposure to heat doesn’t seem to affect the keypolyphenols in mushrooms. So throw them into stir-fries or sauté them bythemselves as a delicious antiaging vegetable side dish.But the real reason to get more “’shrooms” into your diet is their high contentof polyamines, the longevity-promoting compounds that are found in high levelsamong centenarians! My favorite polyamine is spermidine, which was named for itspresence in semen. (I kid you not.) Studies show that spermidine increases lifespan and is cardioprotective.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_5] Mushrooms are one ofthe great sources of spermidine! You can imagine another great source. (Hold thegiggles, please.)LOW-SUGAR FRUITSThough most fruits should be eaten in moderation and only in season (more onthis in a moment), some fruits are naturally low in sugar and can be eaten inlarge quantities year-round. Sadly, we often don’t recognize these antiagingfruits as fruits at all. They include the following.AVOCADOSYes, this guacamole star is actually a fruit! And its flesh contains even moreprebiotic fiber than an artichoke. Like the artichoke, the avocado boastssignificant amounts of vitamins C and E and potassium, as well as a lot offolate. Avocados are also chock full of the same healthy monounsaturated fatfound in olive oil, oleic acid, which supports brain function and is importantto consume at any age.Your skin buddies also adore avocados. Try mashing a ripe avocado and using itas a DIY skin mask or a deep conditioner for your hair. The fatty acids inavocados can help your skin’s natural oil barrier stay strong, protecting youfrom the aging effects of sun damage.GREEN BANANASEverybody praises bananas because they’re rich in potassium, but they’re alsorich in something else that your gut buddies definitely don’t love: sugar. Onemedium banana contains 14 grams of sugar—that’s 31/2 teaspoons! But unripetropical fruit has lower fructose content and is made up of resistant starches,which, as you read earlier, your gut buddies love to munch on. So if you canfind green bananas, go for them. Like avocados, these low-sugar fruits nourishyour hair and skin. Try mashing half an avocado and half a green banana togetherand using the mixture as a hair and/or skin mask. You’ll smell great, and yourskin buddies will love it.RASPBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, AND MULBERRIESThese tart berries have only about 5 grams of sugar per cup, are an awesomesource of prebiotic fiber, and are chock full of polyphenols including ellagicacid. They also have all the vitamins A, C, and K you could hope for. So if youhave a sweet tooth, try freezing some raspberries and noshing on them when youneed to satisfy a craving without supporting the bad bugs in your gut.FIGS AND COCONUTSBelieve it or not, neither of these popular fruits is actually a fruit. Figs areflowers, not fruits, and coconuts are technically tree nuts! Along with thepomegranate, the fig is probably the oldest known “fruit,” dating back inrecords to 5000 BC. As the cover of this book suggests, the fig is ripest and atits best when it is in full flower. Never seen a fig’s flower? Just cut the figin half; the insides are actually multiple tiny flowers waiting for a specificwasp to crawl through the little hole in the base and complete the fertilizationprocess. So a ripe fig is at a very old age and ready to make new life—henceearning its rightful spot on the cover of this book. Good news: most of thesugar in figs comes from prebiotic fiber. And when they’re ripe (between Augustand December), they’re especially delicious.Coconut is one of my all-time favorite foods—not only because it tastes so goodbut also because it has about 7 grams of prebiotic fiber per cup. You don’t haveto eat just the meat—you can bake with coconut flour or sprinkle shreddedcoconut on top of grilled veggies. Just make sure you’re using unsweetened figand coconut; a lot of dried fruits are loaded with sugar. Check labelscarefully. And please ditch the “healthy” coconut water: it’s pure sugar water!HEALTHY FATSThe type of fat you eat is very important because when it comes to inflammation,most fat sources aren’t neutral—they are either proinflammatory oranti-inflammatory. But they aren’t that way by nature. For instance, omega-3fats from fish oil are anti-inflammatory, right? Well, not so fast. It turns outthat the real anti-inflammatory compounds made from DHA and EPA (two types ofomega-3s) in fish oil are called resolvins,6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_6],7[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_7] and these guys are the superheroes of blockinginflammation in your nerves and eyes. But here’s the caveat: you need a littlebit of the active ingredient in aspirin (salicylic acid) to get these effects.That’s why I recommend taking an 81-milligram enteric-coated aspirin a few timesa week to activate that fish oil you’ve been swallowing.And how about that evil omega-6 fat arachidonic acid (AA), the supposed cause ofinflammation? Well, here’s a paradox again. Half of your brain’s fat is theomega-3 fat DHA, while the other half is AA! What’s that stuff doing up there?It’s actually preventing inflammation in your brain and its memory center, thehippocampus.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_8]What’s more, in a large study of Japanese men published in March 2018, the menwith the highest levels of AA and another omega-6 fat, linoleic acid (LA), hadthe lowest risk of death from all causes and the lowest risk of cardiovasculardeaths!9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_9] And in athletic performance trials performedat Baylor University, athletes who supplemented with AA not only improved theirperformance compared with those who took a placebo, but (spoiler alert) a markerfor inflammation that I follow, interleukin 16 (IL-16), went down significantly,not up!10 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_10] What a big, fat paradox. That evilarachidonic acid turns out to be a sweetheart!The omega-3s EPA and DHA do far more than quell inflammation. Several studiesshow that humans with the highest levels on the omega-3 index (the amount of EPAand DHA in your blood as measured over the previous two months) have the largestbrain size and the largest memory areas, the hippocampus, compared with thosewith the lowest levels.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_11] And, as you read earlier,my vegan patients generally don’t know that flaxseed oil, with its short-chainomega-3 fat, doesn’t convert to EPA and DHA. When I first see them, theynormally have horribly low omega-3 indexes unless they are taking algae-derivedDHA. How important is this? Consider the findings of a study from OxfordUniversity that looked at the learning ability of students supplemented withalgae-derived DHA or a placebo. Those who took the DHA exhibited improvedlearning and behavior, and students afflicted with ADHD saw an improvement intheir symptoms as well.12 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_12] Omega-3 supplements havealso been shown to reduce disruptive behavior in healthy children.13[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_13]So long live fish oil, algae-derived DHA, and arachidonic acid! And where canyou get both long-chain omega-3s and omega-6s? Shellfish are probably the bestchoice, while egg yolk contains plenty of arachidonic acid alone. But there areplenty more interesting fats and oils. Here are some of my favorites.PERILLA SEED OILThis little-known oil is derived from the perilla plant, which is in the samefamily as mint and basil. For centuries, people in China have used perilla seedoil to help ease colds and coughs and prevent the flu. And it’s the most popularoil in Korea. But it’s also wonderful when it comes to maintaining a healthybody as you age, as it supports both joint and heart health. It’s a prettysignificant plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids, making it a good optionfor vegetarians who need to increase their omega-3 intake. Like flaxseeds, it’sparticularly rich in the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which benefits yourcardiovascular system, as well as rosmarinic acid, which has antibacterial,antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. As you will learn,this may be the secret of brain health for the folks in Acciaroli, Italy.Perilla oil works great as the fat in stir-fries, eggs, or Miracle Noodle brandpasta (made of konjac plant fiber) or even used in a salad dressing. And for asuper aromatic twist on pesto, try including it in your recipe, combined witholive oil.MCT OILMCT stands for “medium-chain triglycerides”; MCT oil can be turned into ketonesby your liver. As you read earlier, ketones are normally enzymaticallymanufactured from stored fat once your sugar supplies start running low. So atnight when you’re not eating, the cells in your brain and the rest of your bodymake use of the energy from ketones to fuel mitochondria. MCT oil is sometimescalled liquid coconut oil because it remains liquid even at cold temperatures,unlike coconut oil, which becomes a solid. For the most part, MCTs are burned asfuel, instead of being converted to fat.OLIVE OILAs you read earlier, olive oil is a delivery system for polyphenols andtherefore is a miracle drug for longevity. I strive to consume a liter a week aspeople in so many of the Blue Zones do, and I encourage you to do the same!Moreover, olive oil has been shown to increase a type of cholesterol calledapolipoprotein A-IV, which is fundamental in preventing platelets from clumpingafter eating a meal or in the early morning, when heart attacks are more likelyto occur.Other good fat sources include: * Macadamia nut oil * Walnut oil * Avocado oil * Thrive algae oil, a great cooking oil * Citrus-flavored cod-liver oil * Coconut oil. Unless you carry the APOE4 genotype, don’t buy into the warnings about coconut oil. The Kitavans, whose diet consists of 30 percent coconut oil and who don’t have heart disease or strokes, apparently haven’t gotten the message about how dangerous it is.DAIRY ALTERNATIVESAs you know, most conventional dairy products are highly inflammatory becausethey contain casein A1, a type of dairy protein that stimulates inflammation.Luckily, there are plenty of options that are far better for your gut buddiesand are just as satisfying for you.GOAT CHEESE/YOGURT/BUTTERLet me be clear: there is no need for human beings to drink milk from anotheranimal to support or benefit health. You or your child is not a baby cow, kid(baby goat), lamb, or water buffalo. These milks are designed to make therespective baby animal grow quickly to lessen the chance of predation. Allcontain impressive amounts of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which, asyou learned previously, promotes not only growth but also cancer and aging. Andall contain milk sugars such as lactose, which, after all, is a sugar. By nowyou know what they do.Goat or sheep cheese, though made from goat or sheep milk, lacks IGF-1, awater-soluble portion of milk, as well as the sugars, which are discarded orused up in the process of fermentation. If you want animal protein in yourcheeses, these are your best options. On the other hand, coconut yogurt lacksanimal protein as well as IGF-1 and may be your best yogurt choice.COCONUT MILK AND YOGURTAll right, coconut milk isn’t really milk. And it’s not the water that pours outof the coconut when you crack it open, either, as many people think. That stuffis pure sugar, folks! Rather, coconut milk is what you get when you blend andstrain the meat of the coconut. Among the many benefits of coconut milk is thefact that it’s full of a really good-for-you fat called lauric acid. Ipersonally love the natural sweetness and creamy richness of coconut milk. Thereare also great coconut yogurts on the market that are worth a try. But pleaseuse only unsweetened coconut milk or yogurt. If you see sugar on the label ofunsweetened coconut yogurt, not to worry. Since coconut meat has virtually nosugar, sugar is added to make coconut yogurt because the bacteria that makeyogurt have to have sugars to ferment. The bacteria eat the added sugars, sothey are all gone by the time you have the finished product in your hand.GHEEGhee is clarified butter, meaning that the butter has been melted so theproteins and fats separate by density. Once the butter is simmered, anyimpurities are skimmed off the top. Next, the liquid fat is retained, while thesolid residue, which consists of the casein and a little bit of whey proteinthat settles on the bottom, is discarded (including any casein A1, which meansyou can safely eat ghee even from casein A1 cows). Ghee is a staple of SouthAsian and Indian cuisines, as it can be stored without refrigeration and won’tgo rancid.MILLET IS NOT JUST FOR THE BIRDSThough most grains are inflammatory and aging thanks to their high levels oflectins, millet is a notable exception. It’s the key seed in birdseed, but it’snot just for the birds. Millet is a kind of seeded grass, and its manyvariations are actually grown all over the globe. Millet is lectin free and hasbeen getting a lot of attention lately because those with celiac disease havebeen gravitating toward it when looking for gluten-free options. It is also richin magnesium and potassium and high in fiber. But the best thing about millet isthat it can work wonders for your gut. Your gut buddies love its fiber becauseit allows them to better digest the foods you eat and retain their nutrients. Asyou well know if you’ve been reading carefully, you are not what you eat; youare what your gut buddies digest—and millet helps them do exactly that!COFFEE FRUITI have some very good news: your daily coffee habit may actually help you livelonger. In addition to pepping you up, coffee consumption is associated with areduced risk of death. Not a fan of coffee? No problem—you can get the samebenefit from coffee fruit, which is the fruit from which coffee beans are pulled(like cherry pits from a cherry). Believe it or not, this fruit grows on aflowering, bushy green plant. When the fruit is ready to be picked, it is a richburgundy color (though some less common varieties are actually yellow or green).The fruit of the coffee bean—known simply as coffee fruit—has a taut skin, butonce you break through it, you find a sweet, delicious, gummy pulp with a sortof herby or vaguely floral melon taste. It’s light and delicious and can keepyou young in important ways.For starters, coffee fruit is packed with antioxidants and polyphenols that helpboost your immune system, assist in protecting your body against free-radicaldamage, and fight inflammation. But it also has loads of flavonoids, plantchemicals that are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatories in their ownright. Flavonoids also promote the production of nitric oxide, a natural gasproduced in your body that communicates between cells. In particular, nitricacid tells your blood vessels to relax (dilate) so that blood can flow throughthem more freely. Of course, as we age and inflammation takes its toll, ourblood vessels tend to constrict more and more. So the flavonoids and nitric acidin coffee fruit help keep your blood vessels flexible and young.Coffee fruit also supports better cognitive function by boosting brain-derivedneurotrophic factor (BDNF), which, as you read earlier, helps your brain grownew neurons.14 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_14] Maybe that’s why you feel so muchsharper and more alert after drinking a cup of coffee! Unfortunately, raw coffeefruit is incredibly hard to find unless you live on a coffee farm. But the driedform is easy to find in supplements. Can’t find coffee fruit? Then stick withcoffee, which has most of the same benefits.EXTRA-DARK CHOCOLATEWho doesn’t love chocolate? Not your gut buddies, that’s for sure! They want youto eat chocolate every single day, so go ahead and indulge in an ounce ofextra-dark chocolate. Not only will you get to eat something satisfying anddecadent, but you’ll also be doing something great for your health. Chocolatecontains antioxidants and flavonoids, both of which have powerfulanti-inflammatory properties. But the real benefits lie in plant-derived cacao,which is the main ingredient in most commercial chocolate.The flavonols in cacao can provide a boost to brain health, and over time,consuming flavonol-rich chocolate can protect the brain. In one study, peoplewho ate small amounts of dark chocolate for a period of three months had bettermemory, processing speed, and attentiveness than did a control group. Otherresearch has shown a notable improvement in memory retention and new learning inelderly adults after consuming these flavonols. This is believed to be tied toincreased blood flow to the cerebral cortex, the brain structure that is mostaffected by aging. Simply put, the part of the brain that deteriorates the mostwith aging gets more blood flow when you eat chocolate, preventing thisdeterioration from happening.15 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_15] Pretty sweet (punintended), right?But before you grab that candy bar in the checkout line, remember, milkchocolate has no health benefits—it’s mostly sugar. Look instead for chocolatethat’s at least 72% cacao. The darker the chocolate, the better. And it doesn’ttake much to do the job. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),the recommended daily amount of cocoa consumption is 200 milligrams (about .007ounce) for maximum benefits. So keep your chocolate consumption to about anounce a day (a couple of small squares in a standard bar) for maximum healthbenefits. I personally prefer 90% or greater chocolate. And avoid dutched oralkali chocolate products; the dutching process destroys the health-promotingpolyphenols in chocolate.GREEN TEAMy favorite hot beverage, green tea, improves the symptoms and reduces thepathology of autoimmune disease. It does this by suppressing the proliferationof autoimmune T cells (the cops in your inner condo) and their inflammatorycytokines.16 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_16] I drink about five cups of green andmint teas a day and recommend that you do the same to keep inflammation at baywhether you are suffering from an autoimmune condition or not.For an extra longevity kick, try organic pu-erh tea. This fermented tea has beenshown to reduce the oxidation of lipids.17 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_17] Itspolyphenols also help lower iron levels. No, you won’t get “iron-poor blood.” Asyou read earlier, iron is one of the signature aging-promoting compounds.18[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_18] We literally rust out if our iron level is on thehigh side.19 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_19] And you already know that blood donorslive longer than nondonors do. Last, pu-erh tea promotes the growth ofAkkermansia muciniphila, and who doesn’t want more of them around? So we’ve got coffee, tea, and chocolate, as well as delicious foods such asavocado, olive oil, coconut, tubers, mushrooms, raspberries, blackberries, figs,and pomegranates. And you thought your gut buddies didn’t have good taste infood! It turns out that it is remarkably easy to feed your gut buddies whilestill enjoying your meals. Just make sure not to inadvertently feed the bad guysalong the way.GUT-DESTROYING BAD BUG FAVORITESThough I generally like to avoid speaking in absolutes, the foods that followare the main sources of nutrition for the bad bugs in your gut and should beavoided as much as possible. If you slip up and consume any of them, it’s okay;just refocus on feeding your gut buddies so they’ll proliferate and drive outthe bad bugs. Then come back to this list for a reminder of which foods are yourbad bugs’ favorites and therefore the worst ones for your longevity.SIMPLE SUGARS AND STARCHESMy apologies, but then again, you probably already knew this was coming. Whetherit’s glucose, fructose, or sucrose, any type of simple sugar is the number onefood of choice for bad bugs everywhere. And yes, that includes the sugar infruit (which is fructose). As you now know, we were never meant to consume fruityear-round. Before globalization, sweet flavors were readily available onlyduring the summer and fall, when humans needed to store fat by gaining weight byeating fruits in preparation for the winter period of regression. But now we areliving in an endless summer, and fruit, sweet treats, and real or fake sugarsare available around the clock. This is a driving factor of the obesityepidemic, which, of course, if you’ve been following along so far, is reallybeing driven by bad gut bugs.The bad bugs love sugar, and remember, so do cancer cells. So as painful as itmay be to begin with, cutting down on sugar is the best thing you can do todrive out bad bugs and help your gut buddies win the war. In addition to tablesugar, sweets, and other obvious forms of sugar, avoid the following fruits thatare highest in sugar, especially when they are not in season.GRAPESGrapes are an easy snack, and I loved them as a kid. In fact, most kids lovethem. Do you know why? Because they’re essentially tiny sugar bombs. A cup offresh grapes has around 23 grams of sugar. That’s 6 teaspoons of sugar. It’sdessert, not a healthy snack! However, when fermented into wine or vinegar,grapes are amazing for you. They’re a high-polyphenol food, and the fermentationprocess removes the sugar, making them much safer. So enjoy plenty of balsamicvinegar and moderate amounts of red wine—just skip whole grapes! But let meissue my famous proviso again: if you don’t already drink alcohol, don’t start!MANGOESOf course, a mango can vary in size, but according to the USDA, an average mangohas up to a whopping 46 grams of sugar (that’s 12 teaspoons). Mangoes are fullof all three kinds of sugar: glucose, fructose, and even sucrose. And as a mangoripens, all three types of sugar increase. This is why fresh mangoes are sodelicious and so prized by the bad bugs in your gut. But unripe mangoes are pureheaven to your gut buddies, as they are pure oligosaccharides. I eat unripemango salads regularly, and they are delicious.RIPE BANANASBefore a banana ripens, it is made mostly of resistant starch. In fact, as youread earlier, green bananas are made up of almost 80 percent resistant starch.But once the banana ripens, this starch gets converted into sugars—so much sugarthat a “serving size” is actually half of a large banana. Who eats just half abanana? And you’ll find sucrose, fructose, and glucose in a ripe banana. So stayaway and opt for unripe green bananas instead. I promise that not only will youget used to them, but your gut bugs will thank you for the gift that keeps ongiving.LYCHEESThese little guys have a sweet, floral scent and a tart taste. They’re sometimesserved with Asian-inspired meals. They’ll fool you because they don’t seem toosweet, but they’re chock full of sugar—about 29 grams, or 7 teaspoons, per cup.If you haven’t tried lychees yet, don’t start now.APPLESYou’ve been told since you were a kid that “an apple a day keeps the doctoraway.” But did you know that one medium apple contains 19 grams (5 teaspoons) ofsugar? So the saying really should be “An apple a day keeps the gut buddiesaway.” Now, apples are also really high in soluble fiber, so they’re not acomplete no-go. But stick to in-season (that means August through November)apples, and think of them as a special treat, not a daily snack.PINEAPPLEI’ve always felt that pineapples taste too sugary. And with 16 grams (4teaspoons) of sugar in every cup, you can bet that I avoid them at all costs.You should, too.PEARSFinally, a medium-ripe pear contains about 17 grams of sugar. But, great news,crispy pears such as Anjou and unripe Bartlett are full of resistant starches,so please enjoy them! And when that fancy box of pears arrives for the holidays,eat them just before they ripen, and consider them a gift for your gut buddies.SUGAR SUBSTITUTESAs you read earlier, sugar substitutes such as sucralose, saccharin, andaspartame are just as bad for your gut health as actual sugar, if not worse.They alter the gut microbiome, encouraging bad bugs to take over!20[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_20] And a recent study showed that consuming sucralose,known as Splenda, promoted higher blood glucose and insulin levels on a glucosetolerance test in humans than did drinking water.21 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_21]Moreover, despite what the government has told you, sucralose is not inert andis converted into toxic compounds that may persist in you for weeks.22[Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_22]Artificial sweeteners also promote weight gain. This is because when a sweetsubstance attaches to your tongue, your receptors taste sweetness. Then yourtongue’s nerves spring into action. They tell the pleasure receptors in yourbrain’s reward center to get more of this amazing sugary food. Why? Becauseyou’ll need it to store fat in anticipation when the season changes and thereisn’t any food around.Artificial sugar is designed to send the same pleasure signal to your brain asreal sugar does. But when the calories from real sugar don’t make it to yourbloodstream (because you never ingested glucose to begin with), your brain feelscheated and gets mad that the sugar it was promised never arrives. So what doesit do? It tells your body to go back and get more sugar. That’s why I wasaddicted to eight Diet Cokes a day while still being obese! Stop frustratingyour brain and your gut buddies by consuming artificial sugars!CONVENTIONAL DAIRY PRODUCTSGot milk? I hope not. You already know about the dangers of casein A1, which canspark autoimmune attacks. These reactions, of course, get worse the more cowmilk, cow cheese, and cow ice cream you ingest. In fact, most people whocomplain of lactose intolerance—and all the pain, discomfort, and embarrassingsymptoms that come with it—are actually struggling with casein A1 intolerance.But don’t be dismayed. There are a number of herds of cows (as well as goats,sheep, and buffalos) that make a different protein—casein A2—which is muchbetter for you. When it comes to dairy products, it’s simply a matter ofchoosing the right type of protein from the right type of animal. I’ve beendelighted to see that since the publication of The Plant Paradox, casein A2products have become widely available. Look out for them and go back to enjoyingcertain dairy products without destroying your health.Casein A2 is present in the milk of goat, sheep, and water buffalo and is foundin imported cheeses from France, Italy, and Switzerland. There are even goat,sheep, and water buffalo butters, which have a translucent white color becausegoats, sheep, and buffalos transform the copper-colored beta-carotene in whatthey eat into colorless vitamin A, while cows skip that step.Have you ever tasted buffalo mozzarella, otherwise known as mozzarella dibufala? While the vast majority comes from the Naples region of Italy, a newmanufacturer makes it from the milk of grass-fed water buffalo in Uruguay,imported to the United States as Buf. Look for it in Whole Foods, or visit itswebsite to find a local merchant. Buffalo mozzarella has a creaminess that isunparalleled.BAD FATSThough fat in and of itself is not bad, there are certain fat sources thatshould be avoided for the sake of your longevity. They include the following.SATURATED FATSMany of my friends in the paleo and ketogenic communities laud the healthbenefits of saturated fats. But they are sadly overlooking a major problem withthese fats: those sneaky LPSs, the fragments of bacteria that are constantlybeing produced as bacteria divide and die in your gut, travel through your gutwall and out into the body by riding on and hiding in saturated fats. Then theyare transported directly to the hunger center in your brain, the hypothalamus.There, the resulting inflammation sparks hunger. This is why folks on the paleodiet are often sidelined by hunger. So say good-bye to saturated fats and theLPSs that come with them!PEANUT OILWhen my colleagues at the American Heart Association looked at the effects ofdifferent types of fat on the health of arteries (which are critical to healthyheart function), they found that peanut oil led to the most widespread andadvanced atherosclerosis and the most severe coronary narrowing. Of course, weknow that this is because peanut oil is full of lectins, which leads to theautoimmune attack on the arteries.23 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_20_23]For a full list of fats to avoid, see chapter 9[Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#bh4-L5]. But for now, here is a short list ofthe most damaging fats that cause inflammation and allow bad bugs to take over. * Grape seed oil * Corn oil * Cottonseed oil * Safflower oil * Sunflower oil * Partially hydrogenated vegetable or canola oilSo in the end, the news isn’t that bad after all. You can avoid simple sugars,overly sweet fruits, artificial sweeteners, conventional dairy products, and badfats for the sake of your gut buddies, can’t you? Just a few more tweaks to yourdaily habits, and your gut buddies will be relaxing in the comfort of theirnewly renovated luxury suite."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9THE LONGEVITY PARADOX MEAL PLAN [nav.xhtml#nch14]As you read earlier, I believe that one of the best books on longevity everwritten was published in the 1500s. At the age of 40, the author, Luigi Cornaro,was in poor health, which his physicians attributed to his excessive eating anddrinking. He began to adhere to a self-designed diet that we would now describeas calorie restricted, which he maintained well into his old age. In fact, onone occasion when his friends and family insisted that he increase his calorieintake, he described in vivid detail how much worse he felt on that regimen. Hethen returned to his usual style of eating. Ultimately he died a young man atthe ripe old age of 102.Cornaro began writing How to Live 100 Years, or Discourses on the Sober Life(subtitled The Sure and Certain Method of Attaining a Long and Healthful Life)when he was in his eighties and added a new chapter as he reached each five- orten-year milestone thereafter. In his book, he rejected the conventional wisdomthat we are meant to spend our later years in a state of decline. He wrote:> And now some sensual and unreasonable individuals pretend that the existence> of a man after he passes the age of 65 cannot be termed a living one, but a> dead one. I will plainly demonstrate that they are mistaken, for I have a> desire that all men should attain my age, which is the most beautiful period> of life.I couldn’t have said it better myself. But don’t take my word or his for it. A2018 study comparing adults aged 60 to 90 to those aged 18 to 36 showed that thefeeling of being in control of their lives enabled the older group to feel andact similarly to the younger group.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_1] This is what Iwant for you as well: to attain old age and enjoy it as the most beautifulperiod of your life. In our culture we have a tradition of saying that “youth iswasted on the young”—meaning that the physical vitality of youth is wasted whenwe have less wisdom and experience to direct our energy and enjoy our lives.But, as I hope you have seen by now, it doesn’t have to be that way.Now, it’s no coincidence that Luigi Cornaro reached this robust state of healthafter dramatically cutting his food intake. On the Longevity Paradox program,you, too, will plan periods of calorie restriction, but you’ll do itintermittently and without suffering. Let’s take it one month at a time. Eachmonth, your days will be broken down as follows: * Fast-Mimicking Days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah1-L4] Five consecutive days a month, you will eliminate animal protein and limit calories to 900 a day to mimic the benefits of a whole month of full-time calorie restriction. * Free Days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4] On most days, you will eat as much as you like of your gut buddies’ favorite Longevity Paradox foods. * Brain-Wash Days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah4-L4] Once or twice a week, you will skip dinner or eat it very early to make sure your brain is scrubbed completely clean while you sleep. * Optional Calorie Restriction Days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah5-L4] If you choose, you will consume only 600 calories a day once or twice a week to get extra longevity benefits. This can even be done on brain-wash days for a double benefit. * Optional Intensive Care Cleanse [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah6-L4] If you are suffering from degenerative problems or want to kick-start the process, this program, which includes more fasting and brain-wash days, will give your mitochondrial function an extra boost.Now let’s break down each of these components and take a detailed look at howand what you’ll be eating all month long.FAST-MIMICKING DAYSYou now know how important calorie restriction is for your health and longevity.The great news is that you can restrict calories for only five consecutive daysout of the month and still reap the benefits of an entire month of calorierestriction. That’s right. My friend and colleague Valter Longo, head of theDavis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California, has shownthat a monthly five-day modified vegan fast gives you the samelongevity-boosting results as a month of a traditional calorie-restricted dietdoes.2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_2]I strongly recommend that you begin the Longevity Paradox program by doing fivefast-mimicking days in a row. Not only will you get the same benefits as if youhad restricted your calorie intake for the whole month, but you willdramatically change the makeup of your gut bacteria in those five days, drivingout the bad bugs and nourishing your gut buddies. In fact, research by Dr. Longoand by researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, confirms that afast-mimicking diet changes the types of bacteria in your gut for the better.3[Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_3] In a study conducted by researchers at the Knight Labat the University of Colorado, participants who followed just a three-daycleanse saw dramatic shifts in their microbiome, including increased levels ofour good friend Akkermansia! And once your gut buddies are in good shape, theywill make it much easier for you to follow the rest of the program.Please don’t worry that you will starve to death by cutting calories for a fewdays. Humans can easily go without food for two months and longer if water isavailable.4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_4] If you are overweight or obese, haveinsulin resistance or an elevated fasting insulin level, or are on insulininjections, I would advise you to check out the advice in chapter 10[Chapter_10_The_Longevity_.xhtml] of The Plant Paradox, which will guide you inmaking the transition from insulin resistance to insulin sensitivity and helpyou start using ketones as fuel more quickly and easily. If you do find yourselfgetting hungry and really needing something more, feel free to have about atablespoon of MCT oil up to three times a day to ward off the “low-carb flu.” Asyou grow more insulin sensitive and your gut buddies take over and startrenovating, you will be able to complete these five days easily without hungerbecoming an issue.So what will you be eating during these five days? Actually, the things youwon’t be eating are far more important, so let’s start there.FOODS TO AVOID * All dairy products * All grains and pseudograins * All fruit, including all seeded vegetables, which are technically fruits * All sugar sources * Unapproved seeds * Eggs * Soy products * Nightshade plants (eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes) * Corn, soy, canola, and other vegetable oils * Meat, chicken, and all other animal products * All other foods on the “Gut-Destroying Bad Bug Favorites” list [Chapter_8_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4]FOODS TO INCLUDEAnd what can you eat? Your gut buddies’ favorites, of course, which include thefollowing.VEGETABLESYou can eat as much as you’d like of all the following vegetables, either cookedor raw. If you have irritable bowel syndrome, SIBO, diarrhea, or another gutissue, limit your consumption of raw veggies and cook the rest of the things youeat thoroughly. All vegetables should be organic and can be purchased eitherfresh or frozen. If fresh, they should be in season and grown locally withsustainable farming practices, if at all possible. * Cruciferous vegetables: Bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Swiss chard, any color and type of cabbage, cauliflower, kale, mustard greens, collard greens, rapini, kohlrabi, watercress, mizuna, arugula * Greens of all kinds: Belgian endive, all kinds of lettuce, spinach, dandelion greens, chicory * Treviso, radicchio * Artichokes * Asparagus * Celery * Fennel * Radishes and other root vegetables such as yams, taro root, jicama, yucca, cassava, turnips, rutabagas, horseradish * Fresh herbs: Mint, parsley, sage, basil, and cilantro, plus garlic and all kinds of onions, including leeks and chives * Ocean vegetables: Kelp and seaweed, including sheets of noriPROTEINFor these five days, you are going to go vegan. That means no eggs, meat,chicken, or dairy products of any kind. Do not worry that you will becomeprotein deficient! Remember, you are probably eating too much protein right now,and your body recycles the protein that is already present. Eliminating animalproducts for five days gives your body a rest from digesting all that proteinand allows it to become an eco-friendly resort for your gut buddies! Sources ofplant-based protein that you can eat during these five days (in quantities ofeight ounces a day or less) include but do not have to include: * Tempeh (fermented soy, without grains) * Hemp tofu and hemp seeds * Pressure-cooked legumes such as lentils and beans * Hilary’s Millet Cakes * Approved nuts and seedsRemember, your great-ape cousins and your ancestors got plenty of protein byeating leaves, and you can as well.FATS AND OILSAcceptable vegetable fat sources for these five days include: * Avocado—feel free to have a whole one each day * First-cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil * Olives of any kind * Nuts: Walnuts, macadamia nuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, pine nuts, Marcona almonds, blanched almond flour * Avocado oil * Coconut oil * Macadamia nut oil * MCT oil * Perilla oil * Sesame seed oil * Walnut oil * Hemp seed oil * Flaxseed oilCONDIMENTS AND SEASONINGSBecause of their sugar content (not to mention other harmful ingredients), avoidall commercially prepared salad dressings and sauces. Instead, use as much asyou like of the following. * Fresh lemon juice * Vinegars * Mustard * Freshly ground black pepper * Iodized sea salt * Your favorite herbs and spices, minus red chili pepper flakesBEVERAGESObviously, you will avoid all sodas (including diet soda), sports drinks,lemonade, and other commercially prepared beverages. Instead, enjoy at leasteight cups of tap or filtered water a day, as well as: * San Pellegrino or other Italian sparkling mineral water (or Acqua Panna, a still mineral water) * As much tea as you’d like—green, black, or herbal * Regular and/or decaffeinated coffee (black or with unsweetened almond, hemp, or coconut milk) * Stevia extract (preferably SweetLeaf), Just Like Sugar (inulin), or monk fruit to sweeten your tea or coffee, if you likeI put this program together with my good friend Irina Skoeries, who also did theThree-Day Kick-Start Cleanse of The Plant Paradox, with rigorous standards tomake sure you will get the right number of calories and amount of protein oneach day of the “fast.” Using the following meal plan, you will duplicate theeffects of a month of calorie restriction while stimulating stem cellregeneration and strengthening your gut wall.Day 1 * Breakfast Green Smoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Lunch Arugula Salad with Hemp Tofu, Grain-Free Tempeh, or Cauliflower “Steak” and Lemon Vinaigrette [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#arugsal] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Dinner Cabbage-Kale Sauté with Grain-Free Tempeh and Avocado [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#cabkale]Day 2 * Breakfast Green Smoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Lunch Romaine Salad with Avocado, Cilantro Pesto, and Grain-Free Tempeh [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#romsal] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Dinner Lemony Brussels Sprouts, Kale, and Onions with Cabbage “Steak” [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#lembrus]Day 3 * Breakfast Green Smoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Lunch Hemp Tofu-Arugula-Avocado Seaweed Wrap with Cilantro Dipping Sauce [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#hemptofu] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Dinner Roasted Broccoli with Cauliflower “Rice” and Sautéed Onions [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#roastbroc]Day 4 * Breakfast Green Smoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Lunch Longevity Leek Soup [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#lls] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Dinner Hemp Tofu-Arugula-Avocado Seaweed Wrap with Cilantro Dipping Sauce [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#hemptofu]Day 5 * Breakfast Green Smoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Lunch Creamy Cauliflower Parmesan Soup [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#CCPS] * Snack Romaine Lettuce Boats Filled with Guacamole [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#rlbwg] * Dinner Cauliflower “Fried Rice” [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#cauli]FREE DAYSAfter you finish your five-day “fast,” you can begin the free days portion ofthe plan and eat as much as you’d like of your gut buddies’ favorite foods whileyou continue eliminating the foods that nurture bad bugs. If you go from thefive-day “fast” back to your old habits, particularly sugar consumption, badbugs can regrow quickly, undoing much of the progress you made.On free days, you do not have to limit calories, but you should be mindful ofyour protein intake. As you read earlier, Dr. Valter Longo and I agree that youneed only 0.37 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight. Therefore, you caneasily meet your protein needs for an entire day with a scoop of whey proteinpowder, a couple of eggs, one protein bar, or about three ounces of pasturedchicken or wild fish.To make it simple, on your free days, I want you to focus on eating, at maximum,one roughly three-ounce serving of protein. You choose whether that means eggsat breakfast, a salad with tuna at lunch, or a small serving of wild fish orshellfish with dinner. Please start to view grass-fed and -finished beef as anoccasional treat rather than as a diet mainstay. At your other meals, you’ll getplenty of protein from veggies, nuts, mushrooms, and pressure-cooked lentils andby recycling the mucus in your gut.

Mexican Chocolate “Rice” Pudding [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#mexchoc]BRAIN-WASH DAYSAs you read earlier, your body needs to finish digesting your last meal at leastfour hours before you go to sleep in order for your glymphatic system tothoroughly wash out your brain at night. This is how you can avoid the toxicbuildup of amyloid in the brain that can lead to degenerative disease. To get athorough brain wash, I recommend that you skip dinner once a week if you are ingood health, more often if you are already suffering from a degenerativedisease. On a brain-wash day, you will simply eat as if it were any other freeday and then stop eating after lunch. Simple. You can even condense all threemeals into the first half of the day if you wish, eating your last meal no laterthan 4:00 p.m.This will also allow you to take advantage of the benefits of intermittentfasting. In a new study on mice at the National Institutes of Health, the micethat went the longest between meals had the greatest longevity outcomes nomatter what they actually ate.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_5] So for the bestresults, don’t just skip dinner but also make sure that eighteen hours passbefore your next meal. In fact, limiting your eating to a six-hour window dailystimulates autophagy, your cells’ recycling program.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_6]When autophagy occurs at the intestinal lining, stronger, healthier cellsreinforce the gut barrier.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_7] So by just skippingdinner and delaying your breakfast (break-fast, get it?) you get a cleaned-outbrain, younger cells, and a renewed gut barrier. That’s certainly worth missingone meal a week!OPTIONAL CALORIE RESTRICTION DAYSIf you want to go all in on calorie restriction, I recommend my version of the5:2 diet. On this plan, you break your week up into five free days[Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4] and two calorie restriction days whenyou eat 600 calories per day. If you do the math (don’t bother, I did it foryou), this equates to cutting 540 calories every day for a week, giving you thebenefits of full-time calorie restriction and weight loss of a pound a week, ahealthy and safe rate at which to lose weight.Though your gut buddies don’t care which days you choose for your calorierestriction days, I strongly advise doing it on Monday and Thursday. Why? OnMonday you are coming off the weekend, when it’s possible that you overindulged,so it’s a great time to cut back. Then you have two free days[Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4] before you arrive at Thursday, which isjust before the weekend—another great time to cut back. Of course, you canchange these days each week or however often you like to accommodate yourschedule.So what does 600 calories look like? There are approximately 600 calories inthree Quest bars or seven to eight hard-boiled eggs. In fact, the “egg diet”really works, as a recent human trial showed! I’m not kidding—several of mypatients successfully eat this way. Salads work really well on these days, butremember that one tablespoon of olive oil will cost you 120 calories. Or howabout the Drinking Man’s Diet? Seriously, that popular diet from the 1960s and’70s by Robert Cameron, whom I mentioned earlier, suggested drinkingthree-quarters of a bottle of red wine per day, a little bit more than our102-year-old friend Luigi Cornaro drank daily. And Cameron made it to age 98!Imagine what could have happened if he had cut back a trifle? Surprisingly,there are only about 525 calories in a full bottle of wine, so you could sip onthat bottle throughout the day and pair it with one hard-boiled egg for goodmeasure! (Just joking, but you get my point.)More practically, I recommend eating lots of raw and cooked veggies with alittle bit of olive oil and a small amount of a concentrated vegetable or nutprotein on these days to get maximum nutrition while benefiting from calorierestriction.OPTIONAL INTENSIVE CARE CLEANSEAs you read earlier, cancer cells and certain immune cells share a little-knownvulnerability: they cannot efficiently utilize fat as a fuel. Instead, they mustgo through a highly inefficient process known as sugar fermentation to deriveenergy. If you have been diagnosed with cancer or are suffering from an acuteautoimmune disease, Parkinson’s disease, or dementia, the intensive care cleanseprovides your mitochondria with the fuel they need while starving the cells thatare responsible for your condition. You can use this as a kick start to the restof the program as a three-day cleanse or stay on it for life if you find that ithelps your gut buddies and their sisters thrive.For this program, you’ll follow the list of your gut buddies’ favorite foodshere [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#bh3-L5] that you will eat on free days[Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4] with the following changes.Eliminate all fruits and seeded vegetables—their fructose is too tempting forcancer cells. Consume absolutely no fruit except for avocados, green bananas andplantains, green mangoes, and green papayas.Opt for medium-chain fatty acids such as MCT oil, coconut oil, or red palm oilor for the short-chain fatty acids in butter or ghee as oil/fat sources, butcontinue to use olive oil as your main source of fat. Think of other foods asfat delivery devices. Eat as much of these fats as you can.Eat macadamias as your preferred nuts, with smaller amounts of other nuts.You can still treat yourself to extra-dark chocolate, but be sure it contains atleast 90% cacao. Lindt makes a good 90% cacao chocolate bar that is widelyavailable, and as of this writing, Trader Joe’s carries a 100% cacao bar withcacao nibs called Montezuma’s (and no, there’s no revenge).Eat no more than 2 ounces of animal proteins—the size of a quarter of a deck ofcards—a day, preferably in the form of wild fish, shellfish, and mollusks. Ifyou have cancer, avoid animal protein completely, as certain amino acids inanimal protein fuel cancer cells.Egg yolks are virtually pure fat and one of two fats your brain needs tofunction properly. Try a four-yolk, one-whole-egg omelet cooked in coconut oilor ghee and filled with sliced avocado, mushrooms, and onions and sprinkled withturmeric and black pepper. Douse it with more ghee or macadamia oil, perillaoil, or olive oil before serving.Vegans can have half a Hass avocado with a douse of coconut or olive oil. Hempseeds are a good source of fat and plant protein and can be used in shakes orsprinkled on salads or veggies. Walnuts have the highest plant protein contentof the nut choices.8 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_21_8]Putting it all together, let’s take a look at what one month on the LongevityParadox program looks like.Week 1 * 5 fast-mimicking days followed by 2 free days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4]Weeks 2, 3, and 4 * 4 free days [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah2-L4], 2 calorie restriction days of your choice, and 1 brain-wash day [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah4-L4]; or * 6 free days and 1 brain-wash day; or * 5 free days and 2 brain-wash days; or * add as many days as you wish of the optional intensive care cleanse [Chapter_9_The_Longevity_P.xhtml#ah6-L4]It’s up to you to customize the program to suit your needs. If you are young andin good health, feel free to start slowly. This is a program that you can livewith, literally and figuratively. However, if you are already suffering fromdementia, type 2 diabetes, an autoimmune condition, or any other disease ofaging that you now know is actually the result of bad bugs ruling your innerkingdom, you may need to follow the protocol to the letter.Your life is literally in your hands—or, shall I say, in your mouth and gut. Butalthough your diet is the number one factor that will determine which type ofgut bugs are able to thrive in your body—and therefore how long you’llthrive—it’s not the only one. Your daily habits, such as the way you exercise,the temperature of your shower, and even those who you spend time with, all playa role in determining your life and health span. And that leads us to the nextphase of the Longevity Paradox program."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10THE LONGEVITY PARADOX LIFESTYLE PLAN [nav.xhtml#nch15]As you know, one reason calorie restriction is beneficial is that it temporarilystresses your cells, and a little bit of stress is a good thing: it sends asignal to your cells that they should prepare for an impending threat to yourand their survival. This forces them to toughen up and kills off any cells thatcan’t be strengthened and therefore aren’t likely to survive the onslaught. Itis one of the most beneficial things you can do to promote your health andlongevity.That’s why the next pillar of the Longevity Paradox program involves stressingyour cells not only through your diet but also through your lifestyle choices.As you begin this journey, it’s important to keep in mind that the more youstress your body, the more time you need to recover, or you risk stressingyourself too much and causing more harm than good. So getting plenty of sleepand taking time to relax or meditate are also essential components of thisprogram. Alternating between periods of stress and rejuvenation is another cyclethat will benefit your gut buddies and help you achieve a long health span.With this in mind, I’ve broken down the lifestyle program into two parts: first,the habits that will stress and strengthen your cells, and second, the habitsthat will allow them to recover. Together, these simple lifestyle modificationswill leave you—and your gut buddies—feeling better than ever.PART 1: CONQUER STRESSExercise is one of the most commonly practiced forms of hormesis. Every time youwork out, you create tiny tears in your muscles. When your muscles repairthemselves, they become stronger and bigger. And as you read earlier, your gutbuddies also benefit when you exercise and repay you by fixing up their home.They especially like it when you exercise against gravity because thisstresses—and therefore strengthens—more of your muscles.1[Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_1]If you are concerned that you’re not in great shape and can’t safely start aweight training protocol, have no fear. Jack LaLanne, “the Godfather of ModernFitness,” taught me that you need to do only two simple exercises to develop andmaintain strength. Those two exercises are squats (or any type of deep kneebends) and planks or push-ups. Both exercises work against gravity, and togetherthey stress every major muscle group in the body. Anyone at any fitness levelcan do them, and just a small investment of time will yield meaningful results.My five-minute exercise plan incorporates these movements and three othersyou’ll recognize for a complete, well-rounded workout that provides the amountof stress your muscles need to stay strong and prevent wasting, or loss ofmuscle mass with age. You have no excuse to avoid doing this. Start off bycompleting this circuit twice a day or whenever you feel the need to get up andget moving, especially if you spend a large portion of your day sitting. It willgive you an instant burst of energy while strengthening all the muscles—andcells—in your body.STEP 1: THE LONGEVITY PARADOX EXERCISE PLANFIRST MINUTE: JOG IN PLACEI like to call this the Standing Trot. This is not really a full jog; it’s atrot. Don’t overdo it. Remember, if you’re getting hot, it’s not a trot. Youwant to wake yourself up, not wear yourself out! Just do a nice, easy trot forone minute. If this is too much for you, an easy modification is to do itseated. Move your legs and arms as though you’re running while sitting uprightin a chair. If you feel silly while doing this, just keep going anyway. Talk tostrangers walking by your table at Starbucks. Have a chuckle about it if youneed to. Heck, I laugh at myself all the time (hey, watch those comments!), andI believe it keeps me young. In fact, I’ve become friendly with “the LaughingYogi,” who, you guessed it, laughs out loud during yoga and has taught me to doso as well.SECOND MINUTE: CLASSIC CRUNCHESIf your abs get stronger, you’ll stay young longer. A strong core is essentialto maintaining mobility and eliminating back pain. To do a crunch with properform, lie on your back with your spine straight and your knees bent, armspointed toward your feet, and focus on lifting your head and shoulders up usingyour abs, not your neck or your arms. Pull in your lower abdominals, around yourbelly button, and slowly peel your spine off the floor vertebra by vertebra;speed is not your friend here. You don’t need to sit all the way up. Just makesure you feel the engagement of your abdominal muscles as you lift. Repeat asmany times as you can, keeping good form, for one minute. If this bothers yourback, try a supported crunch instead. Just rest your calves on a chair or benchwith your knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Do your crunches in this position toease the pressure on your spine. Still too much strain on your neck? Do thecrunches the old-fashioned way: support your head with your hands, but don’tpull up with them.THIRD MINUTE: PLANKThis is one of Jack LaLanne’s favorites—and mine. Planks are great because theyengage all of your muscles at once, yet they don’t require any movement! To do aplank, simply get into the top of a “push-up” position and hold it for oneminute. Keep your back straight, your butt slightly high, your abs pulled in,and your hands directly below your shoulders with your arms straight. If this iseasy for you, simply do push-ups for that minute instead. But if it’s toodifficult for you at first, don’t worry; it is perfectly normal not to be ableto hold a plank for a full minute without stopping. Take a break whenever youneed to and then get back into position. Or if you need to take some weight off,lower your knees to the ground. Still too hard? Perform the plank resting onyour elbows with your forearms out front. Just make sure to keep your upper bodyand core engaged.FOURTH MINUTE: SQUATSNow we move on to another of Jack LaLanne’s favorites. To this day, I do squatsevery morning and every night while I’m brushing my teeth! I have nothing betterto do during this time, and this way I keep my gums healthy and strengthen mylower body and core at the same time.To do squats properly, stand with your feet parallel to each other a littlewider than hip width apart. Inhale, draw in your abdominal muscles, and slowlybend your knees while keeping your chest forward and your head lifted. Bend asdeeply as your mobility will allow, then return to a standing position byengaging your gluteal muscles. Do as many repetitions as you can in one minute,focusing on keeping your legs parallel and your abs engaged the whole time.Feeling unbalanced? Just hold on to a counter or the back of a chair with onehand.FIFTH MINUTE: MEDITATIONYou thought this was going to be another type of movement, didn’t you? Nope!You’re done moving, and it’s time to bring your heart rate back down, relax, andsweep away the mental clutter. Don’t be tempted to skip this step and move onwith your day. Remember, your gut buddies love to meditate, so treat them to oneminute (or more if you have time!) of complete relaxation.Start by either sitting up straight or lying on your back, and focus on inhalingdeeply through your nose and exhaling completely through your mouth. With eachexhalation, think about relaxing all of the muscles in your body. Try relaxingyour feet first, then your knees and thighs, then your back, then your arms andhands, then your neck—you get the idea. After just a minute, you’ll berefreshed, alert, and energized—and so will your gut buddies. And no, you don’tneed to let your mind go blank; that just adds to many people’s tensions!A Prescription to Play!Going outside and moving your body is so important that I often literally writemy patients a prescription to get a dog. Many of them have thanked me later,saying it was the best thing they’ve ever done. Dogs not only force you to getoutside and get walking, but they get dirty. Their paws get muddy, and theircoats pick up pollen spores and leaves. Many people see this as a negative atfirst, until I explain that exposure to the bacteria in dirt is good for theirgut buddies. In fact, research shows that people who live with dogs have farmore diverse microbiomes than do non–pet owners.2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_2] Andkids who have dogs have far fewer allergies than those who don’t. Talk aboutman’s best friend!Whether you have a dog or not, get outside as much as you can and get moving. Ilike to take a ten-minute walk after each meal. You don’t have to strainyourself. Simply move. Walk. Go outside and weed the garden or mow the lawn.Your body is designed to be active, not to sit for long periods of time. Ifpossible, take your daily walks up and down hills (against gravity) to stressmore muscles and reap even greater benefits.If and when you’re ready for more, I highly recommend another simple exercisethat anyone can do at any age—and I guarantee you’ll have a gigantic smile fromear to ear while doing it. It’s called rebounding, but it is really justbouncing on a minitrampoline. I got a rebounder at Target for less than thirtydollars, and I love bouncing on it. It’s easier on the joints than jogging—oreven walking—on a hard surface. Not to mention that it’s great for yourlymphatic system, which carries vital nutrients to all of your cells. My goodfriend and patient Tony Robbins bounces on his minirebounder just before hebounds onto the stage. It’s located right next to the stairs. No wonder he looks(and is) so energized!To get started, stand on your minitrampoline with your feet shoulder widthapart. Bend your knees and lightly bounce up and down. Do this for one minute.Rest for one minute. Repeat two more times. Easy! I do this once a week, and itmakes me feel like a kid. Feeling wobbly? Many rebounders come with a pole orhandle for balance purposes. So take this as your prescription to play—it willactually make you young again.HIIT FOR FUNAnother exercise option that provides big benefits for a small investment oftime is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT burns more fat for longerthan traditional exercise does. Plus, whereas traditional aerobic exercise canweaken the immune system, HIIT doesn’t have that effect. As little as tenminutes of HIIT three times a week can confer a variety of health benefits,especially for those who were previously inactive. So if you’ve been waiting foran excuse to start a new exercise routine, here it is. HIIT is also a highlyenjoyable form of exercise. In fact, research shows that it elicits greaterfeelings of happiness than traditional forms of moderate-intensity exercise dobecause it leads to greater neurotransmitter release.3[Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_3] And of course, as you know well by now, your gutbuddies are the ones producing the precursors to serotonin and other“happy-making” hormones, so it’s safe to say that they enjoy HIIT, too!On the Longevity Paradox program, I recommend doing a ten-minute HIIT routinethree times a week in addition to your five-minute daily circuit. You can chooseany form of exercise you prefer: walking, running, cycling, spinning, or justdoing jumping jacks. For thirty seconds or so, work as hard as you can, followedby roughly an equal amount of recovery time. As you get stronger, you mightextend your bursts of intensity to a minute. Just be sure to give yourselfadequate recovery afterward. Continue until your ten minutes are up, and you’llbe happier and healthier—and so will your gut buddies.STEP 2: COOK YOUR CELLS—JUST A LITTLEAs you read earlier, I first studied heat-shock proteins when performing heartsurgery. I needed to keep the heart from being injured during beating-heartsurgery by temporarily cutting off blood flow to certain regions of the heart inorder to perform the surgery, so I would clamp down a blood vessel for two orthree minutes at a time and then release it. My colleagues and I found that whenwe did this, the heart cells would produce heat-shock proteins to protect theheart against the stress of having no oxygen supply. Once the heat-shockproteins developed, we could reclamp the blood vessel—this time for ten minutesat a time without having to worry about damaging the heart, which could nowwithstand longer periods without blood flow because it was so well protected.This is a perfect example of hormesis in action. Your cells get the message thattough times are coming (in this case because of a lack of blood flow) and thatthey had better toughen up. So they develop heat-shock proteins as a means ofprotection. These proteins tell any cells that are not carrying their weight toself-destruct, leaving only healthy, fresh cells once the tide has turned andall is well again.But heat-shock proteins protect you against all kinds of threats, not just alack of blood flow. As their name implies, your cells produce these protectiveproteins when temporarily stressed by extreme temperatures. So once a week orso, try to spend some time in a sauna or a steam room, expose yourself to anear-infrared or red-light sauna, take a hot yoga class, or come visit me inPalm Springs in the summer!4 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_4] If these options aren’trealistic, simply take a nice hot bath. Recent studies have shown that a hotbath relieves mild depression better than antidepressants. To avoidoverstressing your cells, get into the bathtub when it’s fairly warm, and thenkeep letting out some of the water and adding more hot water. You’ll achieve thesame hormetic effects as long as you’re sweating.STEP 3: TOUGHEN UP FOR THE WINTERExposure to cold temperatures has a similar effect as heat exposure, signalingto your cells to take up a defensive posture to survive a long, brutal winter.Many hibernating animals survive near-freezing temperatures during the winter byproducing a protective compound when they are exposed to cold temperatures. Isthis why rodents that hibernate live on average twice as long as those thatdon’t? Or is it because hibernating rodents have a far lower metabolic rate,which, as you read earlier, promotes longevity? I suspect it’s a little bit ofboth. Exposure to cold temperatures also stimulates your gut buddies to producemore of two beneficial neurotransmitters, GABA and serotonin, both of which helpextend life span.5 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_5]To take advantage of these benefits, I recommend taking a daily “Scottishshower.” This may not sound like fun, but it will certainly wake you up in themorning and force your body to stay energized and activated throughout the day.To do so, start your shower with warm water as usual and then gradually cool thewater down. By the last couple of minutes of your shower, you should be runningnothing but cold water. I promise you’ll get used to this fairly quickly. Andjust think about how much money you’ll save on your hot water bill!If you’re still not convinced, think about the fact that your skin buddies alsolove a Scottish shower. Hot water strips out the nourishing oils they producefor your skin and hair. Cold water, on the other hand, leaves these importantoils intact. This gives you smooth, bright skin and full, shiny hair in additionto a boost in energy and a longer, healthier life. Still too extreme? Buy a coldvest—literally, a vest with removable cold packs—and wear it for a few hours aday. There are even ones that you can wear under a suit or dress.PART 2: REJUVENATEOkay, are you done being stressed? Good, then it’s time to move on to therejuvenating aspects of the Longevity Paradox program. After all, if you overdoit on the stress and don’t take time to recover, not only will you fail tobenefit from all that stress, but you’ll actually cause your body harm by notallowing the stressed cells to return to normal and repair the microdamage thathas been done—the exact opposite of what you want to achieve. So don’t skipthese important steps even if they feel unnecessary. They are an important partof your long-term health and happiness.STEP 1: PRIORITIZE SLEEPIt’s no secret that sleep is important for a long, healthy life, as my friendArianna Huffington so eloquently showed in her book The Sleep Revolution. Deepsleep is when your glymphatic system “washes” your brain, scrubbing it of junkand debris so it doesn’t build up an accumulation of the amyloid plaques thatcan eventually lead to Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. You’realready skipping dinner at least once a week in order to make sure you haveenough blood flowing to your brain as soon as you get to sleep in order tocomplete that important cleanse.But once a week is just a start. Your brain needs adequate sleep every night,not just on your brain-wash evenings. It turns out that losing just one night ofsleep results in amyloid increases of about 5 percent in the brain’s thalamusand hippocampus, the regions of the brain that are especially vulnerable todamage in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.6 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_6]Ouch! This suggests that chronic sleep deprivation may be a leading cause ofAlzheimer’s.If that’s not enough to get you to bed on time, how about this: lack of sleepwill also cause you to gain weight as you age. The two hormones that controlhunger and satiety, ghrelin and leptin, respectively, are very sensitive tosleep duration. When college students were put into a sleep lab and allowed tosleep for eight hours, the following morning they had high levels of leptin(which tells you that you’re full) and low levels of ghrelin (which tells you tokeep eating). The next night they were awakened after just six hours. This timetheir ghrelin levels were high and their leptin levels were low, making themhungrier and more difficult to feel sated.7 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_7] I canassure you from personal experience as a surgical resident with thirty-six hourson and twelve hours off for months at a time that getting very little sleepmakes you gain a lot of weight!This, of course, corresponds to the yearly cycle. The long days of summer, withtheir shorter nights, stimulate the body to eat and to start storing fat for theupcoming winter. To put it simply, when you get a lot of sleep, your body thinksit’s winter and that it should burn up all the fat that is stored on your body.But when you miss sleep, your body thinks it is summer and that it should startstoring fat to prepare for winter.This is another reason that hibernating animals live longer than ones that don’thibernate. They are living off of that stored fat as ketones, which burncleanly. Think of ketones as clean-burning natural gas, while proteins andsugars are dirty diesel fuel. With the former there’s no need for a catalyticconverter! You want your body to think it’s winter year-round so that it willkeep you strong, lean, and alive.Sunlight is, of course, one of the sources that signals to your body the time ofday and time of year. When your body is exposed to sunlight, key receptors inyour retinas are activated, which stimulates your gut buddies to producehormonal and chemical messengers that make you feel either sleepy or alert. So,for example, if it is dark out, your retinas pick up on the message that it isnighttime and send an alert for your body to create the neurotransmittermelatonin, which helps you sleep. This is commonly referred to as one of yourcircadian rhythms.Unfortunately, the blue spectrum in light stimulates the alertness and feedingcycle that your body associates with summer. With more hours of daylight duringthe summer months, it is time to stay up later and eat more food to store forthe coming winter. It’s not only the intensity of blue light but also itsduration that determines your seasonal patterns of sleeping, waking, and eating.We humans have special receptors in our eyes that process blue-spectrum light,which tells our bodies to wake up and be alert. Before screens and fluorescentlights took over the world, the sun was our only source of blue light. So formost of human existence, we saw blue-spectrum light only when the sun was outduring the daytime. The human body evolved to use this daytime blue-light sourceto set its circadian rhythm. But now, screens and lightbulbs emit huge amountsof blue light at any time of the day or night. This interferes with your gutbuddies and your circadian rhythm, which can in turn lead you to age morerapidly.In order to get the sleep your body needs, it’s important to reestablish yourcircadian rhythm and get back in sync with the natural ebb and flow of daylight.Here are some ways to do this. * Reduce your exposure to blue-spectrum light at night. Once the sun goes down, turn off all screens. It may be unrealistic to do this all the time, but try your best at least a few nights a week. Check out apps such as f.lux that reduce your computer screen’s amount of blue light the rest of the time. * Get a pair of blue light–blocking glasses and wear them after the sun normally goes down while you are at home reading, watching TV, or on your computer that you were supposed to shut down. (I’m watching you!) These glasses can protect your eyes from overexposure to blue light. In fact, did you know that blue light–blocking glasses were originally developed for NASA astronauts to use, since the sun’s rays are even stronger in space? If they work for astronauts, surely they can work for you. * Try taking time-released melatonin supplements to reset your body clock if it’s been thrown off. The pills usually come in 3- to 5-milligram doses—and that’s plenty. Time-released melatonin is particularly useful when it comes to adjusting from jet lag and resetting your sleep-wake cycle when your work schedule is inconsistent. * Keep a consistent sleep/wake rhythm. Go to bed at the same time each night, or at least as often as possible. Make sure you will sleep a full eight hours before you need to wake up. Remember, this is not a luxury; your brain, your body, and your gut buddies all depend on it. * Last, try to be consistent in your sleep schedule. Sleeping in on the weekend often doesn’t make up for time lost during the week. Want some help? I know I sound like a broken record, but get a dog! Believe me, it won’t let you sleep in and it usually gives you a signal when it’s bedtime.Now that you’ve recovered from all of that self-imposed stress, it’s time tomove on to the next part of the Longevity Paradox program, which I’d be willingto bet isn’t what you expect.STEP 2: KISS AND CONNECTThere is one thing the people in the long-lived Blue Zones have in common thatwe have not yet addressed, and that is that they all live in extremely tightlyknit communities. In fact, research shows that most centenarians, regardless oftheir culture or country of origin, have a strong social and spiritual supportsystem.This reminds me again of Edith (“Michelle”), the age-defying beauty you readabout earlier, who recently passed on while she was very young, right beforeturning 106. When she was a youthful 101-year-old, she fell in the bathroom andbroke her hip. I honestly thought that was going to be the end. There was aperiod of about six months when her decline was obvious. For the first time, shebecame forgetful and began showing signs of her age. But I underestimated her.Edith had a robust social network. She was always out and about with heradorable little Pomeranian. That dog got her back out onto her feet after thefall, and soon she was making plans to meet friends for lunch. Soon her socialcalendar was full of appointments, reasons to get out of bed, connections to bemade and nurtured. She enjoyed another five good years after that fall, hermental status recovered fully, and I believe that her strong network of socialand emotional support had a lot to do with that.The same principle is true for the long-lived Seventh-Day Adventists of LomaLinda. They live within a tight-knit community that provides both practical andspiritual support to all its members. We see the importance of community even inthe animal kingdom: naked mole rats work together to dig tunnels and find tubersto feed to their queen. They have the same fascinating social structure as bees,one that all other long-lived societies share, whether it’s based on a familystructure, a religion, or a village.Perhaps this is why so many of my male (and increasingly female) patientsimmediately see their health begin to decline as soon as they retire. They lacktheir daily workplace social structure and become isolated, which ages them. Inour culture, older folks tend to become isolated and depressed, but socialconnections are essential for good health. As a result, we are seeing anepidemic of loneliness that coincides with our decreasing health spans and lifespans. It might be tempting to dismiss this as coincidence or purely a mentalphenomenon, but it is actually, as you might suspect, tied very closely to thehealth of your gut buddies.Think about it: the more people you come into contact with, the more bacteriayou share—just like the dog that licks your face and spreads its bugs all overyou (I hope your colleagues and book club members don’t greet you that way, buthey, maybe they should! As I travel in France, Italy, and the rest of theMediterranean, home to the longest-living people on Earth, men and women kisseach other’s cheeks upon greeting). This idea also ties back to the study youread about earlier, which showed that people who live together often have thesame types of health problems—not because they share genes but because theyshare microbiomes—and it explains why people tend to become obese if their closecontacts are obese. It’s not merely because people choose friends who sharesimilar lifestyle habits—it’s because they share microbiomes with their friends,and their gut bugs play a huge role in influencing their weight.8[Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_8],9 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_9]Your chance of becoming obese increases by 57 percent if you have a friend whobecomes obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one siblingbecomes obese, the chance that the other will become obese increases by 40percent. If one spouse becomes obese, the likelihood that the other spouse willbecome obese increases by 37 percent. Notably, these effects are not seen amongimmediate neighbors. And the siblings do not become obese at the same timebecause they share the same genes; it’s because they share the same gut bugs.10[Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_10]It needs to be said: be careful with whom you share bacteria! Thankfully, ourgut buddies help us even with this, at least when it comes to selecting ourmates. There is now evidence to suggest that kissing, which is universal amonghumans and other great apes, is more than a chance to exchange bodily fluidspleasantly. In another case of “fact is stranger than fiction,” when we kissanother person, we are really sampling his or her bacterial mixture to see if itis compatible with our own.11 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_22_11] If it is, ourmicrobiome will tell us that it’s a match by stimulating the production offeel-good hormones that make us want to kiss him or her again. (I hear the themefrom The Twilight Zone playing whenever I think about this. I also think of allthe pickup lines you single readers now have at your disposal regardinginformation sharing and microbiome research back at your apartment.)So, what does this mean for you, especially if you’re already married? Get outthere and spread those germs around. Seriously! Join a group—any group—whetherit’s a book club, a workout group, or even Parents Who Refuse to Drink Alone ona Friday Night. Volunteer at a local organization that needs your help. Returnto your spiritual roots or explore new roots. And for goodness’ sake, get a dog,already!I’m tempted to say that humans are social creatures, but by now it’s clear thatit is more accurate to say that your gut buddies are the ones that really wantto be social and be exposed to new friends and acquaintances. Do them this favorwhile following the rest of the Longevity Paradox lifestyle plan, and they’llrepay you in spades. I guarantee it. I’ve seen in scores of patients that “superseniors” are motivated to be with others, act as a source of knowledge foryounger generations, and literally become the pillar of their families orcommunities. After all, what good is a long, healthy life if you can’t spend itwith the people you love? Human connection really seems to drive successfulaging—not to mention the motivation to stay alive and vibrant and make sure yourdog gets its walk twice a day!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11LONGEVITY PARADOX SUPPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS [nav.xhtml#nch16]THE MEANING OF “SUPPLEMENT”Many people still believe that there is a supplement magic bullet—in otherwords, that one or more supplements will somehow correct their ongoing relianceon the typical Western diet, as well as cause all their health issues tomagically reverse course and heal their bodies. Moreover, if you scan theInternet, you will find wild claims that taking one particular supplement willmake you immortal or almost. I can assure you that this is nonsense, and I saythat because I have witnessed this misconception in my patients’ blood work fartoo many times over the last eighteen years. However, if you embark on theLongevity Paradox program, many of the supplements that follow can and willprovide measurable benefits. I have presented studies on such benefits atnational and international medical conferences. Remember, true to their name,supplements enhance the results of the Longevity Paradox program—but they arenot shortcuts.Several of my colleagues in longevity take the prescription drug metformin[Chapter_2_Protect_and_Def.xhtml#metformin] and some at least talk about and maysecretly take the organ transplant antirejection drug rapamycin (Sirolimus), thelatter for its known direct suppression of mTOR. I do neither, preferring thenatural methods I have elucidated in this book and using other naturalsupplements to mimic these drugs’ actions. A disclaimer: I own and operate myown supplement company, GundryMD, but in no way am I suggesting that you need tobuy my products. I have combined many of my favorite nutrients together informulas for GundryMD.com. but I also share the names of other brands I like, aswell as the supplement dosage, so you can find whatever works best for you andyour budget, either online or in your local health food store.I used to tell my patients that supplements made expensive urine. That wasbefore I started measuring the effects of vitamins, minerals, and plantcompounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and other phytonutrients on mypatients’ inflammation biomarkers. I can now reliably discern when patients havechanged their supplement regimen or even changed brands, based upon thesetests.1 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_23_1]Our hunter-gatherer ancestors consumed more than 250 different plants annuallyon a rotating, seasonal basis. Those plants’ roots delved deep into six feet oforganic loam soil, which teemed with bacteria and fungi to create an amazingcombination of minerals and phytochemicals within the plants’ tubers, leaves,flowers, and fruits. The meat and fat from the animals that our forebears killedand ate also contained those phytochemicals, because the animals they ate alsoate those plants.Let’s say that you eat organic food, you eat seasonally, you frequent your localfarmers’ market, you consume wild-caught seafood, you limit your consumption ofpastured chicken and eggs, you limit your consumption of grass-fed meats, andyou sprinkle aged cheeses from A2 cows, as well as from sheep and goats, on yourfood. You eat pressure-cooked lentils; you throw mushrooms on everything. Youskip meals, you have a brain-wash night weekly. Isn’t that enough? As the labtests on many of my patients who are faithful organic eaters show, getting allof the nutrients you need simply cannot be done in our society without takingsupplements. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately), you do not live in Okinawain the 1940s, on Kitava, or on a remote island off the coast of Greece; you getmy drift.So here are a few of the supplements that I recommend considering. The firsttwo—vitamin D3 and the B vitamins—are essential for everyone.VITAMIN D3Most Americans have very low levels of vitamin D3. About 80 percent of thepatients in my practice were vitamin D deficient when they first enrolled,including 100 percent of my autoimmune and lectin-intolerant patients. I havebeen shocked by how much supplementation some of my autoimmune patients need toget their vitamin D blood levels up to what I consider normal, which is 70 to120 ng/ml for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D in yourbody.Because I measure vitamin D levels every three months, I can be aggressive withreplacement, but if you are just beginning this program, please take just 5,000IU of vitamin D3 daily. For autoimmune disease, start with 10,000 IU a day. Inthe last eighteen years, I have yet to see a case of vitamin D toxicity. Infact, I doubt that it exists.THE B VITAMINS, ESPECIALLY METHYLFOLATE AND METHYLCOBALAMINMany of the B vitamins are produced by gut bacteria, so if your gut rain foresthas been decimated, it is likely that you are deficient in both methylfolate(the active form of folic acid) and methylcobalamin (the active form of vitaminB12, sometimes called methyl B12). Moreover, more than half of the world’spopulation has one or more mutations of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase(MTHFR) genes (it is possible to have single or double mutations of the two mostcommon genes), which limits their ability to make the active forms of bothvitamins. Many people, including myself, call the MTHFR mutation the Mother F’ergene, thanks to how the acronym looks, but that’s not how I refer to it in TVinterviews! The good news is that by swallowing a 1,000-microgram methylfolatetablet each day and putting 1,000 to 5,000 micrograms of methyl B12 under yourtongue, you can combat the genetic mutation. Since you have about a 50 percentchance of carrying one or more of these single or double mutations, I think itis worth taking the active forms of methyfolate and methyl B12 just in case.Although they will not hurt you, if you are one of the few with one or both ofthe double mutations, you may notice increased excitability or converselydepression.Why should you take these B-vitamin supplements? Simply put, they contribute amethyl group to an amino acid called homocysteine in your bloodstream andconvert it to a harmless substance. An elevated homocysteine level is correlatedwith damage to the inner lining of your blood vessels that is on a par with thedamage caused by elevated cholesterol levels. Methyl groups (–CH3) areresponsible for turning genetic switches on or off as well. These B-vitaminsupplements almost always lower homocysteine levels to within normal range.THE G7Years ago, when Dr. Gundry’s Diet Evolution was first published, I was asked toname the seven most important classes of supplements that I felt everyone shouldhave in his or her armamentarium to help achieve great health. We termed thisthe G7, in reference to the meeting of heads of state to determine the futurecourse of the world (and in reference to the first letter of my last name). Weshortened it to G6 for The Plant Paradox, but I am now re-adding a seventh forlongevity. Here is my new G7 list.POLYPHENOLSPerhaps the most important class of compounds missing from your diet is theplant phytochemicals called polyphenols. Plants design these compounds andconcentrate them in their fruit and leaves to resist insects and protect againstsunburn (yes, fruit gets sunburned), so polyphenols provide you with a host ofbeneficial effects when metabolized by your gut bacteria. Fun fact: thosebeautiful fall colors in leaves are the polyphenols that were always there,hidden by the dark green chlorophyll. Another fun fact: the leaves of a plantgenerally have more polyphenols than the fruit does. For instance, olive andapple tree leaves have more polyphenols than their olive or apple fruits, one ofthe reasons that olive leaf extract provides more of the benefits associatedwith olive oil. These benefits include blocking the formation of theatherosclerosis-causing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from the animal proteinscarnitine and choline and actively dilating your blood vessels. These compoundsare so important that I formulated my own blend called Vital Reds. The productcombines thirty-four different polyphenols, as well as my favorite probiotic, aspore form of Bacillus coagulans (BC30), into a powder that mixes easily withwater.However, as all my patients know, I don’t even sell my own products in myoffices, choosing instead to point out alternative sources of polyphenols. Someof my favorite polyphenols in supplement form are grape seed extract, pine treebark extract (sometimes marketed as pycnogenol), and resveratrol, the polyphenolin red wine. You can find supplements at Costco, Trader Joe’s, and Whole Foodsand online. My suggested doses are 100 milligrams of both grape seed extract andresveratrol and 25 to 100 milligrams of pine tree bark extract a day. Othergreat additions are green tea extract, berberine, cocoa powder, cinnamon,mulberry, and pomegranate, many of which (and many more) are in Vital Reds butcan also be taken separately.In my opinion, the best resveratrol product available is Longevinex, which Ihave taken for at least eleven years. I have no relationship with the companybut am impressed with its research. Resveratrol and other small molecules suchas quercetin, which are present in red wine, are responsible for the activationof the SIRT1 gene, which in turn suppresses mTOR. You can find it atwww.longevinex.com.GREEN PLANT PHYTOCHEMICALSWithout a doubt, you cannot eat enough greens to satisfy your gut buddies, afact that you will soon witness for yourself, when your cravings for greensincreases exponentially in the coming weeks on the Longevity Paradox program. Anadditional benefit of greens is that they tend to suppress your appetite for thebad stuff that hurts our gut buddies. Studies have shown, for instance, that thephytochemicals in spinach dramatically reduce hunger for simple sugars andfats,2 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_23_2] which is one reason I usually have the GreenSmoothie [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#grnsmo] in this book for breakfast.Spinach is an ingredient in a lot of the greens blend powders on the market, buta word of warning about these phytochemical powders: I have not been able tofind a greens blend without wheatgrass, barley grass, or oat grass as aningredient—and the lectins in grains and grasses are the last things you need toswallow. I designed my own green formula called Primal Plants, combining spinachextract with eleven other superfood greens, particularly diindolylmethane (DIM),a remarkable immune-stimulating compound found in only minute amounts inbroccoli. My blend also includes modified citrus pectin andgalactooligosaccharides as hunger suppressants and gut buddy stimulators.You can get the benefits without using this particular product, though. Spinachextract is available in 500-milligram capsules, and I recommend that you taketwo per day. DIM is available in capsule form, and the usual dose is 100milligrams a day. Modified citrus pectin comes as a powder or in 500-milligramcapsules. Take two capsules or one scoop per day. My studies show that modifiedcitrus pectin reduces an elevated galectin-3 level, a key marker of myocardialand kidney stress, by decreasing the bad bugs in your gut and increasing thegood ones.PREBIOTICSThe nomenclature of what goes on in your intestinal tract is confusing at best.Probiotics, as you now know, refer to the bugs that live in and on you.Prebiotics are the compounds that the probiotics need to eat in order to surviveand grow. It turns out that many of the compounds that are used for thetreatment of constipation, such as psyllium powder or husks, work not as a bowelstimulator laxative but as a food for your gut buddies; this makes them grow andmultiply, accounting for that bigger bowel movement. Even more interesting isthe fact that the gang members in your gut can’t eat psyllium husks and otherfibers, so prebiotics feed the good guys and starve the bad guys.One of the best prebiotics is inulin. I designed a practical way around the needto get these prebiotic fibers into you: PrebioThrive. It combines fiveprebiotics, including fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) and galactooligosaccharides(GOSs), in a powder that you simply mix with water and drink daily. Another wayto get prebiotics is to take powdered psyllium husk. Start with a teaspoon a dayin water and work up to a tablespoon a day. Also consider ordering GOSs, whichare available online—I like the brand Bimuno. Take a packet or scoop each day.Then add a teaspoon of inulin powder a day.LECTIN BLOCKERSDespite our best efforts, we all sometimes find ourselves in situations in whichwe must—or accidentally—eat foods that contain major amounts of lectins. Thegood news is that there are a number of helpful lectin-absorbing compounds onthe market. I designed a formula early in my career to help myself in suchsituations, and after many requests from my patients it is now available asLectin Shield. It combines nine proven ingredients to absorb lectins or blockthem from reaching your gut wall. Simply take two capsules before alectin-containing meal.Alternatively, you could take glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) intablet form, which also bind lectins. Products such as Osteo Bi-Flex and MoveFree are available at Costco and other larger retailers. Also consider takingD-mannose, which is also in my Lectin Shield, in a dose of 500 milligrams twicea day, particularly if you are prone to urinary tract infections. D-mannose isthe active ingredient in cranberries, but drinking the juice alone will notconfer the same benefits, as D-mannose is present in cranberries in very smallamounts.SUGAR DEFENSESpeaking of sugar: as you well know, we are awash in it—not only in its mostfamiliar form but also in high-fructose corn syrup and any simple carbohydratethat rapidly breaks down into sugar, including your favorite fruits. I have beenimpressed through the years by the fact that the addition of a few simplesupplements has made a major difference in my compliant patients’ glucose andhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. And, as you remember, IGF-1 is influencedprimarily by sugar and animal proteins, so the lower I can get your absorptionand processing of sugar, the better. Last year, I formulated Glucose Defense. Itcombines chromium, zinc, selenium, cinnamon bark extract, berberine, turmericextract, and black pepper extract. (The latter enhances the absorbability ofturmeric—anytime you consume turmeric, make sure you also consume black pepper!Most high-quality turmeric supplements contain both spices.) You can take justtwo capsules twice a day to receive the whole spectrum of benefits.If you prefer, Costco sells a wonderful product called CinSulin, which combineschromium and cinnamon. Take two capsules a day. Combine this with 30 milligramsof zinc once a day, 150 micrograms of selenium a day, 250 milligrams ofberberine twice a day, and 200 milligrams of turmeric extract a day.Costco also offers an excellent turmeric supplement made by Youtheory. Take twoof those a day. Because turmeric is so poorly absorbed, very little reaches yourbloodstream. This is a shame because curcumin, the active ingredient inturmeric, is one of the few antioxidants to cross the blood-brain barrier intoyour brain. Because of this, I now produce Biomax Curcumin, which is absorbedvia a different mechanism and thus reaches much higher blood levels; I currentlytake two daily.While I’m on the subject of curcumin and berberine (sometimes called Oregongrape root, not to be confused with grape seed extract, a different polyphenol),both of these substances have been shown to act on PCSK9 gene expression in theliver. If that sounds familiar, the new injectable cholesterol-lowering drugRepatha works via the same mechanism (but at a cost of about $1,000 a month).Again, both berberine and curcumin supplements are easy to find.LONG-CHAIN OMEGA-3SI have been measuring red blood cell–bound (RBC-bound) omega-3 levels in mypatients for twelve years, and what I see scares me. Most people are profoundlydeficient in the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and, moreimportant, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In fact, the only people in my practicewho have sufficient levels of these brain-boosting fats without takingsupplements eat sardines or herring on a daily basis. Why should you worry?Well, your brain is made up of approximately 60 percent fat. In other words,ladies, when you want to call your husband or boyfriend a “fathead,” youunknowingly speak the truth! Half of the fat in your brain is DHA, and the otherhalf is arachidonic acid (AA)—great sources of which are egg yolks andshellfish. Studies show that people with the highest levels of omega-3 fats intheir blood have a better memory and a bigger brain than people with the lowestlevels.3 [Notes.xhtml#endnote_23_3] If that isn’t persuasive enough, rememberthat fish oil helps repair your gut wall and keeps those nasty LPSs from gettingacross your gut border.I recommend choosing a fish oil that is molecularly distilled. I’ve been soimpressed with the longevity data coming from the tiny fishing village ofAcciaroli, in southern Italy, where the diet is heavily based on anchovies androsemary, that I’ve formulated my own omega-3 supplement with DHA and rosemaryextract called Omega Advanced.When taking fish oil, try to take 1,000 milligrams of DHA per day. On the backof the bottle, you will find the serving size—either per capsule or per teaspoonif it is a liquid; then look under “ingredients” to find the DHA content percapsule or teaspoon. Calculate how many capsules or teaspoons will get you at orabove 1,000 milligrams of DHA per day.There are several good national brands. Nature’s Bounty, 1400 milligrams,available at Costco, is the supplement I recommend currently. OmegaVia DHA 600is a nice small capsule that’s easy to swallow. And Carlson’s Elite Gems can beswallowed or chewed. Carlson also makes an excellent lemon-flavored cod-liveroil. Take a tablespoon a day to get the right levels in your blood and brain.I’ve already mentioned that good-quality algae-derived DHA is now widelyavailable for my vegan readers, but just make sure that you are taking theequivalent of 1,000 milligrams of DHA per day.MITOCHONDRIAL BOOSTERSThere are a number of compounds that I have discussed throughout the book thatdeserve our consideration in protecting and stimulating mitochondria. To name afew: N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC), 500 milligrams; gynostemma extract, 450milligrams; shilajit, 300 milligrams; reduced or L-glutathione, 150 milligrams;pau d’arco, 50 milligrams; pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), 20 milligrams; andnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced (NADH), 10 milligrams. Feel free toadd the doses listed above to your regimen.Speaking of NADH, there are several compounds available that will probably boostyour nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized (NAD+) levels; one isnicotinamide riboside, patented and marketed as TRU Niagen. A recent human studysuggested that a dose of 1,000 milligrams a day raises the NAD+ level inmononuclear cells. Not yet clinically available at a reasonable price isnicotinamide mononucleotide, which my friend and fellow longevity researcherDavid Sinclair of Harvard Medical School and MIT has shown to be moreefficacious than Niagen in mouse trials. If cost is a concern, plain, cheapniacinamide may, in fact, have the same effect. Why raise your NAD+ level? Toactivate the SIRT1 gene, which in turn, suppresses mTOR. Suppress mTOR, and youwill live better and longer. But remember, fasting has the exact same effect,and it’s not only free, but actually saves money, because you don’t pay forfood!SUPPLEMENTATION DURING RAPID WEIGHT LOSS OR FASTINGAlthough I and other colleagues, including Dr. Jason Fung, MD, a leading experton intermittent fasting, are proponents of intermittent, time-restricted, orwater fasting, little attention has been given to the pioneering work of Dr. RoyWalford on the release of heavy metals and other toxins from our fat storesduring this process. We store heavy metals and other organotoxins such aspolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxin in our fat cells, where they remainremarkably inert (which explains why a swordfish with huge amounts of mercury inits flesh can happily swim around unimpaired). But as Dr. Walford found duringthe rapid weight loss that occurred in the failed Biosphere 2 experiment, hisand the other crew members’ heavy metal and other toxins blood levels rapidlyclimbed and remained severely elevated for about a year before returning tonormal. This is because of our liver’s and kidneys’ very poor ability to haveenough Phase 1 and 2 detoxification pathways to handle these toxins; moreover,many are excreted from our liver into our gut, where they are reabsorbed again.Based on Dr Walford’s findings, I recommend aiming to lose no more than 50pounds a year, 25 pounds in six months, or 12.5 pounds in three months. Butequally important, during fasting I recommend supplementing with milk thistle,D-limonene, dandelion, N-acetylcysteine, activated charcoal, and chlorella, thefirst four to activate the liver detoxification pathways and the last two toabsorb the toxins and heavy metals re-excreted into the gut from the liver.OTHER SUPPLEMENTSBecause so many of you have asked, I am listing here the supplements that Icurrently take.

To start, I recommend simply taking vitamin D, the B vitamins, and the G7.But even taking no supplements at all, following the Longevity Paradox programwill give you plenty of benefits. I can’t wait to hear from you about them."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12LONGEVITY PARADOX RECIPES [nav.xhtml#nch17]You’ve already seen the food lists and meal plans, so hopefully you have a goodidea of what types of foods you’ll be eating on the Longevity Paradox program—adelicious variety of meals that will nourish your gut buddies and drive away thebad bugs.

To make cauliflower “rice,” grate the cauliflowerwith a cheese grater, using the largest holes, into rice-shaped pieces.

When theoil is hot and shimmering in the pan, drop tablespoon-sized balls of the batterinto the oil.Cook 3 to 4 minutes per side, then let rest on a paper towel while assemblingthe salad.Make the salad: Combine the vinegar, oil, mustard, salt, and mint in a largesalad bowl.Add the spinach and broccoli slaw and toss until well dressed.Serve topped with the fritters.Tangy Sesame SlawThere’s nothing like coleslaw for a summer barbecue side dish—and this creamy,rich slaw is one of my favorites, because it’s not heavy and gloppy withmayonnaise.

Sweet potatoes are awonderful source of resistant starch, much like the tubers that help naked molerats live such long and healthy lives.Serves 4For the gnocchi: * 1 pound peeled sweet potato or yam, cut into large chunks (about 1 large sweet potato) * 1 large omega-3 egg or egg substitute, such as Bob’s Red Mill Vegetarian Egg Replacer * 11/2 cups cassava flour (do not use tapioca flour as a substitute) * 1/2 teaspoon sea salt * 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh nutmegFor the sauce: * 1 tablespoon coconut oil or grass-fed European butter * 12 ounces mushrooms (shiitake, portabella, cremini, oyster, or white button), diced * 1 clove garlic, minced * 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme * 11/4 cups unsweetened coconut milk * Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon * 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley * 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast * 1/2 teaspoon iodized sea salt or more to taste * 1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepperMake the gnocchi: Place the sweet potatoes in a large pot and cover with water.Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook 15 to 20 minutes, oruntil tender.Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, then drain, transfer to alarge bowl, and mash with a potato masher until smooth.Double-check that the sweet potato mash is cool (so you don’t cook the egg),then add the egg, 1 cup of the cassava flour, and the salt and nutmeg to themixture.With clean hands, knead until a smooth dough is formed, adding the remainingflour as needed to form a dough that’s neither sticky nor crumbly.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.While waiting for the water to boil, roll chunks of dough into long snakes,about the width of your thumb. Cut each snake into 1-inch pieces (about thelength from the tip of your thumb to the first knuckle). Shape the gnocchi byeither rolling each piece down the back of a fork or using your thumb to make ashallow indentation in each piece.When the water boils, slide the gnocchi one by one into the water using aslotted spoon. When they float to the surface, remove them with the slottedspoon and store in a covered dish to keep warm.If you have more gnocchi than you intend to serve immediately, spread them on aparchment-lined sheet pan once cooked. Allow to cool before transferring to afreezer. Freeze on the sheet pan; then, when solid, transfer to a zip-top bag tostore.Make the sauce: In a large saucepan, heat the oil or butter over medium-highheat.Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes, or untilthe mushrooms are fragrant and tender.Add the garlic and thyme and cook an additional minute, until the garlic istender.Pour the coconut milk into the pan along with the lemon juice and zest and cook,stirring frequently, until the coconut milk thickens, about 8 to 10 minutes.Add the parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Stir until the cheese melts, thentransfer the gnocchi to the sauce.Cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes before serving.Walnut Lentil Veggie Burgers or MeatballsThis veggie burger actually tastes meaty, thanks to the lentils and mushrooms.Plus, the walnuts add a rich kick of protein and cancer-fighting compounds, andthe herbs add a bit of freshness.

Line a sheet pan with parchment and set aside.In a food processor fitted with an S blade, pulse together the onion, garlic,walnuts, mushrooms, parsley, cumin, paprika, curry, black pepper, mustardpowder, and sea salt until a smooth paste is formed (50 to 100 short pulses).Transfer to a bowl and fold in the lentils, egg, and flaxseed, crushing thelentils with your spoon or spatula as you fold them in.Add 2 tablespoons cassava flour and let the mixture rest 5 minutes to absorb theliquid. With your fingers, test to see if the mixture forms a cohesive ball. Addflour bit by bit until the mixture holds its shape when molded.Form into 4 large patties or about 20 meatballs and space evenly on the sheetpan.For the patties: Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, then carefully flip and bake for anadditional 10 minutes.For the meatballs: Bake for 20 minutes total, flipping every 5 minutes.Serve on a bed of lettuce, over Miracle Noodle brand pasta, or with the SweetPotato Gnocchi with Creamy Mushroom Sauce [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#spg].Roasted Broccoli with Miso Walnut SauceLove broccoli with cheddar cheese?

You can pressure-cook the lentils yourself or useEden canned lentils to make your life easier.Serves 4 * 3 cups pressure-cooked lentils (Eden brand canned lentils are great) * 11/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil * 1 medium onion, finely minced * 2 cloves garlic, finely minced * 1 teaspoon cumin * 1 teaspoon paprika * 1 teaspoon garlic powder * 1 teaspoon black pepper * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano * 1/2 teaspoon dried sage * 1 tablespoon coconut aminos * Juice of 1/2 lime * Cilantro, for garnishDrain the cooked lentils well and pat dry.In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.Add the onion, garlic, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, pepper, oregano, and sageand cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions and garlic arevery tender and fragrant.Add the lentils and cook, crushing the lentils with a spoon or spatula.When the lentils are crushed smooth, stir in the coconut aminos and lime juice.Serve garnished with cilantro.Ginger Coconut Cauliflower “Rice”This aromatic variation on fried rice is the perfect base for curries, grilledseafood, or even roasted vegetables. It’s creamy but still manages to be niceand light, so it doesn’t overpower a meal while providing lots of prebioticfiber and ketones from coconut oil.Serves 4 * 4 tablespoons coconut oil * 1 small shallot, minced * 1 tablespoon minced ginger * 4 cups cauliflower rice * 1/4 teaspoon iodized sea salt * 1 cup coconut milk * 1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut * Zest of 1 lime * 1 tablespoon coconut aminosIn a large skillet, heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat.Add the shallot and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant.Add the cauliflower rice, salt, coconut milk, and coconut and cook, stirringfrequently, until the cauliflower rice is tender and the mixture is creamy.Season with lime zest and coconut aminos before serving.Lentil Broccoli CurrySimilar to a traditional Indian curry, this creamy, richly spiced red lentilcurry features a new twist on classic flavors, thanks to ingredients such asbroccoli rice.

For a savory breakfast, try simple toasted millet“grits” with mushrooms and eggs for a filling, hearty meal. It’s also great atdinner—and in my opinion especially delicious when made with Parmesan “Bone”Broth.Serves 2 * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil * 1 shallot, minced * 1 cup uncooked millet * 2 cups mushroom broth or Parmesan “Bone” Broth [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#PBB] * 1/2 teaspoon iodized sea salt * 1/2 cup minced mushrooms * 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme * 4 omega-3 eggs * 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (less if you really don’t like spicy food)In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat.Add the shallot and millet and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallot istranslucent and the millet smells “toasty.”Add the broth and salt and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cook,covered, until the millet is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.While the millet is cooking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a smallskillet.Add the mushrooms and thyme and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushroomsare tender (about 3 minutes).Add the eggs and cayenne pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the eggsare scrambled.Serve the eggs over the millet for a savory alternative to grits or oatmeal.Mushroom Artichoke Fettuccini BakeI used to love mushroom artichoke lasagna, but it’s out of the question on theLongevity Paradox program—luckily, thanks to Miracle Noodle, I can get all theflavors (and texture) of that lasagna without the dangerous lectins and caseinA1 dairy products. It’s savory, creamy, a little salty, and full of meatymushrooms with their cancer-fighting properties, spermidine, and earthy flavor.Serves 4 to 6 * Cooking spray * 1/4 cup avocado oil * 1 large onion, minced * 1 pound mushrooms, diced (portabella, cremini, shiitake, trumpet, or oyster are good) * 1 pound artichoke hearts (frozen and thawed or canned and rinsed), roughly chopped * 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary * 2 tablespoons minced garlic * 2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme * 1 teaspoon sea salt * 1 teaspoon black pepper * Zest of 1 lemon * 3 packs of Miracle Noodle Fettuccini, prepared the Gundry way* * 2 tablespoons cassava or coconut flour * 2 cups coconut milk * 1 cup mushroom broth or Parmesan “Bone” Broth [Chapter_12_Longevity_Para.xhtml#PBB] * 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast * 1/4 cup finely chopped walnutsPreheat the oven to 350° F. Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray and setaside.In a large frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.Add the onion and mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion istranslucent and the mushrooms are tender.Add the artichoke hearts, rosemary, garlic, thyme, salt, pepper, lemon zest, andfettuccini to the pan and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until veryfragrant.Add the cassava flour and cook an additional minute, stirring until it is wellcombined with the mushroom mixture.Add the coconut milk, the broth, and 1/4 cup of the cheese and cook for 3 to 4minutes, until it begins to thicken.Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with the remainingcheese and the walnuts.Bake 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and bubbly.Let rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.*To do this, bring a pot of water to a boil. Rinse the pasta under cold water,then add to the boiling water. Let boil for 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse againunder cold water for 2 minutes. Throw the pasta into a dry pan and cook off anyremaining moisture over medium heat. Don’t worry about the popping sounds;they’re normal!Cauliflower “Fried Rice”This is a great, filling meal to enjoy during your five-day “fast.” With optionslike this, you’ll never go hungry even while your body thinks you’re fasting.

It’s not the sweetest dessert, but the flavors areincredible: coconut, vanilla, and cinnamon play beautifully together, making itfeel decadent and light at the same time.Serves 4 * 1 cup tapioca pearls * 2 cups coconut milk * 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut * 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract * 1/4 cup erythritol powder * 2 cups peeled, diced sweet potatoes or taro rootIn a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.

Cook for an additional 2 minutes.Serve warm, or transfer to the refrigerator and serve chilled for a custardliketexture.Blueberry Miso MuffinsMiso is delicious in desserts, thanks to the slight sweetness in white misopaste, which provides almost a butterscotch flavor—perfect with fresh, in-seasonfruit and pie-inspired seasoning.Makes 12 muffins * 1/4 cup grass-fed butter or coconut oil * 2 tablespoons white miso paste * 2 large omega-3 eggs or Bob’s Red Mill Vegetarian Egg Replacer * 8 drops vanilla-flavored liquid stevia (or more to taste) * 1 cup coconut milk * 2 cups blanched almond flour * 1/4 cup coconut flour * 1 teaspoon baking powder * 1/4 teaspoon allspice * 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg * 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon * 1/2 cup fresh blueberries*Preheat the oven to 350° F.

Alternate adding wet anddry ingredients until the mixture is well blended.Gently fold the blueberries into the batter (use a spatula, not the mixer), thenscoop the batter into 12 muffin tins.Bake 18 to 25 minutes, until a knife inserted into the center of each muffincomes out clean. Let cool before serving.*If blueberries aren’t in season, feel free to use 1/2 cup of in-season fruit,finely minced.Mexican Chocolate “Rice” PuddingI’ve always loved the sweet-spicy flavor profile of Mexican chocolate, whichcontains cinnamon and cayenne pepper, so I added that classic set of spices tomy “rice” pudding—made with cauliflower rice for loads of prebiotic fiber. Youwon’t believe that there’s actually cauliflower in this dessert; it just tasteslike rich, creamy, crave-worthy chocolate.Serves 4 * 4 cups cauliflower rice * 2 cups coconut milk * 1/2 cup diced bittersweet chocolate (at least 80% cacao) * 3 teaspoons cinnamon * 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper * 6 drops liquid stevia * 1/4 teaspoon sea salt * 1 cup toasted walnutsIn a large saucepan, heat the cauliflower rice and half the coconut milk overmedium heat.Let simmer, stirring frequently, for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the “rice” istender.Add the remaining ingredients and stir until the chocolate is melted and wellincorporated.Let simmer for an additional 10 minutes and serve warm, or chill for a thicker,cold rice pudding.Pears Poached in Red Wine with Vanilla Coconut CreamPears contain some powerful longevity-supporting compounds and lots of resistantstarch, but, more important, they’re delicious, especially when paired withcitrus zest, star anise, and red wine. This recipe is a great way to turn even aslightly underripe pear into a sweet, rich, satisfying dessert, made moredecadent by vanilla bean–infused coconut cream.Serves 4For the pears: * 2 cups red wine * 2 cups coconut milk * 2/3 cup erythritol powder * 1 star anise * 1 stick cinnamon * Peel of 1 orange, cut into large strips * 2 whole cloves * 2 semiripe pears, peeledFor the coconut cream: * 1 can coconut cream, refrigerated for 24 hours * 1 vanilla beanPlace a bowl and whisk in your refrigerator.Make the pears: In a large pot, heat the wine, coconut milk, erythritol powder,anise, cinnamon, orange peel, and cloves, stirring frequently until theerythritol powder dissolves and the mixture is simmering.Add the pears and cook, covered, over medium-low heat until tender.With a slotted spoon, remove the pears, spices, and orange peel from thepoaching liquid.

Scrape the vanilla bean and add the seeds to the coconutcream. Whip until stiff peaks have formed.Serve half a pear per person, topped with the whipped coconut cream and adrizzle of the reduced poaching liquid.BEVERAGESWalnut and Nutmeg “Horchata”When I traveled in Spain, I loved the creamy, sweet drink called horchata, soldeverywhere, so I set out to make my own—lectin free, of course.

But youcan die young at a ripe old age by assembling the right team. Or, perhaps moreaccurately, by assembling a village of trillions of inhabitants who want onlyone thing, and that is to preserve their beautiful home. Your team should alsoinclude a devoted collection of family members, friends, and animals who canprovide you with emotional and social support and inspire you to stay activethroughout your years.But let’s not forget the importance of your attitude on your quality of life.One of the traits I’ve observed in many of the “super old” people I’ve had thepleasure of knowing is an outlook I like to call pessimistic optimism. It’sexemplified by the life-enhancing ability to shrug your shoulders at theinevitable bad things that happen and celebrate the many good things.As an example, I’ll leave you to contemplate Ruby, who is turning 102 as I writethis. I’ve known Ruby for at least ten years. When I met her, this diminutivewoman had hands and feet that were so gnarled and deformed by rheumatoidarthritis that my first question to her was, didn’t it hurt horribly to walk?Her response was what I have come to expect from my great teachers: “Of courseit hurts, but I can’t do anything about it, so why pay it any attention?” Sheshrugged. And smiled. Simultaneously. And in her eyes I detected the intensesparkle of life that belied her true age. In her nineties, she taught chairyoga! She had a close network of friends. I began to look forward to every visitwith Ruby, not just because she was such a joy to be around but also because Ialways learned something from her.Year after year I would suggest that we try a few dietary changes to help withher rheumatoid arthritis, but she just wasn’t interested. Shortly after her100th birthday she found a lump in her breast that was cancerous and had to beremoved. When we met after her surgery, I asked her what her plans were now thatshe was 100 and had cancer. Again, her answer didn’t surprise me. She wanted tolive to see her great-grandchildren graduate from high school and wouldn’t let alittle thing like cancer stand in her way. I asked if perhaps now was the timeto try the dietary changes I had been suggesting, and she finally said, “Sure,Doc, let’s give it a try.”When Ruby walked in the door for her 101st birthday visit, I was immediatelystruck by the appearance of her hands. The horribly deformed knuckles were nowdramatically smaller, and her fingers and toes were noticeably straighter. Aquick glance at her new blood work results showed me that her biomarkers foractive rheumatoid arthritis, RF and Anti-CCP3, which were usually very elevated,were now normal. As in negative. I excitedly told her that her eating effortshad paid off, showing her the blood results and pointing to her relaxed hands.She said, “Yes, I’ve noticed my hands, but I have a bone to pick with you.” Withthat she turned her hands and fingers toward the floor, and six rings fell offher fingers, clanging onto the tile. “I’ve got to get my rings resized!” Theperfect pessimistic optimist in action.Ruby’s deaging is happening right before my eyes; now, at 102, she just keepsgetting younger. And this is my hope for you. Through a combination ofnutrition, lifestyle choices, a supportive community, and a mind-set that seeksthe positive while accepting the negative with humor and humility, we can allenjoy a full, vibrant life for as many years as we live on this earth.Of course, Ruby’s time to move onward will eventually come, just as my time andyours will. But until it does, I personally plan to nurture that vital sparkthat keeps her birthday candles lit year after year. Or as Jason Mraz would say,“May the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows.” Die young, dearreader, at a ripe old age!"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [nav.xhtml#nac19]Just as it takes a village to live well to a ripe old age, it took a village oftalented individuals to help get this book into your hands.

Gundry, MD, is a cum laude graduate of Yale University, with specialhonors in human biological and social evolution. After graduating Alpha OmegaAlpha from the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. Gundry completed residencies ingeneral surgery and cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Michigan andserved as a clinical associate at the National Institutes of Health. He inventeddevices that reverse the cell death seen in heart attacks; variations of thesedevices became the Medtronic Gundry Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannula, the mostwidely used device of its kind worldwide to protect the heart during open-heartsurgery. After completing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at theHospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, in London, and spending twoyears as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Dr.Gundry was recruited as professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at LomaLinda University School of Medicine.During his tenure at Loma Linda, Dr. Gundry pioneered the field ofxenotransplantation, the study of how the immune system and blood vesselproteins of one species react to the transplanted heart of a foreign species. Hewas one of the original twenty investigators of the first FDA-approvedimplantable left ventricular assist device. Dr. Gundry is the inventor of theGundry Ministernotomy, the most widely used minimally invasive surgicaltechnique to operate on the aortic valve; the Gundry Lateral Tunnel, a livingtissue that can rebuild parts of the heart in children with severe congenitalheart malformations; and the Skoosh Venous Cannula, the most widely used cannulain minimally invasive heart operations.As a consultant to Computer Motion (now Intuitive Surgical), Dr. Gundry was oneof the fathers of robotic heart surgery. He received early FDA approval forrobotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for coronary artery bypass andmitral valve operations. He holds patents on connecting blood vessels andcoronary artery bypasses without the need for sutures, as well as on repairingthe mitral valve without the need for sutures and the heart-lung machine.Dr. Gundry has served on the Board of Directors of the American Society ofArtificial Internal Organs and was a founding board member and treasurer of theInternational Society of Minimally Invasive Cardiothoracic Surgery. He alsoserved two successive terms as president of the Board of Directors of theAmerican Heart Association, Desert Division. Dr. Gundry has been elected afellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Cardiology,the American Surgical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and theCollege of Chest Physicians. He has served numerous times as an abstractreviewer for the American Heart Association annual meetings. The author of morethan three hundred articles, chapters, and abstracts in peer-reviewed journalson surgical, immunologic, genetic, nutritional, and lipid investigations, he hasalso operated in more than thirty countries, including on multiple charitablemissions.In 2000, inspired by the stunning reversal of coronary artery disease in an“inoperable” patient by using a combination of dietary changes and nutriceuticalsupplements, Dr. Gundry changed the arc of his career. An obese chronic dietfailure himself, he adapted his Yale University thesis to design a diet based onevolutionary coding and the interaction of our ancestral microbiome, genes, andenvironment. Following this program enabled him to reverse his own numerousmedical problems. In the process, he effortlessly lost seventy pounds and haskept them off for seventeen years. These discoveries led him to establish theInternational Heart and Lung Institute—and, as part of it, the Center forRestorative Medicine—in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara, California. There he hasdevoted his research and clinical practice to the dietary and nutriceuticalreversal of most diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, autoimmunedisease, cancer, arthritis, kidney failure, and neurological conditions such asdementia and Alzheimer’s disease, using sophisticated blood tests and blood flowmeasurements to maximize his patients’ health span and longevity.This research resulted in the publication of his bestselling first book, Dr.Gundry’s Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and YourWaistline, in 2008. Following up on the success of that book, he has become oneof the world’s authorities on the human microbiome and the interaction betweenthe gut, the foods we ingest, the products we use, and our physical and mentalhealth and well-being. In recent years, more than 50 percent of his practice hasbeen devoted to the reversal of challenging autoimmune conditions in patientsreferred to him by health professionals around the world. These findingsresulted in the publication of the New York Times bestseller The Plant Paradoxand The Plant Paradox Cookbook, as well as The Plant Paradox: Quick and Easy,recently released. The Plant Paradox has been translated into over twenty-fivelanguages and has prompted worldwide interest in a lectin-free diet.Dr. Gundry has been named to America’s Top Doctors for twenty-one years in a rowby Castle Connolly, the independent physician rating company; to Palm SpringsLife Top Doctors for fifteen years in a row; and to Los Angeles Magazine’s TopDoctors for the last six years.Dr. Gundry is the creator of the nutritional guidelines for the Six SensesResorts and Spas worldwide and a senior scientific advisor to Pegasus CapitalAdvisors. He has been invited to lecture at both the Stanford and MIT BrainSummit meetings on the impact of the gut on brain health and its deterioration.In 2016, he founded GundryMD, his own line of nutriceutical and skin-caresupplements.Dr. Gundry’s wife, Penny, and their dogs, Pearl, Minnie, and George, live inPalm Springs and Montecito California. His grown daughters, Elizabeth andMelissa, their husbands, Tim and Ray, and their children, Sophie and Oliver,live nearby.Discover great authors, exclusive offers, and more at hc.com[http://www.harpercollins.com]"},{"pageContent":"ALSO BY STEVEN R.
