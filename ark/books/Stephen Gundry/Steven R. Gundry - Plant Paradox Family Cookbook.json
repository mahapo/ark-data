After all, most cardiologists tend to treat adultpatients, often those of advanced age. But what many people don’t know is thatback when I was a Professor of Surgery at Loma Linda University School ofMedicine, I was also a Professor of Pediatrics and a Fellow of the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP). In addition to seeing my cardiac patients, I alsosee a great number of families in my current practices in Palm Springs and SantaBarbara, California. Most of the children and young adults I see are sufferingfrom an autoimmune disease that has defied traditional treatments. Other times,my younger patients are brought in by a parent who has regained his or her ownhealth by following my nutritional protocol, and are hopeful their child orchildren can benefit similarly.These parents come to see me with a lot of questions, and no small amount ofconcern about feeding their children a diet that is contrary to what theirpediatricians have advised, or even what AAP suggests is optimal. After all, weare told to feed our children cow’s milk, grains, fruit, and legumes from theirfirst birthday onward. The idea that such foods could be harmful—as I suggest inThe Plant Paradox and my subsequent books—causes parents no small amount ofworry. They come to me looking for advice and explanation, wanting to betterunderstand how their children can follow my protocol safely.In addition, ever since the publication of The Plant Paradox Cookbook, I’vereceived thousands of emails and messages from readers asking how they can makemy recipes more suitable for their families—and asking for recipes that can bethrown together quickly, without a lot of complicated cooking ordifficult-to-find ingredients. These are people who have had success on thePlant Paradox program and are eager to cook nutritious meals everyone in theirfamily will enjoy. They are parents of kids who have turned around theirautoimmune diseases and gone off immunosuppressive drugs, who are finding itchallenging to keep their child’s progress on track for the long run. They arealso, very often, working moms and dads who have little to no time to cook everynight of the week, and are on a food budget that doesn’t allow for lots of fancyingredients.The Plant Paradox Family Cookbook is written, first and foremost, with the needsof these patients and readers in mind, as well as for all of you who havesuccessfully followed the Plant Paradox program and restored your health, butwonder: How do I make this a sustainable lifestyle with a family to cook andcare for? And perhaps equally important, How can I make sure my kids are gettingall the nutrients they need?Well, dear reader, you have come to the right place. This cookbook is designedto give answers to these questions and more. I want to make the Plant Paradoxprogram a lifestyle you and your family can live with, literally andfiguratively.The reality is that the Plant Paradox plan is a way of eating that works foreveryone, regardless of age. It’s that simple. I’ve documented the positivechanges in the bloodwork of thousands of patients in my clinics. I’ve seendiabetic kids reverse their diabetes, obese kids slim down, skinny kids put onsome much-needed weight for the first time in their lives, and yes, reversedautoimmune diseases, reversed asthma, eczema, and even cystic acne. I’vereported these results and more at major national and international meetings,but the real joy I get is when I receive an email, a letter, or read a reviewonline that shares your positive experiences with the program and your amazingsuccesses.Finally, this book is also written for all the “holdouts” who have heard aboutthis crazy Plant Paradox thing—that some plants are out to kill us or at leasthurt us, and that the traditional mainstays of a “healthy” diet like wholegrains, low-fat dairy, and legumes are actually some of the worst foods we canconsume. Maybe you’ve been skeptical of my approach, or maybe you’ve readthrough the guidelines and simply thought, “that’s not for me.” I understandthat change is hard, and I would ask you to consider this: changing your dietand lifestyle doesn’t only affect your health. It affects the health andlong-term wellbeing of your whole family. My intention with this book is to makeit as easy and enjoyable as possible to adapt a healthier lifestyle for everymember of your family, without needing to give up the foods and traditions youand your loved ones enjoy. You can still have pizza night, still eat spaghettiand meatballs, pack a sandwich for school lunches, indulge in an ice pop on ahot sunny day. You can celebrate food and enjoy family meals together that arefuss-free, quick to assemble, and provide the very best nutrition for the peopleyou love.image [../images/pageix.jpg]Everything you need is in these pages. If you haven’t read The Plant Paradox ormy other books, not to worry—I’m going to offer a brief overview of the protocolhere so you can jump right in and join the club. Over the next few chapters,we’ll take a closer look at the nutritional needs of kids as well as the basicsof the Plant Paradox lifestyle so all of us, old hands or newbies alike, canquickly get up to speed before diving into the kitchen. Welcome to The PlantParadox Family Cookbook!"},{"pageContent":"image [../images/page1.jpg]9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rpt1"},{"pageContent":"Chapter One [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch1]Lectins and Your Health [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch1]In my first cookbook, I opened with these wise words from Michael Pollan’selegant start to The Omnivore’s Dilemma: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostlyplants.”In essence, I couldn’t agree more with this sentiment. A plant-based diet iscertainly better for our health than one comprised of poor-quality animalprotein and processed foods. But contrary to what many of us have been taught,not all plants are good for us. And in fact, some can be downright harmful toour health—in particular, those that contain a high concentration of proteinscalled lectins.And therein lies the paradox: plants can be both friend and enemy, good and bad,nutritious and disease-promoting.It’s likely that some of the foods you’ve long considered the healthiest foryou, and certainly, for your children, are actually those that contain a highconcentration of lectins. These foods include most grains, beans and otherlegumes; certain nuts and seeds; and many fruits, as well as most vegetableswith seeds, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplant (which are botanicallyfruit).I know it can feel confusing and contradictory to learn that the foods you’verelied on as the cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle are actually underminingyour and your family’s wellness. So before we go any further we’re going to takea closer look at lectins—what they are, what they do, and why you should avoidthem.Predator and PreyLet’s go back some 450 million years, to a time when plants reigned supreme asthe only living organisms on the planet. This was the golden age for plants—theyhad no predators, and plenty of sunlight and precipitation to grow andproliferate. Now, fast forward about 100 million years, when insects and later,animals, arrive on the scene. What do they want to eat? Plants! But like allliving things, plants have an imperative to grow, reproduce, and, well, notdie—survival is encoded in their DNA. So they adapted to their new environment,developing short- and long-term defense strategies to protect themselves frompredators. These short-term defense strategies included poisoning, paralyzing,or entrapping their predators to cease an attack immediately. Their long-termdefense strategy? Producing chemicals that sicken their enemy, little by little,eventually debilitating them.As you might have guessed, lectins are part of a plant’s long-term defensestrategy. Lectins are present in all plants, but are highly concentrated in onlya few—such as nightshades (tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, potatoes), most grains,legumes, and many fruits. The skins and seeds of plants contain the greatestdensity of lectins. Why the seeds? Well, plants have an imperative not only tosurvive themselves, but also to ensure their offspring (aka seeds) survive.Fruit-bearing plants have a special trick to protect their offspring and ensureproliferation: As the fruit ripens, its lectin concentration decreases. When afruit is fully ripe, its seeds are able to pass through an animal’s digestivesystem intact and are excreted out, where they end up in the soil to begin newlife. But when the fruit is unripe, the lectins in those seeds—which are not yetfully mature, and thus cannot generate new life once deposited in the soil—wreakhavoc in the digestive tract of the animal that consumes them. Hopefully thisanimal learns its lesson after a few belly aches: only eat the fruit when it isfully ripe.So, what about those belly aches, then? How do lectins do their damage insidethe body? To better understand this, it’s helpful to take a brief tour of the GIsystem. Your digestive tract (aka, your intestines, or your “gut”), is alabyrinthine tunnel filled with many twists and turns. If it were all stretchedout and laid flat, it could cover a tennis court. The job of your digestivesystem is to process the foods you eat (to “digest” them), and break them downinto their essential components. Your body extracts the nutrients it can use,including amino acids from the protein you eat, sugar molecules fromcarbohydrates, and fatty acids from fats. If everything is working as it should,eventually these molecules make their way outside of your gut and aretransported via your bloodstream to be absorbed by the cells that need them. Butthe other components of your food—the waste, the toxins, the indigestiblefiber—stay inside the walls until they are eventually excreted.A good analogy is to think of your gut like a tunnel you drive through to crossa river. When you’re in the tunnel, you’re surrounded by water, but it is safelycontained on the other side of the tunnel’s wall. Similarly, the food thattravels through your digestive tract is encased in a “tunnel” of sorts. Any foodparticles that enter that tunnel aren’t technically part of your body, whereyour circulatory system functions as the river rushing through. They stay insidethe tube, protected by the gut wall.While the surface area of your intestines is vast, the gut wall itself is quitefragile—it is just one cell thick. The cells that make up this barrier are linedup neatly side by side, connected to one another by impenetrable seals known as“tight junctions.” These tight junctions function as gatekeepers that decidewhat passes through the wall, and what stays inside. Normally, the onlymolecules able to pass through these gates are the nutrients your body needs,which happen to be very small molecules.As an extra layer of protection, this single layer of cells also produces mucus,made of polysaccharides (complex sugars), to entrap any rogue molecules that maytry to make their way out of the gut and into the bloodstream. Lectins aresticky proteins that easily bind to specific sugar molecules—including, but notexclusively, the polysaccharides that make up this mucus layer. Once inside yourgut, they find these polysaccharides and attach themselves to them.Now, if you have a healthy gut wall protected by a thick layer of mucus, thelectins get stuck, can’t make it through the tight junctions, and that’s the endof it. But if your mucus layer is thin, or if your diet is heavy inlectin-containing foods, or you’ve been exposed to a group of toxins I call the7 Deadly Disruptors (more on that soon), those lectins will get to the targetthey really came for. Attaching to your single-cell wall, they flip a chemicalswitch that breaks apart the tight junctions. Wham! The cells pull apart, andlectins push right on through the wall and into your bloodstream. Over time,lectins begin to damage the gut wall, creating microscopic holes that causeother molecules to continuously leak out—a condition commonly known as “leakygut syndrome.”The integrity of your gut wall is so important to your health that your bodyplaces a lot of resources nearby to protect it: about 65 percent of your immunesystem’s white blood cells are amassed there, just waiting to be called intoaction. What does that “action” look like, when it comes to defending the wall?In a word: inflammation. Think about what happens when your immune systemresponds to an invader externally—for example, when you get a splinter in yourfinger. The whole area around the splinter becomes red and swollen, right?That’s because the splinter is a foreign substance; the redness and swelling ofyour skin is a result of your white blood cells attacking the invader.Similarly, when lectins make their way outside the tunnel of your GI tract, theybecome like “splinters.” Once in the bloodstream, your immune system quicklyidentifies lectins as intruders and initiates an inflammatory response toprotect you from harm. In addition to lectins, your immune system also monitorsto make sure the bacteria in your gut stay on their side of the wall. Buttrillions of bacteria grow and reproduce and die daily, producing smaller bitsof cell debris that can also leak outside of the gut once the wall containsholes. These dead bacterial cell walls are called lipopolysaccharides, or LPSs.Your immune system cannot tell the difference between the cell wall of a deadbacteria or a live one, so if an LPS gets loose in your bloodstream, furtherinflammation is generated.When this immune response takes place regularly—as is the case if lectins arebreaking down your gut wall—you can develop a chronic condition in which theimmune system becomes so upregulated and hypervigilant that it begins to attackeven healthy cells that, on the surface, pose no threat. This is known asautoimmunity. I sometimes refer to autoimmunity as “friendly fire,” in which thebody targets the good guys—which could be anything from skin cells to thyroidcells to nerve cells—by mistake. Common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoidarthritis, Crohn’s disease, lupus, Hashimoto’s disease, multiple sclerosis,Grave’s disease, celiac disease, vitiligo, psoriasis, IBS, and type-1 diabetes.More than 70 percent of my practice now is devoted to treatingpatients—including a large number of children—who suffer from autoimmunediseases. Thankfully, most of these patients are able to reverse theirautoimmune illnesses simply by removing lectins from their diet. By avoiding orneutralizing lectins in your food, you remove a root cause of autoimmunity andgive your gut a chance to heal.The Silent MajorityOkay, so we’ve covered the basic biology and function of the gut, and youunderstand how lectins can trigger chronic inflammation. But there’s another waythat lectins cause major dysfunction in the gut: by harming the trillions ofinhabitants that reside there. I’m talking about your gut bacteria, also knownas your microbiome.The microorganisms that live in your gut help to digest food and extractnutrients from it, protect you from pathogens (bacteria and other dangerousbugs), and play a role in regulating everything from your metabolism to yourmood to your immune system. I like to call these microbes our “gut buddies,”because they do so many beneficial things for us—in fact, they are so essentialto our health that we literally could not live without them.As we evolved, so did our microbiome. When our diet consisted primarily offoraged plants and tubers—along with some occasional animal protein,particularly shellfish and fish—our gut buddies thrived and evolved the abilityto digest the lectins in these foods. They also “taught” our immune system, viachemical messages, that certain common lectins held no threat, and there was noneed for our bodies to respond to these foods with inflammation. But after thelast Ice Age ended, about 10,000 years ago, we had to find new food sources, asmost plants and animals that we’d long relied on for sustenance had died out.And so, we learned how to cultivate crops: mainly grains and beans, which wereable to be dried and stored—an asset that made them highly valuable.Instead of spending most of our time foraging for food, we were able tocultivate shelf-stable foods, domesticate animals, and shift our focus oncreating a more “developed” society. But where we made advances in language,philosophy, and infrastructure, we lost ground when it came to our nutrition.With the introduction of these crops also came the introduction of novel lectinsinto our diet—lectins our bodies, and specifically, our gut buddies, weren’tequipped to digest. And while you might think that the last ten thousand yearsshould’ve bought us, and the microbes that live within us, enough time to evolvethe ability to handle these lectins, the reality is that such a timespan is ablink in evolutionary terms. We weren’t prepared to properly digest these newlectins then, and thanks to changes in our food supply and environment, we areeven less prepared to digest them now.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gut Bugs and The BrainRecent research has confirmed that the health of the microbiome directly impactsmental health and behavior in children. Researchers at Arizona State Universityused a method called fecal transplantation—in which the microbes of a healthyperson are transferred to an individual with a less healthy microbiome—to studythe effects of microbial transfer for children with autism spectrum disorder, orASD. (It is not uncommon for children with ASD to experience gastrointestinalproblems.)The researchers found that not only did the children’s GI and behavioralsymptoms dramatically improve following the treatment, but also that thepositive effects endured over time. Two years following treatment, the initialimprovements in gut symptoms remained and a whopping 45 percent reduction in ASDsymptoms (including speech, social interaction, behavior) was observed.1[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch1fn_1]In my practice, I’ve also been thrilled to witness symptoms alleviate forchildren who suffer from anxiety and depression once we get their nutritionright and start healing their gut. Even if your child has not been diagnosedwith a specific mental health or cognitive issue, don’t be surprised if younotice improvements in his or her overall mood and mental acuity when their guthealth is restored. A healthier gut makes for a less inflamed brain—and that’sgood for everyone’s health.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Changing DietClearly, humans have been eating lectin-containing foods for millions of years.So, you might rightly wonder: Why is it that we only now seem to be experiencingtheir negative effects?One reason is that early humans simply ate fewer lectin-rich plants than we dotoday. Remember, the advent of agriculture and all of those storable grains andlegumes is a relatively new component of our diet. Additional trials came withthe introduction of foods originating in the Americas, also known as the “NewWorld.” These crops included corn, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, quinoa,and other “healthy” mainstays of the typical American diet. While populationsnative to the continent—the Native Americans—had up to fifteen thousand years ofexposure to these plants and prepared them in ways that reduced their lectincontent, those “new” to consuming them—populations from Africa, Europe, andAsia—have had less than five hundred years of exposure.More recently, our diet has changed in other ways. Over the last severaldecades, fruits and vegetables that were once eaten seasonally have becomeavailable year-round. Want blueberries in November or tomatoes in February? Youcan find them, imported from Chile or Mexico, now permanently occupying a shelfin your local grocery store. Eating out-of-season fruit, which is harvestedbefore it is ripe (and thus contains more lectins than normally ripened fruits),shipped thousands of miles away, and then artificially ripened with ethylenegas, unwittingly exposes you and your children to a huge amount of gut-bustinglectins.Another recent change to our diet is that over the last half century or so,we’ve come to rely on processed foods, typically made from high-lectiningredients such as wheat, corn, soy, and vegetable oils. And even if you’vebeen studiously avoiding processed foods over concerns for your health,misinformation about nutrition has likely steered you toward “healthy”foods—like tofu, brown rice, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products—that areactually terrible for your health and full of lectins. At the same time, we’vedecreased our intake of the types of foods our gut buddies thrive on—fermentedvegetables, tubers, and cruciferous vegetables.The animals we eat also contribute to our modern health problems. For starters,we eat much more animal protein now than our ancestors ever did, despite whatyou may have heard about “caveman” diets. In addition, the quality of thatprotein has changed radically. Today the majority of the animals we eat areraised on industrial lots where they are fed a diet of corn- and soy-based feed.This lectin-rich diet causes so many digestive problems for the animals thatranchers douse the feed with calcium carbonate—the active ingredient in theantacids humans take. As you’ve heard me say, you are what you eat. And when itcomes to eating animal products, you are what the thing you are eating, ate.Consuming lectins indirectly through meat, eggs, and dairy harms the gut wall,wipes out your gut buddies, and keeps your immune system continuously activated,instigating chronic inflammation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Ancient Instant PotBelieve it or not, a crude bonfire and a trendy pressure cooker have more incommon you might expect. When humans discovered fire, and the ability to controlit, they gained two advantages: the ability to stay warm, and the ability tocook food. Applying heat to food was a game-changer—not only did cooking foodmake it taste better, it also made it easier to digest.That’s because cooking breaks down the cell walls of plants, which are otherwiseindigestible. This is even true for herbivores who eat plants exclusively–noteven a termite can digest wood! Normally we are all dependent on our gut buddiesto do the job of digesting this plant matter for us. (That big belly on agorilla? It’s a virtual fermentation vat filled with microbes breaking down thehuge amount of plants it consumes!)Cooking foods enabled humans to eat a more varied diet, as well as digest morenutrients. It also allowed us to eat certain foods that are inedible in raw form(yams and sweet potatoes, for instance), but which contain important nutrients.And the cooked starches from these tubers helped nourish our gut buddies. Inthis book, you’ll learn how pressure cooking lectin-containing foods at veryhigh heat has a similar effect—it enables you to extract more nutrients fromfoods, and eat some grains and legumes that are not only inedible raw, but aretoxic unless cooked properly. Imagine where human evolution might be now ifcavemen had had an Instant Pot!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Seven Deadly DisruptorsIn addition to the advent of agriculture, modern innovations to our lifestyle inthe form of drugs, pesticides, and other chemicals have also had a deleteriouseffect on our health, and especially the health of our gut and gut buddies. Ifyou’ve read The Plant Paradox, you’ll know that I’ve identified seven specifictoxins that are harming our health—I call them the “Seven Deadly Disruptors.” Igo into much more detail about these chemicals in my other books, but for ourpurposes here (and so we can get you cooking and improving your family’s healthfaster!), I’ll quickly summarize them. 1. BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS. It must be said that these drugs can be a highly beneficial, life-saving treatment when used correctly. Unfortunately, today they are commonly overprescribed. Antibiotics are so effective that in addition to killing the pathogenic bad bugs, they also wipe out almost all of the trillions of friendly bacteria in your gut. And, bad news: your gut buddies don’t grow back overnight if you swallow a probiotic or eat some yogurt. Think of a course of antibiotics like a forest fire. Even if you plant new seedlings after the fire has wiped out all of the old trees, it takes a long time for a new forest to grow. But our exposure to antibiotics doesn’t only come from swallowing a pill—every time we eat conventionally-raised beef and pork, or even farmed seafood, we’re consuming the antibiotics given to those animals to keep them alive and fatten them up for slaughter. When you consume meat from these animals, your gut buddies take a hit. 2. NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS). This class of drugs includes Ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil), naproxen (Aleve), Celebrex, and other pain relievers. NSAIDs damage the lining of your small intestine and colon, also targeted by lectins, and are a major and under-recognized cause of leaky gut. If these drugs are taken regularly, the result is more and more holes in the gut, which leads to increased inflammation, which means more pain—prompting you to take more NSAIDs. It’s a terribly vicious cycle. The next time you reach for one of these pills or hand one to your child, ask yourself first if it is really necessary. Many times we take these drugs more out of comfort or habit than true need. 3. STOMACH ACID BLOCKERS. When we eat something (generally a food that contains lectins) that gives us indigestion or heartburn, we often reach for acid-blocking drugs like Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, or Protonix to relieve our discomfort. These drugs, most of which are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), reduce the production of stomach acid. That may seem like a good idea, except that stomach acid is what your body uses to neutralize harmful bacteria (aka, bad bugs) and partially digest lectins (they are proteins, after all; acid digests proteins). And the more bad bacteria you have, the less room and fewer resources your gut buddies have to thrive—which means your immune system takes a hit too. Is it any wonder that studies show that people who use acid blockers have three times the likelihood of getting pneumonia than those who do not? And don’t get me started on the increased risk of dementia and heart failure while taking these drugs! Note: To any readers who have been diagnosed with Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth (SIBO), please stop taking these drugs immediately, as they are especially harmful for you—the acid in your stomach prevents bad bugs, which meant to stay in your colon, from swimming upstream into you small bowel where they don’t belong and can make you sick. 4. ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. I’m going to tell you something: I am still heartbroken about how damaging artificial sweeteners are. After all, I was a Diet Coke addict for years. I used to drink eight cans a day . . . and I was also seventy pounds overweight. While these sweeteners are, indeed, calorie-free, they also decimate your gut buddies2 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch1fn_2] while simultaneously triggering your brain to seek out more sweet flavors—prompting you to eat sugar in other forms. 5. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS. These chemicals, which are commonly found in plastics—including plastic wrap and food storage containers as well as personal care products (makeup, shampoo, soap, perfume, sunscreen, etc), household cleaners, carpeting, flame-retardant fabrics, and mattresses–have been shown to interfere with the normal functioning of your hormones. Exposure to them is linked to an array of health issues including diabetes, cancer, poor thyroid function, reproductive problems, and obesity. In addition to plastics, beware of endocrine disruptors lurking in processed foods. Stabilizing agents such as butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT, are used to extend the shelf life of whole grain products like breads and crackers. BHT can also be found in “healthy” industrially-raised chicken.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sanitizer Makes You SickAntibacterial soaps and hand sanitizers have a great marketing gimmick going forthem—they promise to kill every germ on your hands and protect you from gettingsick. But the reality is, instead of keeping you healthy, those chemicals do theopposite: they decimate your microbiome and negatively impact your immunesystem, leaving you more exposed to illness. As a doctor, I know something aboutthe importance of washing your hands. And my suggestion for keeping yourfamily’s hands clean? Good old-fashioned soap and water. There are lots ofinexpensive, high-quality soaps out there—even better if you forgo the ones thatcome in a plastic dispenser and stick with bar soap. Dr. Bronner brand makes anexcellent castile bar soap with a fresh, unobtrusive mint scent (derived frompeppermint oil and not some nefarious chemical) and is fairly easy to find atTrader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and a slew of other stores. Trust me, bar soap andwater will do the trick!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS (GMOS) AND THE HERBICIDE ROUNDUP. Most genetically modified foods have been bred to withstand glyphosate, which is a key ingredient in the pesticide Roundup, made by Monsanto (now owned by Bayer, and Enlist, which is manufactured by Dow Chemical). Glyphosate has been classified as a “probable human carcinogen” by the World Health Organization. Amazingly, it is patented not as an herbicide, but as an antibiotic, meaning that it kills bacteria (including your gut microbes when you ingest it in the food you eat). In rat studies, Roundup has also been found to contribute to fatty liver disease (an inflamed liver) even at low doses. When you consider that the liver is an organ that helps to filter out toxins from the body, it makes sense that exposure to Roundup would cause it to become inflamed. Unlike non-GMO plants, many GMO plants have been engineered to survive when exposed to glyphosate. This means that farmers can drench their fields with the chemical to kill the weeds, while their main crop—typically corn, soy, or wheat—is unaffected. This is straightforward enough, and the takeaway is—don’t buy GMO foods. Unfortunately, it’s becoming a lot tougher for consumers to have transparency into how their food is produced, and some sneaky practices are at work. Farmers are using Roundup on non-GMO conventional crops as a desiccant to help accelerate crop death, because a dried-up plant is easier to harvest. Roundup is now being used on almost all conventionally-grown wheat, corn, oats, legumes, beans, and canola, which means it’s more important than ever to select organic versions of these foods—as well as products that contain these ingredients, like breads, crackers, cereals, oatmeal, granola bars, and even wines and beers. In addition, glyphosate is present in the meat and dairy of animals who are fed non-organic grains. 7. BLUE LIGHT. Our bodies are finely tuned to react to the light we perceive via our optic nerve. When days are long and nights are short (in summer), we are cued to eat more and store fat to prepare us for the coming winter, when food was typically scarce. And when days are short and nights are long, our body gets a signal to burn stored fat since calories from food were generally reduced. These days, we spend most of our time staring at electronic devices that emit blue light—the part of the light spectrum that comprises daylight—prompting our internal clock to think it’s summer all year long. Thus we are continually “preparing for winter,” mistakenly consuming more calories and storing fat rather than burning it.How Lectins Cause Weight Gain in You and Your ChildrenAs you probably know from all of the press about gluten, wheat is an especiallydense source of lectins. But in addition to gluten—which is actually not theworst offender among lectins—there is a particularly damaging lectin present inwhole wheat foods called wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). WGA signals your body tostore fat and has also been linked to celiac and heart diseases. But what is itabout WGA that makes it so insidious? One of its sneaky qualities (which itshares with other lectins) is its ability to mimic insulin in the body.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh No, not those Os . . .!Oats are a staple of many children’s diets—from breakfast foods like oatmeal andcereal “O”s to oat bars and oatmeal cookies to the increasingly popular dairyalternative, oat milk. For generations, oats have been viewed as a “healthfood,” and certainly a kid-friendly food. But oats are a lot less virtuous thenyou might think. For starters, most oats—even those advertised as“gluten-free”—contain a protein that cross-reacts with gluten, making them ahazard if anyone in your family has a gluten intolerance or allergy. Inaddition, oats do contain lectins (and are often contained in animal feed, whichis already full of lectins from corn and soy).But the most disturbing thing about oats is the way they are harvested. A recentstudy conducted by the international environmental group Friends of the Earthfound that 100 percent of non-organic store-brand oat cereal samples testedpositive for residues of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicideRoundup. The average level of glyphosate detected in the samples was 360 partsper billion (ppb), which FOE noted is more than twice the level set byEnvironmental Working Group (EWG) scientists for lifetime cancer risk inchildren. This is because the common farming practice for conventionally-raised,non-GMO oats is to spray the crops with Roundup as a desiccant—to accelerate thedrying process and make them easier to harvest. Because the herbicide is sprayedjust before harvesting, you can bet that it is all over those dried oats and oatproducts you buy at the store. As noted here[9780062911841_Chapter1.xhtml#page_12], Roundup is a known neurotoxin and is notsomething you want to feed your children (or eat yourself!). I recommendavoiding all oats, but if you do choose to eat oats or oat products, pleasepurchase only organic varieties!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A hormone made by your pancreas, insulin is released into your bloodstream invarying amounts in response to the amount of sugar and protein you eat. It helpsto regulate your blood sugar levels by attaching to docks on fat, neuron, ormuscle cells and ordering them to open up and let the glucose in. Once theglucose is moved into the cell, the insulin detaches, backs out of the dock, andall is well.WGA acts similarly to insulin, but instead of docking only temporarily to acell, it stays there indefinitely. Imagine being in a full parking lot andwaiting for a space to open up—you circle and circle the lot, but no one evercomes back to move their car from a space. This is what happens when WGA parksin your cells—it causes sugar to circle through your blood stream, looking for aplace to park. When it makes enough rounds, your body responds by telling thepancreas to produce more insulin so that the sugar can be escorted to a cell.But WGA keeps insulin out, too. Over time, this creates a dangerous cycle inwhich your body becomes less sensitive to the presence of insulin in the blood—acondition known as insulin resistance, or prediabetes.WGA causes problems for all types of cells in the body. When it parks on thedock of a muscle cell, blocking sugar from entering, it starves your muscle ofthe energy it needs. Without glucose, your muscles can’t retain their mass, letalone grow. If your muscle cells are continuously deprived of glucose,eventually some degree of muscle wasting will set in.Just as WGA starves muscle cells, it also starves nerve cells, or neurons.Without adequate glucose, your brain can’t function properly. In response toenergy restriction, your poor hungry, fatigued brain sends an SOS signal in theform of hunger, prompting you to eat more calories—and you comply, often seekingthose calories in the form of sugar and carbohydrates. Of course, you alreadyhave plenty of available calories, the brain just can’t access them—so you endup consuming more energy than you need, leading to weight gain.Finally, WGA also does a number on your fat cells. When WGA parks there it notonly attaches, but also ushers in all the rejected sugar that’s still circlingthe lot, which then gets stored as fat. So the sum result of WGA mimickinginsulin is that your muscle cells shrink, your brain feels sluggish, your fatcells grow, and you find yourself overeating all the time. Does any of thissound vaguely familiar?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bullied at SchoolBeing a teenager is never easy—and it’s even harder when you don’t feel and lookyour best. Such was the case for 14-year-old Sophia. When she visited my office,she was suffering from terrible acne, and she was significantly overweight. Shewas miserable and told me that she was bullied at school. Blood tests revealedthat she had very high insulin levels, high triglycerides, and all the markersfor pre-diabetes and insulin resistance. Her vitamin D and Omega 3 levels werelow, and her testosterone was elevated. This combination of symptoms oftenresults in a diagnosis of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).I knew that the underlying problem was Sophia’s diet. She was drinking soda andjuice, eating cereal and processed foods, and overeating all of these foodsbecause she never felt full. She was willing to give the Plant Paradox program atry, so we gave her and her mother the “Yes, Please” and “No, Thank You” foodlists and scheduled a follow up visit.Two months later, Sophia had lost 10 pounds; 6 months later she was down 20pounds! Her skin had also improved remarkably. Sophia said the bullying haseased, but she wasn’t satisfied. She would ask me, “Why can’t I lose more weightfaster, Dr. G?” I told her what I tell everyone: “Weight off fast will neverlast! Weight off slow, you’re good to go!” Sophia is learning how to eat tosupport her health and she’s learning how to break life-long habits—that takestime. But it is well worth the investment.The last time I spoke with her mom, she told me that Sophia was happier, andmore confident, than she’d ever seen her. And her PCOS symptoms? They’vedisappeared too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not All Lectins Are BadWhile a diet high in lectins spells trouble for your health, the reality is thatas long as you’re eating plants, lectins can’t be completely avoided—and that’sok. In fact, in small amounts, they can actually be beneficial.I know, I know: I’ve just explained in great detail that lectins are bad foryou—how could they be good for you? The concept of “hormesis,” which is used inthe field of toxicology, can help us understand this seeming paradox. Hormesisshows us that sometimes substances that are toxic in large quantities areactually beneficial in smaller quantities. In other words, to borrow a turn ofphrase from Paracelsus, the Renaissance physician known as the “father oftoxicology:” “The dose makes the poison.”The takeaway? Eat a varied diet. One of my objectives with this book is toexpand your repertoire to include all kinds of foods that your family may bemissing out on. While it may initially seem that a lectin-limited eating plan isdifficult to sustain, the reality is, there is a wide array of plants—liketubers, pressure-cooked beans, and leafy greens—that feed your gut buddies andprovide your body with optimal nutrition.So don’t be afraid of plants—most of them are more friend than foe. And don’tworry if you’ve been eating a lot of the ones that fall into the “foe” category:It’s never too late to reverse the damage done by lectins! No matter yourcurrent state of wellbeing, you have the power to turn things around. As I’vedescribed in my previous books, I’ve witnessed incredible transformations in mypatients’ health when they change their diets. Many have reversed chronicillnesses such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.Others have healed longstanding digestive woes, lost weight, cleared brain fog,and regained their sense of vitality.Of course, the Plant Paradox program is designed not only to help reverse theseconditions and symptoms, but also to prevent them from occurring. That’s whyyour committment to improving your family’s health is so important. You can giveyour children every advantage they need and deserve to live a long and happylife—just by changing the food you pack in their lunch boxes every day.On that note, let’s take a closer look at what exactly is in those lunch boxes."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Two [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch2]Separating Fact from Fiction in Kids’ Nutrition[9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch2]After countless conversations with patients and friends who ask me about thebest way to feed their families, it’s become clear to me that there’s a lot ofconfusion out there when it comes to nutrition not only for adults but for kidsas well.If you’re reading this book and you’re a parent, you’re probably already an avidconsumer of health information, and you’re eager to do anything and everythingyou can to give your child or children the best possible start in life. Forthat, I applaud you: because truly, nothing sets up a child for long-termhealth, vitality, and proper development as much as the nutrition they eat.Especially from newborn to age three, when little bodies are just forming—foodaffects everything from the makeup of their microbiome to the strength of theirimmune system to the development of their brain.That said, it is never too late to make a meaningful impact on your children’shealth. Whether your kids are toddlers, grade schoolers, middle schoolers, oreven practically adults, not only will the food you serve them affect theirwellbeing, but the way you eat at home—preparing healthy foods together, eatingfamily dinners, valuing high-quality ingredients—will set a powerful examplethat your kids will take with them long after they’ve left the house.My goal is to empower you to feed your family the kind of food that will notonly make everyone healthier and happier, but also give you the tools to makethis healthy eating simple and sustainable. With that in mind, let’s set therecord straight once and for all and separate fact from fiction when it comes tokids’ nutrition.The Lunchbox DiariesTo my mind, nothing quite sums up the misinformation about how we feed our kidsmore than the all-American lunchbox: A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, madewith squishy processed bread, served with a side of milk, and perhaps somefruit—an apple, a bunch of grapes, a box of raisins. Even if that sandwich ismade with whole-grain bread; even if the peanut butter is “organic;” even if themilk is “skim milk,” this is still far from a healthy lunch. In fact it might aswell be dynamite for your kids’gut buddies. Yet many well-intentioned parentsare fooled into believing that such a meal provides their children with the fuelthey need to grow and learn.It’s not your fault. When you go to the grocery store, watch television, or readadvice in health magazines or online, you are bombarded with conflictinginformation. Unfortunately, for the most part, what you’re being told (or rathersold) is either processed food or purported “health food” that’s anything buthealthy.It’s easy enough to isolate the processed stuff: if it comes in a box, if thenutrition label features a list of hard-to-pronounce ingredients, or if the foodhas undergone a “process” to arrive at its final state—then it’s processed. Butharder to identify are the foods you’ve long believed are healthy: whole grains,milk, and fruit, to name a few from our lunch example. For those of you who havealready experienced the benefits of the Plant Paradox plan, the information I’mabout to share won’t be surprising. But what I want all of my readers tounderstand is that the Plant Paradox plan’s benefits are not limited to adults.Children who eat the foods on this protocol are not deficient in any nutrients,and they’re not deprived or suffering from missing anything in their diets.Rather, they thrive on this program and learn how to make healthy foods choicesfrom a young age, which is a skill that will last a lifetime.The Plant Paradox program requires a multifaceted approach to lifestyle change,but once you get the hang of it, not only will it empower you to give yourfamily the best nutrition possible, it will also, believe it or not, save youtime in the kitchen and money at the grocery store. And that sounds pretty good,doesn’t it? Now, I won’t sugarcoat this: it will require some investment of timeup front, including planning your meals each week. But getting organized isessential to making any big change stick. You will use your menu plan as a mapfor your weekly grocery shopping, too. In some cases, one parent may be able toswing by the store (instead of the drive-thru or pizza place) on their way homefrom work and grab an ingredient or two. In other cases, you may be able to onlysqueeze in a weekly grocery trip, which will require you to plan a little morethoughtfully. You’ll also do some batch cooking and prepping over the weekend,so it’s easier to make dinners (and pack lunches) on school nights.Now, let’s get to the issue at hand: how to feed your family. I know that whatI’m about to share is unsettling, but the information you’re getting fromtrusted sources, including the government, and often your pediatrician, isflawed. Nothing against your pediatrician—remember, I’ve worked in pediatricsmyself—but most doctors aren’t given nutrition classes in medical school. Theadvice they offer their patients is typically based not on the latest research,but on the USDA food pyramid. And let’s be clear about one thing: the U.S.Department of Agriculture’s job is to sell agricultural products. What does theU.S. produce in mass quantities? Corn, wheat, soybeans, cow’s milk, beef, pork,and chicken. Is it any wonder the USDA’s guidelines are predicated on consumingthese products?So let’s take a closer look at that pyramid, and what the USDA suggests you feedyour family.US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOOD PYRAMIDimage [../images/page20.jpg]As you can see, the base of the pyramid is comprised of grains such as bread,pasta, rice, and cereal—all lectin-loaded, processed foods. Above grains we have3 to 5 servings of vegetables (great!) and 2 to 4 servings of fruit—a quantitythat, as we will discuss shortly, is hugely excessive. What’s above fruit andveggies? Why 2 to 3 servings of good old-fashioned dairy products of course—aswell as 2 to 3 daily servings of meat. At the top? Fats, oils, and sweets to beconsumed “sparingly.” This may be the sole place I am in agreement with theUSDA—sweets should be consumed exceedingly sparingly. But healthy fats and oils?Let’s just say, they are a lot better for your child’s growing brain than a bowlof Wheaties.It’s time to take a closer look at what we’re feeding our kids. To kick thingsoff, I’ve identified the top five “healthy” foods that parents are encouraged tofeed their kids, because I want to explore the reasons why they aren’t actuallyso healthy. There’s a very good chance you may have several of these items inyour kitchen now, but after reading this, I doubt they’ll be in your home forlong!The 5 Fictitious Foods (That Are Not Healthy for Kids!)1. COW’S MILKMilk is on the high honor roll of healthy foods for kids. Parents are advised tobegin giving their children whole milk the moment they are weaned from breastmilk or formula—as early as age one. And remember those milk mustache ads andthe campaign to get kids to drink more milk to build healthy bones and teeth? Wehave long been marketed the idea that milk is a food that “does a body good.” Ibeg to differ.Nearly all of cow’s milk in the U.S. and Canada comes from breeds of cows(including the most common breed worldwide, the Holstein) that produce alectin-like protein known as casein A1, which is converted in your body to theprotein beta-casomorphin (BCM), an opiod-like substance that may explain whymilk is so addicting and helps adults and children feel comforted.Unfortunately, this protein also attaches to the pancreas’s insulin-producingcells, known as beta cells, which prompts an immune attack on the pancreas.Research indicates this protein may be a primary cause of type 1 diabetes.3[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_3] BCM also stimulates inflammation. If yoususpect you or your child are “lactose-intolerant,” it’s likely that you’reactually experiencing the discomfort of this inflammatory response, not aproblem with lactose.Many times, parents of infants and toddlers struggle to accept the idea thatthey don’t need to give their children milk to ensure healthy growth anddevelopment. I understand their dilemma—just about every authority new parentsrely on for accurate information suggests just the opposite of what I’m saying.To help assuage their fears, I explain why milk is in no way essential for theirchild’s wellbeing.First, it’s important to understand that all cow’s milk is not only dense incalories, but is loaded with insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which, as thename implies, prompts rapid growth and weight gain. This is a benefit forcalves: size is a valuable asset in the animal world. Bigger animals are morelikely to survive and are less likely to be attacked by a predator. Amazingly,however, your child is not a calf that needs to grow rapidly! Quite theopposite: humans are designed to grow slowly; that’s why human breastmilk hasmuch less IGF-1 than cow’s milk. As long as your child is eating a varied dietthat includes plenty of calcium-rich foods like spinach, sweet potatoes, figs(they can be reconstituted in warm water), and pressure-cooked beans orlentils—all pureed, if necessary—he or she will not be stunted or deficient inany key nutrients. And if you never introduce milk in the first place, yourchild will never miss it.If your family is currently consuming conventional cow’s milk and/or cow’s milkyogurt, cottage cheese, most cheeses, and ice cream, I recommend removing theseproducts from your and their diet. Luckily, due the popularity of the vegan andvegetarian lifestyles, there many widely available and delicious substitutes forthese foods, including goat, sheep, and coconut milks, cheese, and yogurts (besure to avoid those with added sugars) and pili nut yogurt (sold under the brandname Lavva). Your kids can still enjoy ice cream as well—there is a wide varietyof coconut milk–based options available (again, avoid those high in sugar), justbe sure to steer clear of soy-based dairy alternatives, as these products aretypically made with GMO soy and are high in lectins. Of course, the best way togive your kids healthy ice cream treats is to make them at home, where you cancontrol every ingredient—such as the Keto Kids’ Fudge Pops[9780062911841_Chapter11_7.xhtml#page_210] and Almond Butter and Jelly Popsicles[9780062911841_Chapter11_8.xhtml#page_213], which are simple to make and a hugehit with kids!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Vitamin DThe one beneficial thing about cow’s milk for growing kids? In this country,milk is fortified with vitamin D, which is essential for young, growing bones todevelop properly. Studies have also shown that higher levels of vitamin D inchildhood translates to lower cholesterol levels in kids.4 Unfortunately, mostadults and children are deficient in vitamin D. Our body needs exposure tosunlight to convert vitamin D to its usable form, and as more and more kidsspend their free time looking at screens rather than outside playing in thesunshine, pediatricians are seeing more and more vitamin D deficiencies in theiryoung patients.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a minimum of 600 IUs daily ofvitamin D for children ages 1 to 7, and 800 IUs daily for children ages 8 andolder. I disagree. Almost all children I see with allergies, asthma, eczema, orother autoimmune diseases, have very low vitamin D levels. Kids above age 7or 8can easily take 2,000 IUs a day of vitamin D3. I have yet to see a single caseof vitamin D toxicity in my thousands of patients who take vitamin Dsupplements.In addition to supplementation with pills or gummies, be sure to give your kidsplenty of vitamin D–rich foods like egg yolks and salmon. And encourage them toplay outside in the sun!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------2. WHOLE GRAINSChances are, for most of your life you’ve believed that whole grains are ahealthy choice, and you’ve gone out of your way, and spent extra money, to makesure your family eats whole wheat, multi-grain, seeded everything. You buy thebrown bread with lots of texture; you make oatmeal for breakfast; you servequinoa at dinner; you order brown rice with your sushi. You want to feed yourfamily right.I’m truly sorry to tell you this, but it’s all a myth. Whole grains are far froma health food. Yes, they are slower-digesting than processed grains that havehad the hull and germ removed. But it’s those components—the hull of theseed—that contain the greatest concentration of lectins. Whole grains are highlyinflammatory, even more so than their de-hulled counterparts like white breadand white rice.Whole grains are also carbohydrates that convert to sugar in the body, whichmeans they are a source of unnecessary pounds as well. In addition to promotingweight gain, wheat triggers an opiate-like response in your brain, which promptsyou to crave more and more. For many, including kids, these carbohydrates alsocause brain fog and fatigue.So where does our belief in the “goodness” of whole grains originate? It allstarted with Will Keith Kellogg, founder of Kellogg’s brand. Around the turn ofthe twentieth century, Kellogg and his brother, John Harvey Kellogg, devised away to process corn into crunchy flakes, which they recommended for theirability to help keep people “regular.” This was the beginning of massiveadvertising push—and a fiction—that persists to this day: that cereal, and wholegrains, are the cornerstone of a healthy breakfast. Top it off with a littlecow’s milk, and you have a prototypical kid’s breakfast—one that is brimmingwith inflammatory, gut-punishing lectins.I am not going to suggest that your child skips breakfast (though it’s certainlybeneficial for adults to do so on occasion), but I do suggest your children eata low-carb, keto-friendly breakfast that will keep their blood sugar stable andprovide them with filling, nutrient-dense fuel for the day. In other words, putdown that box of “healthy” cereal or that packet of instant oatmeal, whichcarries little to no nutritional value, and make your kids an omelet instead. Notime to cook in the morning? Hard boil some eggs in advance and create breakfastbowls with a hard-boiled egg and half an avocado sprinkled with sea salt anddrizzled with olive oil. With that combination of healthy fats and protein,their little minds and bodies will be well-prepared for the school day ahead!3. FRUITAnother fact that many parents find shocking is that fruit should be enjoyed inmoderation—yes, even for children. I realize this one is particularly toughbecause fruit is such an easy and convenient snack. Who hasn’t told their kid tograb an apple when they complain of being hungry? Of course, an apple is stillbetter than a bag of chips or some other type of processed food, but it’s notthe best choice.Incidentally, as with cereal, there is an interesting story behind our embraceof fruit—in particular, bananas. The idea that fruit was an essential part of ahealthy diet originated in an advertising campaign devised by the United FruitCompany (Chiquita Bananas), which claimed that bananas cured celiac disease andoffered a coupon for a free bunch of bananas in—you guessed it!—Kellogg’s CornFlakes boxes. United Fruit Company even paid doctors to promote bananas forkids’ health!So, why do I suggest limiting fruit? Mostly because it is loaded with sugar—evenmore so today, as modern fruit has been hybridized for high sugar content. (Everwonder why the Honey Crisp apple is so popular? It’s been bred to taste extrasweet!) And yes, it is “natural” sugar, but fructose, the sugar found in fruit,inflicts serious damage on your liver and kidneys. A recent study out of UCLAshowed that a diet high in fructose can lead to insulin resistance, which inturn slows the brain and impairs memory and learning.5[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_5]As you can see here [9780062911841_Chapter2.xhtml#page_20], the USDA recommendseating 2 to 4 servings of fruit a day for adults, and their recommendation forchildren is virtually the same. That’s more than twice the amount of fruit youand your children should be eating! I want you to start thinking of fruit asnutritious candy. While fruit does contain beneficial vitamins, minerals, fiber,antioxidants, and polyphenols, you need only a small serving to get thebenefits. I’m not suggesting that you have to eradicate fruit from your and yourkids’ diets—just make some modifications to how much and which fruits they eat.FRUIT GUIDELINES * Offer your kids in-season fruits; always choose organic, and try to buy from local farmers. * Change up your family’s on-the-go snacks to options that provide protein and fat instead of carbs and sugar: try offering a handful of macadamia nuts, pistachios, or walnuts; unsweetened almond butter with celery sticks; or a small container of coconut, goat’s, pili nut, or sheep’s milk yogurt. * Aim for lower-sugar, high-nutrient fruits like berries, pomegranate seeds, and citrus fruits. * Avoid most tropical fruits (with the exceptions below), which are especially high in sugar. * Feel free to eat the following tropical fruits year-round in their unripe form: bananas, mangoes, and papayas. * Make fruit a treat and serve no more than once a day. To make it a dessert-like indulgence, try topping fruits like berries, plums, or nectarines with a little bit of whipped coconut cream. * Limit serving sizes of fruit to about a half a cup (taking into consideration age and type of fruit). * Avoid fruit juices of all types—even those that are “fresh squeezed.” This is merely mainlining sugar!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, Sugar Is As Bad As You Think It Is.I don’t have to tell you that sugar is terrible for you, and your kids. Not onlydo sugary foods have no place on the Plant Paradox program, they should have noplace in anyone’s diet. But despite the fact that we know sugar is hazardous toour health, many of us keep eating it. And thanks to peer pressure, socialcustoms, and sheer convenience, so do our kids. Many parents feel pressure to“let their kids enjoy childhood” by giving into pleas for sweets, from candy andcookies to juice and soda. And seemingly-healthy kid’s foods—including yogurts,granola, cereals, and energy bars—even contain crazy amounts of hidden sugars.(Not that you’re buying your kids any of these processed foods, right?)Shockingly, as much as 40 percent of American healthcare dollars are spent totreat diseases directly related to the overconsumption of sugar—that’s more than$1 trillion invested annually in treating sugar and junk-food related ailments.4[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_4] Numerous studies have shown that excesssugar intake from processed foods may negatively impact your children’scognition. Soda and fruit juice consumption can raise a child’s risk of obesityby 60 percent per daily serving.5 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_5] And as weknow, obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.6[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_6]So, to the parents who tell me they feel guilty for denying their children thesimple pleasures of childhood, I say: you are not denying them a thing—you aregiving them the precious gift of health. One day they will thank you!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------There is one exception to the fruit rule: avocadoes! Technically a fruit, thehumble avocado is one of the healthiest foods you can eat, and you and your kidsshould feel free to enjoy them year-round.4. PEANUTS AND PEANUT BUTTERThe peanut, which originated in the Americas and was introduced to Europe byChristopher Columbus, is the most popular nut in the U.S. And guess what? It’snot even a nut! It’s a legume and it is loaded with lectins.You might be wondering about peanut allergies—these days it seems like more kidsare allergic to peanuts than ever before. And in fact they are. All foodallergies, including peanut allergies, are on the rise. As you may already know,peanut allergies are so dangerous and widespread, many school lunchrooms are nowequipped with EpiPens, and some school campuses have gone peanut-free. While theubiquity and severity of these allergies is a somewhat modern phenomenon, thereality is that 94 percent of humans carry an antibody to the peanut lectin.6[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_6] Most people have some sensitivity topeanuts, and humans have no business eating peanuts or peanut products.Peanuts and peanut butter tend to be thought of as kids’ foods, so you’ll findthem in just about every packaged food marketed to kids (and parents)—from trailmixes to granola bars to cereals to “healthy” cookies. Here’s the good news: aslong as you’re avoiding packaged foods, you can avoid a lot of peanuts too! Awin-win. And organic almond butter is a great swap for peanut butter—use it ineverything from sandwiches to baked goods—your kids may love the flavor evenmore than their beloved peanut butter!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------To Dose or Not to Dose?Due to the surge in peanut allergies, many pediatricians now advise parents tobegin introducing small amounts of peanut butter to babies as young as sixmonths old. The thinking here is that earlier exposure means a reduced risk ofallergies as the child grows, with the small doses functioning much like avaccine to “educate” the immune system not to react to peanuts. I understandthat this may seem like a logical intervention to ensure your child’s safety,but as you might expect, I disagree with the idea of introducing peanuts in anyform.Instead of relying on peanut butter to educate a child’s immune system, a betterbet is to rely on a healthy microbiome. Gut bugs “talk” to the immune system andteach it what is a threat and what isn’t. For babies, building a healthymicrobiome means avoiding exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (see here[9780062911841_Chapter1.xhtml#page_12] for more details), breastfeeding whenpossible7 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_7], and avoiding unnecessary cyclesof antibiotics. For older children, it means feeding them a varied diet ofgut-supporting foods and avoiding lectins (as well as endocrine disruptors andantibiotics, unless essential). The best defense against life-changing allergiesisn’t a good offense—it’s a good gut!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------5. BEANS AND LENTILSMany pediatricians will advise you to introduce these forms of plant-basedprotein as “first foods”—infants throughout America are fed mushy beans andlentils by well-intentioned parents who think they are giving their little onesthe building blocks of life. Unfortunately, like peanuts, beans and lentils arelegumes and are, therefore, rich in lectins. But it’s not all doom and gloom:you can still safely feed these foods to your children, as long as you areconscientious how you source and prepare them. Always look for organic beans andlentils, as many are GMO crops and/or grown with pesticides. And be sure to soakyour beans overnight before cooking them in the pressure-cooker, which helps toremove the lectins during the cooking process. For an easy shortcut, look forEden Foods organic canned beans, which are soaked and then pressure-cooked inthe cans. Just rinse and serve!The State of (Student) UnionIf you’re reading this book, chances are you’re already aware of some soberingstatistics about the state of children’s health in this country. Between 1970and 2009, daily caloric intake for kids rose by about 425 calories on average—a20 percent increase—largely driven by increased sugar and processed foodconsumption, and constant advertising of junk food to children.8[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_8]Not only have the variety of temptations increased, so too have portion sizes.In a study that examined what Americans ate over the 30-year period from 1986 to2016, researchers found that the total number of entrees, desserts, and sidesincreased by 226 percent, or 22.9 percent per year of the study. What’s more,the calories in all three categories increased significantly as well, with thelargest increase being desserts, followed by entrees. Worse yet, a study thatlooked at kids’ ability to portion control found that children’s caloric intakeincreased with a larger portion size. In other words, it’s up to you to helpyour children to determine what constitutes a healthy amount of food.9[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_9]Increasingly, our diets have become filled with processed vegetable oils, whichare high in a type of fat called omega-6 that is linked to disease andinflammation. These fats are also present in grain-fed meat, dairy, and eggs,whereas beneficial omega-3 fats are found in the oils of fish, particularlywild-caught fatty fish (farmed fish contain a significantly lower amount ofthese healthful fats).10 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_10] Soybean oil, whichis loaded with lectins, is the most commonly-consumed fat in the U.S. and playsa significant role in the development of obesity and diabetes.11[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_11]Today, nearly 20 percent of American children and nearly 40 percent of adultsare obese. And as obesity rates rise, so do related-health problems, includingincreased risks of type 2 diabetes and cancer. Obesity in youth can also triggerearlier puberty in both boys and girls. One study that tracked hormonal changesin boys ages 4 to 7 determined that those who were obese had greater odds ofstarting puberty before the age of 9.12 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_12]While this has been previously observed in girls, the fact that obesity alsoaffects the maturation of boys further cements concerns about the wide-rangingeffects of obesity in children.While much of childhood obesity can be attributed to eating a diet high in junkfood and processed food, the 7 Deadly Disruptors play a role as well. Householdproducts such as hand sanitizers, antibacterial soaps, nonstick cookware,plastic wrap, and more expose you and your children to hormone-disrupting toxinsthat both interfere with the normal functioning of your endocrine system andcause the body to store fat.13 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_13]So, what can we do to start turning the tide on our health and our family’shealth? The answer is really very simple: cook and eat at home more often. Makefamily meals vegetable-centric, with a good portion of healthy fats, someprotein, and limited portions of in-season fruit, preferably all organic. Realfood is, at its core, straightforward. It’s not a bunch of hard-to-pronounceingredients and chemicals. Think about it—if chemicals are added to a food topreserve it and destroy bacteria, guess what they’re doing to your gut buddies?That’s right, they take a hit too. Consumption of processed foods has even beenlinked to an increased risk of cancer and early death.14[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_14] By cutting out or reducing processed andhigh-carb food at home, you are reducing your whole family’s risk of obesity andchronic diseases, as well as tooth decay15 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_15](and oral health is critical to overall health).When you get the junk foods out your house, you will notice a huge difference inyour family’s health—and fast. As inspiration to make these changes, let meshare with you the results of a famous study on kid’s nutrition. Years ago, aschool in Appleton, Wisconsin, changed its school food program, eliminatingextra sugars and processed food and instead preparing healthy, organic meals forbreakfast and lunch at school. Administrators also engaged with parents abouthow to make healthy dinner choices at home. The results of the study wereastounding. Test scores and student behavior improved, truancy rates droppeddramatically, and kids complained of fewer health-related problems. Teachersalso reported enhanced concentration skills in their pupils. One teacher evensaid that she saw these changes begin to take place “overnight.”16[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_16] If that’s not motivation to start changingthe way your family eats, I don’t know what is!After removing processed carbs, sugar, and all other junk food from your home, Irecommend increasing your family’s consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fats.These are foods like wild-caught salmon, flaxseeds, and walnuts. At the sametime, you want to decrease consumption of omega-6 rich foods (think deep-friedfoods cooked in lectin-rich, highly processed oils such as canola, soy, andpeanut), which are highly inflammatory. It’s important to keep in mind though,that simply cutting down on omega-6 fats and eating a few more servings ofomega-3s a week isn’t enough. EPA and DPA, two long-chain omega-3 acids, arecritical for brain and heart health17 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_17], andmost people aren’t getting enough of these nutrients. In fact, a recent studyshowed that children and adults who made changes to their diet to minimizeomega-6 fats and increase consumption of omega-3s still didn’t consume enoughEPA or DHA.The standard American diet has long been criticized for its low EPA and DHAcontent, and even health-conscious adults are challenged to meet their needsgiven the lack of access (and also prohibitive costs) of some of the bestsources of the longer chain omega-3: wild-caught fatty fish and shellfish, andgrass-fed-and-finished beef.18 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_18] But it iswell worth the extra effort and money to consume these fats, whether throughfood or supplementation. Many diseases such as ADHD, depression, cardiovasculardisease, and metabolic syndrome (to name a few) could be improved by increasingomega-3 consumption.19 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_19] In addition, higherDHA intake in children has been shown to correlate with improved schoolperformance!Let me sum up with this fact: When that Wisconsin school experimented withadding “junk food days” to their new, healthy food program, guess what happened?In the days following these indulgences, students complained of stomach aches,feelings of sadness, and lethargy.20 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_20] It’sworth it to make these changes for your family. So let’s take a look at somestrategies to make the transition to a Plant Paradox lifestyle a little easieron you and your kids.Getting Your Family on Board with The Plant Paradox: A Cheat Sheet 1. CHOOSE ONE FOOD/ONE MEAL AT A TIME. Don’t try to change everything overnight. Not only is it difficult to do a 180 on a practical level, but such an abrupt transition is difficult for the whole family on an emotional and psychological level. Bring your kids into the process and give them some control. For instance, if you want to take the strategy of cutting out one food a day, maybe let your kids vote on which foods are the first to go. 2. PLAN AHEAD. I can’t stress this enough: Being organized and planning your meals is the best way to ensure success. Make sure to keep some go-to foods on hand: Omega-3 or pastured eggs, frozen vegetables, coconut milk, avocadoes. Prep vegetables for snacks and meals and wash, dry, and properly store your leafy greens. Buy a salad spinner, and let your kids “run” it. Stock a few basic components, like cauliflower rice, miracle noodles, and Quorn or tempeh, that can be easily thrown together for dinner, preventing you from having any excuses on a busy weeknight. 3. COOK IN LARGE BATCHES. Double or triple the recipe you’re making, and freeze leftovers for those days when you don’t have time to cook. Even better if you can pre-portion into individual servings before freezing. Or save leftovers in the fridge for quick lunches during the week. 4. GET YOUR KIDS IN THE KITCHEN. Involving your kids in the preparation of meals—even if they’re just stirring the ingredients—will help them feel more invested in the meal and more interested in what’s on their plates. And having some little helpers in the kitchen cuts down on your prep time. Both of my grandchildren love to cook with their parents (particularly when it comes to making cookies and pancakes)! 5. OFFER CHOICES. Give your children choices when it comes to their meals. Let them reject one vegetable on their plate. (I had to hide my peas growing up! Little did I know I was rejecting lectin-rich legumes at a tender age.) As long as they are eating a variety of healthy foods, it’s okay for kids to abstain from the things they truly cannot stomach. It’s important to keep mealtimes as stress-free as possible so that kids don’t develop negative or anxious feelings about food. Remember, their taste buds are still evolving! And no, when they reject a food on their plate, don’t you have to give them what they want instead. They will not starve. I guarantee it. 6. HYDRATE WISELY. Serve water at mealtimes and in between meals. Cut out juice and soda completely, even the low carb or sugar free versions. Same goes for sports drinks and sugary or artificially-sweetened iced teas and lemonades. Once your family’s taste buds adjust, you’ll find they actually start craving water and choosing it to quench their thirst. 7. EMBRACE YOUR PRESSURE COOKER AND/OR SLOW COOKER. Let these two gadgets make your life in the kitchen easier. Part 2 [9780062911841_Part2.xhtml] of this book is loaded with new and easy recipes for using these appliances. With a slow cooker, you can just throw together a few ingredients in the morning and then enjoy a meal when you come home after work, without the stress of trying to pull together a meal at the last second when you and the whole family are hungry, tried, or even worse, “hangry.” No time in the morning? No worries! An Instant Pot or other electric pressure cooker may be the ultimate “fast food” miracle. And remember, make a double batch and freeze the leftovers. 8. SNACK SMART. Stock your fridge and pantry with healthy snacks. If there are delicious, healthy options available, you and your family won’t miss the processed stuff you used to munch on.What to Expect When You’re Expecting (or Expecting to Expect)If you don’t have a family now but are planning to start one soon—or if you arealready expecting—then I don’t need to tell you that prenatal nutrition is ofthe utmost importance for the health of both mother and baby. I get a lot ofquestions from patients and readers about the best way to eat during pregnancy,so I wanted to take a pause here to touch on my recommendations (if this doesn’tapply to you, feel free to turn to Chapter 3 [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml]!).Before we go further, I want to say that good nutrition isn’t only about thegrowing baby—it’s also about the mother! Too often we speak to expecting mothersas though they are little more than incubators, offering advice solely under theguise of “what is good for the baby.” I want to be clear that it is just asimportant for expecting and new mothers to care for themselves, to nourishthemselves with healthy foods, and to keep their stress levels to a minimum bynot overthinking every small choice. As long as they are eating well themajority of the time, their baby will be just fine.With that said, the nutrients that fuel a fetus’s development are alsobeneficial for mothers. So, what are those nutrients, and when do you need them?Well, the answer is, earlier than you might think. Obstetricians recommend womenstart taking a prenatal vitamin (not a general multivitamin) six months beforeplanning to conceive,21 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_21] and I agree thatthis is the right window for making nutritional changes to support a healthypregnancy. Prenatal vitamins help to ensure a woman’s body has the nutrients itneeds to support new life, and recently they have also been shown to have aprotective effect against autism. A study out of the University of California,Davis, concluded that mothers who took prenatal vitamins during their firstmonth of pregnancy reduced their child’s risk of autism by more than half.22[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_22]I also recommend supplementing with the active forms of B12 and Folate in theforms of Methyl B12 and methylfolate, to help protect against common geneticdisorders. Another source of protective compounds can be found right in theproduce aisle, in the form of pomegranates, which are one of the mostpolyphenol-rich foods in the world. (You can also buy pomegranate extract, whichis sugar-free.) Polyphenols are “eaten” by gut buddies that convert them intocompounds which help protect a developing child’s brain23[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_23] and heart, and may even help train theimmune system.Many obstetricians will also advise women to take omega-3 and DHA supplements,which support healthy brain development in the fetus. As you know, the Americandiet is sorely lacking in EPA and DHA, and there is no doubt that DHA isessential for healthy brain development. In fact, so important is DHA that ababy will “steal” (borrow?) almost 90 percent of its mother’s DHA to build itsown brain! I recommend all pregnant women, or women who are planning apregnancy, take about 1,000 mg of fish oil or algae-derived DHA per day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eating for TwoI had just finished giving a lecture on the Plant Paradox at a seminar when aman approached me wondering if he could ask a few more questions. He explainedthat he was looking for information to help his wife, who suffered fromrheumatoid arthritis(RA). She took immunosuppressant drugs, which clearly helpedher manage her symptoms, but despite the fact that the couple had been trying toconceive for several years, she had not been able to get pregnant. Moreover,they were both afraid of the unknown effects the drugs she was taking might haveon a baby if she were to become pregnant.I offered to help and ran his wife’s bloodwork, which revealed the classicmarkers for RA were positive, despite being on medication, and, she had very lowlevels of vitamin D and omega-3s. We began supplementation and started the PlantParadox protocol. Three months later, her markers for RA were negative, and hervitamin D levels improved as well. We stopped her immunosuppressant drugs andgave her pre- and probiotics daily. Repeat blood work showed no recurrence of RAmarkers.Shortly thereafter I got the call I had been hoping for: they were expecting!During the wife’s pregnancy I prescribed increasing her fish oil supplementationand made sure she took methyl B12 and methyl folate. She continued to follow thePlant Paradox program. Today the couple has welcomed a healthy baby boy, and Momhas remained free from painful RA symptoms.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------In addition to taking a supplemental DHA, one of the best ways to get therecommended amount of DHA is to consume on a weekly basis 8 to 12 ounces of oilyfish, like wild-caught mackerel, sardines, and wild salmon, but with the cost ofwild fish and possible contamination with mercury, I prefer getting your DHAfrom supplements. I also encourage pregnant women to keep in mind that a highintake of omega-6 fatty acids (found in processed food, fast foods, andvegetable oils) during pregnancy has been shown to predispose babies to obesityboth in childhood and later in life, which lays the groundwork for numeroushealth problems down the road.24 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_24] Andresearchers who performed a statistical analysis found that a higher omega-6 toomega-3 ratio during a mother’s pregnancy was associated with a higher risk herchild developing symptoms of ADHD around seven years of age.25[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_25]Another consideration for pregnant women is to avoid excess sugar, particularlyprocessed sugar. Sugar negatively impacts cognition for babies in utero,26[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_26] and one study found that drinkingsugar-sweetened beverages in particular increases the risk of harm to thefetus’s brain. “Diet” drinks didn’t fare any better—they too were found toadversely impact child cognition.27 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_27] Iencourage all expecting moms to drink plenty of water or unsweetened tea(especially green tea, for its polyphenol content) as their beverage ofchoice—their growing bodies absolutely need hydration to support the function oftwo people!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Importance of Choosing OrganicWe all know how important it is to choose organic foods whenever possible, andeating organic is doubly important for pregnant women. But what you might notknow is that new research points to the importance of eating organic foods evenwhen couples are trying to conceive. A study published in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association found that pesticides can affect fertility in bothwomen and men.28 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_28] For men in particular,pesticides can alter DNA, causing gene mutations that may result in birthdefects, or an outright inability to conceive.29[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_29] And it goes without saying that this is atime to avoid exposure to the endocrine-disrupting chemicals listed here[9780062911841_Chapter1.xhtml#page_12], which can cause hormonal problems thathave been shown to negatively impact fertility.30[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I also get a lot of questions from new moms about how best to feed their babies,and whether breastfeeding is essential. New motherhood is challenging enough, soinstead of adopting the mantra “breast is best,” I like to support the idea that“fed is best.” If your baby is healthy, growing, and thriving—you can hardlywish for more!When it comes to formula, my advice is to look for varieties that contain pre-and post-biotics, DHA, B12, and folate, to make sure the baby is getting all ofhis or her nutritional needs met. If a new mother chooses to and is able tobreastfeed, her diet postpartum continues to be just as critical to her baby’shealth as it was when she was planning and expecting her baby. I recommendcontinued supplementation with prenatal vitamins and DHA (1,000 mg), as thesenutrients will be passed onto babies in breast milk.31[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_31] And remember my famous saying: You are whatyou eat, but you are what the thing you are eating, ate. The same goes forbabies—they literally eat what their mothers eat! Finally, I cannot stressenough the recommendation for breastfeeding moms to take a high-qualityprobiotic daily and feed their gut bugs with prebiotic foods like yams, jicama,Belgium endive and Sunchokes to name a few. The health of the baby’s microbiomeis a direct reflection of its mother’s microbiome.For all new moms, nutrition is an essential component of the postpartum recoveryand healing process. Women not only lose blood (and therefore, iron) duringbirth, they also “lose” (or, donate) a lot of vitamins and DHA as they growtheir babies. I encourage all new moms to increase their consumption of darkgreen leafy vegetables like spinach, which are iron rich, and take a vitamin Csupplement twice a day near meals to help their bodies absorb that iron.Increasing your healthy fat intake from sources like avocadoes and olive oil isimportant too, and offers the side benefit of helping the body more easily shedthe weight of pregnancy. And even for moms who aren’t breastfeeding, I stillrecommend taking a DHA supplement—at least 1,000 mg. I’ve seen a number of newmothers suffering from postpartum depression, and when I run their bloodwork, itturns out that they have very low levels of DHA. Supplementation of thiscritical fatty acid really makes a big difference in their recovery.Alright: Now you that you are armed with the facts (minus the fiction) aboutkids’ nutrition, it’s time to dive into the Plant Paradox program and make it afamily affair. Are you ready? Let’s go!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Breastmilk and the MicrobiomeBreast milk is a treasure trove of nutrition for babies in many ways, and one isthat is helps to set up a healthy microbiome for life. Recent research has shownthat yeasts, other fungi, and bacteria in breast milk provide crucialmicroorganisms to the infant’s developing gut biome. The presence of fungalcells within the breast milk also suggests that breast milk could influence thedevelopment of infants’ mycobiota, a newly discovered component of our overallholobiome, which is made up of (beneficial) fungi.32[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch2fn_32]In addition, oligosaccharides, the naturally occurring sugars in mother’s milk,serve as food for the baby’s gut buddies and help to shape his or her microbiomeand boost immunity. Breast milk is so beneficial to an infant’s immune systemthat exclusively breastfed babies have been found to have lower infant mortalityrates from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea, ear infection,pneumonia, and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), among others.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Three [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch3]So, What Exactly Can My Family Eat? [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch3]When a patient first encounters my now-infamous “No, Thank You” list of foods tobe avoided on the Plant Paradox program, the most common question I hear is:“What’s left for me to eat?”The honest answer is, a lot of delicious foods! The Plant Paradox plan is not adeprivation diet—it is a roadmap for eating smarter. And while there are certainfoods that are off-limits, I’ve replaced them with healthier versions that willstill satisfy your—and your family’s—cravings. That means there are substitutesfor the carbs you love, like bread, pasta, and pizza; recipe hacks for thetomato-based sauces and condiments you can’t live without, like marinara sauceand ketchup; and even decadent, grain- and dairy-free desserts like cheesecakeand chocolate chip cookies. Because really, what kid is going to comply with aneating plan that doesn’t allow for ketchup and dessert?And the best part about using a pressure cooker such as the Instant Pot toprepare your meals is that you can still safely eat a number of high-lectinplant-based proteins, such as beans and lentils. I encourage you to embrace thecreative food swaps and new preparation techniques in this book, which really domake it easier than ever to eat a low-lectin, high-quality, anti-inflammatorydiet. I think you will be amazed at the variety of delicious meals available toyou and your family.Before we get into the details of the “Yes, Please” and “No, Thank You” foodlists, I do want to be clear about one thing: There is no way to eliminate everysingle lectin from your diet, nor would I ever suggest you try to do so—becausegoing entirely lectin-free would mean eradicating all plants from your diet.That’s the last thing I want you to do! Some of my critics have mistakenlycharacterized my program as anti-plant, when nothing could be farther from thetruth. You can even be vegetarian or vegan on the Plant Paradox plan. In fact,my wife and I eat a primarily plant-based diet, with a little fish or meat aboutonce a week. My goal is not to scare you away from plants, but instead to armyou with the information you need to choose the best, most nutritious plantspossible and to learn some simple cooking methods for reducing their lectinload, so that you can keep your gut buddies happy and your inflammation markerslow.By the way, I’ve compiled all of these “Yes, Please” “No, Thank You” foods intoa handy, at-a-glance list, (here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_57]). You’llnotice the list of “Yes, please” foods is more than twice as long as the list of“No, Thank You” foods—you and your family will not go hungry on this program, Ipromise you!Yes, Please: Foods Low in LectinsFATSI recommend that between 60 to 80 percent of your total daily calories come fromhealthy fat sources. That might sound like a lot of fat, and it is—but fat isnot something to be afraid of. Contrary to the misinformation about fatspopularized by the low-fat diet craze, good quality fats are actually essentialfor your health, and can even help you lose weight (if that’s one of yourgoals). On the Plant Paradox program, you are likely going to consume more fatthan you are accustomed to eating.What might surprise you is that fats by themselves do not trigger the release ofinsulin, the hormone that tells your body to store excess sugar and protein asfat. Let that sink in for a moment. Eating fat (without carbs or protein) cannotmake you fat. But, the combination of fats with simple carbohydrates (likechips, nachos, fries, or pasta) or fats combined with a lot of protein andcarbohydrates (a hot dog or burger with a bun, an order of fries, and a soda)creates the perfect weight-gaining and insulin-pumping storm.Good fats not only protect and nourish your gut lining,33[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_33] but since your brain is about 60 percentfat, healthy fats improve your and your kids’ brain function. The best sourcesof healthy fats are extra-virgin olive oil, olives, avocados, avocado oil,coconut milk, MCT oil (aka medium-chain triglyceride oil), coconut oil, perillaoil, walnut oil, macadamia oil, algae oil, omega-3 rich egg yolks from pasturedhens, and fish oil or algae-based DHA and EPA.GREENSGreens contain large amounts of chemicals called polyphenols, which offer manyhealth benefits. Polyphenols act as antioxidants in the body, protecting yourtissues against oxidative stress and inflammation and helping to keep diseaseslike cancer and heart disease at bay. Eating your greens is one of the bestchoices you can make for your health. In fact, one recent study even found thatpeople who eat a serving of greens a day have a 90 percent reduced risk ofdeveloping Alzheimer’s disease.34 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_34] Thinkabout it: If we had a drug that effective, how much would you pay for it? Wellfor about two dollars a day, you can help protect your entire family fromcognitive decline. That’s one of the best incentives to eat more greens I canthink of!In addition to polyphenols, greens are also rich in fiber, which helps you feelfull and keeps blood sugar levels stable. Eating high-fiber foods ensures youare satisfied at meals and aren’t hungry between meals, when it’s easy to betempted by less-than-healthy foods.CRUCIFEROUS AND LOW-LECTIN VEGETABLESVegetables should be the focal point of all your meals on the Plant Paradoxprogram, but cruciferous vegetables are particularly beneficial, as they supplynutrition for your gut buddies in the form of prebiotic fiber. Prebiotic fibercannot be broken down by the digestive enzymes in the gut, and instead serves asfuel for your gut buddies. Prebiotic fiber is literally food for your microbes,and the more you eat, the more they thrive.Consumption of cruciferous vegetables has also been linked to reducedinflammation. In one study of more than 1,000 women, researchers found that ahigher intake of cruciferous vegetables was associated with a 25 percentreduction in inflammation markers.35 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_35] I knowinflammation might seem like something that only affects adults, but considerthis: Many children today are diagnosed with allergies or asthma, both of whichare inflammatory conditions. You have the ability to give your kids the bestpossible preventive medicine, in the form of the food you prepare for them.Members of the cruciferous vegetable family include: arugula, bok choy,broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale,kohlrabi, Swiss chard, and watercress. Other lectin-free vegetables that offerhealth benefits are artichokes, asparagus, beets, celery, garlic, leeks,mushrooms, okra, onions, and radishes. One word of caution: if you or your childhas IBS, diarrhea, undiagnosed stomach pains or Crohn’s disease, or ulcerativecolitis, cook these vegetables to “mush” when you first introduce them to avoiddigestive distress.NUTSNuts are a terrific source of healthy fats, polyphenols, and fiber. They’regreat for everyday eating, but portion control is key, as their calorie andprotein content can add up quickly. Portable and filling, they make a perfectsnack. Keep in mind, not all nuts are compatible with the Plant Paradox program.Peanuts and cashews are legumes and should be avoided. I recommend eatingwalnuts, pistachios, macadamias, hazelnuts, coconut, chestnuts, blanched orMarcona almonds, and pecans. Be careful with whole almonds if your kids haveallergies or autoimmune diseases—the skin on almonds contains lectins that manypeople react to. Some nuts, like coconut and almond, can also be ground intoflour and are great alternatives to wheat flour for baking.AVOCADOSAvocadoes are not only delicious, they’re also nutritional rock stars.Technically a fruit, avocadoes have no sugar even when ripe and are an excellentsource of fat and prebiotic fibers—both of which can help you lose weight andbetter absorb polyphenols (which are fat soluble) from the plants you eat.Avocadoes are rich in heart-healthy monosaturated fat and, like olive oil, theyhave been shown to reduce low-density (LDL) cholesterol, aka the “bad”cholesterol.LECTIN-FREE GRAINSI realize that it may seem daunting to give up all grains, especially becausethey are a centerpiece of the American diet and serve as the main ingredient inmany people’s go-to meals. I’m talking about cereal and oatmeal for breakfast;sandwiches, wraps, and grain bowls at lunch; pasta or rice at dinner—not tomention the many grain-based snacks and sweets we munch on all day. The goodnews is that today there are so many convenient and tasty substitutes fortraditional grains and grain-based flours. In addition, not all grains carry aheavy lectin load: millet, sorghum, and teff are perfectly safe to eat, and evenif you haven’t tried them before, the recipes in this book will give youeverything you need to cook them with confidence. Millet is not only delicious,but is also packed with minerals like magnesium, potassium, and zinc, to name afew. Sorghum, while historically popular in the South, is finally getting thewider attention it deserves. This grain is full of soluble fiber and compoundsthat are friendly to your gut buddies. Sorghum “popcorn” is a Plant Paradox hackmany of my patients love—it smells and tastes exactly like mini-popcorn! Checkout the recipe for my delicious and kid-approved Chocolate-Coconut PoppedSorghum [9780062911841_Chapter11_3.xhtml#page_204].RESISTANT STARCHESResistant starches are carbohydrates that don’t get broken down and convertedinto glucose as quickly as other types of carbs (like bread for instance—whichis almost instantly converted to sugar and then stored as fat in your body). Thebulk of resistant starch passes through your intestine intact, because it ismore resistant to the enzymes in your gut that break down simple carbs.This means that eating foods high in resistant starch gives you a (mostly) freepass when it comes to their caloric content and their effect on your blood sugarlevels. Your gut buddies also love resistant starches and convert them intoimportant fatty acids that serve as fuel for the cells lining your intestines.In fact, giving your gut buddies the right materials to make more of these fatsmay be one of the keys to preventing and even healing “leaky gut.”The family of resistant starches includes root vegetables like sweet potatoesand yams, as well as taro root, yucca, green plantains, cassava, tapioca, greenbananas, jicama, turnips, and rutabagas, as well as pressure-cooked lentils andbeans. Many of these plants have roots that draw water and minerals from thesoil for nourishment and possess amazing absorption abilities. High in prebioticfiber, these are all great sources of fuel for your gut buddies. While it’s okayto eat resistant starches daily, if you’re trying to lose weight you’ll want tobe mindful of your portions. If you’re cooking for your family, a pound ofpressure-cooked lentils will feed everyone under your roof for a couple of mealsand will provide excellent nutrition.WILD-CAUGHT SEAFOODFish and shellfish are some of the tastiest—and healthiest—foods out there. Agreat source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as critically importantvitamin D, eating wild-caught seafood helps to reduce inflammation, protect youagainst heart disease, and boost brain health.36[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_36]But as with most foods, not all seafood is created equal. The seafood Irecommend eating must be wild-caught and not farm-raised, even if it is labeledas “organic.” Farm-raised fish live in overcrowded conditions, often are treatedwith antibiotics, and are fed lectin-rich corn and soy, whereas wild-caught fisheat a natural diet of plants, other fish, algae, and so on. And about that“organic” seafood: Do you really believe someone followed the fish around theocean to see if they ate organically? Of course not! The organic label meansthey were farmed and fed organic corn, soybeans, or other grains. Though we eatmostly vegetarian or vegan during the week, my wife and I have wild seafood onweekends, both because we enjoy it and because we know it benefits our long-termhealth. I call this approach to eating “vegaquarian.”PASTURED POULTRY AND OMEGA-3 EGGSPastured poultry can be an excellent source of protein and fat. But pasturedisn’t the same as free-range or organic. In fact, it’s critically important toknow the difference between these terms when you’re selecting proteins for yourfamily. Legally, “free-range” chickens can be kept in warehouses with 100,000other birds, where they never see the light of day, are fed corn and soy, andare essentially raised no differently than the industrial chicken you’ve beentold to avoid. Pastured poultry, on the other hand, are able to roam and foragefor their food—allowing the chickens to fulfill their dietary obligation ofeating shrubs, bugs, and grubs. If you’re at the grocery store, look for“pastured” or “pasture-raised” on the packaging, or if you’re talking to yourlocal farmer at the farmers market, ask him or her how the chickens are raisedand fed. (I once asked this question of a farmer at my local farmer’s market inSanta Barbara, and she said, “I don’t feed my chickens anything, they work forme!” meaning they fed themselves a lot of tasty insects they found on theirown.)Now, a word of warning if you have an autoimmune disease: you may react even toa pastured chicken, as most breeders will supplement some of the chickens’ dietwith grain-based feed. Just remember that chicken is a modern addition to ourdiet; your great-grandparents rarely ate chicken; the animals were too valuableas egg layers! Chicken is in no way an essential part of a heathly diet.As with poultry, I recommend purchasing pastured eggs or omega-3 eggs—the latterdesignation means that the chickens were fed flaxseeds and/or algae in additionto their normal feed. I actually want you to eat the yolks and limit the whites,as yolks are the part of the egg with the most nutrients and healthy fats.Research has shown that omega-3 eggs can even help lower cholesterol.37[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_37]ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GRASS-FED MEAT (AKA GRASS-FED AND FINISHED)When purchasing meat it’s essential to understand what the animal was fed duringits life. Sadly, because of poor regulation and misleading labeling, the term“grass-fed” can be applied to animals who were primarily raised on a diet ofcorn and soy, but fed grass at some point during their lifecycle. Of course, ifthe animals you’re eating ate corn and soy, you’re eating corn and soy too.Remember my mantra: You are what you eat, but you are also what the thing youare eating, ate. Most of the corn and soy fed to livestock has been geneticallymodified, and usually contains even more lectins than their non-GMOcounterparts. Moreover, as we discussed earlier, even non-GMO grains and soy arenow sprayed with Roundup.When you’re selecting meat, make sure it’s not just grass-fed, but alsograss-finished. The meat from these animals contains more omega-3 fats and feweromega-6 fats, the latter of which are easily oxidized and are inflammatory. Goodchoices include: bison, venison, boar, elk, pork, lamb, beef, prosciutto diParma, serrano ham, and jamón Iberico. Now let’s be clear here: pasturedchickens and grass-fed meats are more expensive, often by a lot, compared to themeat farther down the meat counter that may be labeled as “natural” or even“organic.” Rather than shrugging your shoulders and saying “I’ve got to feed myfamily somehow” while grabbing that cheaper package, I urge you take advantageof the more expensive package as a way to use meat as a side or an accent toyour meal rather than putting it at the center of your dinner.Another thing to consider is that you probably need a lot less animal protein(or any protein for that matter) than you think. We are overproteinized! Yes,it’s true that protein is a critically important macronutrient your body needsto build cells and to maintain muscle mass. The amino acids in proteins areliterally the building blocks of cells and tissues in the human body—we’re madeof protein. But in recent years health “experts” and diet gurus alike haveoveremphasized the importance of protein, and as a result, a lot of people areeating too much of it. Trendy diets like Paleo, Whole30, Keto, Carnivore, andlow-carb encourage people to overindulge in protein.Here’s something that is important to understand: the body doesn’t wastecalories. Any excess protein you eat is immediately converted to sugar, in aprocess called gluconeogenesis. In most cases, this sugar is then stored as fat.Glucose, as you’ll recall from our earlier discussion, also raises blood sugarand insulin levels and lays the foundation for chronic diseases, including type2 diabetes (which is now at epidemic levels among young people). And addinginsult to injury, the amino acids in animal protein appear to be growth agentsfor cancer and accelerated aging. Beef, pork, and lamb contain sugar moleculescalled Neu5Gc, which are associated with increased risk of cancer and heartdisease. Given these risks, I recommend limiting animal protein intake to nomore than four ounces a day.Though plants contain less protein by weight than animal meat, if you’re eatinga plant-rich diet, your protein grams will add up pretty fast. An artichoke hasabout 4 grams of protein, a baked sweet potato, about 2. And so on. Really, ifyou’re eating plenty of plants, you are getting enough protein—so, stopworrying. Keep in mind that some of the largest, most muscle-bound animals onearth eat mostly plants!Finally, please do not buy into the hype that growing children need significantamounts of animal protein and dairy for proper growth. I assure you, having seenkids all over the world, they grow just fine, and have less incidence of obesityand type 2 diabetes, without prodigious amounts of meats and dairy in theirdiets.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Calculating Your Protein NeedsSo, how much protein should you eat—and do you need more or less than yourspouse? What about your kids? How can you make sure everyone in your family isgetting enough of those vital building blocks of human life—without overdoingit?Most protein recommendations are based not on your weight but on your lean bodymass, which is difficult to measure. Dr. Valter Longo at the Longevity Institutein Southern California has devised a simpler calculation that I prefer. He and Iagree that the average person needs 0.37 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.38 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_38] To determine how much protein isideal for you, divide your body weight in pounds by 2.2 to get your weight inkilograms. Then multiply that number by 0.37 and you’ve got the target numberfor your daily protein intake.For kids who are still growing and/or are athletes, you can use the sameequation but multiply the final number by 2. So for example, if your 9-yearoldsoccer star weighs 50 pounds, you would divide by 2.2 to get her weight inkilograms—about 23 kg—and then multiply by .34 to get about 8 grams of protein,and then double it to 16 for her daily intake.If you’re not sure what 16 grams of protein looks like on your plate, inpractical matters, it translates to about 2.5 eggs, or a small serving of fish,or a half-cup of tempeh. With animal protein specifically, keep the “one anddone” phrase in your head—you don’t need to have it at every meal. Try to limitanimal protein to a small portion once a day, or spread it out through the day:an egg in the morning, a bit of goat cheese on your salad during lunch, a fewshrimp with your dinner. It’s easier than you might think for every member ofyour family to get the protein they need!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------image [../images/page46.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Animal Proteins: What Do All These Labels Mean?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHEN THE LABEL SAYS . . . IT MEANS . . . ORGANIC When it comes to meat, poultry,and eggs, the organic designation means the animals were not fed growth hormonesor antibiotics; they were fed organic feed (without GMOs, chemical pesticides,or fertilizers used to grow the grains and soy used in feed); and they wereoffered the potential for outdoor access (but for only 5 minutes every 24hours). “Organic” is the only label that requires government inspection andverification. It’s a good label to look for when buying meat, but the very bestlabel is “pastured,” “grass-fed and finished,” or “100% grass-fed.” If youobserve chickens in their natural habitat, you’ll quickly realize that grainsand soy are not part of their normal diet, and that cows, whose stomachs aredesigned to digest grasses, prefer grass to anything else. All of this meansthat even an “organic” diet is nutritionally lacking and often unnatural foranimals. ALL VEGETARIAN-FED Found mostly on poultry products, this label meansthe chickens weren’t fed animal byproducts, which likely means that they weregiven feed that contains grains, pseudo-grains, and/or soy, most of which areloaded with GMOs and lectins. Chickens, which will eat just about anything yougive them, naturally prefer insects, so a vegetarian diet isn’t actually allthat healthy for them! FREE RANGE This designation, as codified in a 2007federal law, means that animals are given access to the outside for at leastfive minutes a day (yes, you’re allowed to scratch your head while ponderingthis, and yes, five minutes a day is wholly inadequate). “Free-range chickens”typically still live in an overcrowded barn that has some sort of opening—nomatter how small—to the outside, although this “outside” can be a small, muddy,fenced-in or netted-in yard, and the barn may be so crowded that most chickensnever make it out. CAGE FREE While this term may inspire you to envision abucolic landscape—chickens freely roaming in a grass field—“cage-free” justmeans that the chickens aren’t confined to cages. They are still likely to beconfined to an overcrowded warehouse with no guarantee of ever stepping footoutside. PASTURE -RAISED “Pasture-raised” hens must be limited to 1,000 birdsfor every 2.5 acres. That’s 108 sq. ft. per bird—approximately 106 sq. ft. moreper bird than required for the “free range” designation. Field rotation ismandatory, meaning the hens have to get continual access to grassy fields, notthe same area that has already been picked over day and after day by the flock.Also, the hens must be kept outdoors throughout the year—with safe, accessiblehousing should the hens need to protect themselves from predators, or shelterthemselves from extreme weather. When it comes to chicken, pasture-raised reallyis the highest standard possible. OMEGA-3 You’ll see this term on some eggcartons—it means that the eggs were laid by hens who consume a diet enhancedwith flaxseed and/or algae. The polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid from the flaxand/or algae gets transferred to the yolk when they are digested. In a recentstudy, omega-3 eggs had approximately 5 times as much omega-3 fatty acid asconventional eggs.40 Although these chickens likely aren’t allowed to forage fortheir natural diet of grasses, insects, and whatever else they can peck atwandering pastures, omega-3 eggs are often your best alternative if you aren’table to find eggs from pasture-raised chickens, plus they are usually far moreaffordable than pastured eggs. HORMONE-FREE This term, which you’ll see on eggcartons as well as labels of poultry and meat, means the animals weren’tadministered any hormones. However, it doesn’t mean they weren’t fed lectin-richor GMO grains, animal by-products, or given antibiotics. ANTIBIOTIC-FREE Similarto the “hormone-free” designation, this term means only that the animals weren’tgiven antibiotic injections or had antibiotics added to their feed. It doesn’tmean they were fed a natural diet or that they weren’t given hormones. GRASS-FEDGenerally used in relation to beef and other animals raised for meat, thisdesignation means the animals were given access to grass at some point in theirlives and not that they were exclusively grass-fed. Animals raised for meat areoften given hay and access to grass for a little while, then fattened up forslaughter on a diet of grains, antibiotics, and growth hormones. That’s why youwant to look for meat that either says “grass-fed and grass-finished” or “100%grass-fed.”IN-SEASON FRUITEveryone loves fruit, especially kids, and in moderation, it can be a healthytreat and a good source of fiber, vitamins, and polyphenols. But I encourage youto think of fruit more like “candy” than “health food”, so please eat itsparingly. And, more important, I encourage you to eat fruit only when in season(remember, naturally ripened fruit contains fewer lectins, whereas out of seasonfruit, which is picked when underripe, contains more lectins). Our ancestors atefruit only during the summer months, and the extra calories and sugar allowedthem to fatten up for the winter, when food was scarce. Now that fruit isavailable year-round, we indulge in it 356 days a year, and, unfortunately,signal our bodies to store calories and thus retain fat, all year round.Moreover, fruit today is actually bred for sugar content and size. Blueberriesare now the size of grapes, oranges are the size of cantaloupes, and so on.But, before we get too upset about missing our favorite fruit, the good news isthere are some fruits you can enjoy year-round—as long as you eat them beforethey ripen and are still green(these are the exceptions to the “eat only whenripe” rule!). These fruits include green bananas, plantains, mangoes, andpapayas. When these fruits are unripe, they don’t contain a great deal of sugar,and our gut buddies feast on their prebiotic fibers. Another way to get thenutritional benefits of fruit without the sugar? Get out your juicer and juiceyour fruit. Now, throw out the juice and eat the pulp or add it to salads orstir it into baked goods. Or throw it in your blender with some coconut yogurt,a handful of greens, and some almond butter for a gut-friendly smoothie! Here’sa time-saving strategy I like to use: Juice your fruit, strain it, and spoon thepulp into silicone ice cube trays and freeze. Pop out the cubes and store infreezer-safe bags. Then, when you are ready, add a few cubes to your smoothie,or even better, stir into coconut yogurt and you will have a healthy fruit “icecream” in minutes!CERTAIN TYPES OF DAIRYAs we will discuss in detail in in Chapter 4 [9780062911841_Chapter4.xhtml],most of the dairy products available in the U.S. and Canada use milk from breedsof cows that produce a lectin-like protein known as casein A1, which isconverted in your body to the protein beta-casomorphin (BCM). This protein alsoattaches to the pancreas’s insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, whichprompts an immune attack on the pancreas. In addition, most dairy cows are fed adiet of lectin-rich grains and are regularly given antibiotics to treat mastitisinfections induced by near-constant milking by heavy machinery. Of course, thoselectins and drugs end up in the milk products you consume.But milk from the cow breeds Guernsey, Swiss Brown, and Belgian Blue do notcontain this protein, but rather the protein casein A-2. This type of milk—soldunder the label A2 Milk—is becoming increasingly available in stores. Inaddition to A2 milk, you can safely consume the milk of goats, sheep, and waterbuffalo. Keep in mind that all milk is an indulgence, as it still contains a lotof sugar. Likewise, you can enjoy, in moderation, cheeses made from goat, sheep,and buffalo, as well as most Italian, French, and Swiss cows.CHOCOLATESometimes, we all get a craving for something sweet, so thank goodness chocolateoccupies a space on the “Yes, Please” list!. I think it’s important to teachyour kids about the true meaning of a “treat,” and allowing them to have a smallpiece of chocolate is a good way to help them understand the ideas of moderationand balance. So long as it’s consumed in limited quantities, extra-darkchocolate is a healthy choice. Thanks to cacao—the primary ingredient inchocolate and cocoa—these foods are rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and fiber,all of which have anti-inflammatory properties Additionally, chocolate is aheart healthy food: as published in the British Medical Journal, eatingchocolate may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by up to one third!39[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_39] When purchasing chocolate, be on thelookout for how much sugar and dairy have been added. Most commercial chocolatesare made with tons of added ingredients and do not in any way qualify as“healthy.” To get the benefits of chocolate minus the downsides, eat darkchocolate—72 percent cocoa or higher—and limit yourself to one ounce a day orless for you and your kids. That’s about one small square (or one of thedelicious chocolate chip cookies on page 00!). You can even find chocolate barssweetened with Stevia and/or monk fruit, sometimes marketed as keto bars, atspecialty stores. Be mindful though, when feeding chocolate to children, that itdoes contains a small amount of caffeine, so, really, all they need is a tinybit!image [../images/page50.jpg]No, Thank You: Foods High in LectinsThe Plant Paradox program is based on this one essential axiom: The foods youdon’t eat are far more important to your health than the foods you do eat. Onceyou remove the inflammatory agents from your diet, your body is able to stopthrowing all its resources and energy into dealing with continual damage andinstead transition into restoration mode, where excess weight can be shed anddiseases can be healed and even prevented.To that end, what follows is a list of the basic categories of foods excludedfrom the Plant Paradox protocol. These are foods that no human ate until about10,000 years ago—and there is no good reason to continue eating them today.Again, you may fast forward to the list here[9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_59] if you wish, but I think it’s helpful tounderstand why these foods are excluded from the plan. Once you have a sense ofthe damage these foods can cause, you will be even more motivated to avoid them!PEANUTS AND CASHEWSRemember, peanuts and cashews are not nuts: they are legumes loaded withlectins. In fact, the shell that sheaths a cashew is so caustic that workersmust wear protective gloves to shell them! In my medical practice, I havewitnessed firsthand that eating cashews dramatically increases inflammation,especially in patients with arthritis. Did you know the cashew is part of thesame family as poison ivy? I doubt you’d consider munching on that. Since thereare plenty of tasty nuts on the “Yes, Please” list, stick to those and your bodywill thank you. And if you and your kids are die-hard peanut butter fans, Ipromise you that its tastier cousin, almond butter, is part of the Plant Paradoxprogram.CORNLike nearly all other grains, corn (which is not a vegetable, but a grain) has ahigh lectin content. Corn is one of our country’s biggest crops, and it iscommonly used as an ingredient in processed foods—think corn syrup, corn starch,corn flakes, corn chips. The average American eats some form of corn multipletimes a day.QUINOAThis New World pseudo-grain is hailed as a healthy gluten-free substitute towheat, but it is so loaded with lectins that it is no friend to your gutbuddies, immune system, or waistline. As for claims that quinoa is good for youbecause it’s an “ancient grain”—yes, it’s true that ancient Incas made quinoa acentral part of their diet. But what is often missing from this discussion isthe fact that the Incas first soaked and then fermented quinoa before cookingit—two instructions you’ll rarely ever see on the side of a box of quinoa.CONVENTIONALLY RAISED MEATTo understand why corn is among the worst lectin-filled grains, just look at theAmerican farm industry. Farmers use corn for the sole purpose of fattening upcattle. And, guess what? Corn has the same effect on us. Not only that, itcauses fatty deposits in muscles. Want well marbled meats? Feed the animalscorn. Want your and your kid’s muscles well marbled? Cook dinner withconventionally-raised chicken or beef.Remember, as the chart [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_47] explains indetail, “free-range” meats and chicken won’t cut it either. “Free-range” meansthe cattle and chicken were fed corn, most likely without access to pastures.And therefore, since the protein on your plate ate corn, you are, in essence,eating that corn too. Instead opt for only pasture-raised meats and chicken.VEGETABLE OILSYou may have heard that vegetable oils are healthier for you than other types ofoils, but because most of them are made from high-lectin beans or seeds—such ascorn, soybeans, cottonseed, canola seeds, and sunflower seeds—they are allpotent sources of lectins. Worse, many of the corn, canola, and soybeans used tomake this oil are GMO crops, meaning many of them have been bred to produceextra-strength lectins that help make them more resistant to insects.Additionally, these vegetable oils contain primarily omega-6 fats, so theydeliver a double-dose of inflammation when you consume them. I might sound likea broken record, but I’ll say it again: all these oils come from grains or seedssprayed with Roundup, so it too ends up in you!LEGUMES AND BEANSBeans, peas, soybeans, lentils and other legumes (also known as pulses) have thehighest lectin content of any food group. Is it any wonder that they are alsorenowned for their tendency to cause gas, bloating, and indigestion?! I know, Iknow—beans have been hailed as a mainstay of a healthy diet for decades now,particularly if you eat a vegan or vegetarian diet. Don’t get me wrong, I am notagainst legumes and beans! I’m just against eating them without first tamingtheir inflammatory effects. You can dramatically reduce the lectin content ofbeans and legumes by pressure-cooking them, something we’ll cover more in detailsoon.CONVENTIONAL DAIRYDairy products made from the milk of most North American cows—even those thatare grass-fed and organically raised—contain the lectin-like protein casein A1.The only approved dairy products on this plan are those outlined here[9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_61], which include A2 milk; dairy productsmade from goat, sheep, and water buffalo milk; and cheeses from these sources orSouthern European cows. The good news here is that coconut milk—the kind thatcomes in a can as well as the kind that comes in a carton as a milkalternative—makes a great substitute for that creamy dairy taste in soups, icecreams, and other foods.NIGHTSHADESThis popular family of plants includes potatoes, peppers (bell as well as hotpeppers like jalapeño and habañero), eggplant, goji berries, and tomatoes—all ofwhich contain a heaping helping of lectins, in addition to the glycoalkaloidpoison, solanine, a known neurotoxin. They are all high in lectins, particularlyin their seeds and peels, and therefore unfriendly to your health. Some of myrecipes in this book feature tomato sauce; the cooking of tomatoes, and removingtheir skins and seeds greatly reduces their lectin content.SQUASHWith the exception of cucumbers, which first originated in Asia and then madetheir way to Africa and Europe via trade routes, the squash family—fruits withpeels and seeds that grow on vines, including pumpkin, acorn squash, zucchini,and butternut squash—are native to the Americas. Meaning, squash contain lectinsthat humans have only been exposed to in the last five hundred years or so. Inaddition to containing lectins, squash contain sugars that cue your body tostore weight in preparation for winter. All the more reason to not to eat them,or their seeds!Maybe Foods: Foods with Lectin Count That Can be Reduced with PreparationSome foods on the “no” list can be made relatively okay in terms of lectins—ifyou prepare them properly. While I don’t advocate eating any of these foodsregularly, you can include them in your family’s meals occasionally as long asthey don’t seem to cause you or your children problems (digestive upset,achiness, brain fog, rashes, etc).BEANS AND LENTILSFor my vegan and vegetarian readers, especially, I know how important beans canbe in terms of an affordable fiber-packed, protein-rich food. However, they areloaded with lectins. The good news is that cooking them in a pressure cookerlike the Instant Pot all but eradicates their lectin load. Once those peskylectins are out of the way, beans become the “healthy” food they’re often billedas, because your gut buddies love to feast on their soluble fiber.So if you want to eat beans regularly, I recommend investing in an Instant Potor other pressure cooker. Yet another bonus of pressure-cooking is that itproduces perfectly cooked beans in a fraction of the time it takes to cook themon the stove.Fermentation is another preparation method that dramatically reduces lectincount. If you want to experiment with this age-old technique, fermenting lentilshas been shown to reduce their lectin content by 98 percent.40[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_40] But, word to the wise, this is a techniquethat takes a good amount of time—and you’re probably short on that already,aren’t you?WHEAT AND RICEThe lectin known as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is found in wheat bran, whichmeans that whole wheat bread contains WGA, but white bread doesn’t. As you mayrecall, WGA is a nasty lectin—a much smaller protein than other lectins, whichmeans it can sneak through the gut wall even if your gut barrier is fairlyhealthy. Once freed from your digestive tract and in your bloodstream, WGAwreaks all kinds of havoc—including triggering fat storage, causing neurologicalproblems, and contributing to atherosclerosis.The positive spin on WGA is that it means delicious, fluffy white bread,naturally raised with yeast or sourdough starters, is better for you than thewhole wheat/whole grain stuff marketed as “healthy!” By the same token, brownrice is a whole grain, meaning that white rice (the best choice is basmati ricefrom India) is actually better for you than brown rice. Let’s be clear: while Idon’t recommend eating wheat or rice, per se, if you’re going to eat it, eatingthe de-hulled versions will reduce your lectin exposure. If you’re going to eatwhite bread, make it even friendlier to your gut by opting for real sourdough,as fermentation also helps reduce the lectin load. And toast it before eating toincrease its resistant starch content!All of that said, if you’ve been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease or have afamily history of them, I recommend avoiding bread in all forms. And please,pressure-cook your white rice! There’s no point in trying to pressure-cook wheatin an effort to make it more digestible, as gluten is not destroyed bypressure-cooking. For that reason, there’s also no health benefit topressure-cooking rye, barley, or oats (the other gluten-containing whole grains;even gluten-free oats contain a gluten look-a-like lectin).TOMATOES, PEPPERS, EGGPLANTS, CUCUMBERS, ZUCCHINIThe first three of these foods are nightshades, which fall under “No, Thank You”on my list. BUT. I know how much people love these foods. Fresh tomatoes arescrumptious and I realize that folks who live in colder climates look forward totomato season all year long. To make them more digestible, try to stick toheirloom varieties (which have been around longer than most standard varietiesand thus, our gut buddies have had at least a smidge more time to acclimate tothem) and peel and de-seed them before you eat them. The best way to peeltomatoes is to cut a shallow X on the bottom of them, then drop them in boilingwater for a few seconds to loosen the skin. Remove from the water, let themcool, and then the skin will come right off. Then quarter the tomato and scoopthe seeds right out. The blanching doesn’t affect the taste.The same goes for peppers of all kinds—peeling and seeding makes them infinitelymore digestible. It’s easy enough to seed them; to peel them, I like to brieflyroast them either on the grill or directly on the burner of my stove until theskin blisters, making it easy to peel off after putting them in a paper bag fora few minutes to steam.When it comes to cucumbers, zucchini, and eggplant—if you choose to eat thesefoods, peel them and seed them if possible. “Baby” versions are often easier towork with because they contain fewer seeds. When shopping for eggplant, look forthose that have a round bottom as opposed to an oval bottom—they are thought tocontain fewer seeds.41 [9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch3fn_41]THE PLANT PARADOX FOOD LISTSAnd now, my friends, I am excited to present to you the part of the book you’vebeen waiting for: The “Yes, Please” and “No, Thank You” lists!

He’d suffered from multiple ear and throat infectionsthroughout his life (starting as a baby) and had been given many courses ofantibiotics to treat them. His hands and feet were covered with red scalypatches that bled when touched. He developed wheezing and was started on asthmainhalers. He complained of “tummy aches” when he ate, and even though he seemedto eat a lot, he was chronically thin. For the last year, his mother had toliterally carry him around the house because of his painful, bleeding feet.Multiple specialists suggested his skin condition may be psoriasis andrecommended Brian take immunosupressive drugs. His mother sent me some pictures,pleading for help. And help we did!Blood tests revealed that Brian carried one of the two genes associated withgluten intolerance and had multiple markers for leaky gut and lectinintolerance; his vitamin D level was also horribly low. His parents institutedthe Plant Paradox eating program and started Brian on a supplement regimen ofpre- and probiotics, vitamin D3, and Omega 3s. Slowly, Brian’s weeping, bloodyhands and feet began to heal, as I happily discovered through the new picturesarriving in my office every few weeks. Six months later his gut had vastlyimproved and his bloodwork showed very little evidence of gluten and otherlectins in the diet. He could now walk without pain and hold a pen comfotably,and he returned to school. We scheduled his next round of blood tests for 6months later.When the time came for me to phone Brian’s mother with the results, I wasdisappointed. Markers of gluten and some leaky gut had returned. Not terrible,but it was there. Expecting the worst, I made the call. To my relief, Brian’smom explained that few days before his blood was drawn, there was a party atschool and he was convinced by friends to have a cupcake. Just one. He feltlousy after eating it and didn’t want any more. And he hadn’t strayed from hisdiet since! Today Brian is walking on his own two feet again, and breathingeasy—his asthma is gone!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Four [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch4]The Plant Paradox Kitchen [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch4]You know that lectins can harm your health, and the health of your family. Youknow that you’ve been given incorrect information about your nutritional needsand the nutritional needs of your kids. And you know which foods to eat andwhich foods to avoid. Now hopefully, you’re ready to make some changes.But where do you start?Well, everything starts in the kitchen, so before we get to the recipes, let’slook go over some quick pantry and kitchen tips to help you get organized.Remember, one of the best strategies for success on the Plant Paradox program isto prepare and plan in advance as much as possible. With that in mind, let’slook at how to first purge your pantry of the foods you will no longer beeating, and then how to restock it with high-quality foods and set up yourkitchen to make cooking as quick, easy, and pleasurable as possible.The Pantry PurgeBefore you stock your kitchen with delicious, healthy foods, first you have tomake space for them by clearing out the junk that’s in the way. You probablyhave a pretty good idea of which foods need to go—bye bye peanut butter; see yasugary snacks; ciao cereal. While the “No, Thank You” chart[9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_59a] should be used as a comprehensiveguideline, I find it helpful to have a checklist handy as you’re sorting throughyour inventory of food at home. Use it as a reference to help you weed out themain offenders and organize your space, physically as well as mentally. When indoubt, always check labels and look at the ingredients list. Chances are if thelist is long, the food is out. If it contains hard-to-pronounce ingredients,it’s out. If it contains added sugars, wheat, soy or soybean oil, canola oil,peanuts or peanut oil—it’s out.Items to TossDRY GOODSAmaranthArtificial sweetenersBarleyBreadBuckwheatBulgurCanola OilCashewsChia SeedsCornstarchFarroFlour (all varieties except those listed here[9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_57])Fruit, cannedKashaOats/oatmealPastaPeanut butterProtein Powder (except those listed here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_57])Pumpkin seedsQuinoaRed pepper flakesRice (all except Indian Basmati)Sunflower seedsSugar (all)Soup, instant or cannedTomato sauce (jarred)Vegetable oilSNACKSCandy (all!)CashewsCrackers (except those listed here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_57])CerealCookiesDried fruit (except figs and dates)Energy bars (except those listed here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_57])Fruit SnacksGranola/granola barsPeanutsPopcornPotato Chips (and all other chips)PretzelsTortilla chips (except those listed here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_58])Trail MixFRIDGEBeerCoffee creamerDairy products (conventional): milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, cottage cheeseHummusJelly and jamsJuiceKetchupLunch meatsMayonnaise (unless avocado-based)Salad Dressing (bottled)SodaSoy sauceSports/Energy drinksString cheeseTofuTortillas (except those listed here [9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_58])FREEZERConventional meat/meat products: chicken, beef, pork, bacon, sausageIce cream (unless coconut milkbased with few added sugars)Microwavable mealsPopsicles and other frozen treatsI know this is a lot to take in. Remember—you don’t have to do it all at once.You can edit your pantry and fridge in waves if that’s what’s most sustainablefor your family—just be sure to commit to each wave. Pick a date in advance totackle a specific area—no backing out! That said, I know that it is not onlyhard to part with foods you love and rely on—it is also hard part with foods youspent your hard-earned dollars on. I suggest donating unopened items to a localpantry or food bank, so at least you know the food isn’t going to waste. Foreverything else—just do the best you can, as your budget allows. As you removeadditional foods over time, you’ll make more and more room to add some excitingnew ones.Plant Paradox Pantry StaplesAs you make space in your pantry and fridge, the fun part begins: filling itwith new foods! Before you get started on your grocery list, I suggest you takea few minutes to read through the summary below of Plant Paradox pantry staples,and then flip through the recipes in Part 2 [9780062911841_Part2.xhtml#page_86]to see which ingredients you might want to stock first. Maybe you can share thebook with your kids and let them pick out a recipe or an ingredient they’recurious about too. The more they see this lifestyle change as an excitingadventure, the better they will adapt! Here are some of the essential itemsyou’ll be using over the next few weeks:Almond butter: Ideally, you’d purchase organic almond butter made from raw nuts,but if it’s too expensive or difficult to find, look for almond butter madewithout partially hydrogenated oils (aka trans fats) or sweeteners of any kind.You’re looking for a maximum of two ingredients: almonds and salt. For those ofyou with autoimmune disease: look for almond butter made from peeled almonds,like Almondie™.Almond flour: This flour alternative is made up of only finely ground almonds,which are “blanched,” or skinless. It’s not the same as almond meal, whichusually contains the peels as well. Try to find non-GMO, organic almond flourand store it in the freezer to keep it from going rancid. (Nut flours and nuts,because of their fat content, go rancid at room temperature, so it’s best tostore them in the freezer or refrigerator.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plant Paradox on a BudgetThe pantry purge can bring up a lot of mixed feelings, and one very commonreaction is some unease about the investment required to shift toward ahealthier lifestyle. It is true that some of the foods on the Plant Paradoxprogram are considered specialty items, and organic produce and pastured meatsand dairy products are not inexpensive. Over the long haul, you will save moneyon this plan (on both food and healthcare costs), but in the meantime, as youease into this lifestyle, here are a few strategies for making your moneystretch as far as possible: * MAKE A LIST: And check it twice! Plan your shopping list for each week carefully and stick to it. Scope out sales and deals at grocery stores that stock the foods you need. Recently a number of supermarkets have made a commitment to carry food products and ingredients without artificial colors or flavors, such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. Your local stores may have their own organic and in-season sections, but those two are most reliable for me. * MEAT ON THE SIDE: A general rule of thumb in helping to make your dollar go further is to reduce the number of animal products you consume, which is one reason why most of the recipes in this book are or can be adapted to be vegetarian or vegan. If you don’t want to completely abstain from meat, I recommend treating it more as a side dish or flavoring rather than the main attraction of your meal. Eating meat in limited quantities will make grocery shopping more affordable. * GO WHOLE HOG: If you do eat meat, one way to get the best quality possible for the lowest price is to purchase a meat share of a pastured animal. Check out your local CSA or farmer’s market for information. Typically the smallest purchase is a half or a quarter of an animal, but you can always go in with a few neighbors if you want a smaller amount. To find a local farm that grass feeds and pasture-raises, try a quick internet search, or go to eatwild.com. * JOIN THE CLUB: Join a wholesale club, such as Costco, which is my favorite of the bunch. Aside from my beloved Kirkland Pesto, Costco sells a variety of great items in bulk, including: olive oils, nuts, vinegars, olives, seasonings, dried herbs, spices, Italian butter, organic canned vegetables, broth, and organic frozen vegetables, to name a few. An annual membership in one of these clubs is affordable and will pay for itself over time. * SAVE EVERY DROP: What do you do when you just have a few tablespoons left of a homemade sauce, dip, or condiment that required expensive ingredients (not to mention, time and effort) to make? Scoop the remainder into silicone ice cube trays and freeze, then pop the cubes into freezer-safe bags and label. Those little cubes will come in unbelievably handy when you’re preparing meals for younger kids. * SHOP ONLINE: For specialty items that may be harder to find at your local grocery store or wholesale club, sites like Amazon, Thrive Market (which offers qualifying low-income families, veterans, and teachers a free membership), and Vitacost.com are great places to shop. * GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY: Depending on where you live, you can also grow some foods on your own. Herbs are particularly simple to grow and require a minimal investment. Any extra herbs you wind up with at the end of the growing season can be dried and stored. And if you have a little bit more space, consider planting what was once called a “victory garden.” Incredibly, during World War II, 40 percent of all the vegetables consumed in America were grown in home victory gardens. Want victory for you and your family is health? It’s just outside your back (or front) door!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Almond milk: This milk alternative makes a great substitute in recipes wherecow’s milk is called for. Look for unsweetened, unflavored versions, and try tofind organic and non-GMO brands.Arrowroot flour: Often labeled as “arrowroot starch,” this flour is made fromthe arrowroot plant’s root. It acts as a terrific thickener and works well insauces where you’d normally use cornstarch. I like to add it to pancake andwaffle batters as it helps to hold the batter together.Avocados: You can’t really stock up on enough of these! I recommend eating anavocado a day. To ripen them faster, leave them near your green bananas or placethem in a paper bag on your windowsill. If you’re really in a pinch, you can putan avocado in a 350ºF oven for 10 minutes to soften up. While it won’t actuallyripen, the texture will at least be softer. Once ripe, avocadoes can berefrigerated for one or two days, or you can peel and pit them, puree the flesh,and then freeze the puree in ice cube trays. I prefer Hass avocadoes, the oneswith dark green, lizard-like skin.Avocado mayonnaise: Mayonnaise is a beautiful, delicious emulsion, but mostoften store-bought mayonnaise is made with low-quality high-lectin GMO oil, suchas soybean safflower, or canola. Mayonnaise made with avocado oil is much betterfor you. Primal Kitchen makes a great avocado mayo available at Thrive Marketand increasingly in regular stores, and you can even find Chosen Foods AvocadoMayo at Costco.Avocado oil: Boasting a high smoke point and mild flavor, avocado oil isexcellent for frying, roasting, and all-around cooking. Costco, Trader Joe’s,Whole Foods, and most other supermarkets carry it.Baking powder (aluminum free): Look for aluminum-free baking powder as aluminumis a neurotoxin. Reliable brands are Bob’s Red Mill, Rumford, as well as TraderJoe’s and Whole Foods’ 365 brands.Basmati rice: I recommend limiting rice consumption to white basmati ricebecause it has the lowest lectin content and the highest levels of resistantstarch of any rice. Look for basmati rice from India (not Texas, otherwise knownas Texmati).Cassava flour: A popular flour in South American cooking, cassava flour comesfrom a root known as yucca (or yuca) or manioc, and is full of resistant starch.It is a key ingredient to getting fluffy gluten-free baked goods. If you can’tfind it in a store near you, look for it on Amazon or Thrive Market (good brandsare Moon Rabbit and Otto’s Naturals).Cauliflower “rice:” Riced cauliflower, or cauliflower rice, is just cauliflowerchopped up so finely that individual pieces resemble rice granules. You can makeit yourself by pulsing the florets in your food processor, or you can purchaseit from Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, or Costco. Find it in the freezer section orfresh; it’s convenient and cost-effective.Cayenne pepper: If you love some heat in your food, skip the red chile flakes,which contain skin and seeds of the red pepper (both rich in lectins), and gofor cayenne pepper, which is made of ground pepper after it has been peeled,seeded, and dried.Chocolate: Look for at least 72% cacao when purchasing chocolate; most grocerystores carry some good options, but Costco, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe’s arereliable bets. Seek out organic and fair-trade chocolate bars whenever you can,and limit your intake to one ounce (or less) per day; it’s a treat, not anecessity. If you’re baking, look for an unsweetened, high-cacao contentchocolate, with at least 72% cacao. Some products go as high as 99% cacao.Dagoba and Lily’s brand also make excellent chocolate chips.Cocoa powder: This powder is not the same as hot chocolate (“cocoa”), which is apre-sweetened mix with some cocoa powder and a lot of sugar. Cocoa powder isnothing more than finely ground cacao beans. Because on its own cocoa powder canbe fairly bitter (which is actually a good sign, as the flavor is a directresult of all the polyphenols cacao contains), many cocoa powders are “Dutched”and are alkalized with potassium bromate or potassium carbonate to neutralizethe taste of the polyphenols. So, if your cocoa powder says “Dutched,” skip it,and look for the word “non-alkalized.” My favorite cocoa powders are made byDagoba or Scharffenberger; Trader Joe’s also has a non-Dutched variety.Coconut aminos: Remember how I told you to throw out your soy sauce? Well, thisis what you’re going to replace it with. Coconut aminos have a similar taste andcan be used as a soy sauce substitute in cooking (and for dipping sushi). Thisproduct contains only two ingredients: organic coconut tree sap and organic seasalt. You can find it at Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, or online.Coconut cream: The rich, creamy part of coconut milk, coconut cream lends richflavor to many dishes. There are two ways to buy it: you can look for cans ofcoconut cream (I prefer the Trader Joe’s brand, but any brand with BPA-freelining will do), or buy coconut milk and refrigerate it overnight. The creamwill rise to the top and harden—scoop it out gently the next day, and voila,coconut cream!Coconut flour: Another great flour alternative, coconut flour helps you make awide variety of baked goods. Denser than other flours, it absorbs more liquidthan you might expect, so make sure you follow recipes to the letter until youget a really clear sense of how this flour works with other ingredients beforeyou do any experimenting on your own. Some of my favorite brands are Bob’s RedMill, Nutiva, and Let’s Do.Coconut milk: Sold either in the refrigerated dairy case in a cardboard cartonor the beverage aisle in a Tetra Pak so that it can be stored at roomtemperature until you’re ready to use it, coconut milk is richer than other milkalternatives and works well as a creamy replacement for cow’s milk. As you mightsuspect, I recommend seeking out the unsweetened and unflavored versions.Coconut oil: Another cooking oil with a high smoke point, coconut oil also makesa great addition to baked goods in place of canola oil or vegetable oil. Lookfor extra-virgin coconut oil from brands such as Kirkland Viva Labs, CarringtonFarms, and Nature’s Way.Eggs: You could say I’m egg-static (sorry, couldn’t resist!) about eggs. Iadvocate the yolks more strongly than the whites, because they are a good sourceof healthy fats and nutrients. My favorite omelet is made from four yolks andone egg white (you can scramble the excess egg whites and feed them to yourpet). Just make sure you buy eggs that are either pastured or omega-3 enriched,and if buying pastured, look for the soy-free variety.Erythritol: Your body processes this natural sweetener, a sugar alcohol,differently than traditional sugars, so it doesn’t cause a spike in your bloodsugar. It’s also less likely to cause stomach upset than other sugaralternatives. But the best part: Erythritol acts just like sugar when you bakewith it, easily dissolving into batters while retaining great taste. It’s oftensold under the brand name Swerve; Wholesome sells a version of it too.Flaxseed meal: Flaxseeds are a great source of short-chain omega-3s and containno lectins. The only hitch is, they need to be ground in order for your body tobe able to absorb those omega-3s, and once ground, they are very prone tooxidation. So the best way to consume flaxseed is to buy whole flaxseeds andgrind them as needed in a coffee or spice grinder. If you prefer to buy themalready ground, look for a product that was cold-milled, as heat can oxidize thefats, and then store it in the freezer or refrigerator.Ghee: Otherwise known as clarified butter, ghee is butter that has had the milksolids (which consist of protein, including the troublesome casein A1) cookedand filtered out of it, making it not only shelf stable but also easilydigestible. Look for ghee made from the milk of grass-fed cows, which has ahigher concentration of omega-3s than conventionally-raised cows. Pure and PureIndian Foods are two grass-fed brands to look for.Goat’s milk and goat’s milk cheese and yogurt: Goat’s milk doesn’t containcasein A1 and so is a gut-friendly alternative to conventional cow’s milk. Moreimportant, if you are using animal milk to feed your baby or children, goat’smilk is more similar to human milk than cow’s milk. (It’s no wonder goat’s milkhas traditionally been called “mother’s milk”) You can also use goat cheese,sometimes labeled as “chèvre,” and goat’s milk yogurt or kefir (purchaseunsweetened, unflavored varieties) in your cooking. Thankfully we are now alsoseeing goat’s milk used as a base for cheeses like cheddar and mozzarella,making it easier to cook your and your kids’ favorite foods.Hemp milk: The same hemp that is kin to marijuana (although eating or drinkingit will not give you a high), hemp milk is yet another alternative to cow’s milkthat’s great in smoothies and other recipes. I know I sound like a brokenrecord, but stick to the unsweetened, unflavored varieties.Hemp protein powder: A great alternative to whey or pea protein powder forvegans or anyone else who wants to reduce their intake of animal protein, hempprotein powder provides all the essential amino acids and plenty of omega-3s.Trader Joe’s reliably carries it in their stores.Hemp tofu: Another way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of hemp is with thismore densely textured alternative to traditional tofu, which is made from soybeans and is high in lectins. You can find the non-GMO brand Living HarvestTempt hemp tofu at Whole Foods.Honey: Although honey is a “natural” sugar, it is still sugar and should beconsumed only in very small amounts—one teaspoon or less a day. Honey containsenzymes that provide health benefit that no other natural sugar can match, butsugar is sugar. If you need a sweetener and for some reason stevia, erythritol(Swerve), or monk fruit just won’t cut it, you can use a little bit of raw localhoney (which contains beneficial organisms) or Manuka honey (which has antiviraland anti-inflammatory benefits). For the record, pasteurized honey isessentially sugar syrup and unless you cannot consume raw honey, you should notpurchase the pasteurized variety.Inulin: Sold under the brand name Just Like Sugar, inulin is made from chicoryroot or agave (the plant used to make tequila) and is useful in baking and inregular cooking as a replacement for sugar. It provides your gut buddies with afructo oligosaccharide you can’t digest, but they love. You can also find it atWhole Foods under the brand name Viv Agave Organic Blue Agave Inulin, or online.Millet: You’re probably familiar with millet as it is a popular component ofbirdseed. But it’s not just for the birds! This hull-less (and thus,lectin-free) grain is a tasty addition to your diet and can be used as astand-in for rice or quinoa in grain bowls.Miracle Rice: If you’re really missing your rice and eating a small amount ofwhite Basmati rice just isn’t going to cut it (and you don’t want to burn out oncauliflower rice), try this “rice” made from the lectin-free konjac root. Youcan find Miracle Rice in the refrigerated section of most grocery stores, nearthe tofu.Mozzarella: True buffalo mozzarella—the kind that comes in ball-shapes ofdifferent sizes—is made from the milk of water buffalo, meaning it doesn’tcontain casein A1. Read labels carefully; “buffalo milk” should be the mainingredient. Most shredded mozzarella that comes in re-sealable bags is made withcow’s milk. (You can also find goat’s milk mozzarella at Whole Foods or onAmazon.)Nori: If you’re missing the convenience of tortillas, try this seaweed productthat is often used in sushi rolls and is about the thickness of a sheet ofpaper. It makes a great wrap for scrambled eggs, tuna or salmon salad, or othersandwich fixings. Look for organic nori.Nutritional yeast: This is not the kind of yeast that causes bread to rise; it’sa B-vitamin-rich powder that lends a savory, cheesy taste to anything yousprinkle it on. I use it on my Cheesy Almond Crackers[9780062911841_Chapter9_5.xhtml#page_172]. Nutritional yeast is available innatural food stores, grocery stores like Whole Foods, or online.Olive oil: I prefer Mediterranean olive oils, especially Moroccan, Italian,Greek, and Spanish olive oils, but there are also some great American olive oilslike “O,” Bariani, and California Olive Ranch. Make sure to buy extra-virgin—Iget mine at Costco, the Kirkland label, which comes from Tuscany. If you canfind (and afford) organic, that’s your best choice. Good olive oil should benoticeably green, have a fresh, grassy smell, and come in an opaque glass bottlebecause light causes it to deteriorate. By the way, if the oil makes you coughwhen you first try it, that’s a good thing—it’s a sign that it’s rich inpolyphenols! Always look for a pressing date—the oil goes bad about a year afterthat.Paprika: This is another pepper-derived spice, like cayenne pepper, that doesn’tinclude the skins and seeds and is therefore low-lectin. Smoked paprika inparticular imparts a rich flavor to a variety of dishes and is especiallydelicious in stews and chilis.Parmigiano-Reggiano: The real deal Parmesan cheese, made from the milk ofItalian cows—which doesn’t contain casein A1 is produced only during the springand fall, when grasses are abundant (the cows are grass-fed). It can cost up to$20 per pound, but just a little bit of this strong, salty cheese packs a bigpunch. Hold onto the rinds once the cheese is mostly used and add them to yourbroths, stocks, and soups to add depth of flavor.Pecorino Romano: This Tuscan grating cheese is made from sheep’s milk and hasrich, nutty flavor that pairs well with pasta dishes. Like with Parmesan cheese,just a few pinches adds a lot of flavor to a dish.Perilla oil: This oil, made from the seeds of the perilla plant, is the mostcommon cooking oil used in Asian countries. It is a great source of the omega-3fat alpha linolenic acid—containing more of it than any other oil. It alsocontains rosmarinic acid, which benefits brain health. I didn’t call for perillaoil in the recipes in this book, but it can be used interchangeably with oliveoil or coconut oil. Look for it in Asian markets, natural food stores, and WholeFoods.Quorn products: This is a meat substitute derived from mushrooms, but it doesn’ttaste as “meaty” as mushroom; it’s more similar in taste and texture to chicken.Not all Quorn products are Plant Paradox–friendly—stick to the tenders, cutlets,and ground versions. It’s important to note that these products aren’tvegan—there’s a little egg white protein in them. The products in the vegan linecontain potato and gluten, so they aren’t part of the Plant Paradox program.Stay away from any breaded varieties as well. You can find Quorn products in thevegetarian freezer section of most supermarkets.Sea salt, iodized: Sea salt contains many more trace minerals than traditionaltable salt and is therefore much more healthful. However, be sure to look forversions of sea salt that contain added iodine. Iodine is essential to thyroidfunction, and the most typical way we get it is by eating iodized table salt.Once the foodie craze kicked in and so many people switched from traditionaltable salt to sea salt, doctors like myself started to see iodine deficienciesbecome more common. So give yourself the best of both worlds and buy iodized seasalt. It’s pretty easy to find in most supermarkets, and even Morton’s nowproduces an iodized sea salt.Sorghum: Along with millet, sorghum is one of the few grains without a hull. Itcan be eaten as a breakfast cereal, served as a side dish, or even popped likepopcorn. Bob’s Red Mill carries it, or you can find a popped version of it,called Mini Pops, online.Stevia: This natural sweetener contains no calories and won’t cause a spike inblood sugar. Derived from the stevia plant, you can buy it in powdered form orin liquid drops. Because it is 300 times sweeter than sugar, a little bit goesquite a long way. I prefer the SweetLeaf brand because it doesn’t have fillerssuch as maltodextrin like other brands often do, and the first ingredient isinulin, which your gut buddies love.Tempeh: Tempeh is a form of fermented soy. You can find it at the supermarket inthe refrigerator case by the tofu. Look for organic, non-GMO versions (as mostsoy is GMO) made without grains. Please be careful though, most tempeh sold inthe U.S. is mixed with grains. Like tofu, tempeh doesn’t have a great taste onits own, but picks up the flavors of other ingredients well, and is a goodsource of protein for vegans and vegetarians.Vanilla extract: Be careful to only buy vanilla extract that says “pure” on thelabel—otherwise, what you’re buying likely contains a slew of chemicals thatmimic the taste of vanilla rather than the beans themselves. If you are missingsweetened, flavored yogurts, add a touch of pure vanilla extract and a few dropsof stevia to your goat, sheep, hemp, or coconut yogurt—kids love it too.Walnuts: Walnuts are rich in fiber, protein, and essential fatty acids. In fact,research has shown that consumption of just two ounces of walnuts a day forabout two weeks, significantly affected the growth of tumors in confirmed breastcancers, and thus raised chances of survival.46 Look for organic walnuts, andfor a longer shelf life, keep them refrigerated.Yogurt: Look for yogurt made from goat’s, sheep’s, hemp, or coconut milk. Youcan find a wide variety of these yogurts at Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, andnatural food grocery stores. Just be sure to read labels carefully and be on thelookout for added sugars—choose “plain” options.Plant Paradox Kitchen ToolsIn addition to clearing out and restocking your pantry, I recommend taking alittle time to clean out, organize and, if necessary, supplement your kitchentools. While I usually don’t suggest that any specialized cooking equipment isnecessary to follow the Plant Paradox program, given the focus of this book, Ido recommend you invest in either an Instant Pot or a slow cooker to help makeyour life easier and get dinner on the table faster. Below is a full list of thekitchen equipment that will make food preparation simpler, and your time in thekitchen more enjoyable. As with the pantry overhaul, there’s no need to rush outand buy everything at once—go slowly, and only purchase new items as needed.Keep an eye out for sales and specials around holidays (Black Friday sales aresome of the best for cookware, and in May cookware is often discounted again),and do your research online to find the best prices.Blender: I use my blender nearly every day. High-speed blenders such asBlendtec, Vitamix, or Ninja make quick work of smoothies, can blend and heatsoups (so no need to dirty a pan), and do some of your prep work for you bychopping and combining ingredients. If you don’t have a full-size blender anddon’t want to acquire one, the Magic Bullet or the larger NutriBullet are good,smaller options.Food Processor: A food processor is like having three extra sets of hands. Itchops, mixes, and slices in just a few pulses. And you’ll never again have toscrape down the sides of a blender when making pesto or other sauces!Ice Pop Molds: If you have young kids (and even if you don’t!), healthy ice popsare easy-to-make treats that stay fresh in the fridge for a week or more. Irecommend using silicone molds, which release the pops easily and aredish-washer-safe, but make sure that any molds you use are BPA-free.Instant Pot or other pressure cooker: If you want to enjoy eating beans,lentils, or tomato sauce—as well as cut down on cooking time and cook in largerbatches for a family—a pressure cooker is an essential cooking appliance. I lovethe Instant Pot, which regulates the pressure for you, so you don’t have toworry about a thing. You can also use the Instant Pot as a slow cooker, or as asauté pan (it has a high-heat setting so you can brown meat or onions right init). Just be sure not to overfill any type of pressure cooker, digital or not.That “do not fill above this line” line is not a suggestion, it’s a rule foryour safety.Knives: A good chef’s knife and paring knife makes vegetable prep a breeze. Keepthem well-sharpened as you are more likely to injure yourself with a dull knifethan a sharp one. Good knives are a cook’s best friend.Magic Bullet: This mini appliance is a blender/food processor hybrid. It’s greatfor single-serving foods like smoothies, but if you are cooking for a family,you would probably be better served with a full-size high-speed blender.Microwave: You probably already have one of these, but if you don’t, there’scertainly no need to purchase one. That said, they do come in awfully handy forthawing frozen leftovers and reheating last night’s dinner for lunch the nextday.Mixing Bowls: The right mixing bowls can make a huge difference in your ease andenjoyment of cooking. Look for a set (large, medium, and small) with high sidesso ingredients don’t slosh over the edge and onto your countertop or floor whenyou’re mixing. I recommend using glass bowls, but if buying another type ofbowl, please avoid plastic.Salad Spinner: I know what you might be thinking—not another bulky gadget! Butgreens are central to the Plant Paradox plan, and if they are cleaned and driedproperly they will last longer in the fridge and cut down on prep time whenyou’re cooking. I could not believe the difference this gadget made in my, andmy wife, Penny’s, lives! It makes it so much easier to have organic greens andlettuces at the ready anytime: just chop, throw in the spinner basket, rinse,then spin away the water! No more plastic bags that use questionable chemicalsto keep that pre-chopped lettuce “fresh” for days!Sheet pan: A number of recipes in this book utilize a sheet pan to create easy,“one and done” sheet-pan suppers. You probably already have a few of these—andthey are likely old and covered with years of charred residue. I suggestpurchasing a new rimmed sheet pan with a ceramic coating—you can find themonline for about $20. And for ease of cleanup (and keeping your pan looking likenew), line the pan with parchment paper when cooking any foods that don’t needto be crispy (the parchment will absorb moisture).Skillets: A good-quality pan that evenly distributes heat makes food tastebetter and makes cleanup easier. Please resist the temptation to buy or use askillet with a nonstick coating, as these contain dangerous chemicals that leachinto your food. Instead, look for a skillet with a ceramic coating or made fromhigh-quality stainless steel. And please, throw away that cast iron skilletwithout a ceramic coating. I can’t tell you the number of patients I see who usea cast iron skillet about once a week and have dangerously high iron levels.Slow Cooker: A number of recipes in this book can be prepared using a slowcooker, which is another appliance that minimizes your time in the kitchen. SlowCookers are a worthwhile investment for busy families and working parents withlong hours. Just throw a few ingredients into the slow cooker in the morning,turn it on, and dinner is ready when you get home.Spiralizer: This handy tool makes noodles out of all kinds of vegetables, suchas jicama, sweet potatoes, and daikon radish, so you can enjoy “pasta” minus thelectins. You don’t need a fancy, electronic one. The hand-held version worksjust fine and costs about $15.Vegetable Peelers: Remember, lectins are found in the peels and seeds of plants,so having a peeler helps you lighten your lectin load. I recommend having twokinds: One with straight-edge blades and one with serrated-edge blades. Theserrated edge lets you peel delicate foods, like tomatoes, saving you the stepof blanching them.Meal Planning 101Now that your kitchen is cleaned out and ready to go, it’s time to start on yourgrocery list. But before you can write a list you need to know your game plan—ormeal plan—for the week ahead. If you’re not someone who typically plans out eachmeal of the week, don’t panic: You’re not alone. A lot of busy families areplaying it by ear, cooking meals on the fly, or not planning out more than a dayahead. But not only will planning a week (or more) of meals make it easier tostay on the program, it will also save you time and money.The best way to get going on your meal plans is to flip through the pages in therecipe section of this book and select those that most appeal to you. Thencompare the ingredients lists—are there recipes that utilize the sameingredients, thus minimizing the items on your shopping list? Which ones wouldmake the best leftovers for lunch? (Hint: braised foods like stews and chilisare perfect for packing into a thermos the next day.) Which recipes do you thinkyou might want make a double batch of and freeze for future meals?To get you started, I’ve put together a few sample plans that take thesequestions into consideration. Feel free to mix and match based on your family’sneeds and preferences, or follow the plan as is to get started. I didn’t accountfor snacks and treats here, because I don’t recommend eating in between mealsand indulging in treats on a daily basis. But you can plan for your snacks inthe same way you would meals—hard-boiling half a dozen eggs for on-the-gosnacking, or baking a dozen cookies or making a batch of ice pops for treatsthat will last a week or more.Finally, a note about meal planning for those who are looking to lose weight orsee dramatic results. I do recommend intermittent fasting as part of the PlantParadox program, for adults only, but given the focus of this book, I’ve chosennot to include a fasting protocol here. If you’d like to learn more about thebenefits and practice of intermittent fasting, you can turn to The Plant Paradoxor The Plant Paradox Quick and Easy as a resource. In the meantime, just knowthat prolonging the time your digestive system has to rest between meals offersmany health benefits—so when you’d like to, feel free to skip breakfast and eatan earlier dinner. You can customize your meal plan to suit your and yourfamily’s needs!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sample Meal Plans--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DAY BREAKFAST LUNCH DINNER DAY 1 Breakfast Casserole for a Crowd[9780062911841_Chapter5_3.xhtml#page_92]; save leftovers Lettuce Wrap “Tacos”[9780062911841_Chapter9_9.xhtml#page_178] Sheet Pan Turkey Dinner[9780062911841_Chapter6_8.xhtml#page_118] DAY 2 Green Banana Bread[9780062911841_Chapter5_4.xhtml#page_93]; save leftovers Thanksgiving Sandwich[9780062911841_Chapter9_1.xhtml#page_163] made with leftover turkey Portobello“Pot Roast” [9780062911841_Chapter7_5.xhtml#page_140] with “Baked” SweetPotatoes [9780062911841_Chapter13_5.xhtml#page_237] DAY 3 Breakfast Casserolefor a Crowd [9780062911841_Chapter5_3.xhtml#page_92] (leftovers) Portobello “PotRoast” [9780062911841_Chapter7_5.xhtml#page_140] (leftovers) “Spaghetti” andMeatballs [9780062911841_Chapter7_2.xhtml#page_134]; save extra sauce DAY 4Shakshuka [9780062911841_Chapter5_6.xhtml#page_97] with tomato sauce (leftovers)Vegetable Roll-Ups [9780062911841_Chapter9_4.xhtml#page_168] Green Chili withChicken [9780062911841_Chapter8_4.xhtml#page_153] DAY 5 Green Banana Bread[9780062911841_Chapter5_4.xhtml#page_93] (leftovers) or hardboiled egg withavocado slices Green Chili with Chicken[9780062911841_Chapter8_4.xhtml#page_153] (leftovers) Cauliflower BroccoliNuggets [9780062911841_Chapter6_5.xhtml#page_112] with Five-Minute BrusselsSprouts Salad [9780062911841_Chapter10_2.xhtml#page_183] DAY 6 Sweet Potato EggNests [9780062911841_Chapter5_8.xhtml#page_101] Five-Minute Brussels SproutsSalad [9780062911841_Chapter10_2.xhtml#page_183] (leftovers), Lectin-Free LunchKits [9780062911841_Chapter9_5.xhtml#page_171] Not-Too-Spicy Tikka Masala[9780062911841_Chapter7_1.xhtml#page_132] with Keto Naan Bread[9780062911841_Chapter10_3.xhtml#page_184] DAY 7 Coconut Mochi Pancake[9780062911841_Chapter5_2.xhtml#page_90]; save leftovers Not-Too-Spicy TikkaMasala [9780062911841_Chapter7_1.xhtml#page_132] (leftovers) with cauliflowerrice Clean out the fridge night—everyone picks their favorite leftovers from theweek!

The entire philosophyof this program can be summarized in the following four rules:RULE 1: What you remove from your diet has a far bigger impact on your healththan what you add to it.This isn’t a nutrition plan focused on the latest “miracle” foods. After twentyyears of clinical research with my patients, many with children and teenagerswith severe asthma, eczema, allergies, and autoimmune diseases, I am telling youthat what you remove from your and your kids’ diets will have a far morepositive impact on your and their health than what you add to it. If all you didwas ditch the foods on the “No, Thank You” list[9780062911841_Chapter3.xhtml#page_59], you and your family would noticeimprovements immediately. There’s a reason I list this rule first; and it’sbecause it’s the most important one!RULE 2: Take care of your gut buddies and they’ll take care of you.You’ve likely been waging a full-on battle with the microbes in your gut for along time. Between taking medications like ibuprofen and other non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and antacids, as well as eating a dietthat includes pesticide-treated foods, processed foods, and foods that are highin sugar and saturated fats, your gut buddies have been struggling to hang inthere. But when you stop consuming these substances, the microbes that are sovital to your wellbeing will begin multiplying in droves. Here’s how I like tolook at it: When you start eating the foods that nourish your gut buddies andallow them to proliferate, you become healthier, mentally sharper—like asuperhero version of yourself! As Bette Midler would say, your gut buddiesbecome “the wind beneath [your] wings.”RULE 3: Fruit = Candy.I know this is a tough one, so it bears repeating: please think of fruit as atreat to be enjoyed in moderation, not as a health food to be consumedregularly. Yes, fruit contains nutrients, polyphenols, vitamins, and fiber—butso do vegetables, minus the sugar. The sugar content in fruit is particularlytroublesome. The sugar in fruit is fructose, which is especially appealing tocancer cells—it’s their preferred source of fuel.42[9780062911841_Notes.xhtml#ch4fn_42] All sugar (fruit and non-fruit) causes aspike in blood sugar and insulin, which triggers an inflammatory response fromyour immune system. I liken eating a bowl of fruit for breakfast to eating abowl of Skittles—and would you ever let your kids eat candy for breakfast? Ofcourse not. It also bears repeating that juice—fresh squeezed or otherwise—isjust concentrated sugar water.In addition, much of the fruit we eat is shipped across long distances and thusmust be firm to hold up in transit—so it is harvested before fully ripening.This means that the peels and seeds have a high lectin concentration. So whenyou do eat fruit, it’s important to choose locally grown, in-season fruit tominimize lectin exposure. Also remember that a “fruit” is classified as anyproduce item that contains seeds (the exception to this rule is strawberries,the sole fruit with seeds on the outside).It is true that some nutrients, like polyphenols, are found only in specificfruits (like resveratrol in the skin of red grapes). But green and cruciferousvegetables contain many other important polyphenols and nutrients and are muchmore beneficial for your overall health. Bottom line: When you reduce fruitconsumption, your family’s nutritional needs will be met just fine, as long aseveryone eats their vegetables!RULE 4: You are what the thing you are eating, ate.If you and your family choose to eat animal protein, it’s important to keep inmind that eating any meat other than wild-caught seafood and pasture-raisedchickens, cows, lamb, and pigs (or any other animal you eat) means that you arealso eating some nasty chemicals, as well as lectins. Conventionally-and evenorganically-raised animals are fed a diet of corn, soy, and/or wheat, ingestinga ton of lectins, which in turn, are ingested by you and your family. If youremove all other high-lectin foods from your diet but still eatconventionally-raised animals, you are, in fact, sabotaging yourself. Yes,pastured meat is costly, so just do the best you can. My preference is to treatmeat as more of a weekly indulgence than an everyday necessity, so I feelcomfortable splurging on the best quality I can find.Okay, enough with the preparation already: It’s time to eat! In Part 2[9780062911841_Part2.xhtml], you’ll find recipes for every meal of the day, aswell as vegetable-focused side dishes, lunchbox-friendly meals for little kids(and big kids!), and even some indulgent desserts. Many of these meals can bemade with an Instant Pot or slow cooker, while others are simple sheet pan mealsthat require very little prep and hardly any dishwashing. If you don’t have anInstant Pot or slow cooker, don’t worry. You can adapt these recipes to makethem on the stovetop as well—they will just require a little bit more cookingtime.Are you ready to get cooking? Let’s go!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A Baseball Cap to Hide Her PainRegina was a beautiful, smart, totally bald 6-yearold girl whose parents broughther to see me after the treatments she’d received for alopecia areata had failedto help her. The family had been told that all trials of steroids andimmune-suppressing drugs hadn’t worked. When I met her, she wore a baseball capthat had a fake blond ponytail coming out the back. Even her eyelashes weregone.Blood work revealed she had an anti-histone antibody that was a marker for anautoimmune disease similar to Lupus. I instructed her and her parents on thePlant Paradox protocol, and started her on vitamin D and omega-3 supplements. Wemet again three months later. Her Histone marker was down, her Vitamin D andOmega 3 levels were coming up, and she had about an inch of “peach fuzz” on herscalp and the beginnings of eyebrows. We were all delighted! After another threemonths of following the plan, her Histone returned to normal and she had severalinches of healthy hair growth on her scalp! The baseball cap was gone.We elected to see her six months later, but before that appointment, I receiveda frantic email from Regina’s mother with a new picture: her hair had completelyfallen out again. Repeat blood tests showed her Histone was again positive; thefamily came back into see me early, and this time the baseball cap was back on.On questioning, Regina told me and her parents that when at school or visitingfriends’ houses, she had been convinced to “cheat” with the occasional cookie orglass of milk or even a sandwich. After all she was a normal 7-year-old kid.But despite the temptations, Regina was determined to commit to the plan andregrow her hair. Her parents talked with the school, which allowed her to bringher own food from home.

Just be awarethat when popping sorghum, you’ll get a large number of kernels that don’tpop—more than with regular popcorn—so be sure to have extra on hand. If you’renot a “sweet popcorn” person, consider drizzling your popped sorghum with alittle olive oil, sea salt, and nutritional yeast for a “cheesy” popcorn–stylesnack.SERVES 42 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil1¼ cups dried sorghum½ cup bittersweet chocolate chips, melted½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut1 teaspoon flaky sea salt 1. Place a medium bowl next to your stove to remove kernels as they pop—sorghum burns quickly. 2. In a large, heavy-bottom saucepan with a lid, over medium-high heat, add a few (5 to 7) kernels of sorghum. 3. Cover, and wait until the kernels pop. (It’s quieter than popcorn, so pay close attention.) 4. When the kernels have popped, remove from the heat, and add the oil along with the remaining sorghum. 5. Cover the pot, put on oven mitts, and shake to spread the grains. Let rest for about 30 seconds. 6. Return the pot to the heat. 7. Shake or stir frequently, until the popping slows down—you may notice some smoke, which is normal, but when the pot smokes, feel free to reduce the heat a bit. 8. As the kernels pop, strain them out with a slotted spoon (you don’t have to get every single one) to prevent burning. 9. Once all the kernels are popped, drizzle with the melted chocolate, coconut, and salt. Toss to combine, then let cool (so the chocolate sets) before serving with plenty of napkins."},{"pageContent":"Crème Brûlèe [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rch11_4]One of my favorite desserts—and I suspect yours, too—is much easier to preparewith an Instant Pot.

Add enough water to make sure the beans are completely submerged by at least 2 inches.* 2. Cook them on “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” mode at high pressure—I find this produces more consistent results than cooking on “Bean/Chili” mode. For cooking times, refer to the chart below. 3.

As if things weren’tbusy enough before The Plant Paradox, wow, did you guys step up to the plate!Directed by Susan Lokken, my longtime physician’s assistant, MitzuKillion-Jacobo, my loyal team of Adda Harris, Tanya Marta, Cindy Crosby (whosinglehandedly keeps the office afloat monetarily), Donna Fitzgerald, mydaughter, Melissa Perko, Yessenia Parra, and of course the “Blood Suckers” ledby Laurie Acuna and Lynn Visk.Since this is a family cookbook, you will notice that my dedication goes out toour two daughters, Elizabeth and Melissa, their husbands Tim and Ray, and thegrandkids, Sophie and Oliver. Elizabeth and Tim transformed their lives over thelast two years with The Plant Paradox, and if they can raise their kids with it,so can you, dear readers!Both this book and The Longevity Paradox were written while we were displacedfrom our home in Montecito, which was destroyed in the mudslides that killed 25people, including our next-door neighbor. When they say home is where the heartis, nothing could be truer. Throughout it all, my wife Penny remained my “home”and continues to be so, even now that we have recently acquired a new place.Thanks Penny, again for being our family’s anchor, and the home port I alwayslong to return to from my travels.Finally, like I said in The Plant Paradox and all my subsequent books, none ofthis would be possible without you, my patients and readers. Thank you for yourtrust in me and my team as we together try to maximize our collective knowledge,health, and longevity. And now, let’s give our kids the best shot at greathealth for their long lifetime!"},{"pageContent":"Pressure Cooker FAQs [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rapp]There quite a few models of the Instant Pot, and this guide is not intended toserve as a replacement to the user’s manual that comes with it—instead, it isdesigned to provide some tips, tricks, and hacks to make Instant Pot cookingsimpler. Please read the user’s manual that comes with your Instant Pot beforeyou start cooking.No matter which model of Instant Pot you have, your pot should come with thepressure cooker itself, the lid, the insert, or pot, and a wire rack that’shandy for container-in-container cooking. If your model does not come with awire rack, I suggest purchasing one from your local cookware store orAmazon—there are lots of Instant Pot-friendly options available.Once you’ve read your user’s manual, the best way to familiarize yourself withyour new cooking gadget is to put it to use! I suggest starting with basicrecipes like pressure-cooked beans or rice, as they’ll give you a good sense ofhow your Instant Pot works. Along with the pressure-cooking settings (more onthose below), make sure to try these other functions: * SAUTÉ: The Instant Pot is great for browning food before pressure cooking—this really builds flavor for stews and other dishes. You can also sauté food before slow cooking, if using your Instant Pot as a slow cooker, or if you simply don’t want to break out a pot or pan. In this book you’ll also find some recipes that call for switching back to sauté after pressure cooking. * SLOW COOK/KEEP WARM: Did you know you can actually use your Instant Pot like a slow cooker or crock pot? This setting comes in handy if you don’t want another appliance crowding your kitchen. It’s also great for keeping your pressure-cooked meals warm until your family is ready to eat. * YOGURT: If you’ve ever been curious about making your own yogurt, this setting is for you. And great news—you can use it with coconut, goat, sheep, or A2 milk. All you need is the milk of your choice (I like to use coconut cream) and a high-quality probiotic supplement. Simply dissolve the probiotic supplement in the milk, switch to the yogurt setting, and let the Instant Pot do the rest! There are tons of guides on the Internet if you want to learn more about yogurt making in the Instant Pot. * CANCEL: This button stops whatever you’re doing and switches the pressure cooker to “off” mode. If you press it mid–pressure cooking cycle, you’ll still need to wait for the pressure to release before opening the pot. * PRESSURE-COOKING SETTINGS: Most of the recipes in this book use manual settings, as they are universal to all models of Instant Pots, but other settings include Meat/Stew, Bean/Chili, Poultry, Rice, Steam, Multigrain, and Porridge. Once you get the hang of the manual settings, you can try experimenting with these settings. (A word of caution: for some models of the Instant Pot, pushing the button for your desired setting more than once will change the temperature or the pressure of the setting, from low heat/pressure to high. Read your user’s manual carefully.)Pressure Cooking BasicsThe basics of cooking in an Instant Pot are the same across the board. Whenyou’re ready to start the pressure-cooking process(after any seasoning orsautéing has been done), here’s what you need to do: 1. Make sure there’s AT LEAST a cup of liquid in your pot (or whatever amount is specified in your instruction manual). 2. Make sure your pot is not filled above the fill line marked on the inside of the cooking container (½ if you’re cooking beans—especially unsoaked beans). 3. Double check that everything that belongs in the Instant Pot is in the pot (it’s hard to stop cooking halfway through). 4. Put the lid on Instant Pot and twist to lock. Make sure the valve on top is switched to “sealing.” 5. Hit the “manual” or “pressure cook” button and adjust the time up or down using the arrows. 6. Wait a few seconds, and the pot will start. It should beep and show “On” on the display screen. You’ll notice the timer won’t begin until the pot is pressurized, which can take 5 to 10 minutes. 7. When pot is pressurized, it will automatically start counting down the timer based on the cook time you’ve set. When cooking is done, it will switch to a natural pressure release (on some models, you’ll notice and “L” in front of the timer at this point). 8. You can either leave the pot to automatically depressurize, or you can switch your pot to manual pressure release (see more about the pressure release settings below). 9. No matter which pressure release setting you select, wait until the float valve is completely dropped before attempting to open your pot, and beware of the steam that will be released as it is extremely hot and can easily burn you. 10. Once the pot is depressurized, open, remove food, or continue with your recipe.Releasing PressureAs mentioned, there are two ways to release the pressure on your Instant Pot:manua or natural (automatic). * NATURAL: At the end of cooking, your pot will begin the automatic pressure release process, even if you don’t vent the pot. If you notice an “L” next to your timer, and it is counting up rather than down, it is in automatic pressure release mode. If you want to naturally release pressure fully, you don’t need to touch your Instant Pot at all after cooking—just leave it alone and the pressure will release. This can take up to 30 minutes depending on the recipe, so be patient. Your Instant Pot won’t open otherwise. In this book, you’ll notice that a lot of recipes call for a certain amount of time allowing for a natural pressure release followed by a manual release. This is to ensure the proper cook time for all ingredients in the pot while minimizing the minutes spent cooking. * MANUAL: To manually release pressure (either right after cooking, or after a prescribed amount of time naturally releasing pressure), check that the vent of your Instant Pot is pointed away from anything sensitive to moisture or heat, and well out of the way of you or others. Then, flip the valve on top of the lid from “Sealing” to “Venting”—you should notice steam releasing fairly quickly, letting out a loud hiss which may startle pets or children. If you’re manually releasing a recipe with a lot of liquid, you may also notice sputtering—this is normal, if a little messy.No matter how you release pressure, once the float valve at the top of yourInstant Pot has dropped, it is safe to open the pot. Always remember to open thepot away from your body.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Container-in-Container (or PIP) Cooking Made SimpleMany of the recipes in this book feature container-in-container (or Pot-in-pot,PIP) cooking. This is the term used for pressurecooking a dish within aheatproof dish, rather than adding liquid directly to the dish and stewing. Thismethod works well for foods like cakes and bread, egg dishes, and custards whereyou want to achieve a particular texture.To use this method, look for heatproof containers that fit inside your InstantPot, such as a 7-inch springform cake pan or 7-inch cake pan around 3 inchesdeep. You can also use silicone baking dishes, or even oven-safe stoneware orglass bakeware. Whatever dish you’re using, make sure it is very well oiled witholive oil or avocado oil, for easy release after cooking. You can also line yourdishes with parchment if you’d prefer.When you’re ready to cook, place the rack that comes with your Instant Potinside the cooking pot, and add a cup and a half of water. Then, carefully loweryour prepared container into the pot, so it’s resting on top of the rack. Oneeasy way to do this is to create a foil sling, and carefully lower it in. Youcan cook with the sling in the instant pot, and use it to lift the hot dish outwhen done. You can also use tongs, or specially designed gadgets available incooking stores and online.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Instant Pot “hacks” to make your life easier * COOK MEAT FROM FROZEN. I know that when I’m able to get a good price on wild-caught seafood or pastured chicken, I stock up and freeze some. And if you want, you can throw it right in the pressure cooker, frozen—just add 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time to whatever you’re making to thaw food fully. * STACK YOUR FOOD. If you’re cooking food in ramekins, or even multiple container-in-container dishes with the same cooking time, go ahead and stack them, staggering them a bit. That way, you can make multiple dishes at once. A great way to do this is to use metal dim sum steamers or steamer baskets to create layers within your pot, or by buying multiple racks. * FREEZE MEALS IN ADVANCE. Prepare and freeze uncooked meals in silicone molds that fit inside your instant pot. Then, when it’s time to cook, just remove from the mold, dump in the pot, and cook. You can even cook right in the silicone mold, if it’s oven safe. * USE YOUR DISHWASHER. The rack and inner pot of your Instant Pot are dishwasher safe, and I find if you give them a good soak first, you can often drop them right in the dishwasher, no scrubbing needed. * FOR CRISP VEGETABLES, USE “0.” There’s nothing worse than soggy vegetables, and sometimes the Instant Pot overcooks them. To make quick, perfectly steamed vegetables, put yours in a steamer basket, and cook for 0 minutes on high pressure—then release manually. The time it takes the pressure cooker to come to pressure is all you need to cook most vegetables. * BUY EXTRA SEALING RINGS. The silicone rings are the first things to absorb smells, or to crack and break on Instant Pots, so it’s worth keeping a few extra on hand. I’ve actually got one I use just for curries, since the smell works its way into the silicone almost immediately.What Not to Do * DON’T BE AFRAID OF PRESSURE COOKING! Instant Pots are not your grandmother’s pressure cookers; if you follow the instructions that come with your Instant Pot, you don’t need to worry about burns or explosions—electric pressure cookers are incredibly safe to use. * DON’T BE AFRAID TO USE MULTIPLE SETTINGS IN ONE MEAL. You’ll notice that many recipes start with sautéing and then transition to pressure cooking; this is a great way to build flavor. * DON’T FORGET TO PUT LIQUID IN THE POT. Different sized Instant Pots require different amounts of liquid for cooking, but count on using at least 1.5 cups of liquid any time you cook with it—whether it’s water, coconut milk, broth, or wine. * DON’T BRING YOUR INSTANT POT TO PRESSURE WITH THE VALVE ON “VENTING.” It should always be set for sealing when you’re bringing food to pressure, or the pot simply won’t pressurize. * DON’T UNDERESTIMATE TOTAL COOK TIME. The cook time listed only reflects the time the food will cook in the Instant Pot—you need to account for any sautéing in the recipes, as well as the time it takes your pot to depressurize. That can be anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the dish and the method. * DON’T BE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THE “BURN” WARNING. It’s the most common error message you’ll get, and it could happen for a few reasons: 1. You could be using too little liquid. Try adding a bit more. 2. You could have some sugars or burnt-on food caramelizing on the bottom of the pot. Add water to prevent this from happening. 3. Your lid could be loose or your pot could be “Venting.” Remove lid and reattach before using. * DON’T EXPECT THE SAME TEXTURE FROM BAKED GOODS. Breads, cakes, and pancakes will come out a bit spongier than you might be used to, and more like steamed cakes, buns, or puddings. This is normal—and actually delicious."},{"pageContent":"Resources [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rres]For More Information OnlineDRGUNDRY.COMThis is my personal website, where I post my thoughts, videos, and sharebreaking health news.

GUNDRY YOUTUBE PAGE (https://www.youtube.com/drgundry)Check out my Youtube channel for free cooking demonstrations and a whole libraryof recipes you won’t find in any of my books!SupplementsIt’s my firm belief that even if you have the most immaculate, health-promotingdiet, you can still benefit from the right supplements. Why? Because modernfarming practices, such as the use of pesticides, herbicides, and chemicalfertilizers, have depleted our soil of nutrients and friendly bacterialpopulations. You simply can’t get all the nutrients and micronutrients you needfrom food, because the food you eat isn’t able to deliver those nutrients fromthe soil.In my own life and in my practice with the thousands of patients I have seen,these are the supplements I recommend, because these vitamins and minerals areessential to our well-being, and the vast majority of us are deficient in them:VITAMIN DEven here in sunny Southern California, about 80 percent of my patients arevitamin D deficient when I first begin treating them, and that number is closerto 100 percent if those patients have an autoimmune disorder. This is a seriousproblem, because vitamin D plays an important role in helping your immune systemto function, your bones to stay strong, and your beneficial intestinal flora andgut wall to be healthy. I recommend that everyone take at least 5,000 IUs ofvitamin D3 daily, and if you have an autoimmune condition, make that 10,000.B VITAMINSB vitamins are key for protecting the inner lining of your blood vessels, andabout half the population has a genetic mutation that prevents them from beingable to convert folic acid and vitamin B12 into their active forms. To make sureyou are getting enough B vitamins in a form that your body can use, I recommendtaking methylfolate (the active form of folic acid), 1,000 mcg a day, and methylB12 (the active form of vitamin B12), 1,000 to 5,000 mcg under your tongue eachday.GREEN PLANT PHYTOCHEMICALSYour gut buddies love greens, but you have to take care not to take a greenssupplement that contains lectin-rich grasses such as wheatgrass, barley grass,or oat grass. The supplements I recommend to lend you the vibrance of eatinglarge amount of greens are: * Spinach extract, 1,000 mg. * DIM (diindolylmethane), an immune-boosting compound found in broccoli, 100 mg.POLYPHENOLSThese phytochemicals protect plants from insects and sun damage, and they offermany benefits to you, including improved cardiovascular health and support ofyour gut bacteria. The polyphenol-containing supplements I recommend takingdaily (you can choose one, or take a combination) are: * Grape seed extract, 100 mg. * Pine tree bark extract, 25 to 100 mg. * Resveratrol (the polyphenol in red wine).PREBIOTICSPrebiotics are the substances that feed and nourish your gut buddies—they arethe fertilizer that boosts the health of your internal garden. In addition tosupporting your immunity, prebiotics will help to keep you regular. Goodprebiotic supplements include: * Psyllium husks, a teaspoon a day in water, working up to a tablespoon per day. * Inulin powder, a teaspoon a day (the sweetener Just Like Sugar is primarily inulin).LECTIN BLOCKERSRemember, you can’t avoid all lectins in your diet. For the lectins you doconsume, it helps to have some lectin-fighting compounds in your system. Theseinclude: * Glucosamine, which occurs naturally in the fluid that surrounds and protects your joints and serves a building block of cartilage, binds to inflammatory lectins and reduces pain. You can take one Osteo Bi-Flex or Move Free (both can be found at Costco) daily. * D-mannose, the active ingredient in cranberries, is also an effective lectin blocker. Take 1,000 mg a day (divided into two doses of 500 mg each).SUGAR BLOCKERSTo maintain healthy blood glucose levels, I recommend the following: * CinSulin, a combination of chromium and cinnamon available at Costco, two capsules a day. * Zinc, 30 mg. * Selenium, 150 mcg. * Berberine, 250 mg twice a day. * Turmeric extract, 200 mg twice a day.OMEGA-3SOmega-3 fats are vital to the health of your gut and the health of your brain.In fact, half the fat in your brain—which is made up of 60 percent fat intotal—is a long-chain omega-3 fat called DHA. Yet, in my ten years of seeingpatients, nearly everyone is majorly deficient in these vital fats. Unlessyou’re eating sardines or herring on a daily basis, you likely need to take anomega-3 supplement. I recommend: * Fish oil, molecularly distilled and from small fish such as sardines and anchovies, enough to get 1,000 mg of DHA per day. Brands I like include Kirkland Signature Fish Oil (enteric coated, for no fish burps), OmegaVia DHA 600, and Carlson Elite Omega-3 Gems."},{"pageContent":"Endnotes [9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rnot]CHAPTER 11 [9780062911841_Chapter1.xhtml#ch1fn1].

[9780062911841_Contents.xhtml#rata]STEVEN R. GUNDRY, MD, is a cum laude graduate of Yale University, with specialhonors in human biological and social evolution. After grad- uating Alpha OmegaAlpha from the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. Gundry completed residencies ingeneral surgery and cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Michigan andserved as a clinical associate at the National Institutes of Health. He inventeddevices that reverse the cell death seen in heart attacks; variations of thesedevices became the Medtronic Gundry Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannula, the mostwidely used device of its kind worldwide to protect the heart during open-heartsurgery. After completing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at theHospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, in London, and spending twoyears as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Dr.Gundry was recruited as professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at LomaLinda University School of Medicine.During his tenure at Loma Linda, Dr. Gundry pioneered the field of xe-notransplantation, the study of how the immune system and blood vessel proteinsof one species react to the transplanted heart of a foreign species. He was oneof the original twenty investigators of the first FDA-approved implantable leftventricular assist device. Dr. Gundry is the inventor of the GundryMinisternotomy, the most widely used minimally invasive surgical technique tooperate on the aortic valve; the Gundry Lateral Tun- nel, a living tissue thatcan rebuild parts of the heart in children with se- vere congenital heartmalformations; and the Skoosh Venous Cannula, the most widely used cannula inminimally invasive heart operations.As a consultant to Computer Motion (now Intuitive Surgical), Dr. Gundry was oneof the fathers of robotic heart surgery. He received early FDA approval forrobotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for coronary artery bypass andmitral valve operations. He holds patents on connecting blood vessels andcoronary artery bypasses without the need for sutures, as well as on repairingthe mitral valve without the need for sutures and the heart-lung machine.Dr. Gundry has served on the Board of Directors of the American So- ciety ofArtificial Internal Organs and was a founding board member and treasurer of theInternational Society of Minimally Invasive Car- diothoracic Surgery. He alsoserved two successive terms as president of the Board of Directors of theAmerican Heart Association, Desert Division. Dr. Gundry has been elected afellow of the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Cardiology,the American Surgi- cal Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and theCollege of Chest Physicians. He has served numerous times as an abstract re-viewer for the American Heart Association annual meetings. The author of morethan three hundred articles, chapters, and abstracts in peerreviewed journals onsurgical, immunologic, genetic, nutritional, and lipid investigations, he hasalso operated in more than thirty countries, including on multiple charitablemissions.In 2000, inspired by the stunning reversal of coronary artery disease in an“inoperable” patient by using a combination of dietary changes and nutriceuticalsupplements, Dr. Gundry changed the arc of his ca- reer. An obese chronic dietfailure himself, he adapted his Yale University thesis to design a diet based onevolutionary coding and the interaction of our ancestral microbiome, genes, andenvironment. Fol- lowing this program enabled him to reverse his own numerousmedical problems. In the process, he effortlessly lost seventy pounds and haskept them off for seventeen years. These discoveries led him to estab- lish theInternational Heart and Lung Institute—and, as part of it, the Center forRestorative Medicine—in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara, California. There he hasdevoted his research and clinical practice to the dietary and nutriceuticalreversal of most diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, autoimmunedisease, cancer, arthritis, kidney fail- ure, and neurological conditions suchas dementia and Alzheimer’s dis- ease, using sophisticated blood tests and bloodflow measurements to maximize his patients’ health span and longevity.This research resulted in the publication of his bestselling first book, Dr.Gundry’s Diet Evolution: Turn Off the Genes That Are Killing You and YourWaistline, in 2008. Following up on the success of that book, he has be- comeone of the world’s authorities on the human microbiome and the interactionbetween the gut, the foods we ingest, the products we use, and our physical andmental health and well-being.
