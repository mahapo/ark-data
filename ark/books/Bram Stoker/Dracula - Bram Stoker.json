Bistritz.— Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1stMay, arriving at Viennaearly next morning; should havearrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesthseems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I gotof it from the train and the little I could walk throughthe streets. I feared to go very far from the station, aswe had arrived late and would start as near the cor-rect time as possible.The impression I had was that we were leaving theWest and entering the East;the most western of splen-did bridges over the Danube, which is here of noblewidth and depth, took us among the traditions of Turk-ish rule.3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfallto Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at theHotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, achicken done up some way with red pepper, whichwas very good but thirsty. (Mem. get recipe for Mina.)I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprikahendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should beable to get it anywhere along the Carpathians.I found my smattering of German very useful here,indeed, I don’tknow how I should be able to get onwithout it.Having had some time at my disposal when in Lon-don, I had visited the British Museum, and made searchamong the books and maps in the library regardingTransylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowl-edge of the country could hardly fail to have someimportance in dealing with a nobleman of that coun-try.I find that the district he named is in the extremeeast of the country, just on the borders of three states,Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the midst ofthe Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and leastknown portions of Europe.I was not able to light on any map or work givingthe exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there areno maps of this country as yet to compare with ourown Ordance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz,the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, asthey may refresh my memory when I talk over my travelswith Mina.In the population of Transylvania there are four dis-tinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixedwith them the Wallachs, who are the descendants ofthe Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in theEast and North. I am going among the latter, whoclaim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. Thismay be so, for when the Magyars conquered the coun-4Chapter 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"try in the eleventh century they found the Huns settledin it.I read that every known superstition in the world isgathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if itwere the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool;if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I mustask the Count all about them.)I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfort-able enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams. Therewas a dog howling all night under my window, whichmay have had something to do with it; or it may havebeen the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water inmy carafe, and was still thirsty. Towards morning Islept and was wakened by the continuous knocking atmy door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundlythen.I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of por-ridge of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga”,and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellentdish, which they call “impletata”. (Mem., get recipefor this also.)I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a littlebefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, forafter rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in thecarriage for more than an hour before we began tomove.It seems to me that the further east you go the moreunpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be inChina?All day long we seemed to dawdle through a coun-try which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimeswe saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hillssuch as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran byrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stonymargin on each side of them to be subject ot greatfloods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, tosweep the outside edge of a river clear.At every station there were groups of people, some-Chapter 15"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"times crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of themwere just like the peasantsat home or those I saw com-ing through France and Germany, with short jackets,and round hats, and home-made trousers; but otherswere very picturesque.The women looked pretty, except when you got nearthem, but they were very clumsy about the waist. Theyhad all full white sleevesof some kind or other, andmost of them had big belts with a lot of strips of some-thing fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet,but of course there were petticoats under them.The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, whowere more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linenshirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a footwide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore highboots, with their trousers tucked into them, and hadlong black hair and heavy black moustaches. They arevery picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. Onthe stage they would be set down at once as some oldOriental band of brigands. They are, however, I am told,very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-as-sertion.It was on the dark side of twilight when we got toBistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Beingpractically on the frontier—for the Borgo Pass leadsfrom it into Bukovina— it has had a very stormy ex-istence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty yearsago a series of great fires took place, which made ter-rible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very be-ginning of the seventeenth century it underwent asiege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casu-alties of war proper being assisted by famine and dis-ease.Count Dracula had directed me to go to the GoldenKrone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to bethoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted tosee all I could of the ways of the country.Chapter 16"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I was evidently expected, for when I got near thedoor I faceda cheery-looking elderly woman in theusual peasant dress—white undergarment with a longdouble apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fit-ting almost too tight for modesty. When I came closeshe bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly manin white shirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter: “My friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anx-iously expecting you. Sleep well tonight. At threetomorrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a placeon it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriagewill await you and will bring you to me. I trust thatyour journey from London has been a happy one, andthat you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.—Your friend, Dracula.”4 May—I found that my landlord had got a letter fromthe Count, directing him to secure the best place onthe coach for me; but on making inquiries as to de-tails he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended thathe could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he hadunderstood it perfectly; at least, he answered my ques-tions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me,looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. Hemumbled out that the money had been sent in aletter,and that was all he knew. When I asked him if heknew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of hiscastle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and,saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refusedto speak further. It was so near the time of startingthat I had no time to ask anyone else, for it was allvery mysterious and not by any means comforting.Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to myChapter 17"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"roomand said in a hysterical way: “Must you go? Oh! YoungHerr, must you go?” She was in such an excited statethat she seemed to have lost her grip of what Germanshe knew, and mixed it all up with some other lan-guage which I did not know at all. I was just able tofollow her by asking many questions. When I told herthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged onimportant business, she asked again:“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that itwas the fourth of May.She shook her head as she said again:“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you knowwhat day it is?”On my saying that I did not understand, she wenton:“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not knowthat tonight,when the clock strikes midnight, all theevil things in the world will havefull sway? Do youknow where you are going, and what you are goingto?” She was in such evident distress that I tried tocomfort her, but without effect. Finally, she went downon her knees and implored me not to go; at least towait a day or two before starting.It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfort-able. However, there was business to be done, and Icould allow nothing to interfere with it.I tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could,that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, andthat I must go.She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a cru-cifix from her neck offered it to me.I did not know what to do, for, as an English Church-man, I have been taught to regard such things as insome measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungra-cious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and insuch a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she putChapter 18"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the rosary round my neck and said, “For your mother’ssake,” and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I amwaiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; andthe crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostlytraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do notknow, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mindas usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let itbring my goodbye. Here comes the coach!5 May. The Castle.—The gray of the morning has passed,and the sun is high over the distant horizon, whichseems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not,for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till Iawake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down, and, lestwho reads them may fancy that I dined too well beforeI left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called “robber steak”—bits ofbacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, andstrung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in simplestyle of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queersting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagree-able. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothingelse. When I got on the coach, the driver had not takenhis seat, and I saw him talking to the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every nowand then they looked at me, and some of the peoplewho were sitting on the bench outside the door—cameand listened, and then looked at me, most of thempityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated,queer words, for there were many nationalities in theChapter 19"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary frommy bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongstthem were “Ordog”—Satan, “Pokol”—hell, “stregoica”—witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both mean the samething, one being Slovak and the other Servian for some-thing that is either werewolf or vampire. (Mem., I mustask the Count about these superstitions.) When we started, the crowd round the inn door, whichhad by this time swelled to a considerable size, allmade the sign of the cross and pointed two fingerstowards me. With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tellme what they meant. He would not answer at first, buton learning that I was English, he explained that itwas a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting foran unknown place to meet an unknown man. But ev-eryone seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, andso sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had ofthe inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures,allcrossing themselves, as they stood round the wide arch-way, with its background of rich foliage of oleanderand orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centreof the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers coveredthe whole front of the boxseat,—”gotza” they callthem—cracked his big whip over his four small horses,which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey. I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears inthe beauty of the scene as we drove along, althoughhad I known the language, or rather languages, whichmy fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not havebeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay agreen sloping land full of forests and woods, with hereand there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees orwith farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road. ThereChapter 110"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry. And as we drove by I couldsee the green grass under the trees spangled with thefallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills ofwhat they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or wasshut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, whichhere and there ran down the hillsides like tongues offlame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to flyover it with a feverish haste. I could not understandthen what the haste meant, but the driver was evi-dently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.I was told that this road is in summertime excellent,but that it had not yet been put in order after thewinter snows. In this respect it is different from thegeneral run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an oldtradition that they are not to be kept in too goodorder. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them,lest the Turk should think that they were preparing tobring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war whichwas always really at loading point. Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Landrose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps ofthe Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us theytowered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon themand bringing out all the glorious colours of this beau-tiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows ofthe peaks, green and brown where grass and rockmingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rockand pointed crags, till these were themselves lost inthe distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Hereand there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains,through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw nowand again the white gleam of falling water. One of mycompanions touched my arm as we swept round thebase of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-coveredpeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound onour serpentine way, to be right before us.Chapter 111"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" “Look! Isten szek!”—”God’s seat!”—and he crossedhimself reverently. As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sanklower and lower behind us, the shadows of the eveningbegan to creep round us. This was emphasized by thefact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sun-set, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.Here and there we passed Cszeks and slovaks, all inpicturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was pain-fully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,and as we swept by, my companions all crossed them-selves. Here and there was a peasant man or womankneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn roundas we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender ofdevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outerworld. There were many things new to me. For in-stance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there verybeautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stemsshining like silver through the delicate green of theleaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordi-nary peasants’s cart—with its long, snakelike verte-bra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. Onthis were sure to be seated quite a group of homecom-ing peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slo-vaks with their coloured sheepskins, the latter carry-ing lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end.As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and thegrowing twilight seemed to merge into one dark misti-ness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine,though in the valleys which ran deep between the spursof the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the darkfirs stood out here and there against the backgroundof late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cutthrough the pine woods that seemed in the darknessto be closing down upon us, great masses of greynesswhich here and there bestrewed the trees, produced apeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried onChapter 112"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier inthe evening, when the falling sunset threw into strangerelief the ghost-like clouds which amongst theCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the val-leys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despiteour driver’s haste, the horses could only go slowly. Iwished to get down and walk up them, as we do athome, but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,”he said. “You must not walk here. The dogs are toofierce.” And then he added, with what he evidentlymeant for grim pleasantry— for he looked round tocatch the approving smile of the rest—”And you mayhave enough of such matters before you go to sleep.”The only stop he would make was a moment’s pause tolight his lamps. When it grew dark there seemed to be some excite-ment amongst the passengers, and they kept speakingto him, one after the other, as though urging him tofurther speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully withhis long whip, and with wild cries of encouragementurged them on to further exertions. Then through thedarkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light aheadof us,as though there were a cleft in the hills. Theexcitement of the passengers grew greater. The crazycoach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayedlike a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on.The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along.Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us oneach side and to frown down upon us. We were enter-ing on the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the pas-sengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon mewith an earnestness which would take no denial. Thesewere certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each wasgiven in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and ablessing, and that same strange mixture of fear-mean-ing movements which I had seen outside the hotel atBistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard againstthe evil eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leanedChapter 113"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"forward, and on each side the passengers, craning overthe edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the dark-ness. It was evident that something very exciting waseither happening or expected, but though I asked eachpassenger, no one would give me the slightest expla-nation. This state of excitement kept on for some littletime. And at last we saw before us the Pass openingout on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling cloudsoverhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense ofthunder. It seemed as though the mountain range hadseparated two atmospheres, and that now we had gotinto the thunderous one. I was now myself lookingout for the conveyance which was to take me to theCount. Each moment I expected to see the glare oflamps through the blackness, but all was dark. Theonly light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, inwhich the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in awhite cloud. We could see now the sandy road lyingwhite before us, but there was on it no sign of a ve-hicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of glad-ness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.I was already thinking what I had best do, when thedriver, looking at his watch, said to the others some-thing which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so qui-etly and in so low a tone, I thought it was “An hourless than the time.” Then turning to me, he spoke inGerman worse than my own. “There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expectedafter all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and returntomorrow or the next day, better the next day.” Whilsthe was speaking the horses began to neigh and snortand plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold themup. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peas-ants and a universal crossing of themselves, a caleche,with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us,and drew up beside the coach. I could see from theflash of our lamps as the rays fell on them, that thehorses were coal-black and splendid animals. They wereChapter 114"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and agreat black hat, which seemed to hide his face fromus. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very brighteyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turnedto us. He said to the driver, “You are early tonight, myfriend.” The man stammered in reply, “The English Herr wasin a hurry.” To which the stranger replied, “That is why, I sup-pose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You can-not deceive me, my friend. I know too much, and myhorses are swift.” As he spoke he smiled,and the lamplight fell on ahard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-look-ing teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companionswhispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”. “Denn die Todten reiten Schnell.” (“For the dead travelfast.”) The strange driver evidently heard the words, for helooked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turnedhis face away, at the same time putting out his twofingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s lug-gage,” said the driver, and with exceeding alacrity mybags were handed out and put in the caleche. Then Idescended from the side of the coach, as the calechewas close alongside, the driver helping me with a handwhich caught my arm in a grip of steel. His strengthmust have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned,and we swept into the darkness of the pass. As I lookedback I saw the steam from the horses of the coach bythe light of the lamps,and projected against it the fig-ures of my late companions crossing themselves. Thenthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses,and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As theysank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and alonely feeling come over me. But a cloak was thrownChapter 115"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and thedriver said in excellent German—”The night is chill,mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take allcare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandyof the country) underneath the seat, if you shouldrequire it.” I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know itwas there all the same. I felt a little strangely, and nota little frightened. I think had there been any alterna-tive I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting thatunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hardpace straight along, then we made a complete turnand went along another straight road. It seemed to methat we were simply going over and over the sameground again, and so I took note of some salient point,and found that this was so. I would have liked to haveasked the driver what this all meant, but I really fearedto do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any pro-test would have had no effect in case there had beenan intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know howtime was passing, I struck a match, and by its flamelooked at my watch. It was within a few minutes ofmidnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I supposethe general superstition about midnight was increasedby my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feelingof suspense. Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhousefar down the road, a long, agonized wailing, as if fromfear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and thenanother and another, till, borne on the wind whichnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howlingbegan, which seemed to come from all over the coun-try, as far as the imagination could grasp it throughthe gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear,but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and theyquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though af-Chapter 116"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ter a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in thedistance, from the mountains on each side of us begana louder and a sharper howling, that of wolves, whichaffected both the horses and myself in the same way.For I was minded to jump from the caleche and run,whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so thatthe driver had to use all his great strength to keepthem from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my ownears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses sofar became quiet that the driver was able to descendand to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered some-thing in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamersdoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under hiscaresses they became quite manageable again, thoughthey still trembled. The driver again took his seat,and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. Thistime, after going to the far side or the Pass, he sud-denly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharplyto the right. Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in placesarched right over the roadway till we passed asthrough a tunnel. And again great frowning rocksguarded us boldly on either side. Though we were inshelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moanedand whistled through the rocks, and the branches ofthe trees crashed together as we swept along. It grewcolder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow beganto fall, so that soon we and all around us were coveredwith a white blanket. The keen wind still carried thehowling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as wewent on our way. The baying of the wolves soundednearer and nearer, as though they were closing roundon us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, andthe horses shared my fear. The driver, however, wasnot in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head toleft and right, but I could not see anything throughthe darkness.Chapter 117"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" Suddenly, away on our left I saw a faint flickeringblue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment. Heat once checked the horses, and, jumping to theground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not knowwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolvesgrew closer. But while I wondered, the driver suddenlyappeared again, and without a word took his seat, andwe resumed our journey. I think I must have fallenasleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemedto be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it islike a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appearedso near the road, that even in the darkness around usI could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly towhere the blue flame arose, it must have been veryfaint, for it did not seem to illumine the place aroundit at all, and gathering a few stones, formed them intosome device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect. Whenhe stood between me and the flame he did not ob-struct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.This startled me, but as the effect was only momen-tary, I took it that my eyes deceived me strainingthrough the darkness. Then for a time there were noblue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom,with the howling of the wolves around us, as thoughthey were following in a moving circle. At last there came a time when the driver went fur-ther afield than he had yet gone, and during his ab-sence, the horses began to tremble worse than everand to snort and scream with fright. I could not seeany cause for it, for the howling of the wolves hadceased altogether. But just then the moon, sailingthrough the black clouds, appeared behind the jaggedcrest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light Isaw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth andlolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggyhair. They were a hundred times more terrible in thegrim silence which held them than even when theyChapter 118"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. Itis only when a man feels himself face to face with suchhorrors that he can understand their true import. All at once the wolves began to howl as though themoonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. Thehorses jumped about and reared, and looked helplesslyround with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see.But the living ring of terror encompassed them on ev-ery side, and they had perforce to remain within it. Icalled to the coachman to come, for it seemed to methat our only chance was to try to break out throughthe ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beatthe side of the caleche, hoping by the noise to scarethe wolves from the side, so as to give him a chance ofreaching the trap. How he came there, I know not,but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperiouscommand, and looking towards the sound, saw himstand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, asthough brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, thewolves fell back and back further still. Just then aheavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, sothat we were again in darkness. When I could see again the driver was climbing intothe caleche, and the wolves disappeared. This was allso strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came uponme, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemedinterminable as we swept on our way, now in almostcomplete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured themoon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods ofquick descent, but in the main always ascending. Sud-denly, I became conscious of the fact that the driverwas in the act of pulling up the horses in the court-yard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall blackwindows came no ray of light,and whose broken battle-ments showed a jagged line against the sky.Chapter 119"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2Jonathan Harker’s Journal Continued5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I hadbeen fully awake I must have noticed the approach ofsuch a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyardlooked of considerable size, and as several dark waysled from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemedbigger than it really is. I have not yet been able tosee it by daylight. When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped downand held out his hand to assist me to alight. Again Icould not but notice his prodigious strength. His handactually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushedmine if he had chosen. Then he took my traps, andplaced them on the ground beside me as I stood closeto a great door, old and studded with large iron nails,and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. Icould see even in th e dim light that the stone wasmassively carved, but that the carving had been muchworn by time and weather. As I stood, the driverjumped again into his seat and shook the reins. Thehorses started forward,and trap and all disappeareddown one of the dark openings. I stood in silence where I was, for I did not knowwhat to do. Of bell or knocker there was no sign.Through these frowning walls and dark window open-ings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate.The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubtsand fears crowding upon me. What sort of place had Icome to, and among what kind of people? What sortof grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor’sclerk sent out to explain the purchase of a Londonestate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s clerk! Mina wouldnot like that. Solicitor, for just before leaving LondonChapter 220"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"I got word that my examination was successful, and Iam now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyesand pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemedlike a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that Ishould suddenly awake, and find myself at home, withthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I hadnow and again felt in the morning after a day of over-work. But my flesh answered the pinching test, andmy eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awakeand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was tobe patient, and to wait the coming of morning. Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavystep approaching behind the great door, and sawthrough the chinks the gleam of a coming light. Thenthere was the sound of rattling chains and the clank-ing of massive bolts drawn back. A key was turnedwith the loud grating noise of long disuse, and thegreat door swung back. Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for along white moustache, and clad in black from head tofoot, without a single speck of colour about him any-where. He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, inwhich the flame burned without a chimney or globe ofany kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flick-ered in the draught of the open door. The old manmotioned me in with his right hand with a courtlygesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strangeintonation. “Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your ownfree will!” He made no motion of stepping to meet me,but stood like a statue,as though his gesture of wel-come had fixed him into stone. The instant, however,that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved im-pulsively forward, and holding out his hand graspedmine with a strength which made me wince, an effectwhich was not lessened by the fact that it seemed coldas ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man.Again he said.Chapter 221"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" “Welcome to my house! Enter freely. Go safely, andleave something of the happiness you bring!” Thestrength of the handshake was so much akin to thatwhich I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had notseen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not thesame person to whom I was speaking. So to make sure,I said interrogatively, “Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly was as he replied, “I am Dracula,and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Comein, the night air is chill, and you must need to eat andrest.”As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracketon the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage. Hehad carried it in before I could forestall him. I pro-tested, but he insisted. “Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my peopleare not available. Let me see to your comfortmyself.”He insisted on carrying my traps along thepassage, and then up a great winding stair, and alonganother great passage, on whose stone floor our stepsrang heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavydoor, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room inwhich a table was spread for supper, and on whosemighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,flamed and flared. The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed thedoor, and crossing the room, opened another door,which led into a small octagonal room lit by a singlelamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.Passing through this, he opened another door, andmotioned me to enter. It was a welcome sight. Forhere was a great bedroom well lighted and warmedwith another log fire, also added to but lately, for thetop logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up thewide chimney. The Count himself left my luggage in-side and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door. “You will need, after your journey, to refresh your-self by making your toilet. I trust you will find allyou wish. When you are ready, come into the otherChapter 222"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"room, where you will find your supper prepared.” The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous wel-come seemed to have dissipated all my doubts andfears. Having then reached my normal state, I discov-ered that I was half famished with hunger. So making ahasty toilet, I went into the other room. I found supper already laid out. My host, who stoodon one side of the great fireplace, leaning against thestonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to thetable, and said, “I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. Youwill I trust, excuse me that I do not join you, but Ihave dined already, and I do not sup.” I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkinshad entrusted to me. He opened it and read it gravely.Then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me toread. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill ofpleasure. “I must regret that an attack of gout, from whichmalady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely anytravelling on my part for some time to come. But I amhappy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one inwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a youngman, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of avery faithful disposition. He is discreet and silent, andhas grown into manhood in my service. He shall beready to attend on you when you will during his stay,and shall take your instructions in all matters.” The count himself came forward and took off the coverof a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roastchicken. This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottleof old tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my sup-per. During the time I was eating it the Count askedme many question as to my journey, and I told him bydegrees all I had experienced. By this time I had finished my supper,and by my host’sdesire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun tosmoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same timeChapter 223"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now anopportunity of observing him, and found him of a verymarked physiognomy. His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, withhigh bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly archednostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair growingscantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting overthe nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl inits own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see itunder the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth. These pro-truded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddinessshowed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. Forthe rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremelypointed. The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeksfirm though thin. The general effect was one of ex-traordinary pallor. Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as theylay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemedrather white and fine. But seeing them now close tome, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse,broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there werehairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were longand fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the Count leanedover me and his hands touched me, I could not repressa shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank,but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which,do what I would, I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back. And witha grim sort of smile, which showed more than he hadyet done his protruberant teeth, sat himself down againon his own side of the fireplace. We were both silentfor a while, and as I looked towards the window I sawthe first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemeda strange stillness over everything. But as I listened,I heard as if from down below in the valley the howl-ing of many wolves. The Count’s eyes gleamed, and heChapter 224"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"said. “Listen to them, the children of the night. What mu-sic they make!” Seeing, I suppose, some expression inmy face strange to him, he added, “Ah, sir, you dwell-ers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of thehunter.” Then he rose and said. “But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready,and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will. Ihave to be away till the afternoon, so sleep well anddream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for mehimself the door to the octagonal room, and I enteredmy bedroom. I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt. I fear. I thinkstrange things, which I dare not confess to my ownsoul. God keep me, if only for the sake of those dearto me!7 May.—It is again early morning, but I have restedand enjoyed the last twenty-four hours. I slept tilllate in the day, and awoke of my own accord. When Ihad dressed myself I went into the room where we hadsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with cof-fee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth.There was a card on the table, on which was written—”I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.D.” I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal. When I haddone, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the ser-vants know I had finished, but I could not find one.There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, con-sidering the extraordinary evidences of wealth whichare round me. The table service is of gold, and so beau-tifully wrought that it must be of immense value. Thecurtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas andthe hangings of my bed are of the costliest and mostbeautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous valuewhen they were made, for they are centuries old, thoughin excellent order. I saw something like them in Hamp-ton Court, but they were worn and frayed and moth-Chapter 225"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I hadto get the little shaving glass from my bag before Icould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yetseen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near thecastle except the howling of wolves. Some time after Ihad finished my meal, I do not know whether to call itbreakfast of dinner, for it was between five and sixo’clock when I had it, I looked about for something toread, for I did not like to go about the castle until Ihad asked the Count’s permission. There was absolutelynothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writ-ing materials, so I opened another door in the roomand found a sort of library. The door opposite mine Itried, but found locked. In the library I found, to my great delight, a vastnumber of English books, whole shelves full of them,and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers. Atable in the center was littered with English maga-zines and newspapers, though none of them were ofvery recent date. The books were of the most variedkind, history, geography, politics, political economy,botany, geology, law, all relating to England and En-glish life and customs and manners. There were evensuch books of reference as the London Directory, the“Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the Armyand Navy Lists, and it somehow gladdened my heart tosee it, the Law List. Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened,and the Count entered. He saluted me in a hearty way,and hoped that I had had a good night’s rest. Then hewent on. “I am glad you found your way in here, for I am surethere is much that will interest you. These compan-ions,” and he laid his hand on some of the books, “havebeen good friends to me, and for some years past, eversince I had the idea of going to London, have given memany, many hours of pleasure. Through them I haveChapter 226"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"come to know your great England, and to know her isto love her. I long to go through the crowded streetsof your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirland rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, itsdeath, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! As yetI only know your tongue through books. To you, myfriend, I look that I know it to speak.” “But, Count,” I said, “You know and speak Englishthoroughly!” He bowed gravely. “I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flatteringestimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way onthe road I would travel. True, I know the grammar andthe words, but yet I know not how to speak them. “Indeed,” I said, “You speak excellently.” “Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did Imove and speak in your London, none there are whowould not know me for a stranger. That is not enoughfor me. Here I am noble. I am a Boyar. The commonpeople know me, and I am master. But a stranger in astrange land, he is no one. Men know him not, and toknow not is to care not for. I am content if I am likethe rest, so that no man stops if he sees me, or pausesin his speaking if he hears my words, ‘Ha, ha! Astranger!’I have been so long master that I would be masterstill, or at least that none other should be master ofme. You come to me not alone as agent of my friendPeter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my newestate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with mea while, so that by our talking I may learn the Englishintonation. And I would that you tell me when I makeerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorrythat I had to be away so long today, but you will, Iknow forgive one who has so many important affairsin hand.” Of course I said all I could about being willing, andasked if I might come into that room when I chose. Heanswered, “Yes, certainly,” and added.Chapter 227"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" “You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, ex-cept where the doors are locked, where of course youwill not wish to go. There is reason that all things areas they are, and did you see with my eyes and knowwith my knowledge, you would perhaps better under-stand.”I said I was sure of this, and then he went on. “We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not En-gland. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall beto you many strange things. Nay, from what you havetold me of your experiences already, you know some-thing of what strange things there may be.” This led to much conversation, and as it was evidentthat he wanted to talk, if only for talking’s sake, Iasked him many questions regarding things that hadalready happened to me or come within my notice.Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned theconversation by pretending not to understand, butgenerally he answered all I asked most frankly. Thenas time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, Iasked him of some of the strange things of the preced-ing night, as for instance, why the coachman went tothe places where he had seen the blue flames. He thenexplained to me that it was commonly believed thaton a certain night of the year, last night, in fact, whenall evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway, ablue flame is seen over any place where treasure hasbeen concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he went on, “in theregion through which you came last night, there canbe but little doubt. For it was the ground fought overfor centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and theTurk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all thisregion that has not been enriched by the blood ofmen, patriots or invaders. In the old days there werestirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungariancame up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meetthem, men and women, the aged and the children too,Chapter 228"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes,that they might sweep destruction on them with theirartificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphanthe found but little, for whatever there was had beensheltered in the friendly soil.” “But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long un-discovered, when there is a sure index to it if men willbut take the trouble to look? “The Count smiled, andas his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp,canine teeth showed out strangely. He answered. “Because your peasant is at heart a coward and afool! Those flames only appear on one night, and onthat night no man of this land will, if he can help it,stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did hewould not know what to do. Why, even the peasantthat you tell me of who marked the place of the flamewould not know where to look in daylight even for hisown work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, beable to find these places again?” “There you are right,” I said. “I know no more thanthe dead where even to look for them.” Then we driftedinto other matters. “Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and ofthe house which you have procured for me.” With anapology for my remissness, I went into my own roomto get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placingthem in order I heard a rattling of china and silver inthe next room, and as I passed through, noticed thatthe table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it wasby this time deep into the dark. The lamps were alsolit in the study or library, and I found the Count lyingon the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, andEnglish Bradshaw’s Guide. When I came in he clearedthe books and papers from the table, and with him Iwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. Hewas interested in everything, and asked me a myriadquestions about the place and its surroundings. Heclearly had studied beforehand all he could get on theChapter 229"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"subject of the neighborhood, for he evidently at theend knew very much more than I did. When I remarkedthis, he answered. “Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friendHarker Jonathan, nay, pardon me. I fall into mycountry’s habit of putting your patronymic first, myfriend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to cor-rect and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, prob-ably working at papers of the law with my other friend,Peter Hawkins. So!” We went thoroughly into the business of the pur-chase of the estate at Purfleet. When I had told himthe facts and got his signature to the necessary pa-pers, and had written a letter with them ready to postto Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had comeacross so suitable a place. I read to him the notes whichI had made at the time, and which I inscribe here. “At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came across just such aplace as seemed to be required, and where was dis-played a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale.It was surrounded by a high wall, of ancient struc-ture, built of heavy stones, and has not been repairedfor a large number of years. The closed gates are ofheavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust. “The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption ofthe old Quatre Face, as the house is four sided, agree-ing with the cardinal points of the compass. It con-tains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded bythe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are manytrees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and thereis a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidentlyfed by some springs, as the water is clear and flowsaway in a fair-sized stream. The house is very largeand of all periods back, I should say, to mediaevaltimes, for one part is of stone immensely thick, withonly a few windows high up and heavily barred withiron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an oldChapter 230"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not thekey of the door leading to it from the house, but Ihave taken with my Kodak views of it from variouspoints. The house had been added to, but in a verystraggling way, and I can only guess at the amount ofground it covers, which must be very great. There arebut few houses close at hand, one being a very largehouse only recently added to and formed into a pri-vate lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible fromthe grounds.” When I had finished, he said, “I am glad that it is oldand big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in anew house would kill me. A house cannot be madehabitable in a day, and after all, how few days go tomake up a century. I rejoice also that there is a chapelof old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to thinkthat our bones may lie amongst the common dead. Iseek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuous-ness of much sunshine and sparkling waters whichplease the young and gay. I am no longer young, andmy heart, through weary years of mourning over thedead, is attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of mycastle are broken. The shadows are many, and the windbreathes cold through the broken battlements and case-ments. I love the shade and the shadow, and would bealone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow hiswords and his look did not seem to accord, or else itwas that his cast of face made his smile look malig-nant and saturnine. Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me topull my papers together. He was some little time away,and I began to look at some of the books around me.One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally toEngland, as if that map had been much used. On look-ing at it I found in certain places little rings marked,and on examining these I noticed that one was nearLondon on the east side, manifestly where his new es-tate was situated. The other two were Exeter, andChapter 231"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Whitby on the Yorkshire coast. It was the better part of an hour when the Countreturned. “Aha!” he said. “Still at your books? Good!But you must not work always. Come! I am informedthat your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and wewent into the next room, where I found an excellentsupper ready on the table. The Count again excusedhimself, as he had dined out on his being away fromhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chattedwhilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the lastevening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting andasking questions on every conceivable subject, hourafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed,but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligationto meet my host’s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy,as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me, but Icould not help experiencing that chill which comesover one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, inits way, the turn of the tide. They say that people whoare near death die generally at the change to dawn orat the turn of the tide. Anyone who has when tired,and tied as it were to his post, experienced this changein the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once weheard the crow of the cock coming up with preter-natural shrillness through the clear morning air. Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said, “Why thereis the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stayup so long. You must make your conversation regard-ing my dear new country of England less interesting,so that I may not forget how time flies by us,” andwith a courtly bow, he quickly left me. I went into my room and drew the curtains, but therewas little to notice. My window opened into the court-yard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickeningsky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have writtenof this day.8 May.—I began to fear as I wrote in this book that IChapter 232"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"was getting too diffuse. But now I am glad that I wentinto detail from the first, for there is something sostrange about this place and all in it that I cannot butfeel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I hadnever come. It may be that this strange night exist-ence is telling on me, but would that that were all! Ifthere were any one to talk to I could bear it, but thereis no one. I have only the Count to speak with, andhe—I fear I am myself the only living soul within theplace. Let me be prosaiac so far as facts can be. It willhelp me to bear up, and imagination must not run riotwith me. If it does I am lost. Let me say at once howI stand, or seem to. I only slept a few hours when I went to bed,and feel-ing that I could not sleep any more, got up. I hadhung my shaving glass by the window, and was justbeginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on myshoulder, and heard the Count’s voice saying to me,“Good morning.” I started, for it amazed me that I hadnot seen him, since the reflection of the glass coveredthe whole room behind me. In starting I had cut my-self slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.Having answered the Count’s salutation, I turned tothe glass again to see how I had been mistaken. Thistime there could be no error, for the man was close tome, and I could see him over my shoulder. But therewas no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole roombehind me was displayed, but there was no sign of aman in it, except myself. This was startling, and coming on the top of so manystrange things, was beginning to increase that vaguefeeling of uneasiness which I always have when theCount is near. But at the instant I saw the the cut hadbled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin.I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round tolook for some sticking plaster. When the Count sawmy face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury,and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drewChapter 233"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"away and his hand touched the string of beads whichheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him,for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly be-lieve that it was ever there. “Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut your-self. It is more dangerous that you think in this coun-try.” Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on, “Andthis is the wretched thing that has done the mischief.It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” Andopening the window with one wrench of his terriblehand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered intoa thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard farbelow. Then he withdrew without a word. It is veryannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless inmy watch-case or the bottom of the shaving pot, whichis fortunately of metal. When I went into the dining room, breakfast was pre-pared, but I could not find the Count anywhere. So Ibreakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have notseen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very pecu-liar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in thecastle. I went out on the stairs, and found a roomlooking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stoodthere was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle ison the very edge of a terrific precipice. A stone fallingfrom the window would fall a thousand feet withouttouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a seaof green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift wherethere is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads wherethe rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests. But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when Ihad seen the view I explored further. Doors, doors,doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In noplace save from the windows in the castle walls is therean available exit. The castle is a veritable prison, andI am a prisoner!Chapter 234"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3Jonathan Harker’s Journal Continued When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wildfeeling came over me. I rushed up and down the stairs,trying every door and peering out of every window Icould find, but after a little the conviction of my help-lessness overpowered all other feelings. When I lookback after a few hours I think I must have been madfor the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in atrap. When, however, the conviction had come to methat I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quietly as Ihave ever done anything in my life, and began to thinkover what was best to be done. I am thinking still, andas yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of onething only am I certain. That it is no use making myideas known to the Count. He knows well that I amimprisoned, and as he has done it himself, and hasdoubtless his own motives for it, he would only de-ceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far asI can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledgeand my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, Iknow, either being deceived, like a baby, by my ownfears, or else I am in desperate straits, and if the latterbe so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to getthrough. I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heardthe great door below shut, and knew that the Counthad returned. He did not come at once into the li-brary, so I went cautiously to my own room and foundhim making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmedwhat I had all along thought, that there are no ser-vants in the house. When later I saw him through thechink of the hinges of the door laying the table in thedining room, I was assured of it. For if he does himselfall these menial offices, surely it is proof that there isChapter 335"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"no one else in the castle, it must have been the Counthimself who was the driver of the coach that broughtme here. This is a terrible thought, for if so, what doesit mean that he could control the wolves, as he did,by only holding up his hand for silence? How was itthat all the people at Bistritz and on the coach hadsome terrible fear for me? What meant the giving ofthe crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of themountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifixround my neck! For it is a comfort and a strength tome whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which Ihave been taught to regard with disfavour and as idola-trous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be ofhelp. Is it that there is something in the essence of thething itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, inconveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Sometime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and tryto make up my mind about it. In the meantime I mustfind out all I can about Count Dracula,as it may helpme to understand. Tonight he may talk of himself, if Iturn the conversation that way. I must be very care-ful, however, not to awake his suspicion.Midnight.—I have had a long talk with the Count. Iasked him a few questions on Transylvania history, andhe warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speak-ing of things and people, and especially of battles, hespoke as if he had been present at them all. This heafterwards explained by saying that to a Boyar thepride of his house and name is his own pride, thattheir glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate.Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we”,and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. Iwish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it,for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have init a whole history of the country. He grew excited ashe spoke, and walked about the room pulling his greatChapter 336"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"white moustache and grasping anything on which helaid his hands as though he would crush it by mainstrength.One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as Ican, for it tells in its way the story of his race. “We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in ourveins flows the blood of many brave races who foughtas the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpoolof European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Ice-land the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gamethem, which their Berserkers displayed to such fellintent on the seaboards of Europe, aye, and of Asiaand Africa too, till the peoples thought that thewerewolves themselves had come. Here, too, whenthey came, they found the Huns, whose warlike furyhad swept the earth like a living flame, till the dyingpeoples held that in their veins ran the blood of thoseold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had matedwith the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devilor what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose bloodis in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a wonderthat we were a conquering race, that we were proud,that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, theBulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our fron-tiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that whenArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarianfatherland he found us here when he reached the fron-tier, that the Honfoglalas was completed there? Andwhen the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelyswere claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars,and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding ofthe frontier of Turkeyland. Aye, and more than that,endless duty of the frontier guard, for as the Turkssay, ‘water sleeps, and the enemy is sleepless.’ Whomore gladly than we throughout the Four Nations re-ceived the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its warlike call flockedquicker to the standard of the King? When was re-deemed that great shame of my nation, the shame ofChapter 337"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyarwent down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but oneof my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danubeand beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Draculaindeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother,when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk andbrought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not thisDracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his racewho in a later age again and again brought his forcesover the great river into Turkeyland, who, when hewas beaten back, came again, and again, though hehad to come alone from the bloody field where histroops were being slaughtered, since he knew that healone could ultimately triumph! They said that hethought only of himself. Bah! What good are peasantswithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brainand heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battleof Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of theDracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spiritwould not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir,the Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart’s blood,their brains, and their swords, can boast a record thatmushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and theRomanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.Blood is too precious a thing in these days ofdishonourable peace, and the glories of the great racesare as a tale that is told.” It was by this time close on morning, and we went tobed. (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the begin-ning of the “Arabian Nights,” for everything has tobreak off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet’sfather.)12 May.—Let me begin with facts, bare, meager facts,verified by books and figures, and of which there canbe no doubt. I must not confuse them with experi-ences which will have to rest on my own observation,or my memory of them. Last evening when the CountChapter 338"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"came from his room he began by asking me questionson legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds ofbusiness. I had spent the day wearily over books, and,simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some ofthe matters I had been examined in at Lincoln’s Inn.There was a certain method in the Count’s inquiries, soI shall try to put them down in sequence. The knowl-edge may somehow or some time be useful to me. First, he asked if a man in England might have twosolicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen ifhe wished, but that it would not be wise to have morethan one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as onlyone could act at a time, and that to change would becertain to militate against his interest. He seemed thor-oughly to understand, and went on to ask if therewould be any practical difficulty in having one man toattend, say, to banking, and another to look after ship-ping, in case local help were needed in a place farfrom the home of the banking solicitor. I asked toexplain more fully, so that I might not by any chancemislead him, so he said, “I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. PeterHawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful ca-thedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys forme through your good self my place at London. Good!Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think itstrange that I have sought the services of one so faroff from London instead of some one resident there,that my motive was that no local interest might beserved save my wish only, and as one of London resi-dence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himselfor friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent,whose labours should be only to my interest. Now,suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods,say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover,might it not be that it could with more ease be doneby consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that certainly it would be most easy, butChapter 339"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"that we solicitors had a system of agency one for theother, so that local work could be done locally oninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, sim-ply placing himself in the hands of one man, couldhave his wishes carried out by him without furthertrouble. “But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct my-self.Is it not so?” “Of course, “ I replied, and “Such is often done bymen of business, who do not like the whole of theiraffairs to be known by any one person.” “Good!” he said,and then went on to ask about themeans of making consignments and the forms to begone through, and of all sorts of difficulties whichmight arise, but by forethought could be guardedagainst. I explained all these things to him to the bestof my ability, and he certainly left me under the im-pression that he would have made a wonderful solici-tor, for there was nothing that he did not think of orforesee. For a man who was never in the country, andwho did not evidently do much in the way of business,his knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When hehad satisfied himself on these points of which he hadspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by thebooks available, he suddenly stood up and said, “Haveyou written since your first letter to our friend Mr.Peter Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that I an-swered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen anyopportunity of sending letters to anybody. “Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying aheavy hand on my shoulder, “write to our friend andto any other, and say, if it will please you, that youshall stay with me until a month from now.” “Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for myheart grew cold at the thought. “I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal. WhenChapter 340"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"your master, employer, what you will, engaged thatsomeone should come on his behalf, it was understoodthat my needs only were to be consulted. I have notstinted. Is it not so?” What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr.Hawkins’ interest, not mine, and I had to think of him,not myself, and besides, while Count Dracula was speak-ing, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing whichmade me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if Iwished it I could have no choice. The Count saw hisvictory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble ofmy face, for he began at once to use them, but in hisown smooth, resistless way. “I pray you, my good young friend, that you willnot discourse of things other than business in yourletters. It will doubtless please your friends to knowthat you are well, and that you look forward to get-ting home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handedme three sheets of note paper and three envelopes.They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and look-ing at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red under-lip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that Ishould be more careful what I wrote, for he would beable to read it. So I determined to write only formalnotes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret,and also to Mina, for to her I could write shorthand,which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When Ihad written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a bookwhilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as hewrote them to some books on his table. Then he tookup my two and placed them with his own, and put byhis writing materials, after which, the instant the doorhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked atthe letters, which were face down on the table. I feltno compunction in doing so for under the circum-stances I felt that I should protect myself in every wayI could.Chapter 341"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington,No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner,Varna. The third was to Coutts & Co., London, and thefourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, BudaPesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I wasjust about to look at them when I saw the door handlemove. I sank back in my seat, having just had time toresume my book before the Count, holding still an-other letter in his hand, entered the room. He took upthe letters on the table and stamped them carefully,and then turning to me, said, “I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work todo in private this evening. You will, I hope, find allthings as you wish.” At the door he turned, and aftera moment’s pause said, “Let me advise you, my dearyoung friend. Nay, let me warn you with all serious-ness, that should you leave these rooms you will notby any chance go to sleep in any other part of thecastle. It is old, and has many memories, and thereare bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned!Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like todo, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms,for your rest will then be safe. But if you be not care-ful in this respect, then,” He finished his speech in agruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if hewere washing them. I quite understood. My only doubtwas as to whether any dream could be more terriblethan the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mys-tery which seemed closing around me.Later.—I endorse the last words written, but this timethere is no doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleepin any place where he is not. I have placed the crucifixover the head of my bed, I imagine that my rest isthus freer from dreams, and there it shall remain. When he left me I went to my room. After a littlewhile, not hearing any sound, I came out and went upthe stone stair to where I could look out towards theChapter 342"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"South. There was some sense of freedom in the vastexpanse, inaccessible though it was to me,as comparedwith the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Lookingout on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and Iseemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were ofthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal exist-ence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start atmy own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horribleimaginings. God knows that there is ground for myterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out overthe beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moon-light till it was almost as light as day. In the soft lightthe distant hills became melted, and the shadows inthe valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The merebeauty seemed to cheer me. There was peace and com-fort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the win-dow my eye was caught by something moving a storeybelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imag-ined, from the order of the rooms, that the windowsof the Count’s own room would look out. The windowat which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned,and though weatherworn, was still complete. But itwas evidently many a day since the case had been there.I drew back behind the stonework, and looked care-fully out. What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from thewindow. I did not see the face, but I knew the man bythe neck and the movement of his back and arms. Inany case I could not mistake the hands which I hadhad some many opportunities of studying. I was atfirst interested and somewhat amused, for it is won-derful how small a matter will interest and amuse aman when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changedto repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowlyemerge from the window and begin to crawl down thecastle wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with hiscloak spreading out around him like great wings. Atfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it wasChapter 343"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect ofshadow, but I kept looking, and it could be no delu-sion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners ofthe stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress ofyears, and by thus using every projection and inequalitymove downwards with considerable speed, just as alizard moves along a wall. What manner of man is this, or what manner of crea-ture, is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread ofthis horrible place overpowering me. I am in fear, inawful fear, and there is no escape for me. I am encom-passed about with terrors that I dare not think of.15 May.—Once more I have seen the count go out inhis lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelongway, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to theleft. He vanished into some hole or window. When hishead had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more,but without avail. The distance was too great to al-low a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left thecastle now, and thought to use the opportunity toexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I wentback to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all thedoors. They were all locked, as I had expected, andthe locks were comparatively new. But I went downthe stone stairs to the hall where I had entered origi-nally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enoughand unhook the great chains. But the door was locked,and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’sroom. I must watch should his door be unlocked, sothat I may get it and escape. I went on to make athorough examination of the various stairs and pas-sages, and to try the doors that opened from them.One or two small rooms near the hall were open, butthere was nothing to see in them except old furniture,dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, Ifound one door at the top of the stairway which,though it seemed locked, gave a little under pressure.Chapter 344"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked,but that the resistance came from the fact that thehinges had fallen somewhat,and the heavy door restedon the floor. Here was an opportunity which I mightnot have again, so I exerted myself,and with manyefforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was nowin a wing of the castle further to the right than therooms I knew and a storey lower down. From thewindows I could see that the suite of rooms lay alongto the south of the castle, the windows of the endroom looking out both west and south.On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was agreat precipice. The castle was built on the corner of agreat rock, so that on three sides it was quite impreg-nable, and great windows were placed here where sling,or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequentlylight and comfort, impossible to a position which hadto be guarded, were secured. To the west was a greatvalley, and then, rising far away, great jagged moun-tain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rockstudded with mountain ash and thorn, whose rootsclung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.This was evidently the portion of the castle occupiedby the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture hadmore an air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moon-light, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabledone to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealthof dust which lay over all and disguised in some mea-sure the ravages of time and moth. My lamp seemed tobe of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I wasglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneli-ness in the place which chilled my heart and made mynerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone inthe rooms which I had come to hate from the presenceof the Count, and after trying a little to school mynerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here Iam, sitting at a little oak table where in old timesChapter 345"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thoughtand many blushes, her ill-spelt love letter, and writ-ing in my diary in shorthand all that has happenedsince I closed it last. It is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my sensesdeceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers oftheir own which mere “modernity” cannot kill.Later: The morning of 16 May.—God preserve my san-ity, for to this I am reduced. Safety and the assuranceof safety are things of the past. Whilst I live on herethere is but one thing to hope for, that I may not gomad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, thensurely it is maddening to think that of all the foulthings that lurk in this hateful place the Count is theleast dreadful to me, that to him alone I can look forsafety, even though this be only whilst I can serve hispurpose. Great God! Merciful God, let me be calm, forout of that way lies madness indeed. I begin to getnew lights on certain things which have puzzled me.Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meantwhen he made Hamlet say, “My tablets! Quick, mytablets! `tis meet that I put it down,” etc., For now,feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as ifthe shock had come which must end in its undoing, Iturn to my diary for repose. The habit of entering ac-curately must help to soothe me. The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at thetime. It frightens me more not when I think of it, forin the future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fearto doubt what he may say! When I had written in my diary and had fortunatelyreplaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.The Count’s warning came into my mind, but I tookpleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was uponme, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings asoutrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wideexpanse without gave a sense of freedom which re-Chapter 346"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"freshed me. I determined not to return tonight to thegloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, ofold, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilsttheir gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk awayin the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couchout of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, Icould look at the lovely view to east and south,andunthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composedmyself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep. Ihope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlinglyreal, so real that now sitting here in the broad, fullsunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believethat it was all sleep. I was not alone. The room was the same, unchangedin any way since I came into it. I could see along thefloor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footstepsmarked where I had disturbed the long accumulationof dust. In the moonlight opposite me were threeyoung women, ladies by their dress and manner. Ithought at the time that I must be dreaming when Isaw them, they threw no shadow on the floor. Theycame close to me, and looked at me for some time,and then whispered together. Two were dark, and hadhigh aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark,piercing eyes, that seemed to be almost red when con-trasted with the pale yellow moon. The other wasfair,as fair as can be, with great masses of golden hairand eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow toknow her face, and to know it in connection with somedreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the momenthow or where. All three had brilliant white teeth thatshone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuouslips. There was something about them that made meuneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadlyfear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire thatthey would kiss me with those red lips. It is not goodto note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’seyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth. They whis-Chapter 347"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"pered together, and then they all three laughed, sucha silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though thesound never could have come through the softness ofhuman lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweet-ness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand.The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the othertwo urged her on. One said, “Go on! You are first, and we shall follow.Yours’ is the right to begin.” The other added, “He is young and strong. There arekisses for us all.” I lay quiet, looking out from under my eyelashes inan agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl ad-vanced and bent over me till I could feel the move-ment of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense,honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through thenerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying thesweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood. I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out andsaw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on herknees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was adeliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling andrepulsive, and as she arched her neck she actuallylicked her lips like an animal, till I could see in themoonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips andon the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.Lower and lower went her head as the lips went belowthe range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fastenon my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear thechurning sound of her tongue as it licked her teethand lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck.Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one’sflesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approachesnearer, nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch ofthe lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat, andthe hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching andpausing there. I closed my eyes in languorous ecstasyand waited, waited with beating heart.Chapter 348"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" But at that instant, another sensation swept throughme as quick as lightning. I was conscious of the pres-ence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in astorm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I sawhis strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair womanand with giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyestransformed with fury, the white teeth champing withrage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion. Butthe Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury,even to the demons of the pit. His eyes were posi-tively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as ifthe flames of hell fire blazed behind them. His facewas deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard likedrawn wires. The thick eyebrows that met over thenose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal.With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the womanfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as thoughhe were beating them back. It was the same imperiousgesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voicewhich, though low and almost in a whisper seemed tocut through the air and then ring in the room he said, “How dare you touch him, any of you? How dareyou cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it? Back, Itell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware how youmeddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turnedto answer him. “You yourself never loved. You neverlove!” On this the other women joined,and such a mirth-less, hard, soulless laughter rang through the roomthat it almost made me faint to hear. It seemed likethe pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face at-tentively, and said in a soft whisper, “Yes, I too canlove. You yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it notso? Well, now I promise you that when I am done withhim you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! Go! Imust awaken him, for there is work to be done.” “Are we to have nothing tonight?” said one of them,Chapter 349"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which hehad thrown upon the floor, and which moved as thoughthere were some living thing within it. For answer henodded his head. One of the women jumped forwardand opened it. If my ears did not deceive me therewas a gasp and a low wail, as of a half smothered child.The women closed round, whilst I was aghast withhorror. But as I looked, they disappeared, and withthem the dreadful bag. There was no door near them,and they could not have passed me without my notic-ing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of themoonlight and pass out through the window, for I couldsee outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment be-fore they entirely faded away. Then the horror overcame me,and I sank down un-conscious.CHAPTER 4Jonathan Harker’s Journal ContinuedI awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt,the Count must have carried me here. I tried to satisfymyself on the subject, but could not arrive at any un-questionable result. To be sure, there were certain smallevidences, such as that my clothes were folded andlaid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watchwas still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed towind it the last thing before going to bed, and manysuch details. But these things are no proof, for theymay have been evidences that my mind was not asusual, and, for some cause or another, I had certainlybeen much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thingI am glad. If it was that the Count carried me here andundressed me, he must have been hurried in his task,Chapter 450"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary wouldhave been a mystery to him which he would not havebrooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As Ilook round this room, although it has been to me sofull of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothingcan be more dreadful than those awful women, whowere, who are, waiting to suck my blood.18 May.—I have been down to look at that room againin daylight, for I must know the truth. When I got tothe doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed.It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb thatpart of the woodwork was splintered. I could see thatthe bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door isfastened from the inside. I fear it was no dream, andmust act on this surmise.19 May.—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Countasked me in the sauvest tones to write three letters,one saying that my work here was nearly done, andthat I should start for home within a few days,anotherthat I was starting on the next morning from the timeof the letter, and the third that I had left the castleand arrived at Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, butfelt that in the present state of things it would bemadness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I amso absolutely in his power. And to refuse would be toexcite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knowsthat I know too much, and that I must not live, lest Ibe dangerous to him. My only chance is to prolongmy opportunities. Something may occur which willgive ma a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes some-thing of that gathering wrath which was manifest whenhe hurled that fair woman from him. He explained tome that posts were few and uncertain, and that mywriting now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.And he assured me with so much impressiveness thathe would countermand the later letters, which wouldChapter 451"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chancewould admit of my prolonging my stay, that to op-pose him would have been to create new suspicion. Itherefore pretended to fall in with his views, and askedhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said, “The firstshould be June 12, the second June 19,and the thirdJune 29.” I know now the span of my life. God help me!28 May.—There is a chance of escape, or at any rate ofbeing able to send word home. A band of Szgany havecome to the castle, and are encamped in the court-yard. These are gipsies. I have notes of them in mybook. They are peculiar to this part of the world,though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the worldover. There are thousands of them in Hungary andTransylvania, who are almost outside all law. They at-tach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar,and call themselves by his name. They are fearless andwithout religion, save superstition, and they talk onlytheir own varieties of the Romany tongue. I shall write some letters home, and shall try to getthem to have them posted. I have already spoken tothem through my window to begin acquaintanceship.They took their hats off and made obeisance and manysigns, which however, I could not understand any morethan I could their spoken language. I have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand,and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate withher. To her I have explained my situation, but withoutthe horrors which I may only surmise. It would shockand frighten her to death were I to expose my heart toher. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shallnot yet know my secret or the extent of my knowl-edge.... I have given the letters. I threw them through theChapter 452"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"bars of my window with a gold piece, and made whatsigns I could to have them posted. The man who tookthem pressed them to his heart and bowed, and thenput them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole backto the study, and began to read. As the Count did notcome in, I have written here.... The Count has come. He sat down beside me, andsaid in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters,“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though Iknow not whence they come, I shall, of course, takecare. See!”—He must have looked at it.—”One is fromyou, and to my friend Peter Hawkins. The other,”—here he caught sight of the strange symbols as heopened the envelope, and the dark look came into hisface, and his eyes blazed wickedly,—”The other is avile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospital-ity! It is not signed. Well! So it cannot matter tous.”And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flameof the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went on, “The letter to Hawkins, that I shall,of course send on, since it is yours. Your letters aresacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that unknow-ingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?”He held out the letter to me, and with a courteousbow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.When he went out of the room I could hear the keyturn softly. A minute later I went over and tried it,and the door was locked. When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietlyinto the room, his coming awakened me, for I hadgone to sleep on the sofa. He was very courteous andvery cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had beensleeping, he said, “So, my friend, you are tired? Getto bed. There is the surest rest. I may not have thepleasure of talk tonight, since there are many laboursto me, but you will sleep, I pray.”Chapter 453"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strangeto say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its owncalms.31 May.—This morning when I woke I thought I wouldprovide myself with some papers and envelopes frommy bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I mightwrite in case I should get an opportunity, but again asurprise, again a shock! Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all mynotes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel,my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful tome were I once outside the castle. I sat and ponderedawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and Imade search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobewhere I had placed my clothes. The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and alsomy overcoat and rug. I could find no trace of themanywhere. This looked like some new scheme of vil-lainy....17 June.—This morning, as I was sitting on the edgeof my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without acrackling of whips and pounding and scraping of horses’feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard. Withjoy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into theyard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eightsturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak,with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheep-skin, and high boots. They had also their long stavesin hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend andtry and join them through the main hall, as I thoughtthat way might be opened for them. Again a shock,my door was fastened on the outside. Then I ran to the window and cried to them. Theylooked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just thenthe “hetman” of the Szgany came out, and seeing thempointing to my window, said something, at which theyChapter 454"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or ago-nized entreaty, would make them even look at me.They resolutely turned away. The leiter-wagons con-tained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope.These were evidently empty by the ease with whichthe Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance asthey were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a greatheap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were givensome money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck,lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards,I heard the crackling of their whips die away in thedistance.24 June.—Last night the Count left me early, and lockedhimself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran upthe winding stair, and looked out of the window, whichopened South. I thought I would watch for the Count,for there is something going on. The Szgany are quar-tered somewhere in the castle and are doing work ofsome kind. I know it, for now and then, I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and,whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthlessvillainy. I had been at the window somewhat less than half anhour, when I saw something coming out of the Count’swindow. I drew back and watched carefully, and sawthe whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me tofind that he had on the suit of clothes which I hadworn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoul-der the terrible bag which I had seen the women takeaway. There could be no doubt as to his quest, and inmy garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil,that he will allow others to see me, as they think, sothat he may both leave evidence that I have been seenin the towns or villages posting my own letters, andthat any wickedness which he may do shall by theChapter 455"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"local people be attributed to me. It makes me rage to think that this can go on, andwhilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but with-out that protection of the law which is even a criminal’sright and consolation. I thought I would watch for the Count’s return, andfor a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then Ibegan to notice that there were some quaint littlespecks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They werelike the tiniest grains of dust,and they whirled roundand gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. Iwatched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort ofcalm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure ina more comfortable position, so that I could enjoymore fully the aerial gambolling. Something made me start up, a low, piteous howlingof dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which washidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in myears, and the floating moats of dust to take new shapesto the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I feltmyself struggling to awake to some call of my in-stincts. Nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer thecall. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust. The moon-beams seemed to quiver as they went by me into themass of gloom beyond. More and more they gatheredtill they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And thenI started, broad awake and in full possession of mysenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradu-ally materialised from the moonbeams, were thosethree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, wherethere was no moonlight, and where the lamp was burn-ing brightly. When a couple of hours had passed I heard some-thing stirring in the Count’s room, something like aChapter 456"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"sharp wail quickly suppressed. And then there was si-lence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With abeating heart, I tried the door, but I was locked in myprison, and could do nothing. I sat down and simplycried. As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without,the agonised cry of a woman. I rushed to the window,and throwing it up, peered between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair,holding her hands over her heart as one distressed withrunning. She was leaning against the corner of thegateway. When she saw my face at the window shethrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice ladenwith menace, “Monster, give me my child!” She threw herself on her knees,and raising up herhands, cried the same words in tones which wrung myheart. Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, andabandoned herself to all the violences of extravagantemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and thoughI could not see her, I could hear the beating of hernaked hands against the door. Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, Iheard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, me-tallic whisper. His call seemed to be answered from farand wide by the howling of wolves. Before many min-utes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-updam when liberated, through the wide entrance intothe courtyard. There was no cry from the woman, and the howlingof the wolves was but short. Before long they streamedaway singly, licking their lips. I could not pity her, for I knew now what had be-come of her child, and she was better dead. What shall I do? What can I do? How can I escapefrom this dreadful thing of night, gloom, and fear?25 June.—No man knows till he has suffered from thenight how sweet and dear to his heart and eye theChapter 457"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"morning can be. When the sun grew so high this morn-ing that it struck the top of the great gateway oppo-site my window, the high spot which it touched seemedto me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous gar-ment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the courage ofthe day is upon me. Last night one of my post-datedletters went to post, the first of that fatal series whichis to blot out the very traces of my existence from theearth. Let me not think of it. Action! It has always been at night-time that I have beenmolested or threatened, or in some way in danger orin fear. I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he maybe awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get intohis room! But there is no possible way. The door isalways locked, no way for me. Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where hisbody has gone why may not another body go? I haveseen him myself crawl from his window. Why shouldnot I imitate him, and go in by his window? The chancesare desperate, but my need is more desperate still. Ishall risk it. At the worst it can only be death, and aman’s death is not a calf’s, and the dreaded Hereaftermay still be open to me. God help me in my task!Goodbye, Mina, if I fail. Goodbye, my faithful friendand second father. Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God help-ing me, have come safely back to this room. I mustput down every detail in order. I went whilst my cour-age was fresh straight to the window on the southside, and at once got outside on this side. The stonesare big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by pro-cess of time been washed away between them. I tookoff my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.Chapter 458"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"I looked down once, so as to make sure that a suddenglimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me,but after that kept my eyes away from it. I know prettywell the direction and distance of the Count’s window,and made for it as well as I could, having regard to theopportunities available. I did not feel dizzy, I supposeI was too excited, and the time seemed ridiculouslyshort till I found myself standing on the window silland trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agi-tation, however, when I bent down and slid feet fore-most in through the window. Then I looked around forthe Count, but with surprise and gladness, made a dis-covery. The room was empty! It was barely furnishedwith odd things, which seemed to have never beenused. The furniture was something the same style as thatin the south rooms, and was covered with dust. Ilooked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and Icould not find it anywhere. The only thing I found wasa great heap of gold in one corner, gold of all kinds,Roman, and British, and Austrian,and Hungarian,andGreek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust,as though it had lain long in the ground. None of itthat I noticed was less than three hundred years old.There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled,but all of them old and stained. At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I triedit, for, since I could not find the key of the room orthe key of the outer door, which was the main objectof my search, I must make further examination, or allmy efforts would be in vain. It was open, and ledthrough a stone passage to a circular stairway, whichwent steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went for thestairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in theheavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tun-nel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sicklyodour, the odour of old earth newly turned. As I wentChapter 459"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier.At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar,and found myself in an old ruined chapel, which hadevidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was bro-ken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults,but the ground had recently been dug over, and theearth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly thosewhich had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made a search overevery inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. Iwent down even into the vaults, where the dim lightstruggled,although to do so was a dread to my verysoul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing ex-cept fragments of old coffins and piles of dust. In thethird, however, I made a discovery. There, in one of the great boxes, of which there werefifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!He was either dead or asleep. I could not say which,for eyes were open and stony, but without the glassi-ness of death,and the cheeks had the warmth of lifethrough all their pallor. The lips were as red as ever.But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath,no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life,but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for theearthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holeshere and there. I thought he might have the keys onhim, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes,and in them dead though they were, such a look ofhate, though unconscious of me or my presence, thatI fled from the place, and leaving the Count’s room bythe window, crawled again up the castle wall. Regain-ing my room, I threw myself panting upon the bedand tried to think.29 June.—Today is the date of my last letter, and theCount has taken steps to prove that it was genuine,Chapter 460"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"for again I saw him leave the castle by the same win-dow, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethalweapon, that I might destroy him. But I fear that noweapon wrought along by man’s hand would have anyeffect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for Ifeared to see those weird sisters. I came back to thelibrary, and read there till I fell asleep. I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me asgrimly as a man could look as he said, “Tomorrow, myfriend, we must part. You return to your beautiful En-gland, I to some work which may have such an endthat we may never meet. Your letter home has beendespatched. Tomorrow I shall not be here, but all shallbe ready for your journey. In the morning come theSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, andalso come some Slovaks. When they have gone, mycarriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to theBorgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina toBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of youat Castle Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincer-ity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the wordto write it in connection with such a monster, so Iasked him point-blank, “Why may I not go tonight?” “Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are awayon a mission.” “But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get awayat once.” He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile thatI knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.He said, “And your baggage?” “I do not care about it. I can send for it some othertime.” The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesywhich made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real, “YouEnglish have a saying which is close to my heart, forits spirit is that which rules our boyars, ‘Welcome theChapter 461"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"coming, speed the parting guest.’ Come with me, mydear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait in myhouse against your will, though sad am I at yourgoing,and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!” Witha stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me downthe stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.“Hark!” Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. Itwas almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising ofhis hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seemsto leap under the baton of the conductor. After a pauseof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to thedoor, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked theheavy chains, and began to draw it open. To my intense astonishment I saw that it was un-locked. Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could seeno key of any kind. As the door began to open, the howling of the wolveswithout grew louder and angrier. Their red jaws, withchamping teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as theyleaped, came in through the opening door. I knew thanthat to struggle at the moment against the Count wasuseless. With such allies as these at his command, Icould do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and onlythe Count’s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struckme that this might be the moment and means of mydoom. I was to be given to the wolves, and at my owninstigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in theidea great enough for the Count, and as the last chanceI cried out, “Shut the door! I shall wait till morning.”And I covered my face with my hands to hide my tearsof bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threwthe door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoedthrough the hall as they shot back into their places.In silence we returned to the library, and after a minuteor two I went to my own room. The last I saw of CountChapter 462"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a redlight of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile thatJudas in hell might be proud of. When I was in my room and about to lie down, Ithought I heard a whispering at my door. I went to itsoftly and listened. Unless my ears deceived me, I heardthe voice of the Count. “Back! Back to your own place! Your time is not yetcome. Wait! Have patience! Tonight is mine. Tomor-row night is yours!” There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in arage I threw open the door, and saw without the threeterrible women licking their lips. As I appeared, theyall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away. I came back to my room and threw myself on myknees. It is then so near the end? Tomorrow! Tomor-row! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!30 June.—These may be the last words I ever write inthis diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when Iwoke threw myself on my knees, for I determined thatif Death came he should find me ready. At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knewthat the morning had come. Then came the welcomecockcrow, and I felt that I was safe. With a glad heart,I opened the door and ran down the hall. I had seenthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was be-fore me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, Iunhooked the chains and threw back the massive bolts. But the door would not move. Despair seized me. Ipulled and pulled at the door, and shook it till, mas-sive as it was, it rattled in its casement. I could seethe bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the Count. Then a wild desire took me to obtain the key at anyrisk,and I determined then and there to scale the wallagain, and gain the Count’s room. He might kill me,but death now seemed the happier choice of evils.Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, andChapter 463"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"scrambled down the wall,as before, into the Count’sroom. It was empty, but that was as I expected. I couldnot see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained.I went through the door in the corner and down thewinding stair and along the dark passage to the oldchapel. I knew now well enough where to find themonster I sought. The great box was in the same place, close againstthe wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down,but with the nails ready in their places to be ham-mered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raisedthe lid, and laid it back against the wall. And then Isaw something which filled my very soul with horror.There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth hadbeen half restored. For the white hair and moustachewere changed to dark iron-grey. The cheeks were fuller,and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath. Themouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were goutsof fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of themouth and ran down over the chin and neck. Even thedeep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh,for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. Itseemed as if the whole awful creature were simplygorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhaustedwith his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him,and everysense in me revolted at the contact, but I had to search,or I was lost. The coming night might see my ownbody a banquet in a similar war to those horrid three.I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of thekey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. Therewas a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemedto drive me mad. This was the being I was helping totransfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries tocome he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiatehis lust for blood, and create a new and ever-wideningcircle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.Chapter 464"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desirecame upon me to rid the world of such a monster.There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized ashovel which the workmen had been using to fill thecases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge down-ward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the headturned, and the eyes fell upon me, with all their blazeof basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyze me,and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced fromthe face, merely making a deep gash above the fore-head. The shovel fell from my hand across the box,andas I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught theedge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the hor-rid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was ofthe bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grinof malice which would have held its own in the neth-ermost hell. I thought and thought what should be my next move,but my brain seemed on fire,and I waited with a de-spairing feeling growing over me. As I waited I heardin the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices com-ing closer, and through their song the rolling of heavywheels and the cracking of whips. The Szgany and theSlovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming.With a last look around and at the box which con-tained the vile body, I ran from the place and gainedthe Count’s room, determined to rush out at the mo-ment the door should be opened. With strained ears, Ilistened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the keyin the great lock and the falling back of the heavydoor. There must have been some other means of en-try, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet trampingand dying away in some passage which sent up a clang-ing echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault,where I might find the new entrance, but at the mo-ment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, andthe door to the winding stair blew to with a shockChapter 465"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran topush it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I wasagain a prisoner, and the net of doom was closinground me more closely. As I write there is in the passage below a sound ofmany tramping feet and the crash of weights being setdown heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freightof earth. There was a sound of hammering. It is thebox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feettramping again along the hall, with with many otheridle feet coming behind them. The door is shut, the chains rattle. There is a grind-ing of the key in the lock. I can hear the key with-drawn, then another door opens and shuts. I hear thecreaking of lock and bolt. Hark! In the courtyard and down the rocky way theroll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the cho-rus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance. I am alone in the castle with those horrible women.Faugh! Mina is a woman, and there is nought in com-mon. They are devils of the Pit! I shall not remain alone with them. I shall try toscale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted.I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want itlater. I may find a way from this dreadful place. And then away for home! Away to the quickest andnearest train! Away from the cursed spot, from thiscursed land, where the devil and his children still walkwith earthly feet!

I wrote you twice since we parted, andyour last letter was only your second. Besides, I havenothing to tell you. There is really nothing to interestyou. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a greatdeal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in thepark. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose itwas the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some-one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood. He often comes to see us,Chapter 568"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"and he and Mamma get on very well together, theyhave so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just do foryou, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. Heis an excellant parti, being handsome, well off, and ofgood birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy!He is only nine-and twenty, and he has an immenselunatic asylum all under his own care. Mr. Holmwoodintroduced him to me, and he called here to see us,and often comes now. I think he is one of the mostresolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm. Heseems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what awonderful power he must have over his patients. Hehas a curious habit of looking one straight in the face,as if trying to read one’s thoughts. He tries this onvery much with me, but I flatter myself he has got atough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and Ican tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you moretrouble than you can well fancy if you have never triedit. He say that I afford him a curious psychological study,and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, takesufficient interest in dress to be able to describe thenew fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, butnever mind. Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out, Mina, we have told all our secretsto each other since we were children. We have slepttogether and eaten together, and laughed and criedtogether, and now, though I have spoken, I would liketo speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I lovehim. I am blushing as I write, for although I think heloves me, he has not told me so in words. But, oh,Mina, I love him. I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire un-dressing, as we used to sit, and I would try to tell youwhat I feel. I do not know how I am writing this evento you.

L.LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY24 MayMy dearest Mina, Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweetletter. It was so nice to be able to tell you and to haveyour sympathy. My dear, it never rains but it pours.How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall betwenty in September, and yet I never had a proposaltill today, not a real proposal, and today I had three.Just fancy! Three proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful!I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poorfellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don’t knowwhat to do with myself. And three proposals! But, forgoodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they wouldbe getting all sorts of extravagant ideas, and imagin-ing themselves injured and slighted if in their veryfirst day at home they did not get six at least. Somegirls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are en-gaged and are going to settle down soon soberly intoold married women, can despise vanity. Well, I musttell you about the three, but you must keep it a se-cret, dear, from every one except, of course, Jonathan.You will tell him, because I would, if I were in yourplace, certainly tell Arthur. A woman ought to tellher husband everything. Don’t you think so, dear? AndI must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives,Chapter 570"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"to be quite as fair as they are. And women, I am afraid,are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch.I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic asylumman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. Hewas very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to allsorts of little things, and remembered them, but healmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, whichmen don’t generally do when they are cool, and thenwhen he wanted to appear at ease he kept playingwith a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. Hespoke to me, Mina, very straightfordwardly. He toldme how dear I was to him, though he had known me solittle, and what his life would be with me to help andcheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy hewould be if I did not care for him, but when he saw mecry he said he was a brute and would not add to mypresent trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I couldlove him in time, and when I shook my head his handstrembled, and then with some hesitation he asked meif I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely,saying that he did not want to wring my confidencefrom me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heartwas free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felta sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. Ionly told him that much, and then he stood up, andhe looked very strong and very grave as he took bothmy hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy,and that If I ever wanted a friend I must count him oneof my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying, and you must ex-cuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed tois all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t atall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow,whom you know loves you honestly, going away andlooking all broken hearted, and to know that, no mat-ter what he may say at the moment, you are passingChapter 571"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, Ifeel so miserable, though I am so happy.Evening. Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits thanwhen I left off, so I can go on telling you about theday. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch. He issuch a nice fellow,and American from Texas, and helooks so young and so fresh that it seems almost im-possible that he has been to so many places and hassuch adventures. I sympathize with poor Desdemonawhen she had such a stream poured in her ear, even bya black man. I suppose that we women are such cow-ards that we think a man will save us from fears, andwe marry him. I know now what I would do if I were aman and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don’t,for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, andArthur never told any, and yet... . My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincy P. Mor-ris found me alone. It seems that a man always doesfind a girl alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twiceto make a chance, and I helping him all I could, I amnot ashamed to say it now. I must tell you beforehandthat Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang, that is tosay, he never does so to strangers or before them, forhe is really well educated and has exquisite manners,but he found out that it amused me to hear him talkAmerican slang,and whenever I was present, and therewas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things.I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fitsexactly into whatever else he has to say. But this is away slang has. I do not know myself if I shall everspeak slang. I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I havenever heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked ashappy and jolly as he could, but I could see all theChapter 572"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"same that he was very nervous. He took my hand inhis, and said ever so sweetly... . “Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulatethe fixin’s of your little shoes, but I guess if you waittill you find a man that is you will go join them sevenyoung women with the lamps when you quit. Won’tyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go downthe long road together, driving in double harness?” Well, he did look so hood humoured and so jolly thatit didn’t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poorDr. Seward. So I said, as lightly as I could, that I didnot know anything of hitching, and that I wasn’t bro-ken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he hadspoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he hadmade a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momen-tous, and occasion for him, I would forgive him. Hereally did look serious when he was saying it, and Icouldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he wasnumber Two in one day. And then, my dear, before Icould say a word he began pouring out a perfect tor-rent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul atmy feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall neveragain think that a man must be playful always, andnever earnest, because he is merry at times. I supposehe saw something in my face which checked him, forhe suddenly stopped,and said with a sort of manlyfervour that I could have loved him for if I had beenfree... . “Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know. I shouldnot be here speaking to you as I am now if I did notbelieve you clean grit, right through to the very depthsof your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another,is there any one else that you care for? And if there isI’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but willbe, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.” My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we womenare so little worthy of them? Here was I almost mak-ing fun of this great hearted, true gentleman. I burstChapter 573"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"into tears, I am afraid, my dear, you will think this avery sloppy letter in more ways than one, and I reallyfelt very badly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as manyas want her, and save all this trouble? But this isheresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that,though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Mor-ris’ brave eyes, and I told him out straight... . “Yes, there is some one I love, though he has nottold me yet that he even loves me.” I was right tospeak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into hisface, and he put out both his hands and took mine, Ithink I put them into his, and said in a hearty way... . “That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late fora chance of winning you than being in time for anyother girl in the world. Don’t cry, my dear. If it’s forme, I’m a hard nut to crack, and I take it standing up.If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well,he’d better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal withme. Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made mea friend, and that’s rarer than a lover, it’s more selfishanyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty lonelywalk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you giveme one kiss? It’ll be something to keep off the dark-ness now and then. You can, you know, if you like, forthat other good fellow, or you could not love him,hasn’t spoken yet.” That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweetof him, and noble too, to a rival, wasn’t it? And he sosad, so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as helooked down into my face, I am afraid I was blushingvery much, he said, “Little girl, I hold your hand, andyou’ve kissed me, and if these things don’t make usfriends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweethonesty to me, and goodbye.” He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, wentstraight out of the room without looking back, with-Chapter 574"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"out a tear or a quiver or a pause, and I am crying likea baby.

Whitby.—Lucy met me at the station, look-ing sweeter and lovlier than ever, and we drove up tothe house at the Crescent in which they have rooms.This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runsthrough a deep valley, which broadens out as it comesChapter 677"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, withhigh piers, through which the view seems somehowfurther away than it really is. The valley is beautifullygreen, and it is so steep that when you are on the highland on either side you look right across it, unlessyou are near enough to see down. The houses of theold town—the side away from us, are all red-roofed,and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like thepictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town isthe ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by theDanes, and which is the scene of part of “Marmion,”where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a mostnoble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful andromantic bits. There is a legend that a white lady isseen in one of the windows. Between it and the townthere is another church, the parish one, round whichis a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to mymind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right overthe town, and has a full view of the harbour and all upthe bay to where the headland called Kettlenessstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply overthe harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, andsome of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the gravesstretches out over the sandy pathway far below. Thereare walks, with seats beside them, through the church-yard, and people go and sit there all day long lookingat the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here often myself and work. In-deed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee,and listening to the talk of three old men who aresitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day butsit here and talk. The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, onelong granite wall stretching out into the sea, with acurve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of whichis a lighthouse. A heavy seawall runs along outside ofit. On the near side, the seawall makes an elbow crooked78Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Betweenthe two piers there is a narrow opening into theharbour, which then suddenly widens. It is nice at high water, but when the tide is out itshoals away to nothing,and there is merely the streamof the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rockshere and there. Outside the harbour on this side thererises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp ofwhich runs straight out from behind the south light-house. At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, whichswings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful soundon the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bellsare heard out at sea. I must ask the old man aboutthis. He is coming this way.... He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, forhis face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that hewas a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Water-loo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very scepticalperson, for when I asked him about the bells at seaand the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely, “I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them thingsbe all wore out. Mind, I don’t say that they never was,but I do say that they wasn’t in my time. They be allvery well for comers and trippers, an’ the like, but notfor a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks fromYork and Leeds that be always eatin’cured herrin’s anddrinkin’ tea an’ lookin’ out to buy cheap jet wouldcreed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be bothered tellin’lies to them, even the newspapers, which is full offool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn inter-esting things from, so I asked him if he would mindtelling me something about the whale fishing in theold days. He was just settling himself to begin whenthe clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to getup, and said,79Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" “I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like to be kept waitin’ when the teais ready, for it takes me time to crammle aboon thegrees, for there be a many of ‘em, and miss, I lackbelly-timber sairly by the clock.” He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, aswell as he could, down the steps. The steps are a greatfeature on the place. They lead from the town to thechurch, there are hundreds of them, I do not knowhow many, and they wind up in a delicate curve. Theslope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk upand down them. I think they must originally have had something todo with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy wentout, visiting with her mother, and as they were onlyduty calls, I did not go.1 August.—I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, andwe had a most interesting talk with my old friend andthe two others who always come and join him. He isevidently the Sir Oracle of them,and I should thinkmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and down faces every-body. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies them,andthen takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawnfrock. She has got a beautiful colour since she hasbeen here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time incoming and sitting near her when we sat down. She isso sweet with old people, I think they all fell in lovewith her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed anddid not contradict her, but gave me double share in-stead. I got him on the subject of the legends , and hewent off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try toremember it and put it down. “It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that’swhat it be and nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-80Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ghosts an’ bar-guests an’ bogles an’ all anent them isonly fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women a’belderin’. Theybe nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs an’warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome berk-bodies an’ railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s,an’ to get folks to do somethin’ that they don’t otherincline to. It makes me ireful to think o’ them. Why,it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paperan’ preachin’ them ou t of pulpits, does want to becuttin’ them on the tombstones. Look here all aroundyou in what airt ye will. All them steans, holdin’ uptheir heads as well as they can out of their pride, isacant, simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ thelies wrote on them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred tothe memory’ wrote on all of them, an’ yet in nigh halfof them there bean’t no bodies at all, an’ the memoriesof them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much lesssacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind oranother! My gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment atthe Day of Judgment when they come tumblin’ up intheir death-sarks, all jouped together an’ trying’ todrag their tombsteans with them to prove how goodthey was, some of them trimmlin’ an’ dithering, withtheir hands that dozzened an’ slippery from lyin’ inthe sea that they can’t even keep their gurp o’ them.” I could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air andthe way in which he looked round for the approval ofhis cronies that he was “showing off,” so I put in aword to keep him going. “Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely thesetombstones are not all wrong?” “Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong,savin’ where they make out the people too good, forthere be folk that do think a balm-bowl be like thesea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be onlylies. Now look you here. You come here a stranger, an’you see this kirkgarth.” I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I81Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it hadsomething to do with the church. He went on, “And you consate that all these steansbe aboon folk that be haped here, snod an’ snog?” Iassented again. “Then that be just where the lie comesin. Why, there be scores of these laybeds that be toomas old Dun’s ‘baccabox on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions, and they alllaughed. “And, my gog! How could they be other-wise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank,read it!” I went over and read, “Edward Spencelagh, mastermariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres,April, 1854, age 30.” When I came back Mr. Swaleswent on, “Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here?Murdered off the coast of Andres! An’ you consatedhis body lay under! Why, I could name ye a dozenwhose bones lie in the Greenland seas above,” hepointed northwards, “or where the currants may havedrifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can,with your young eyes, read the small print of the liesfrom here. This Braithwaite Lowery, I knew his father,lost in the Lively off Greenland in ‘20, or AndrewWoodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or JohnPaxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later, or oldJohn Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me,drowned in the Gulf of Finland in ‘50. Do ye think thatall these men will have to make a rush to Whitby whenthe trumpet sounds? I have me antherums aboot it! Itell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ andjostlin’ one another that way that it ‘ud be like a fightup on the ice in the old days, when we’d be at oneanother from daylight to dark, an’ tryin’ to tie up ourcuts by the aurora borealis.” This was evidently localpleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and hiscronies joined in with gusto. “But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for82Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"you start on the assumption that all the poor people,or their spirits, will have to take their tombstoneswith them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think thatwill be really necessary?” “Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer methat, miss!” “To please their relatives, I suppose.” “To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he saidwith intense scorn. “How will it pleasure their rela-tives to know that lies is wrote over them, and thateverybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laiddown as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close tothe edge of the cliff. “Read the lies on that thruff-stone,” he said. The letters were upside down to me from where I sat,but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant overand read, “Sacred to the memory of George Canon,who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, onJuly 29,1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness. Thistomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearlybeloved son.‘He was the only son of his mother, andshe was a widow.’ Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see any-thing very funny in that!” She spoke her comment verygravely and somewhat severely. “Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha-ha! But that’s becauseye don’t gawm the sorrowin’mother was a hell-cat thathated him because he was acrewk’d, a regular lamiterhe was, an’ he hated her so that he committed suicidein order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put onhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with anold musket that they had for scarin’ crows with. ‘twarn’tfor crows then, for it brought the clegsand the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off therocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’veoften heard him say masel’ that he hoped he’d go tohell, for his mother was so pious that she’d be sure togo to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where she83Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate,” he hammered itwith his stick as he spoke, “a pack of lies? And won’tit make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin’ utthe grees with the tompstean balanced on his hump,and asks to be took as evidence!” I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned theconversation as she said, rising up, “Oh, why did youtell us of this? It is my favorite seat, and I cannotleave it, and now I find I must go on sitting over thegrave of a suicide.” “That won’t harm ye, my pretty, an’ it may make poorGeordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin’ on hislap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve sat here off an’ on fornigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me no harm.Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’lie there either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scartwhen ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and theplace as bare as a stubble-field. There’s the clock, and’Imust gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off he hobbled. Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautifulbefore us that we took hands as we sat, and she toldme all over again about Arthur and their coming mar-riage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven’theard from Jonathan for a whole month. The same day. I came up here alone, for I am verysad. There was no letter for me. I hope there cannotbe anything the matter with Jonathan. The clock hasjust struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over thetown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, andsometimes singly. They run right up the Esk and dieaway in the curve of the valley. To my left the view iscut off by a black line of roof of the old house next tothe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in thefields away behind me, and there is a clatter of don-keys’ hoofs up the paved road below. The band on thepier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and furtheralong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a84Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"back street. Neither of the bands hears the other, butup here I hear and see them both. I wonder whereJonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he werehere.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY5 June.—The case of Renfield grows more interestingthe more I get to understand the man. He has certainqualities very largely developed, selfishness, secrecy,and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, butwhat it is I do not know. His redeeming quality is alove of animals, though, indeed, he has such curiousturns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnor-mally cruel. His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at presentsuch a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate.To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury,as I expected, but took the matter in simple serious-ness. He thought for a moment, and then said, “May Ihave three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, Isaid that would do. I must watch him.18 June.—He has turned his mind now to spiders,andhas got several very big fellows in a box. He keepsfeeding them his flies, and the number of the latter isbecoming sensibly diminished, although he has usedhalf his food in attracting more flies from outside tohis room.1 July.—His spiders are now becoming as great a nui-sance as his flies, and today I told him that he mustget rid of them. He looked very sad at this, so I said that he mustsome of them, at all events. He cheerfully acquiescedin this, and I gave him the same time as before for85Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when ahorrid blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzedinto the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for afew moments between his finger and thumb, and be-fore I knew what he was going to do, put it in hismouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that itwas very good and very wholesome, that it was life,strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea,or the rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets ridof his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, forhe keeps a little notebook in which he is always jot-ting down something. whole pages of it are filled withmasses of figures, generally single numbers added upin batches, and then the totals added in batches again,as though he were focussing some account, as the au-ditors put it.8 July.—There is a method in his madness,and the ru-dimentary idea in my mind is growing. It will be awhole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebra-tion, you will have to give the wall to your consciousbrother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that Imight notice if there were any change. Things remainas they were except that he has parted with some ofhis pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow, and has alreadypartially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, foralready the spiders have diminshed. Those that do re-main, however, are well fed, for he still brings in theflies by tempting them with his food.19 July—We are progressing. My friend has now awhole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders arealmost obliterated. When I came in he ran to me andsaid he wanted to ask me a great favour, a very, very86Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"great favour. And as he spoke, he fawned on me like adog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort ofrapture in his voice and bearing, “A kitten, a nice,little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, andteach, and feed, and feed, and feed!” I was not unprepared for this request, for I had no-ticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vi-vacity, but I did not care that his pretty family oftame sparrows should be wiped out in the same man-ner as the flies and spiders. So I said I would see aboutit, and asked him if he would not rather have a catthan a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered, “Oh, yes,I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest youshould refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kit-ten, would they?” I shook my head, and said that at present I feared itwould not be possible, but that I would see about it.His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it,for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look whichmeant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidalmaniac. I shall test him with his present craving andsee how it will work out, then I shall know more.10 pm.—I have visited him again and found him sit-ting in a corner brooding. When I came in he threwhimself on his knees before me and implored me to lethim have a cat, that his salvation depended upon it. I was firm, however, and told him that he could nothave it, whereupon he went without a word, and satdown, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I hadfound him. I shall see him in the morning early.20 July.—Visited Renfield very early, before attendantwent his rounds. Found him up and humming a tune.He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, inthe window, and was manifestly beginning his fly catch-87Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ing again, and beginning it cheerfully and with a goodgrace. I looked around for his birds,and not seeingthem,asked him where they were. He replied, withoutturning round, that they had all flown away. Therewere a few feathers about the room and on his pillowa drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told thekeeper to report to me if there were anything oddabout him during the day.11 am.—The attendant has just been to see me to saythat Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged awhole lot of feathers. “My belief is, doctor,” he said,“that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took andate them raw!”11 pm.—I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight,enough to make even him sleep, and took away hispocketbook to look at it. The thought that has beenbuzzing about my brain lately is complete, and thetheory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shallhave to invent a new classification for him, and callhim a zoophagous (life-eating) maniac. What he de-sires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he haslaid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. Hegave many flies to one spider and many spiders to onebird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds.What would have been his later steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the ex-periment. It might be done if there were only a suffi-cient cause. Men sneered at vivisection, and yet lookat its results today! Why not advance science in itsmost difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of thebrain? Had I even the secret of one such mind, did I holdthe key to the fancy of even one lunatic, I might ad-vance my own branch of science to a pitch compared88Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’sbrain knowledge would be as nothing. If only therewere a sufficient cause! I must not think too much ofthis, or I may be tempted. A good cause might turnthe scale with me, for may not I too be of an excep-tional brain, congenitally? How well the man reasoned. Lunatics always do withintheir own scope. I wonder at how many lives he valuesa man, or if at only one. He has closed the accountmost accurately, and today begun a new record. Howmany of us begin a new record with each day of ourlives? To me it seems only yesterday that my whole lifeended with my new hope, and that truly I began a newrecord. So it shall be until the Great Recorder sums meup and closes my ledger account with a balance toprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor canI be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours,but I must only wait on hopeless and work. Work! Work! If I could have as strong a cause as my poor madfriend there, a good, unselfish cause to make me work,that would be indeed happiness.MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL26 July.—I am anxious,and it soothes me to expressmyself here. It is like whispering to one’s self and lis-tening at the same time. And there is also somethingabout the shorthand symbols that makes it differentfrom writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and aboutJonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time,and was very concerned, but yesterday dear Mr.Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter fromhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and hesaid the enclosed had just been received. It is only aline dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is juststarting for home. That is not like Jonathan. I do not89Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy , although she is so well, has latelytaken to her old habit of walking in her sleep. Hermother has spoken to me about it, and we have de-cided that I am to lock the door of our room everynight. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers al-ways go out on roofs of houses and along the edges ofcliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over witha despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, andshe tells me that her husband, Lucy’s father, had thesame habit, that he would get up in the night anddress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is al-ready planning out her dresses and how her house isto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do thesame, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a verysimple way, and shall have to try to make both endsmeet. Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, onlyson of Lord Godalming, is coming up here very shortly,as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not verywell, and I think dear Lucy is counting the momentstill he comes. She wants to take him up in the seat onthe churchyard cliff and show him the beauty ofWhitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her.She will be all right when he arrives.27 July.—No news from Jonathan. I am getting quiteuneasy about him, though why I should I do not know,but I do wish that he would write, if it were only asingle line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each nightI am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortu-nately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold.But still, the anxiety and the perpetually being awak-ened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting ner-vous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health90Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called toRing to see his father, who has been taken seriouslyill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, butit does not touch her looks. She is a trifle stouter,and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost theanemic look which she had. I pray it will all last.3 August.—Another week gone by, and no news fromJonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I haveheard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely wouldhave written. I look at that last letter of his, but some-how it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him,and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week,but there is an odd concentration about her which Ido not understand, even in her sleep she seems to bewatching me. She tries the door, and finding it locked,goes about the room searching for the key.6 August.—Another three days, and no news. This sus-pense is getting dreadful. If I only knew where towrite to or where to go to, I should feel easier. But noone has heard a word of Jonathan since that last let-ter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwisewell. Last night was very threatening, and the fisher-men say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watchit and learn the weather signs. Today is a gray day,and the sun as I write is hiddenin thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything isgray except the green grass, which seems like emeraldamongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged withthe sunburst at the far edge, hang over the gray sea,into which the sandpoints stretch like gray figures.The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandyflats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting in-land. The horizon is lost in a gray mist. All vastness,the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a91Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"‘brool’ over the sea that sounds like some passage ofdoom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there,sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem ‘menlike trees walking’. The fishing boats are racing forhome, and rise and dip in the ground swell as theysweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Herecomes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me,and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that hewants to talk. I have been quite touched by the change in the poorold man. When he sat down beside me, he said in avery gentle way, “I want to say something to you,miss.” I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor oldwrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully. So he said, leaving his hand in mine, “I’m afraid, mydeary, that I must have shocked you by all the wickedthings I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like,for weeks past, but I didn’t mean them, and I want yeto remember that when I’m gone. We aud folks that bedaffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’taltogether like to think of it, and we don’t want tofeel scart of it, and that’s why I’ve took to makin’ lightof it, so that I’d cheer up my own heart a bit. But,Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a bit,only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time mustbe nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred yearsis too much for any man to expect. And I’m so nigh itthat the Aud Man is already whettin’ his scythe. Yesee, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all atonce. The chafts will wag as they be used to. Someday soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpetfor me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my deary!”—forhe saw that I was crying—”if he should come this verynight I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be,after all, only a waitin’ for somethin’ else than whatwe’re doin’, and death be all that we can rightly de-92Chapter 6"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"pend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, mydeary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we belookin’ and wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out overthe sea that’s bringin’ with it loss and wreck, and soredistress, and sad hearts. Look! Look!” he cried sud-denly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoastbeyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smellslike death. It’s in the air. I feel it comin’. Lord, makeme answer cheerful, when my call comes!” He held uphis arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth movedas though he were praying. After a few minutes’ si-lence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessedme, and said goodbye, and hobbled off. It all touchedme, and upset me very much. I was glad when the coastguard came along, with hisspyglass under his arm. He stopped to talk with me, ashe always does, but all the time kept looking at astrange ship. “I can’t make her out,” he said. “She’s a Russian, bythe look of her. But she’s knocking about in the queer-est way. She doesn’t know her mind a bit. She seems tosee the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to runup north in the open, or to put in here. Look thereagain! She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’tmind the hand on the wheel, changes about with ev-ery puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before thistime tomorrow.”CHAPTER 7CUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST (PASTEDIN MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL)From a correspondent.Whitby. One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record93Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"has just been experienced here, with results bothstrange and unique. The weather had been somewhatsultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the monthof August. Saturday evening was as fine as was everknown, and the great body of holiday-makers laid outyesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’sBay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various tripsin the neighborhood of Whitby. The steamers Emmaand Scarborough made trips up and down the coast,and there was an unusual amount of ‘tripping’ both toand from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till theafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent theEast Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding emi-nence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the northand east, called attention to a sudden show of ‘marestails’ high in the sky to the northwest. The wind wasthen blowing from the south-west in the mild degreewhich in barometrical language is ranked ‘No. 2, lightbreeze.’ The coastguard on duty at once made report, andone old fisherman, who for more than half a centuryhas kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff,foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sud-den storm. The approach of sunset was so very beauti-ful, so grand in its masses of splendidly colouredclouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walkalong the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy thebeauty. Before the sun dipped below the black mass ofKettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky,its downward was was marked by myriad clouds ofevery sunset colour, flame, purple, pink, green, vio-let, and all the tints of gold, with here and there massesnot large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in allsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhou-ettes. The experience was not lost on the painters,and doubtless some of the sketches of the ‘Prelude tothe Great Storm’ will grace the R. A and R. I. walls inMay next.94Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" More than one captain made up his mind then andthere that his ‘cobble’ or his ‘mule’, as they term thedifferent classes of boats, would remain in the harbourtill the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirelyduring the evening, and at midnight there was a deadcalm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which,on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensi-tive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even thecoasting steamers, which usually hug the shore soclosely, kept well to seaward,and but few fishing boatswere in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreignschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly goingwestwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her of-ficers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she re-mained in sight, and efforts were made to signal herto reduce sail in the face of her danger. Before thenight shut down she was seen with sails idly flappingas she gently rolled on the undulating swell of thesea. “As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.” Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grewquite oppressive,and the silence was so marked thatthe bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dogin the town was distinctly heard, and the band on thepier, with its lively French air, was like a dischord inthe great harmony of nature’s silence. A little aftermidnight came a strange sound from over the sea, andhigh overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint,hollow booming. Then without warning the tempest broke. With arapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible,and evenafterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspectof nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose ingrowing fury, each over-topping its fellow, till in avery few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roar-ing and devouring monster. White-crested waves beat95Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelvingcliffs. Others broke over the piers, and with their spumeswept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise fromthe end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with suchforce that it was with difficulty that even strong menkept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the ironstanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entirepier from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalitiesof the night would have increased manifold. To add tothe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland. White, wet clouds, whichswept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp andcold that it needed but little effort of imagination tothink that the spirits of those lost at sea were touch-ing their living brethren with the clammy hands ofdeath, and many a one shuddered at the wreaths ofsea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some dis-tance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, whichcame thick and fast, followed by such peals of thunderthat the whole sky overhead seemed trembling underthe shock of the footsteps of the storm. Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasur-able grandeur and of absorbing interest. The sea, run-ning mountains high, threw skywards with each wavemighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemedto snatch at and whirl away into space. Here and therea fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running madly forshelter before the blast, now and again the white wingsof a storm-tossed seabird. On the summit of the EastCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment,but had not yet been tried. The officers in charge of itgot it into working order, and in the pauses of on-rushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea. Onceor twice its service was most effective, as when a fish-ing boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into theharbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light,96Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.As each boat achieved the safety of the port there wasa shout of joy from the mass of people on the shore,ashout which for a moment seemed to cleave the galeand was then swept away in its rush. Before long the searchlight discovered some distanceaway a schooner with all sails set, apparently the samevessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.The wind had by this time backed to the east, andthere was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliffas they realized the terrible danger in which she nowwas. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef onwhich so many good ships have from time to time suf-fered, and, with the wind blowing from its presentquarter, it would be quite impossible that she shouldfetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waveswere so great that in their troughs the shallows of theshore were almost visible, and the schooner, with allsails set, was rushing with such speed that, in thewords of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,if it was only in hell”. Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto, a mass of dank mist,which seemed to close on all things like a gray pall,and left available to men only the organ of hearing,for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thun-der, and the booming of the mighty billows camethrough the damp oblivion even louder than before.The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on theharbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shockwas expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and theremnant of the sea fog melted in the blast. And then,mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from waveto wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept thestrange schooner before the blast, with all sail set,and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight97Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"followed her, and a shudder ran through all who sawher, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with droop-ing head, which swung horribly to and fro at eachmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen onthe deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that theship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour,unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,all took place more quickly than it takes to write thesewords. The schooner paused not, but rushing acrossthe harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation ofsand and gravel washed by many tides and many stormsinto the southeast corner of the pier jutting under theEast Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier. There was of course a considerable concussion as thevessel drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope,and stay was strained,and some of the ‘top-hammer’came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the veryinstant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprangup on deck from below,as if shot up by the concus-sion, and running forward, jumped from the bow onthe sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the church-yard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeplythat some of the flat tombstones, thruffsteans orthrough-stones, as they call them in Whitby vernacu-lar, actually project over where the sustaining cliffhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, whichseemed intensified just beyond the focus of the search-light. It so happened that there was no one at the momenton Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in closeproximity were either in bed or were out on the heightsabove. Thus the coastguard on duty on the easternside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the littlepier, was the first to climb aboard. The men workingthe searchlight, after scouring the entrance of theharbour without seeing anything, then turned the light98Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ranaft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over toexamine it,and recoiled at once as though under somesudden emotion. This seemed to pique general curios-ity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by theDraw-bridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondentis a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of thecrowd. When I arrived, however, I found already as-sembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguardand police refused to allow to come on board. By thecourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your corre-spondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one ofa small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actu-ally lashed to the wheel. It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised,or even awed, for not often can such a sight have beenseen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tiedone over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Betweenthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set ofbeads on which it was fastened being around both wristsand wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. Thepoor fellow may have been seated at one time, but theflapping and buffeting of the sails had worked throughthe rudder of the wheel and had dragged him to andfro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cutthe flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and adoctor, Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place,who came immediately after me, declared, after mak-ing examination, that the man must have been deadfor quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, emptysave for a little roll of paper, which proved to be theaddendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up hisown hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. Thefact that a coastguard was the first on board may save99Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"some complications later on, in the Admiralty Court,for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is theright of the first civilian entering on a derelict. Al-ready, however, the legal tongues are wagging, andone young law student is loudly asserting that therights of the owner are already completely sacrificed,his property being held in contravention of the stat-ues of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, ifnot proof, of delegated possession, is held in a deadhand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has beenreverently removed from the place where he held hishonourable watch and ward till death, a steadfastnessas noble as that of the young Casabianca, and placedin the mortuary to await inquest. Already the sudden storm is passing,and its fierce-ness is abating. Crowds are scattering backward, andthe sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further de-tails of the derelict ship which found her way so mi-raculously into harbour in the storm.9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of thederelict in the storm last night is almost more star-tling than the thing itself. It turns out that the schoo-ner is Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter.She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, withonly a small amount of cargo, a number of greatwooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr.S.F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morningwent aboard and took formal possession of the goodsconsigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party,took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbourdues, etc. Nothing is talked about here today except the strangecoincidence. The officials of the Board of Trade have100Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"been most exacting in seeing that every compliancehas been made with existing regulations. As the mat-ter is to be a ‘nine days wonder’, they are evidentlydetermined that there shall be no cause of other com-plaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning thedog which landed when the ship struck, and more thana few of the members of the S.P.C.A., which is verystrong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal.To the general disappointment, however, it was not tobe found. It seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.It may be that it was frightened and made its way onto the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possi-bility, lest later on it should in itself become a dan-ger, for it is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morn-ing a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to acoal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found deadin the roadway opposite its master’s yard. It had beenfighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent,for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slitopen as if with a savage claw.Later.—By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspec-tor, I have been permitted to look over the log bookof the Demeter, which was in order up to within threedays, but contained nothing of special interest exceptas to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, how-ever, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle,which was today produced at the inquest. And a morestrange narrative than the two between them unfold ithas not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permit-ted to use them, and accordingly send you a tran-script, simply omitting technical details of seaman-ship and supercargo. It almost seems as though thecaptain had been seized with some kind of mania be-101Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"fore he had got well into blue water, and that this haddeveloped persistently throughout the voyage. Ofcourse my statement must be taken cum grano, since Iam writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russianconsul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.LOG OF THE “DEMETER” Varna to WhitbyWritten 18 July, things so strange happening, that Ishall keep accurate note henceforth till we land.On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand andboxes of earth. At noon set sail. East wind, fresh.Crew, five hands...two mates, cook, and myself, (cap-tain).On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded byTurkish Customs officers. Backsheesh. All correct.Under way at 4 p. m.On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officersand flagboat of guarding squadron. Backsheesh again.Work of officers thorough, but quick. Want us off soon.At dark passed into Archipelago.On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfiedabout something. Seemed scared, but would not speakout.On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men allsteady fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate couldnot make out what was wrong. They only told himthere was something, and crossed themselves. Mate losttemper with one of them that day and struck him.Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one ofthe crew, Petrofsky, was missing. Could not accountfor it. Took larboard watch eight bells last night, was102Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"relieved by Amramoff, but did not go to bunk. Menmore downcast than ever. All said they expected some-thing of the kind, but would not say more than therewas something aboard. Mate getting very impatient withthem. Feared some trouble ahead.On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, cameto my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to methat he thought there was a strange man aboard theship. He said that in his watch he had been shelteringbehind the deckhouse, as there was a rain storm, whenhe saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of thecrew, come up the companionway, and go along thedeck forward and disappear. He followed cautiously,but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatch-ways were all closed. He was in a panic of supersti-tious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread. Toallay it, I shall today search the entire ship carefullyfrom stem to stern.Later in the day I got together the whole crew, andtold them, as they evidently thought there was someone in the ship, we would search from stem to stern.First mate angry, said it was folly, and to yield to suchfoolish ideas would demoralise the men, said he wouldengage to keep them out of trouble with the handspike.I let him take the helm, while the rest began a thor-ough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns. Weleft no corner unsearched. As there were only the bigwooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a mancould hide. Men much relieved when search over, andwent back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, butsaid nothing.22 July.—Rough weather last three days, and all handsbusy with sails, no time to be frightened. Men seem tohave forgotten their dread. Mate cheerful again, andall on good terms. Praised men for work in bad weather.Passed Gibraltar and out through Straits. All well.103Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"24 July.—There seems some doom over this ship. Al-ready a hand short, and entering the Bay of Biscaywith wild weather ahead, and yet last night anotherman lost, disappeared. Like the first, he came off hiswatch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic offear, sent a round robin, asking to have double watch,as they fear to be alone. Mate angry. Fear there will besome trouble, as either he or the men will do someviolence.28 July.—Four days in hell, knocking about in a sortof malestrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep forany one. Men all worn out. Hardly know how to set awatch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volun-teered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a fewhours sleep. Wind abating, seas still terrific, but feelthem less, as ship is steadier.29 July.—Another tragedy. Had single watch tonight,as crew too tired to double. When morning watch cameon deck could find no one except steersman. Raisedoutcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but noone found. Are now without second mate, and crew ina panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth andwait for any sign of cause.30 July.—Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England.Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out, sleptsoundly, awakened by mate telling me that both manof watch and steersman missing. Only self and mateand two hands left to work ship.1 August.—Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted.Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able tosignal for help or get in somewhere. Not having powerto work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,as could not raise them again. We seem to be driftingto some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised104Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"than either of men. His stronger nature seems to haveworked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,working stolidly and patiently, with minds made upto worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.2 August, midnight.—Woke up from few minutes sleepby hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Couldsee nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran againstmate. Tells me he heard cry and ran, but no sign ofman on watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Matesays we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a momentof fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heardthe man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea,and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems tomove with us, and God seems to have deserted us.3 August.—At midnight I went to relieve the man atthe wheel and when I got to it found no one there. Thewind was steady, and as we ran before it there was noyawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.After a few seconds, he rushed up on deck in his flan-nels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatlyfear his reason has given way. He came close to me andwhispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, asthough fearing the very air might hear. “It is here. Iknow it now. On the watch last night I saw It, like aman, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in thebows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave itmy knife, but the knife went through It, empty as theair.” And as he spoke he took the knife and drove itsavagely into space. Then he went on, “But It is here,and I’ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one ofthose boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and see.You work the helm.” And with a warning look and hisfinger on his lip, he went below. There was springingup a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. Isaw him come out on deck again with a tool chest andlantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad,105Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"stark, raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stophim. He can’t hurt those big boxes, they are invoicedas clay, and to pull them about is as harmless a thingas he can do. So here I stay and mind the helm, andwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait tillthe fog clears. Then, if I can’t steer to any harbourwith the wind that is, I shall cut down sails, and lieby, and signal for help.... It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning tohope that the mate would come out calmer, for I heardhim knocking away at something in the hold, and workis good for him, there came up the hatchway a sud-den, startled scream, which made my blood run cold,and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun, araging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face con-vulsed with fear. “Save me! Save me!” he cried, andthen looked round on the blanket of fog. His horrorturned to despair, and in a steady voice he said, “Youhad better come too, captain, before it is too late. Heis there! I know the secret now. The sea will save mefrom Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could saya word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang onthe bulwark and deliberately threw himself into thesea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was thismadman who had got rid of the men one by one, andnow he has followed them himself. God help me! Howam I to account for all these horrors when I get toport? When I get to port! Will that ever be?4 August.—Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce,I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why elseI know not.

There is noevidence to adduce, and whether or not the man him-self committed the murders there is now none to say.The folk here hold almost universally that the captainis simply a hero, and he is to be given a public fu-neral. Already it is arranged that his body is to betaken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece andthen brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbeysteps, for he is to be buried in the churchyard on thecliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats havealready given in their names as wishing to follow himto the grave. No trace has ever been found of the great dog, atwhich there is much mourning, for, with public opin-ion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adoptedby the town.

The storm was fearful, and as it boomedloudly among the chimney pots, it made me shudder.When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distantgun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake, but shegot up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each107Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"time I awoke in time and managed to undress her with-out waking her, and got her back to bed. It is a verystrange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as herwill is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, ifthere be any, disappears, and she yields herself almostexactly to the routine of her life. Early in the morning we both got up and went downto the harbour to see if anything had happened in thenight. There were very few people about, and thoughthe sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, thebig, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselvesbecause the foam that topped them was like snow,forced themselves in through the mouth of the harbour,like a bullying man going through a crowd. SomehowI felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night,but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where ishe, and how? I am getting fearfully anxious abouthim. If I only knew what to do, and could do any-thing!10 August.—The funeral of the poor sea captain todaywas most touching. Every boat in the harbour seemedto be there, and the coffin was carried by captains allthe way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard. Lucycame with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilstthe cortege of boats went up the river to the Viaductand came down again. We had a lovely view, and sawthe procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow waslaid to rest near our seat so that we stood on it, whenthe time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless anduneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that herdreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd inone thing. She will not admit to me that there is anycause for restlessness, or if there be, she does not un-derstand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor Mr. Swaleswas found dead this morning on our seat, his neckbeing broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,108Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for therewas a look of fear and horror on his face that the mensaid made them shudder. Poor dear old man! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influ-ences more acutely than other people do. Just nowshe was quite upset by a little thing which I did notmuch heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look forthe boats was followed by his dog. The dog is alwayswith him. They are both quiet persons, and I never sawthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During theservice the dog would not come to its master, who wason the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barkingand howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and thenharshly, and then angrily. But it would neither comenor cease to make a noise. It was in a fury, with itseyes savage, and all its hair bristling out like a cat’stail when puss is on the war path. Finally the man toogot angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, andthen took it by the scruff of the neck and half draggedand half threw it on the tombstone on which the seatis fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poorthing began to tremble. It did not try to get away,but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and wasin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, thoughwithout effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt totouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort ofway. I greatly fear that she is of too super sensitive anature to go through the world without trouble. Shewill be dreaming of this tonight, I am sure. The wholeagglomeration of things, the ship steered into port bya dead man, his attitude, tied to the wheel with acrucifix and beads, the touching funeral, the dog, nowfurious and now in terror, will all afford material forher dreams. I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired outphysically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the109Chapter 7"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and back. She ought not tohave much inclination for sleep-walking then.CHAPTER 8MINA MURRAY’S JOURNALSame day, 11 o’clock P.M.—Oh, but I am tired! If itwere not that I had made my diary a duty I should notopen it tonight. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after awhile, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dearcows who came nosing towards us in a field close tothe lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. Ibelieve we forgot everything, except of course, per-sonal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean andgive us a fresh start. We had a capital ‘severe tea’ atRobin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn,with a bow window right over the seaweed-coveredrocks of the strand. I believe we should have shockedthe ‘New Woman’ with our appetites. Men are moretolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some,or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our heartsfull of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep offto bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in,however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for sup-per. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dustymiller. I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I amquite heroic. I think that some day the bishops mustget together and see about breeding up a new class ofcurates, who don’t take supper, no matter how hardthey may be pressed to, and who will know when girlsare tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has morecolor in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh so sweet.If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her onlyin the drawing room, I wonder what he would say if hesaw her now. Some of the ‘New Women’ writers will110Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"some day start an idea that men and women should beallowed to see each other asleep before proposing oraccepting. But I suppose the ‘New Woman’ won’t con-descend in future to accept. She will do the propos-ing herself. And a nice job she will make of it too!There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really be-lieve she has turned the corner, and that we are overher troubles with dreaming. I should be quite happy ifI only knew if Jonathan....God bless and keep him.11 August.—Diary again. No sleep now, so I may aswell write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have hadsuch an adventure, such an agonizing experience. Ifell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.... Sud-denly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a hor-rible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling ofemptiness around me. The room was dark, so I couldnot see Lucy’s bed. I stole across and felt for her. Thebed was empty. I lit a match and found that she wasnot in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, asI had left it. I feared to wake her mother, who hasbeen more than usually ill lately, so threw on someclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leavingthe room it struck me that the clothes she wore mightgive me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dress-ing-gown would mean house, dress outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,”I said to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only inher nightdress.” I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room. Notthere! Then I looked in all the other rooms of thehouse, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart.Finally, I came to the hall door and found it open. Itwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had notcaught. The people of the house are careful to lockthe door every night, so I feared that Lucy must havegone out as she was. There was no time to think of111Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"what might happen. A vague over-mastering fear ob-scured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock wasstriking one as I was in the Crescent, and there wasnot a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, butcould see no sign of the white figure which I expected.At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I lookedacross the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope orfear, I don’t know which, of seeing Lucy in our favor-ite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driv-ing clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleet-ing diorama of light and shade as they sailed across.For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadowof a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all aroundit. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins ofthe abbey coming into view, and as the edge of a nar-row band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along,the church and churchyard became gradually visible.Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed,for there, on our favorite seat, the silver light of themoon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white. Thecoming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much,for shadow shut down on light almost immediately,but it seemed to me as though something dark stoodbehind the seat where the white figure shone, and bentover it. What it was, whether man or beast, I couldnot tell.I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew downthe steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-mar-ket to the bridge, which was the only way to reachthe East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a souldid I see. I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted nowitness of poor Lucy’s condition. The time and dis-tance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and mybreath came laboured as I toiled up the endless stepsto the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemedto me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as112Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat andthe white figure, for I was now close enough to distin-guish it even through the spells of shadow. There wasundoubtedly something, long and black, bending overthe half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy!Lucy!” and something raised a head, and from where Iwas I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance ofthe churchyard. As I entered, the church was betweenme and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight ofher. When I came in view again the cloud had passed,and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I couldsee Lucy half reclining with her head lying over theback of the seat. She was quite alone, and there wasnot a sign of any living thing about. When I bent over her I could see that she was stillasleep. Her lips were parted, and she was breathing,not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps,as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath.As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep andpulled the collar of her nightdress close around her,as though she felt the cold. I flung the warm shawlover her, and drew the edges tight around her neck,for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chillfrom the night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wakeher all at once, so, in order to have my hands free tohelp her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a bigsafety pin. But I must have been clumsy in my anxietyand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by,when her breathing became quieter, she put her handto her throat again and moaned. When I had her care-fully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet, and thenbegan very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond, but gradually she be-came more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning andsighing occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast,and for many other reasons, I wished to get her home113Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"at once, I shook her forcibly, till finally she openedher eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised to seeme, as, of course, she did not realize all at once whereshe was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time,when her body must have been chilled with cold, andher mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in achurchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. Shetrembled a little, and clung to me. When I told her tocome at once with me home, she rose without a word,with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, thegravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. Shestopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes,but I would not. However, when we got to the path-way outside the chruchyard, where there was a puddleof water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feetwith mud, using each foot in turn on the other, sothat as we went home, no one, in case we should meetany one, should notice my bare feet. Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meet-ing a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quitesober, passing along a street in front of us. But we hidin a door till he had disappeared up an opening suchas there are here, steep little closes, or ‘wynds’, asthey call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud allthe time sometimes I thought I should faint. I wasfilled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health,lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for herreputation in case the story should get wind. Whenwe got in, and had washed our feet, and had said aprayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me notto say a word to any one, even her mother, about hersleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking ofthe state of her mother’s health, and how the knowl-edge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, ofhow such a story might become distorted, nay, infalli-114Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"bly would, in case it should leak out, I thought itwiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked thedoor, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps Ishall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly.The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea... .Same day, noon.—All goes well. Lucy slept till I wokeher and seemed not to have even changed her side.The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmedher, on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looksbetter this morning than she has done for weeks. I wassorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pinhurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for theskin of her throat was pierced. I must have pinched upa piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for thereare two little red points like pin-pricks, and on theband of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When Iapologised and was concerned about it, she laughedand petted me, and said she did not even feel it. For-tunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.Same day, night.—We passed a happy day. The air wasclear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze.We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenradriving by the road and Lucy and I walking by thecliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sadmyself, for I could not but feel how absolutely happyit would have been had Jonathan been with me. Butthere! I must only be patient. In the evening westrolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some goodmusic by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.Lucy seems more restful than she has been for sometime, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door andsecure the key the same as before, though I do notexpect any trouble tonight.12 August.—My expectations were wrong, for twiceduring the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get115Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little im-patient at finding the door shut, and went back to bedunder a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, andheard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucywoke, too, and I was glad to see, was even better thanon the previous morning. All her old gaiety of mannerseemed to have come back, and she came and snuggledin beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told herhow anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she triedto comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for,though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can make themmore bearable.13 August.—Another quiet day, and to bed with thekey on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night,and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, point-ing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling asidethe blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, andthe soft effect of the light over the sea and sky, mergedtogether in one great silent mystery, was beautifulbeyond words. Between me and the moonlight flitteda great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles.Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose,frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across theharbour towards the abbey. When I came back fromthe window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleep-ing peacefully. She did not stir again all night.14 August.—On the East Cliff, reading and writing allday. Lucy seems to have become as much in love withthe spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from itwhen it is time to come home for lunch or tea or din-ner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We werecoming home for dinner, and had come to the top ofthe steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look atthe view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low downin the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness. Thered light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old116Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautifulrosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenlyLucy murmured as if to herself... . “His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It wassuch an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing,that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so asto see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, andsaw that she was in a half dreamy state, with an oddlook on her face that I could not quite make out, so Isaid nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared tobe looking over at our own seat, whereon was a darkfigure seated alone. I was quite a little startled my-self, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger hadgreat eyes like burning flames, but a second look dis-pelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining onthe windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our seat, andas the sun dipped there was just sufficient change inthe refraction and reflection to make it appear as ifthe light moved. I called Lucy’s attention to the pecu-liar effect, and she became herself with a start, butshe looked sad all the same. It may have been that shewas thinking of that terrible night up there. We neverrefer to it, so I said nothing, and we went home todinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. Isaw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself. I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and wasfull of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.When coming home, it was then bright moonlight, sobright that, though the front of our part of the Cres-cent was in shadow, everything could be well seen, Ithrew a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy’s headleaning out. I opened my handkerchief and waved it.She did not notice or make any movement whatever.Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of thebuilding, and the light fell on the window. There dis-tinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against theside of the window sill and her eyes shut. She was fastasleep, and by her, seated on the window sill, was some-117Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"thing that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraidshe might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I cameinto the room she was moving back to her bed, fastasleep, and breathing heavily. She was holding herhand to her throat, as though to protect if from thecold. I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly. I havetaken care that the door is locked and the windowsecurely fastened. She looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is palerthan is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard lookunder her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fret-ting about something. I wish I could find out what itis.15 August.—Rose later than usual. Lucy was languidand tired, and slept on after we had been called. Wehad a happy surprise at breakfast. Arthur’s father isbetter, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucyis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry atonce. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She isgrieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is re-joiced that she is soon to have some one to protecther. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me thatshe has got her death warrant. She has not told Lucy,and made me promise secrecy. Her doctor told her thatwithin a few months, at most, she must die, for herheart is weakening. At any time, even now, a suddenshock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, we werewise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful nightof Lucy’s sleep-walking.17 August.—No diary for two whole days. I have nothad the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seemsto be coming over our happiness. No news fromJonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilsther mother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do notunderstand Lucy’s fading away as she is doing. She118Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air, butall the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and shegets weaker and more languid day by day. At night Ihear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to mywrist at night, but she gets up and walks about theroom, and sits at the open window. Last night I foundher leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried towake her I could not. She was in a faint. When I managed to restore her,she was weak as water, and cried silently between long,painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how shecame to be at the window she shook her head andturned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unluckyprick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat justnow as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem notto have healed. They are still open, and, if anything,larger than before, and the edges of them are faintlywhite. They are like little white dots with red cen-tres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shallinsist on the doctor seeing about them.LETTER, SAMUEL F. BILLINGTON & SON, SOLICITORSWHITBY, TO MESSRS.

Lucy is ever so much bet-ter. Last night she slept well all night, and did notdisturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks,though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If shewere in any way anemic I could understand it, but sheis not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheer-fulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passedfrom her, and she has just reminded me, as if I neededany reminding, of that night, and that it was here, onthis very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel ofher boot on the stone slab and said, “My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! Idaresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me thatit was because I didn’t want to wake up Geordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I askedher if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look cameinto her forehead, which Arthur, I call him Arthur fromher habit, says he loves, and indeed, I don’t wonderthat he does. Then she went on in a half-dreamingkind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself. “I didn’t quite dream, but it all seemed to be real. Ionly wanted to be here in this spot. I don’t know why,for I was afraid of something, I don’t know what. Iremember, though I suppose I was asleep, passingthrough the streets and over the bridge.

Then I had a vague memory of some-thing long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw inthe sunset, and something very sweet and very bitterall around me at once. And then I seemed sinking into121Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears,as I have heard there is to drowning men, and theneverything seemed passing away from me.

I saw youdo it before I felt you.” Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncannyto me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did notquite like it, and thought it better not to keep hermind on the subject, so we drifted on to another sub-ject, and Lucy was like her old self again. When wegot home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and herpale cheeks were really more rosy. Her mother re-joiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happyevening together.19 August.—Joy, joy, joy! Although not all joy. Atlast, news of Jonathan.

About eight o’clock he began to get excitedand sniff about as a dog does when setting. The atten-dant was struck by his manner, and knowing my inter-est in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually re-spectful to the attendant and at times servile, but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty. Wouldnot condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was, “I don’t want to talk to you.You don’t count now. The master is at hand.” The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of reli-gious mania which has seized him. If so, we must lookout for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal andreligious mania at once might be dangerous. The com-bination is a dreadful one. At Nine o’clock I visited him myself. His attitude tome was the same as that to the attendant. In his sub-lime self-feeling the difference between myself and theattendant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like reli-gious mania, and he will soon think that he himself isGod.124Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" These infinitesimal distinctions between man and manare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How thesemadmen give themselves away! The real God takethheed lest a sparrow fall. But the God created fromhuman vanity sees no difference between an eagle anda sparrow. Oh, if men only knew! For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting ex-cited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretendto be watching him, but I kept strict observation allthe same. All at once that shifty look came into hiseyes which we always see when a madman has seizedan idea, and with it the shifty movement of the headand back which asylum attendants come to know sowell. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on theedge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space withlack-luster eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real oronly assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of hispets, a theme which had never failed to excite his at-tention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily,“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.” “What” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’tcare about spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobbyand the notebook is filling up with columns of smallfigures.) To this he answered enigmatically, “The Bride maid-ens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride.But when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidensshine not to the eyes that are filled.” He would not explain himself, but remained obsti-nately seated on his bed all the time I remained withhim. I am weary tonight and low in spirits. I cannot butthink of Lucy, and how different things might havebeen. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral, the modernMorpheus!

I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clockstrike only twice, when the night watchman came tome, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield hadescaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once.My patient is too dangerous a person to be roamingabout. Those ideas of his might work out dangerouslywith strangers. The attendant was waiting for me. He said he hadseen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep inhis bed, when he had looked through the observationtrap in the door. His attention was called by the soundof the window being wrenched out. He ran back andsaw his feet disappear through the window, and had atonce sent up for me. He was only in his night gear,and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful towatch where he should go than to follow him, as hemight lose sight of him whilst getting out of the build-ing by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t getthrough the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet fore-most, and as we were only a few feet above groundlanded unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to theleft, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quicklyas I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw awhite figure scale the high wall which separates ourgrounds from those of the deserted house. I ran back at once, told the watchman to get threeor four men immediately and follow me into thegrounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be danger-ous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’sfigure just disappearing behind the angle of the house,126Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I foundhim pressed close against the old iron-bound oak doorof the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some one, but I wasafraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying,les t I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to fol-lowing a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping isupon him! After a few minutes, however, I could seethat he did not take note of anything around him, andso ventured to draw nearer to him, the more so as mymen had now crossed the wall and were closing himin. I heard him say.... “I am here to do your bidding, Master. I am yourslave, and you will reward me, for I shall be faithful. Ihave worshipped you long and afar off. Now that youare near, I await your commands, and you will notpass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distributionof good things?” He is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of theloaves and fishes even when he believes his is in a realPresence. His manias make a startling combination.When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He isimmensely strong, for he was more like a wild beastthan a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage be-fore, and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that wehave found out his strength and his danger in goodtime. With strength and determination like his, hemight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now, at any rate. Jack Sheppard himselfcouldn’t get free from the strait waistcoat that keepshim restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in thepadded room.

Now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at onceto have a look at him. He was still in the strait waist-coat and in the padded room, but the suffused lookhad gone from his face, and his eyes had something oftheir old pleading. I might almost say, cringing, soft-ness. I was satisfied with his present condition, anddirected him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humourenough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me,he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively atthem, “They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurtingyou! The fools!” It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to findmyself disassociated even in the mind of this poormadman from the others, but all the same I do notfollow his thought. Am I to take it that I have any-thing in common with him, so that we are, as it were,to stand together. Or has he to gain from me somegood so stupendous that my well being is needful toHim? I must find out later on. Tonight he will notspeak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-growncat will not tempt him. He will only say, “I don’t take any stock in cats. Ihave more to think of now, and I can wait. I can wait.” After a while I left him.

Atthe same time, I am not by any means satisfied withher appearance. She is woefully different from whatshe was when I saw her last. Of course you must bearin mind that I did not have full opportunity of exami-nation such as I should wish.

I had better tell you exactlywhat happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure,your own conclusions. I shall then say what I havedone and propose doing. “I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Hermother was present, and in a few seconds I made upmy mind that she was trying all she knew to misleadher mother and prevent her from being anxious.

It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me anevident chance, and I secured a few drops of the bloodand have analysed them. “The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condi-tion, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorousstate of health.

He looked grave, but said, ‘ I have madecareful examination, but there is no functional cause.With you I agree that there has been much blood lost,it has been but is not. But the conditions of her are inno way anemic. I have asked her to send me her maid,that I may ask just one or two questions, that so I maynot chance to miss nothing. I know well what she willsay. And yet there is cause. There is always cause foreverything. I must go back home and think. You mustsend me the telegram every day, and if there be causeI shall come again.

SEWARD’S DIARY4 September.—Zoophagous patient still keeps up ourinterest in him. He had only one outburst and thatwas yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the strokeof noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knewthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately142Chapter 9"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"the men came at a run, and were just in time, for atthe stroke of noon he became so violent that it tookall their strength to hold him. In about five minutes,however, he began to get more quiet, and finally sankinto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has re-mained up to now. The attendant tells me that hisscreams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling.I found my hands full when I got in, attending to someof the other patients who were frightened by him.Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the soundsdisturbed even me, though I was some distance away.It is now after the dinner hour of the asylum, and asyet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull,sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems ratherto indicate than to show something directly. I cannotquite understand it.Later.—Another change in my patient. At five o’clockI looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happyand contented as he used to be. He was catching fliesand eating them, and was keeping note of his captureby making nailmarks on the edge of the door betweenthe ridges of padding. When he saw me, he came overand apologized for his bad conduct, and asked me in avery humble, cringing way to be led back to his ownroom, and to have his notebook again. I thought itwell to humour him, so he is back in his room with thewindow open. He has the sugar of his tea spread outon the window sill, and is reaping quite a harvest offlies. He is not now eating them, but putting theminto a box, as of old, and is already examining thecorners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get himto talk about the past few days, for any clue to histhoughts would be of immense help to me, but he wouldnot rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, andsaid in a sort of far away voice, as though saying itrather to himself than to me. “All over! All over! He has deserted me. No hope for143Chapter 9"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"me now unless I do it myself!” Then suddenly turningto me in a resolute way, he said, “Doctor, won’t you bevery good to me and let me have a little more sugar? Ithink it would be very good for me.” “And the flies?” I said. “Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies, there-fore I like it.”And there are people who know so littleas to think that madmen do not argue. I procured hima double supply, and left him as happy a man as, Isuppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom hismind.Midnight.—Another change in him. I had been to seeMiss Westenra, whom I found much better, and hadjust returned, and was standing at our own gate look-ing at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling.As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear itbetter than in the morning. It was a shock to me toturn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset overLondon, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and allthe marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even ason foul water, and to realize all the grim sternness ofmy own cold stone building, with its wealth of breath-ing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure itall. I reached him just as the sun was going down, andfrom his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank hebecame less and less frenzied, and just as it dipped heslid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, onthe floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectualrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few min-utes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him.I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I wasanxious to see what he would do. He went straightover to the window and brushed out the crumbs ofsugar. Then he took his fly box, and emptied it out-side, and threw away the box. Then he shut the win-dow, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All thissurprised me, so I asked him, “Are you going to keep144Chapter 9"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"flies any more?” “No,” said he. “I am sick of all that rubbish!” Hecertainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish Icould get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause ofhis sudden passion. Stop. There may be a clue afterall, if we can find why today his paroxysms came on athigh noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a ma-lign influence of the sun at periods which affects cer-tain natures, as at times the moon does others? Weshall see.TELEGRAM.

ARTHUR HOLMWOOD“6 September“My dear Art, “My news today is not so good. Lucy this morninghad gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thingwhich has arisen from it. Mrs. Westenra was naturallyanxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me pro-fessionally about her. I took advantage of the oppor-tunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing,the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, andthat I would put her in his charge conjointly withmyself. So now we can come and go without alarmingher unduly, for a shock to her would mean suddendeath, and this, in Lucy’s weak condition, might bedisastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties,all of us, my poor fellow, but, please God, we shallcome through them all right. If any need I shall write,so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for grantedthat I am simply waiting for news, In haste,“Yours ever,”John SewardDR. SEWARD’S DIARY7 September.—The first thing Van Helsing said to mewhen we met at Liverpool Street was, “Have you saidanything to our young friend, to lover of her?” “No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said inmy telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling himthat you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not sowell, and that I should let him know if need be.”146Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" “Right, my friend,” he said. “Quite right! Better henot know as yet. Perhaps he will never know. I prayso, but if it be needed, then he shall know all. And,my good friend John, let me caution you. You dealwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way orthe other, and inasmuch as you deal discreetly withyour madmen, so deal with God’s madmen too, therest of the world. You tell not your madmen what youdo nor why you do it. You tell them not what youthink. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, whereit may rest, where it may gather its kind around itand breed.You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, andhere.” He touched me on the heart and on the fore-head, and then touched himself the same way. “I havefor myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfoldto you.” “Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good. Wemay arrive at some decision.”He looked at me and said,“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even beforeit has ripened, while the milk of its mother earth is inhim, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint himwith his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rubhim between his rough hands, and blow away the greenchaff, and say to you, ‘Look! He’s good corn, he willmake a good crop when the time comes.’ “ I did not see the application and told him so. Forreply he reached over and took my ear in his hand andpulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lec-tures, and said, “The good husbandman tell you sothen because he knows, but not till then. But you donot find the good husbandman dig up his planted cornto see if he grow. That is for the children who play athusbandry, and not for those who take it as of thework of their life. See you now, friend John? I havesown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in mak-ing it sprout, if he sprout at all, there’s some promise,and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke off,147Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he wenton gravely, “You were always a careful student, andyour case book was ever more full than the rest. And Itrust that good habit have not fail. Remember, myfriend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, andwe should not trust the weaker. Even if you have notkept the good practice, let me tell you that this caseof our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I say maybe, of such interest to us and others that all the restmay not make him kick the beam, as your people say.Take then good note of it. Nothing is too small. Icounsel you, put down in record even your doubtsand surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you tosee how true you guess. We learn from failure, notfrom success!” When I described Lucy’s symptoms, the same as be-fore, but infinitely more marked, he looked very grave,but said nothing. He took with him a bag in whichwere many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly para-phernalia of our beneficial trade,” as he once called,in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor ofthe healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. Shewas alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected tofind her. Nature in one of her beneficient moods hasordained that even death has some antidote to its ownterrors. Here, in a case where any shock may provefatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause orother, the things not personal, even the terrible changein her daughter to whom she is so attached, do notseem to reach her. It is something like the way dameNature gathers round a foreign body an envelope ofsome insensitive tissue which can protect from evilthat which it would otherwise harm by contact. If thisbe an ordered selfishness, then we should pause beforewe condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for theremay be deeper root for its causes than we have knowl-edge of.148Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pa-thology, and set down a rule that she should not bepresent with Lucy, or think of her illness more thanwas absolutely required. She assented readily, so readilythat I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life.Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy’s room. If Iwas shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrifiedwhen I saw her today. She was ghastly, chalkily pale. The red seemed tohave gone even from her lips and gums, and the bonesof her face stood out prominently. Her breathing waspainful to see or hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set asmarble, and his eyebrows converged till they almosttouched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and didnot seem to have strength to speak, so for a while wewere all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, andwe went gently out of the room. The instant we hadclosed the door he stepped quickly along the passageto the next door, which was open. Then he pulled mequickly in with him and closed the door. “My god!” hesaid. “This is dreadful. There is not time to be lost.She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’saction as it should be. There must be a transfusion ofblood at once. Is it you or me?” “I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must beme.” “Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag.I am prepared.” I went downstairs with him, and as we were goingthere was a knock at the hall door. When we reachedthe hall, the maid had just opened the door, and Arthurwas stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, sayingin an eager whisper, “Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines ofyour letter, and have been in an agony. The dad wasbetter, so I ran down here to see for myself. Is notthat gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful toyou, sir, for coming.”149Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him, hehad been angry at his interruption at such a time, butnow, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recog-nized the strong young manhood which seemed toemanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pausehe said to him as he held out his hand, “Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of ourdear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child,do not go like that.”For he suddenly grew pale and satdown in a chair almost fainting. “You are to help her.You can do more than any that live, and your courageis your best help.” “What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me,and I shall do it. My life is hers’ and I would give thelast drop of blood in my body for her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and Icould from old knowledge detect a trace of its originin his answer. “My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not thelast!” “What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and hisopen nostrils quivered with intent. Van Helsing slappedhim on the shoulder. “Come!” he said. “You are a man, and it is a man wewant. You are better than me, better than my friendJohn.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professorwent on by explaining in a kindly way. “Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, andblood she must have or die. My friend John and I haveconsulted, and we are about to perform what we calltransfusion of blood, to transfer from full veins of oneto the empty veins which pine for him. John was togive his blood, as he is the more young and strongthan me.”—Here Arthur took my hand and wrung ithard in silence.—”But now you are here, you are moregood than us, old or young, who toil much in theworld of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and ourblood so bright than yours!”150Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" Arthur turned to him and said, “If you only knewhow gladly I would die for her you would under-stand....” He stopped with a sort of choke in his voice. “Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-offyou will be happy that you have done all for her youlove. Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her oncebefore it is done, but then you must go, and you mustleave at my sign. Say no word to Madame. You knowhow it is with her. There must be no shock, any knowl-edge of this would be one. Come!” We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by directionremained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked atus, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she wassimply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke tous, that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laidthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed anarcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily,“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off,like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow iseasy. Yes.” She had made the effort with success.It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This,in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The timeseemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eye-lids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifestits potency, and she fell into a deep sleep. When theProfessor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room,and bade him strip off his coat. Then he added, “Youmay take that one little kiss whiles I bring over thetable. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us lookedwhilst he bent over her. Van Helsing, turning to me, said, “He is so youngand strong, and of blood so pure that we need notdefibrinate it.” Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, VanHelsing performed the operation. As the transfusionwent on, something like life seemed to come back topoor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pal-151Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"lor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. Af-ter a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of bloodwas telling on Arthur, strong man as he was. It gaveme an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system musthave undergone that what weakened Arthur only par-tially restored her. But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watchin hand, and with his eyes fixed now on the patientand now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat.Presently, he said in a soft voice, “Do not stir an in-stant. It is enough. You attend him. I will look toher.” When all was over, I could see how much Arthur wasweakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm tobring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turn-ing round, the man seems to have eyes in the back ofhis head, “The brave lover, I think, deserve anotherkiss, which he shall have presently.” And as he hadnow finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow tothe patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black vel-vet band which she seems always to wear round herthroat, buckled with an old diamond buckle whichher lover had given her, was dragged a little up, andshowed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deephiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’sways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at themoment, but turned to me, saying, “Now take downour brave young lover, give him of the port wine, andlet him lie down a while. He must then go home andrest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be re-cruited of what he has so given to his love. He mustnot stay here. Hold a moment! I may take it, sir, thatyou are anxious of result. Then bring it with you, thatin all ways the operation is successful. You have savedher life this time, and you can go home and rest easyin mind that all that can be is. I shall tell her all whenshe is well. She shall love you none the less for what152Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"you have done. Goodbye.” When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucywas sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger. Icould see the counterpane move as her breast heaved.By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.The velvet band again covered the red mark. I askedthe Professor in a whisper, “What do you make of thatmark on her throat?” “What do you make of it?” “I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and thenand there proceeded to loose the band. Just over theexternal jugular vein there were two punctures, notlarge, but not wholesome looking. There was no signof disease, but the edges were white and worn look-ing, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred tome that that this wound, or whatever it was, might bethe means of that manifest loss of blood. But I aban-doned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thingcould not be. The whole bed would have been drenchedto a scarlet with the blood which the girl must havelost to leave such a pallor as she had before the trans-fusion. “Well?” said Van Helsing. “Well,” said I. “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I must go back toAmsterdam tonight,” he said “There are books andthings there which I want. You must remain here allnight, and you must not let your sight pass from her.” “Shall I have a nurse?” I asked. “We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watchall night. See that she is well fed, and that nothingdisturbs her. You must not sleep all the night. Lateron we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon aspossible. And then we may begin.” “May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?” “We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. Hecame back a moment later and put his head inside thedoor and said with a warning finger held up, “Remem-153Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ber, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harmbefall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!”DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—CONTINUED8 September.—I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiateworked itself off towards dusk, and she waked natu-rally. She looked a different being from what she hadbeen before the operation. Her spirits even were good,and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could seeevidences of the absolute prostration which she hadundergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. VanHelsing had directed that I should sit up with her, shealmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out herdaughter’s renewed strength and excellent spirits. Iwas firm, however, and made preparations for my longvigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night Icame in, having in the meantime had supper, and tooka seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but lookedat me gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After along spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with aneffort seemed to pull herself together and shook itoff. It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, soI tackled the subject at once. “You do not want to sleep?” “No. I am afraid.” “Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we allcrave for.” “Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you apresage of horror!” “A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?” “I don’t know. Oh, I don’t know. And that is what isso terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep,until I dread the very thought.” “But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight. I am herewatching you, and I can promise that nothing willhappen.”Chapter 10154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" “Ah, I can trust you!” she said. I seized the opportunity, and said, “I promise that ifI see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you atonce.” “You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are tome. Then I will sleep!” And almost at the word shegave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep. All night long I watched by her. She never stirred,but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving,health-giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, andher breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pen-dulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evi-dent that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peaceof mind. In the early morning her maid came, and I left her inher care and took myself back home, for I was anxiousabout many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsingand to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result ofthe operation. My own work, with its manifold ar-rears, took me all day to clear off. It was dark when Iwas able to inquire about my zoophagous patient. Thereport was good. He had been quite quiet for the pastday and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing atAmsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that Ishould be at Hillingham tonight, as it might be wellto be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by thenight mail and would join me early in the morning.9 September.—I was pretty tired and worn out when Igot to Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had awink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel thatnumbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy wasup and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands withme she looked sharply in my face and said, “No sitting up tonight for you. You are worn out. Iam quite well again. Indeed, I am, and if there is to beany sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had mysupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by herChapter 10155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and hada couple of glasses of the more than excellent port.Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a roomnext her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said. “You must stay here. I shall leavethis door open and my door too. You can lie on thesofa for I know that nothing would induce any of youdoctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient abovethe horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, andyou can come to me at once.” I could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, andcould not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewingher promise to call me if she should want anything, Ilay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.LUCY WESTENRA’S DIARY9 September.—I feel so happy tonight. I have been somiserably weak, that to be able to think and moveabout is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of eastwind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warmabout me. I suppose it is that sickness and weaknessare selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympa-thy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give loverein, and in thought and feeling he can wander wherehe wills. I know where my thoughts are. If only Arthurknew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as yousleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of lastnight! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Sewardwatching me. And tonight I shall not fear to sleep,since he is close at hand and within call. Thank every-body for being so good to me. Thank God! GoodnightArthur.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY10 September.—I was conscious of the Professor’s handChapter 10156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"on my head, and started awake all in a second. That isone of the things that we learn in an asylum, at anyrate. “And how is our patient?” “Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” Ianswered. “Come, let us see,” he said. And together we wentinto the room. The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gen-tly, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-liketread, over to the bed. As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight floodedthe room, I heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspira-tion, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot throughmy heart. As I passed over he moved back, and hisexclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed noenforcement from his agonized face. He raised his handand pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawnand ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble. There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poorLucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever.Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to haveshrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see ina corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but theinstinct of his life and all the long years of habit stoodto him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring the brandy.” I flew to the dining room, and returned with thedecanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, andtogether we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felther heart, and after a few moments of agonizing sus-pense said, “It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. Allour work is undone. We must begin again. There is noyoung Arthur here now. I have to call on you yourselfthis time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was dippinginto his bag, and producing the instruments of trans-157Chapter 10"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"fusion. I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just atpresent, and no need of one. and so, without a moment’sdelay, we began the operation. After a time, it did not seem a short time either, forthe draining away of one’s blood, no matter how will-ingly it be given, is a terrible feeling, Van Helsing heldup a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said. “But I fearthat with growing strength she may wake, and thatwould make danger, oh, so much danger. But I shallprecaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection ofmorphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, tocarry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemedto merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with afeeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tingeof color steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips. Noman knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel hisown lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the womanhe loves. The Professor watched me critically. “That will do,”he said. “Already?” I remonstrated. “You took a greatdeal more from Art.” To which he smiled a sad sort ofsmile as he replied, “He is her lover, her fiance. You have work, muchwork to do for her and for others, and the present willsuffice. When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy,whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. Ilaid down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me,for I felt faint and a little sick. By and by he bound upmy wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass ofwine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he cameafter me, and half whispered. “Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our younglover should turn up unexpected, as before, no wordto him. It would at once frighten him and enjealoushim, too. There must be none. So!”Chapter 10158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" When I came back he looked at me carefully, andthen said, “You are not much the worse. Go into theroom, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile, then havemuch breakfast and come here to me.” I followed out his orders, for I knew how right andwise they were. I had done my part, and now my nextduty was to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, andin the weakness lost something of the amazement atwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however,wondering over and over again how Lucy had madesuch a retrograde movement, and how she could havebeen drained of so much blood with no sign any whereto show for it. I think I must have continued my won-der in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking mythoughts always came back to the little punctures inher throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance oftheir edges, tiny though they were. Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke shewas fairly well and strong, though not nearly so muchso as the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her,he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, withstrict injunctions that I was not to leave her for amoment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking theway to the nearest telegraph office. Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite un-conscious that anything had happened. I tried to keepher amused and interested. When her mother came upto see her, she did not seem to notice any change what-ever, but said to me gratefully, “We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you havedone, but you really must now take care not to over-work yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You wanta wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you do!”As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was onlymomentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not standfor long an unwonted drain to the head. The reactioncame in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyeson me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on myChapter 10159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"lips. With a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows. Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and pres-ently said to me. “Now you go home, and eat muchand drink enough. Make yourself strong. I stay heretonight, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. Youand I must watch the case, and we must have noneother to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not askthe. Think what you will. Do not fear to think eventhe most not-improbable. Goodnight.” In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked ifthey or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.They implored me to let them, and when I said it wasDr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit up,they asked me quite piteously to intercede withthe‘foreign gentleman’. I was much touched by theirkindness. Perhaps it is because I am weak at present,and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, thattheir devotion was manifested. For over and over againhave I seen similar instances of woman’s kindness. Igot back here in time for a late dinner, went my rounds,all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. Itis coming.11 September.—This afternoon I went over toHillingham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, andLucy much better. Shortly after I had arrived, a bigparcel from abroad came for the Professor. He openedit with much impressment, assumed, of course, andshowed a great bundle of white flowers. “These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said. “For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!” “Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. Theseare medicines.” Here Lucy made a wry face. “Nay, butthey are not to take in a decoction or in nauseousform, so you need not snub that so charming nose, orI shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes hemay have to endure in seeing so much beauty that heso loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, thatChapter 10160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is me-dicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in yourwindow, I make pretty wreath, and hang him roundyour neck, so you sleep well. Oh, yes! They, like thelotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell solike the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youththat the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, andfind him all too late.” Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examiningthe flowers and smelling them. Now she threw themdown saying, with half laughter, and half disgust,“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up ajoke on me. Why, these flowers are only common gar-lic.” To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with allhis sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrowsmeeting, “No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim pur-pose in what I do, and I warn you that you do notthwart me. Take care, for the sake of others if not foryour own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she mightwell be, he went on more gently, “Oh, little miss, mydear, do not fear me. I only do for your good, butthere is much virtue to you in those so common flow-ers. See, I place them myself in your room. I makemyself the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! Notelling to others that make so inquisitive questions.We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience, andobedience is to bring you strong and well into lovingarms that wait for you. Now sit still a while. Comewith me, friend John, and you shall help me deck theroom with my garlic, which is all the war from Haarlem,where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, orthey would not have been here.” We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.The Professor’s actions were certainly odd and not tobe found in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of.Chapter 10161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"First he fastened up the windows and latched themsecurely. Next, taking a handful of the flowers, herubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensurethat every whiff of air that might get in would beladen with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp herubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below,and at each side, and round the fireplace in the sameway. It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently Isaid, “Well, Professor, I know you always have a rea-son for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. Itis well we have no sceptic here, or he would say thatyou were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.” “Perhaps I am!” He answered quietly as he began tomake the wreath which Lucy was to wear round herneck. We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for thenight, and when she was in bed he came and himselffixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The lastwords he said to her were, “Take care you do not disturb it, and even if theroom feel close, do not tonight open the window orthe door.” “I promise,” said Lucy. “And thank you both a thou-sand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what haveI done to be blessed with such friends?” As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting,Van Helsing said, “Tonight I can sleep in peace, andsleep I want, two nights of travel, much reading in theday between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,and a night to sit up, without to wink. Tomorrow inthe morning early you call for me, and we come to-gether to see our pretty miss, so much more strongfor my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho, ho!” He seemed so confident that I, remembering my ownconfidence two nights before and with the baneful re-sult, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been myweakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend,but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.Chapter 11162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11LUCY WESTENRA’S DIARY12 September.—How good they all are to me.

Oh, the terrible struggle that I havehad against sleep so often of late, the pain of sleep-lessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with suchunknown horrors as it has for me!

The carriage orderedfrom the hotel was waiting. The Professor took hisbag, which he always brings with him now. Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I ar-rived at Hillingham at eight o’clock. It was a lovelymorning. The bright sunshine and all the fresh feelingof early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’sannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds ofbeautiful colors, but had not yet begun to drop fromthe trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra com-Chapter 11163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ing out of the morning room. She is always an earlyriser. She greeted us warmly and said, “You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. Thedear child is still asleep. I looked into her room andsaw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her.”The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. Herubbed his hands together, and said, “Aha! I thought Ihad diagnosed the case. My treatment is working.” To which she replied, “You must not take all the creditto yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this morning is due inpart to me.” “How do you mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor. “Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night,and went into her room. She was sleeping soundly, sosoundly that even my coming did not wake her. Butthe room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of thosehorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere,and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck.I feared that the heavy odor would be too much forthe dear child in her weak state, so I took them allaway and opened a bit of the window to let in a littlefresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am sure.” She moved off into her boudoir, where she usuallybreakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched theProfessor’s face, and saw it turn ashen gray. He hadbeen able to retain his self-command whilst the poorlady was present, for he knew her state and how mis-chievous a shock would be. He actually smiled on heras he held open the door for her to pass into her room.But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, sud-denly and forcibly, into the dining room and closedthe door. Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsingbreak down. He raised his hands over his head in asort of mute despair, and then beat his palms togetherin a helpless way. Finally he sat down on a chair, andputting his hands before his face, began to sob, withloud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very rack-Chapter 11164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"ing of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealingto the whole universe. “God! God! God!” he said.“What have we done, what has this poor thing done,that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst usstill, send down from the pagan world of old, thatsuch things must be, and in such way? This poormother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think,does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul,and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her,or she die, then both die. Oh, how we are beset! Howare all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he jumped to his feet. “Come,” hesaid.”come, we must see and act. Devils or no devils,or all the devils at once, it matters not. We must fighthim all the same.” He went to the hall door for hisbag, and together we went up to Lucy’s room. Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsingwent towards the bed. This time he did not start as helooked on the poor face with the same awful, waxenpallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness andinfinite pity. “As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing in-spiration of his which meant so much. Without a wordhe went and locked the door, and then began to setout on the little table the instruments for yet anotheroperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago rec-ognized the necessity, and begun to take off my coat,but he stopped me with a warning hand. “No!” he said.“Today you must operate. I shall provide. You are weak-ened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat androlled up his shirtsleeve. Again the operation. Again the narcotic. Again somereturn of color to the ashy cheeks, and the regularbreathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilstVan Helsing recruited himself and rested. Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs.Westenra that she must not remove anything fromChapter 11165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Lucy’s room without consulting him. That the flowerswere of medicinal value, and that the breathing of theirodor was a part of the system of cure. Then he tookover the care of the case himself, saying that he wouldwatch this night and the next, and would send meword when to come. After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, freshand bright and seemingly not much the worse for herterrible ordeal. What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder ifmy long habit of life amongst the insane is beginningto tell upon my own brain.LUCY WESTENRA’S DIARY17 September.—Four days and nights of peace. I amgetting so strong again that I hardly know myself. Itis as if I had passed through some long nightmare, andhad just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine andfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have adim half remembrance of long, anxious times of wait-ing and fearing, darkness in which there was not eventhe pain of hope to make present distress more poi-gnant. And then long spells of oblivion, and the risingback to life as a diver coming up through a great pressof water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been withme, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away.The noises that used to frighten me out of my wits,the flapping against the windows, the distant voiceswhich seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds thatcame from I know not where and commanded me to doI know not what, have all ceased. I go to bed nowwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keepawake. I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and aboxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem.

Thomas Bilder lives in one ofthe cottages in the enclosure behind the elephanthouse, and was just sitting down to his tea when Ifound him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,elderly, and without children, and if the specimen Ienjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind,their lives must be pretty comfortable. The keeperwould not enter on what he called business until thesupper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then whenthe table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said, “Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.You’ll excoose me refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunalsubjucts afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jack-als and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore Ibegins to arsk them questions.” “How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried,wishful to get him into a talkative humor. “ `Ittin’ of them over the `ead with a pole is one way.Chapter 11167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Scratchin’ of their ears in another, when gents as isflush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals.

He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of.I’m more surprised at ‘im for wantin’ to get out norany other animile in the place.

Well, larst night, so soon as the moonwas hup, the wolves here all began a-‘owling. Therewarn’t nothing for them to ‘owl at. There warn’t noone near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Parkroad. Once or twice I went out to see that all wasright, and it was, and then the ‘owling stopped. Justbefore twelve o’clock I just took a look round aforeturnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite toold Bersicker’s cage I see the rails broken and twistedabout and the cage empty.

If a man like you, who knows theanimals from experience, can’t hazard a good guess atany rate, who is even to try?” “Well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way.

I have always thoughtthat a wild animal never looks so well as when someobstacle of pronounced durability is between us. Apersonal experience has intensified rather than dimin-ished that idea. After all, however, there is nothing like custom, forneither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of thewolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was apeaceful and well-behaved as that father of all pic-ture-wolves, Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilstmoving her confidence in masquerade. The whole scene was a unutterable mixture of com-edy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for a half a dayhad paralyzed London and set all the children in townshivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of peni-tent mood, and was received and petted like a sort ofvulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all overwith most tender solicitude, and when he had finishedwith his penitent said, “There, I knew the poor old chap would get into somekind of trouble.

SEWARD’S DIARY17 September.—I was engaged after dinner in my studyposting up my books, which, through press of otherwork and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadlyinto arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and inrushed my patient, with his face distorted with pas-sion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patientgetting of his own accord into the Superintendent’s studyis almost unknown. Without an instant’s notice he made straight at me.He had a dinner knife in his hand, and as I saw he wasdangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. Hewas too quick and too strong for me, however, forbefore I could get my balance he had struck at me andcut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I got in myright hand and he was sprawling on his back on thefloor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trick-led on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was notintent on further effort, and occupied myself bindingup my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate fig-ure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, andwe turned our attention to him, his employment posi-tively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on thefloor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallenfrom my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and tomy surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly,simply repeating over and over again, “The blood isthe life!

This is an exact record of what took placetonight. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barelystrength to write, but it must be done if I die in thedoing. I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowerswere placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fellasleep. I was waked by the flapping at the window, whichChapter 11174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff atWhitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know sowell. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Sewardwas in the next room, as Dr. Van Helsing said he wouldbe, so that I might have called him. I tried to sleep,but I could not. Then there came to me the old fear ofsleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleepwould try to come then when I did not want it. So, asI feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out.“Is there anybody there?” There was no answer. I wasafraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howllike a dog’s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to thewindow and looked out, but could see nothing, ex-cept a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting itswings against the window. So I went back to bed again,but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the dooropened, and mother looked in. Seeing by my movingthat I was not asleep, she came in and sat by me. Shesaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont,“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to seethat you were all right.” I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and askedher to come in and sleep with me, so she came intobed, and lay down beside me. She did not take off herdressing gown, for she said she would only stay a whileand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there inmy arms, and I in hers the flapping and buffeting cameto the window again. She was startled and a little fright-ened, and cried out, “What is that?” I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and shelay quiet. But I could hear her poor dear heart stillbeating terribly. After a while there was the howl againout in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was acrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass washurled on the floor. The window blind blew back withthe wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of thebroken panes there was the head of a great, gauntChapter 11175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"gray wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into asitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything thatwould help her. Amongst other things, she clutchedthe wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted onmy wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me.For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf,and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in herthroat. Then she fell over, as if struck with lightning,and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for amoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I keptmy eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew hishead back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemsto come blowing in through the broken window, andwheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust thattravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert.I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, anddear Mother’s poor body, which seemed to grow coldalready, for her dear heart had ceased to beat, weighedme down, and I remembered no more for a while. The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, tillI recovered consciousness again. Somewhere near, apassing bell was tolling. The dogs all round the neigh-borhood were howling, and in our shrubbery, seem-ingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I wasdazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness,but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voiceof my dead mother come back to comfort me. Thesounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for Icould hear their bare feet pattering outside my door.I called to them, and they came in, and when they sawwhat had happened, and what it was that lay over meon the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed inthrough the broken window, and the door slammedto. They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laidher, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I hadChapter 11176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that Idirected them to go to the dining room and each havea glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant andclosed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in abody to the dining room, and I laid what flowers I hadon my dear mother’s breast. When they were there Iremembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but Ididn’t like to remove them, and besides, I would havesome of the servants to sit up with me now. I wassurprised that the maids did not come back. I calledthem, but got no answer, so I went to the dining roomto look for them. My heart sank when I saw what had happened. Theyall four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily.The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, butthere was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, andlooking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle whichMother’s doctor uses for her—oh! did use—was empty.What am I to do? What am I to do? I am back in theroom with Mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone,save for the sleeping servants, whom some one hasdrugged. Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for Ican hear the low howl of the wolf through the brokenwindow. The air seems full of specks, floating and circling inthe draught from the window, and the lights burn blueand dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harmthis night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, wherethey shall find it when they come to lay me out. Mydear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Goodbye,dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night. Godkeep you, dear, and God help me!Chapter 11177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12DR. SEWARD’S DIARY18 September.—I drove at once to Hillingham and ar-rived early. Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up theavenue alone. I knocked gently and rang as quietly aspossible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother,and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After awhile, finding no response, I knocked and rang again,still no answer. I cursed the laziness of the servantsthat they should lie abed at such an hour, for it wasnow ten o’clock, and so rang and knocked again, butmore impatiently, but still without response. HithertoI had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fearbegan to assail me. Was this desolation but anotherlink in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tightround us? Was it indeed a house of death to which Ihad come, too late? I know that minutes, even sec-onds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, ifshe had had again one of those frightful relapses, andI went round the house to try if I could find by chancean entry anywhere. I could find no means of ingress. Every window anddoor was fastened and locked, and I returned baffledto the porch. As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of aswiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the gate,and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running upthe avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out, “Then itwas you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we toolate? Did you not get my telegram?” I answered as quickly and coherently as I could thatI had only got his telegram early in the morning, andhad not a minute in coming here, and that I could notmake any one in the house hear me. He paused andraised his hat as he said solemnly, “Then I fear we aretoo late. God’s will be done!”Chapter 12178"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" With his usual recuperative energy, he went on,“Come. If there be no way open to get in, we mustmake one. Time is all in all to us now.” We went round to the back of the house, where therewas a kitchen window. The Professor took a small sur-gical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointedto the iron bars which guarded the window. I attackedthem at once and had very soon cut through three ofthem. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back thefastening of the sashes and opened the window. Ihelped the Professor in, and followed him. There wasno one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, whichwere close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we wentalong, and in the dining room, dimly lit by rays oflight through the shutters, found four servant womenlying on the floor. There was no need to think themdead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smellof laudanum in the room left no doubt as to theircondition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as wemoved away he said, “We can attend to them later.”Thenwe ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two wepaused at the door to listen, but there was no soundthat we could hear. With white faces and tremblinghands, we opened the door gently, and entered theroom. How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed laytwo women, Lucy and her mother. The latter lay far-thest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, theedge of which had been blown back by the droughtthrough the broken window, showing the drawn, white,face, with a look of terror fixed upon it. By her sidelay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn. Theflowers which had been round her neck we found uponher mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showingthe two little wounds which we had noticed before,but looking horribly white and mangled. Without aword the Professor bent over the bed, his head almostChapter 12179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"touching poor Lucy’s breast. Then he gave a quick turnof his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to hisfeet, he cried out to me, “It is not yet too late! Quick!Quick! Bring the brandy!” I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking careto smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged likethe decanter of sherry which I found on the table. Themaids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and Ifancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did notstay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. Herubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lipsand gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands.He said to me, “I can do this, all that can be at thepresent. You go wake those maids. Flick them in theface with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make themget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul isnearly as cold as that beside her. She will need beheated before we can do anything more.” I went at once, and found little difficulty in wakingthree of the women. The fourth was only a young girl,and the drug had evidently affected her more stronglyso I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrancecame back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysteri-cal manner. I was stern with them, however, and wouldnot let them talk. I told them that one life was badenough to lose, and if they delayed they would sacri-fice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying they went abouttheir way, half clad as they were, and prepared fireand water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fireswere still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. Wegot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placedher in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs therewas a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off,hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Thenshe returned and whispered to us that there was agentleman who had come with a message from Mr.Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he mustChapter 12180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"wait, for we could see no one now. She went awaywith the message, and, engrossed with our work, Iclean forgot all about him. I never saw in all my experience the Professor workin such deadly earnest. I knew, as he knew, that it wasa stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told himso. He answered me in a way that I did not under-stand, but with the sternest look that his face couldwear. “If that were all, I would stop here where we arenow, and let her fade away into peace, for I see nolight in life over her horizon.” He went on with hiswork with, if possible, renewed and more frenziedvigour. Presently we both began to be conscious that theheat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy’s heartbeat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and herlungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s facealmost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath androlled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me, “Thefirst gain is ours! Check to the King!” We took Lucy into another room, which had by nowbeen prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a fewdrops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that VanHelsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat.She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, ifnot worse than, we had ever seen her. Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told herto stay with her and not to take her eyes off her tillwe returned, and then beckoned me out of the room. “We must consult as to what is to be done,” he saidas we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened thedining room door, and we passed in, he closing thedoor carefully behind him. The shutters had beenopened, but the blinds were already down, with thatobedience to the etiquette of death which the Britishwoman of the lower classes always rigidly observes.The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however,Chapter 12181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"light enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternnesswas somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He wasevidently torturing his mind about something, so Iwaited for an instant, and he spoke. “What are we to do now? Where are we to turn forhelp? We must have another transfusion of blood, andthat soon, or that poor girl’s life won’t be worth anhour’s purchase. You are exhausted already. I am ex-hausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if theywould have courage to submit. What are we to do forsomeone who will open his veins for her?” “What’s the matter with me, anyhow?” The voice came from the sofa across the room, andits tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for theywere those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, buthis face softened and a glad look came into his eyes asI cried out, “Quincey Morris!” and rushed towards himwith outstretched hands. “What brought you her?” I cried as our hands met. “I guess Art is the cause.” He handed me a telegram.—‘Have not heard fromSeward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Can-not leave. Father still in same condition. Send meword how Lucy is. Do not delay.—Holmwood.’ “I think I came just in the nick of time. You knowyou have only to tell me what to do.” Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, look-ing him straight in the eyes as he said, “A brave man’sblood is the best thing on this earth when a woman isin trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devilmay work against us for all he’s worth, but God sendsus men when we want them.” Once again we went through that ghastly operation.I have not the heart to go through with the details.Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her morethan before, for though plenty of blood went into herveins, her body did not respond to the treatment asChapter 12182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back intolife was something frightful to see and hear. However,the action of both heart and lungs improved, and VanHelsing made a sub-cutaneous injection of morphia,as before, and with good effect. Her faint became aprofound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I wentdownstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of themaids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine,and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Thena thought struck me, and I went back to the roomwhere Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I foundVan Helsing with a sheet or two of note paper in hishand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking itover as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was alook of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who hashad a doubt solved. He handed me the paper sayingonly, “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when we carriedher to the bath.” When I had read it, I stook looking at the Professor,and after a pause asked him, “In God’s name, what doesit all mean? Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort ofhorrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I didnot know what to say more. Van Helsing put out hishand and took the paper, saying, “Do not trouble about it now. Forget if for the present.You shall know and understand it all in good time, butit will be later. And now what is it that you came tome to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I wasall myself again. “I came to speak about the certificate of death. If wedo not act properly and wisely, there may be an in-quest, and that paper would have to be produced. I amin hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had itwould surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know,and you know, and the other doctor who attended herknows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart,and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill upChapter 12183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself tothe registrar and go on to the undertaker.” “Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! TrulyMiss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is atleast happy in the friends thatlove her. One, two, three,all open their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah,yes, I know, friend John. I am not blind! I love you allthe more for it! Now go.” In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram forArthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead, thatLucy also had been ill, but was now going on better,and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told himwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I wasgoing said, “When you come back, Jack, may I have two wordswith you all to ourselves?” I nodded in reply and wentout. I found no difficulty about the registration, andarranged with the local undertaker to come up in theevening to measure for the coffin and to make arrange-ments. When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I toldhim I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, andwent up to her room. She was still sleeping, and theProfessor seemingly had not moved from his seat ather side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gath-ered that he expected her to wake before long andwas afraid of fore-stalling nature. So I went down toQuincey and took him into the breakfast room, wherethe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a littlemore cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the otherrooms. When we were alone, he said to me, “Jack Seward, Idon’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve noright to be, but this is no ordinary case. You know Iloved that girl and wanted to marry her, but althoughthat’s all past and gone, I can’t help feeling anxiousabout her all the same. What is it that’s wrong withher? The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow is is, I canChapter 12184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"see that, said that time you two came into the room,that you must have another transfusion of blood, andthat both you and he were exhausted. Now I knowwell that you medical men speak in camera, and that aman must not expect to know what they consult aboutin private. But this is no common matter, and what-ever it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?” “That’s so,” I said, and he went on. “I take it that both you and Van Helsing had donealready what I did today. Is not that so?” “That’s so.” “And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him fourdays ago down at his own place he looked queer. Ihave not seen anything pulled down so quick since Iwas on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond ofgo to grass all in a night. One of those big bats thatthey call vampires had got at her in the night, andwhat with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn’tenough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had toput a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you maytell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was thefirst, is not that so?” As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.He was in a torture of suspense regarding the womanhe loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mys-tery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the man-hood of him, and there was a royal lot of it, too, tokeep him from breaking down. I paused before an-swering, for I felt that I must not betray anythingwhich the Professor wished kept secret, but alreadyhe knew so much, and guessed so much, that therecould be no reason for not answering, so I answered inthe same phrase. “That’s so.” “And how long has this been going on?” “About ten days.” “Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poorChapter 12185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"pretty creature that we all love has had put into herveins within that time the blood of four strong men.Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then com-ing close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper. “Whattook it out?” I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. VanHelsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits’end. I can’t even hazard a guess. There has been a se-ries of little circumstances which have thrown out allour calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until allbe well, or ill.” Quincey held out his hand. “Count me in,” he said.“You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, andI’ll do it.” When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first move-ment was to feel in her breast, and to my surprise,produced the paper which Van Helsing had given meto read. The careful Professor had replaced it where ithad come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.Her eyes then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, andgladdened. Then she looked round the room, and see-ing where she was, shuddered. She gave a loud cry,and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what was meant, that she hadrealized to the full her mother’s death. So we triedwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathyeased her somewhat, but she was very low in thoughtand spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a longtime. We told her that either or both of us would nowremain with her all the time, and that seemed to com-fort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a veryodd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took thepaper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsingstepped over and took the pieces from her. All thesame, however, she went on with the action of tear-ing, as though the material were still in her hands.Finally she lifted her hands and opened them as thoughChapter 12186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised,and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he saidnothing.19 September.—All last night she slept fitfully, beingalways afraid to sleep, and something weaker whenshe woke from it. The Professor and I took in turns towatch, and we never left her for a moment unattended.Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but Iknew that all night long he patrolled round and roundthe house. When the day came, its searching light showed theravages in poor Lucy’s strength. She was hardly ableto turn her head, and the little nourishment which shecould take seemed to do her no good. At times sheslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the differ-ence in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleepshe looked stronger, although more haggard, and herbreathing was softer. Her open mouth showed the palegums drawn back from the teeth, which looked posi-tively longer and sharper than usual. When she wokethe softness of her eyes evidently changed the expres-sion, for she looked her own self, although a dyingone. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and wetelegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him atthe station. When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and thesun was setting full and warm, and the red lightstreamed in through the window and gave more colorto the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was sim-ply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or thecomatose condition that passed for it, had grown morefrequent, so that the pauses when conversation waspossible were shortened. Arthur’s presence, however,seemed to act as a stimulant. She rallied a little, andspoke to him more brightly than she had done sincewe arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spokeChapter 12187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made ofeverything. It is now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsingare sitting with her. I am to relieve them in a quarterof an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy’s phono-graph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. I fearthat tomorrow will end our watching, for the shockhas been too great. The poor child cannot rally.

You will pardon me, I know, for all myfaults when you have read all my budget of news. Well,I got my husband back all right. When we arrived atExeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it,though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He tookus to his house, where there were rooms for us all niceand comfortable, and we dined together.

He is beginning toput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terriblyweakened by the long illness. Even now he sometimesstarts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes alltrembling until I can coax him back to his usual pla-cidity.

Withregard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. Hehas had another outbreak, which might have had adreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened,was unattended with any unhappy results. This after-noon a carrier’s cart with two men made a call at theempty house whose grounds abut on ours, the houseto which, you will remember, the patient twice ranaway. The men stopped at our gate to ask the portertheir way, as they were strangers. “I was myself looking out of the study window, hav-ing a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them comeup to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield’sroom, the patient began to rate him from within, andcalled him all the foul names he could lay his tongueto. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, con-tented himself by telling him to ‘shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar’, whereon our man accused him ofrobbing him and wanting to murder him and said thathe would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I openedthe window and signed to the man not to notice, so hecontented himself after looking the place over andmaking up his mind as to what kind of place he hadgot to by saying, ‘Lor’ bless yer, sir, I wouldn’t mindwhat was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I pity yeand the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with awild beast like that.’ “Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I toldhim where the gate of the empty house was. He wentaway followed by threats and curses and revilings fromChapter 12190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"our man. I went down to see if I could make out anycause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing ofthe kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my aston-ishment, quite composed and most genial in his man-ner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but heblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, andled me to believe that he was completely oblivious ofthe affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, onlyanother instance of his cunning, for within half anhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken outthrough the window of his room, and was running downthe avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me,and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on somemischief. My fear was justified when I saw the samecart which had passed before coming down the road,having on it some great wooden boxes. The men werewiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face,as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up tohim, the patient rushed at them, and pulling one ofthem off the cart, began to knock his head against theground. If I had not seized him just at the moment, Ibelieve he would have killed the man there and then.The other fellow jumped down and struck him overthe head with the butt end of his heavy whip. It was ahorrible blow, but he did not seem to mind it, butseized him also, and struggled with the three of us,pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know Iam no lightweight, and the others were both burlymen. At first he was silent in his fighting, but as webegan to master him, and the attendants were puttinga strait waistcoat on him, he began to shout, ‘I’ll frus-trate them! They shan’t rob me! They shan’t murder meby inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’and allsorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with veryconsiderable difficulty that they got him back to thehouse and put him in the padded room. One of theattendants, Hardy, had a finger broken.

Their threats were, how-ever, mingled with some sort of indirect apology forthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman.They said that if it had not been for the way theirstrength had been spent in carrying and raising theheavy boxes to the cart they would have made shortwork of him. They gave as another reason for theirdefeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which theyhad been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupa-tion and the reprehensible distance from the scene oftheir labors of any place of public entertainment. I quiteunderstood their drift, and after a stiff glass of stronggrog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sover-eign in hand, they made light of the attack, and sworethat they would encounter a worse madman any day forthe pleasure of meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ asyour correspondent.

But it is here that the graveshock that he experienced tells upon him the most.Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strongnature such as his, a nature which enabled him by ourdear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master ina few years, should be so injured that the very essenceof its strength is gone.

Forgiveme for troubling you. With all blessings,“Your loving,“Mina Harker”DR. SEWARD’ DIARY20 September.—Only resolution and habit can let memake an entry tonight. I am too miserable, too lowspirited, too sick of the world and all in it, includinglife itself, that I would not care if I heard this momentthe flapping of the wings of the angel of death. Andhe has been flapping those grim wings to some pur-pose of late, Lucy’s mother and Arthur’s father, andnow... . Let me get on with my work. I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused atfirst. It was only when I told him that we should wanthim to help us during the day, and that we must notall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suf-fer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,”he said. “Come with me. You are sick and weak, andhave had much sorrow and much mental pain, as wellas that tax on your strength that we know of. Youmust not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fearsand alarms. Come to the drawing room, where there isa big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie onone, and I on the other, and our sympathy will becomfort to each other, even though we do not speak,and even if we sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longinglook on Lucy’s face, which lay in her pillow, almostwhiter than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I lookedaround the room to see that all was as it should be. Icould see that the Professor had carried out in thisroom, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic.Chapter 12194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, andround Lucy’s neck, over the silk handkerchief whichVan Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet ofthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and herface was at its worst, for the open mouth showed thepale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light,seemed longer and sharper than they had been in themorning. In particular, by some trick of the light, thecanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down beside her, and presently she moved un-easily. At the same moment there came a sort of dullflapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to itsoftly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. Therewas a full moonlight, and I could see that the noisewas made by a great bat, which wheeled around, doubt-less attracted by the light, although so dim, and ev-ery now and again struck the window with its wings.When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy hadmoved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowersfrom her throat. I replaced them as well as I could,and sat watching her. Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as VanHelsinghad prescribed. She took but a little, and thatlanguidly. There did not seem to be with her now theunconscious struggle for life and strength that hadhitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curiousthat the moment she became conscious she pressedthe garlic flowers close to her. It was certainly oddthat whenever she got into that lethargic state, withthe stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her,but that when she waked she clutched them close. Therewas no possibility of making amy mistake about this,for in the long hours that followed, she had many spellsof sleeping and waking and repeated both actions manytimes. At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthurhad then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let himChapter 12195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face I could hear thesissing indraw of breath, and he said to me in a sharpwhisper.”Draw up the blind. I want light!” Then hebent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s,examined her carefully. He removed the flowers andlifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he didso he started back and I could hear his ejaculation,“Mein Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bentover and looked, too, and as I noticed some queerchill came over me. The wounds on the throat hadabsolutely disappeared. For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking ather, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to meand said calmly, “She is dying. It will not be longnow. It will be much difference, mark me, whethershe dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy,and let him come and see the last. He trusts us, and wehave promised him.” I went to the dining room and waked him. He wasdazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlightstreaming in through the edges of the shutters hethought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assuredhim that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gentlyas I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that theend was near. He covered his face with his hands, andslid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilsthis shoulders shook with grief. I took him by thehand and raised him up. “Come,” I said, “my dear oldfellow, summon all your fortitude. It will be best andeasiest for her.” When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that VanHelsing had, with his usual forethought, been puttingmatters straight and making everything look as pleas-ing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s hair, sothat it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.When we came into the room she opened her eyes, andseeing him, whispered softly, “Arthur! Oh, my love, IChapter 12196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing mo-tioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not yet! Holdher hand, it will comfort her more.” So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, andshe looked her best, with all the soft lines matchingthe angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyesclosed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breastheaved softly, and her breath came and went like atired child’s. And then insensibly there came the strange changewhich I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grewstertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums,drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharperthan ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, uncon-scious way she opened her eyes, which were now dulland hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,such as I had never heard from her lips, “Arthur! Oh,my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, but at that in-stant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled byher voice, swooped upon him, and catching him bythe neck with both hands, dragged him back with afury of strength which I never thought he could havepossessed, and actually hurled him almost across theroom. “Not on your life!” he said, “not for your living souland hers!” And he stood between them like a lion atbay. Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a mo-ment know what to do or say, and before any impulseof violence could seize him he realized the place andthe occasion, and stood silent, waiting. I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, andwe saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over herface. The sharp teeth clamped together. Then her eyesclosed, and she breathed heavily. Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all theirChapter 12197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand,took Van Helsing’s great brown one, drawing it closeto her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in afaint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend,and his! Oh, guard him, and give me peace!” “I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside herand holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath.Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him, “Come, mychild, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the fore-head, and only once.” Their eyes met instead of their lips, and so theyparted. Lucy’s eyes closed, and Van Helsing, who hadbeen watching closely, took Arthur’s arm, and drewhim away. And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again,and all at once it ceased. “It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!” I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to thedrawing room, where he sat down, and covered hisface with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly brokeme down to see. I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing lookingat poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than eve. Somechange had come over her body. Death had given backpart of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recov-ered some of their flowing lines. Even the lips had losttheir deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longerneeded for the working of the heart, had gone to makethe harshness of death as little rude as might be. “We thought her dying whilst she slept, And sleep-ing when she died.” I stood beside Van Helsing, and said, “Ah well, poorgirl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!” He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, “Notso, alas! Not so. It is only the beginning!” When I asked him what he meant, he only shook hishead and answered, “We can do nothing as yet. Waitand see.”Chapter 12198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—cont.The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day,so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together.I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the ur-bane undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted, orblessed, with something of his own obsequious sua-vity. Even the woman who performed the last officesfor the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from thedeath chamber, “She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite aprivilege to attend on her. It’s not too much to saythat she will do credit to our establishment!” I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. Thiswas possible from the disordered state of things in thehousehold. There were no relatives at hand, and asArthur had to be back the next day to attend at hisfather’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one whoshould have been bidden. Under the circumstances,Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examinepapers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s pa-pers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he,being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of Englishlegal requirements, and so might in ignorance makesome unnecessary trouble. He answered me, “I know, I know. You forget that Iam a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not alto-gether for the law. You knew that, when you avoidedthe coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There maybe papers more, such as this.” As he spoke he took from his pocket book the memo-randum which had been in Lucy’s breast, and whichshe had torn in her sleep. “When you find anything of the solicitor who is forChapter 13199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and writehim tonight. For me, I watch here in the room and inMiss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself search forwhat may be. It is not well that her very thoughts gointo the hands of strangers.” I went on with my part of the work, and in anotherhalf hour had found the name and address of Mrs.Westenra’s solicitor and had written to him. All thepoor lady’s papers were in order. Explicit directionsregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardlysealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsingwalked into the room, saying, “Can I help you friend John? I am free, and if I may,my service is to you.” “Have you got what you looked for?” I asked. To which he replied, “I did not look for any specificthing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all thatthere was, only some letters and a few memoranda,and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and weshall for the present say nothing of them. I shall seethat poor lad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanc-tion, I shall use some.” When we had finished the work in hand, he said tome, “And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. Wewant sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate.Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!” Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. Theundertaker had certainly done his work well, for theroom was turned into a small chapelle ardente. Therewas a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and deathwas made as little repulsive as might be. The end ofthe winding sheet was laid over the face. When theProfessor bent over and turned it gently back, we bothstarted at the beauty before us. The tall wax candlesshowing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’sloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hoursthat had passed, instead of leaving traces of ‘decay’sChapter 13200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"effacing fingers’, had but restored the beauty of life,till positively I could not believe my eyes that I waslooking at a corpse. The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not lovedher as I had, and there was no need for tears in hiseyes. He said to me, “Remain till I return,” and leftthe room. He came back with a handful of wild garlicfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had notbeen opened, and placed the flowers amongst the oth-ers on and around the bed. Then he took from hisneck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placedit over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place,and we came away. I was undressing in my own room, when, with a pre-monitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once be-gan to speak. “Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, aset of post-mortem knives.” “Must we make an autopsy?” I asked. “Yes and no. I want to operate, but not what youthink. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another.I want to cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah!You a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seenwith no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of lifeand death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I mustnot forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her,and I have not forgotten it for is I that shall operate,and you must not help. I would like to do it tonight,but for Arthur I must not. He will be free after hisfather’s funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see her,to see it. Then, when she is coffined ready for the nextday, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shallunscrew the coffin lid, and shall do our operation,and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone.” “But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilateher poor body without need? And if there is no neces-sity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it, nogood to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge,Chapter 13201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"why do it? Without such it is monstrous.” For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said,with infinite tenderness, “Friend John, I pity your poorbleeding heart, and I love you the more because itdoes so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself theburden that you do bear. But there are things that youknow not, but that you shall know, and bless me forknowing, though they are not pleasant things. John,my child, you have been my friend now many years,and yet did you ever know me to do any without goodcause? I may err, I am but man, but I believe in all Ido. Was it not for these causes that you send for mewhen the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed,nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss hislove, though she was dying, and snatched him awayby all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw how shethanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice,too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand andbless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promiseto her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes! “Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do.You have for many years trust me. You have believe meweeks past, when there be things so strange that youmight have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friendJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think,and that is not perhaps well. And if I work, as work Ishall, no matter trust or no trust, without my friendtrust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh solonely when I want all help and courage that may be!”He paused a moment and went on solemnly, “FriendJohn, there are strange and terrible days before us.Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a goodend. Will you not have faith in me?” I took his hand, and promised him. I held my dooropen as he went away, and watched him go to his roomand close the door. As I stood without moving, I sawone of the maids pass silently along the passage, shehad her back to me, so did not see me, and go into theChapter 13202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotionis so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show itunasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl put-ting aside the terrors which she naturally had of deathto go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whomshe loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonelytill laid to eternal rest. I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broaddaylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming intomy room. He came over to my bedside and said, “Youneed not trouble about the knives. We shall not doit.” “Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the nightbefore had greatly impressed me. “Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late, or too early.See!” Here he held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.” “How stolen, “I asked in wonder, “since you have itnow?” “Because I get it back from the worthless wretch whostole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and theliving. Her punishment will surely come, but notthrough me. She knew not altogether what she did,and thus unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”He went away on the word, leaving me with a newmystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with. The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the so-licitor came, Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons,Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial and veryappreciative of what we had done, and took off ourhands all cares as to details. During lunch he told usthat Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected suddendeath from her heart, and had put her affairs in abso-lute order. He informed us that, with the exception ofa certain entailed property of Lucy’s father which now,in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branchof the family, the whole estate, real and personal, wasleft absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had toldChapter 13203"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"us so much he went on, “Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamen-tary disposition, and pointed out certain contingen-cies that might leave her daughter either penniless ornot so free as she should be to act regarding a matri-monial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so farthat we almost came into collision, for she asked us ifwe were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes.Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times outof a hundred we should have proved, by the logic ofevents, the accuracy of our judgment. “Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case anyother form of disposition would have rendered impos-sible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her prede-ceasing her daughter the latter would have come intopossession of the property, and, even had she onlysurvived her mother by five minutes, her propertywould, in case there were no will, and a will was apractical impossibility in such a case, have been treatedat her decease as under intestacy. In which case LordGodalming, though so dear a friend, would have hadno claim in the world. And the inheritors, being re-mote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights,for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. Iassure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result,perfectly rejoiced.” He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the onelittle part, in which he was officially interested, of sogreat a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limita-tions of sympathetic understanding. He did not remain long, but said he would look inlater in the day and see Lord Godalming. His coming,however, had been a certain comfort to us, since itassured us that we should not have to dread hostilecriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected atfive o’clock, so a little before that time we visited thedeath chamber. It was so in very truth, for now bothChapter 13204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true tohis craft, had made the best display he could of hisgoods, and there was a mortuary air about the placethat lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to beadhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming wascoming very soon, it would be less harrowing to hisfeelings to see all that was left of his fiancee quitealone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidityand exerted himself to restore things to the conditionin which we left them the night before, so that whenArthur came such shocks to his feelings as we couldavoid were saved. Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken.Even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunksomewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions.He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedlyattached to his father, and to lose him, and at such atime, was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warmas ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous.But I could not help seeing that there was some con-straint with him. The professor noticed it too, andmotioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and lefthim at the door of the room, as I felt he would like tobe quite alone with her, but he took my arm and ledme in, saying huskily, “You loved her too, old fellow. She told me all aboutit, and there was no friend had a closer place in herheart than you. I don’t know how to thank you for allyou have done for her. I can’t think yet... .” Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his armsround my shoulders and laid his head on my breast,crying, “Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do? The whole oflife seems gone from me all at once, and there is noth-ing in the wide world for me to live for.” I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases mendo not need much expression. A grip of the hand, theChapter 13205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in uni-son, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s heart.I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, andthen I said softly to him, “Come and look at her.” Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted thelawn from her face. God! How beautiful she was. Everyhour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It fright-ened and amazed me somewhat. And as for Arthur, hefell to trembling, and finally was shaken with doubtas with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said tome in a faint whisper, “Jack, is she really dead?” I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on tosuggest, for I felt that such a horrible doubt shouldnot have life for a moment longer than I could help,that it often happened that after death faces becomesoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty,that this was especially so when death had been pre-ceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. I seemedto quite do away with any doubt, and after kneelingbeside the couch for a while and looking at her lov-ingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that thatmust be goodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared, sohe went back and took her dead hand in his and kissedit, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He cameaway, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her ashe came. I left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsingthat he had said goodbye, so the latter went to thekitchen to tell the undertaker’s men to proceed withthe preperations and to screw up the coffin. When hecame out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s ques-tion, and he replied, “I am not surprised. Just now Idoubted for a moment myself!”We all dined together, and I could see that poor Artwas trying to make the best of things. Van Helsinghad been silent all dinner time, but when we had litour cigars he said, “Lord...,” but Arthur interruptedhim.Chapter 13206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" “No, no, not that, for God’s sake! Not yet at any rate.Forgive me, sir. I did not mean to speak offensively. Itis only because my loss is so recent.” The Professor answered very sweetly, “I only usedthat name because I was in doubt. I must not call you‘Mr.’ and I have grown to love you, yes, my dear boy,to love you, as Arthur.” Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’swarmly. “Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope Imay always have the title of a friend. And let me saythat I am at a loss for words to thank you for yourgoodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, andwent on, “I know that she understood your goodnesseven better than I do. And if I was rude or in any waywanting at that time you acted so, you remember,”—the Professor nodded—”You must forgive me.” He answered with a grave kindness, “I know it washard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust suchviolence needs to understand, and I take it that youdo not, that you cannot, trust me now, for you do notyet understand. And there may be more times when Ishall want you to trust when you cannot, and maynot, and must not yet understand. But the time willcome when your trust shall be whole and complete inme, and when you shall understand as though the sun-light himself shone through. Then you shall bless mefrom first to last for your own sake, and for the sakeof others, and for her dear sake to whom I swore toprotect.” “And indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly. “I shallin all ways trust you. I know and believe you have avery noble heart, and you are Jack’s friend, and youwere hers. You shall do what you like.” The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, asthough about to speak, and finally said, “May I askyou something now?” “Certainly.” “You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her prop-Chapter 13207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"erty?” “No, poor dear. I never thought of it.” “And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal withit as you will. I want you to give me permission toread all Miss Lucy’s papers and letters. Believe me, it isno idle curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure,she would have approved. I have them all here. I tookthem before we knew that all was yours, so that nostrange hand might touch them, no strange eye lookthrough words into her soul. I shall keep them, if Imay. Even you may not see them yet, but I shall keepthem safe. No word shall be lost, and in the good timeI shall give them back to you. It is a hard thing that Iask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy’s sake?” Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, “Dr. VanHelsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in say-ing this I am doing what my dear one would have ap-proved. I shall not trouble you with questions till thetime comes.” The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, “Andyou are right. There will be pain for us all, but it willnot be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We andyou too, you most of all, dear boy, will have to passthrough the bitter water before we reach the sweet.But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and doour duty, and all will be well!” I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. VanHelsing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, asif patroling the house, and was never out of sight ofthe room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with thewild garlic flowers, which sent through the odor oflily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into thenight.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL22 September.—In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleep-ing. It seems only yesterday that the last entry wasChapter 13208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby andall the world before me, Jonathan away and no newsof him, and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a so-licitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr.Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with anotherattack that may harm him. Some day he may ask meabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand,see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so it maybe as well to freshen it up again with an exercise any-how. The service was very simple and very solemn. Therewere only ourselves and the servants there, one or twoold friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and agentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the Presi-dent of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and Istood hand in hand, and we felt that our best anddearest friend was gone from us. We came back to town quietly, taking a bus to HydePark Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me togo into the Row for a while, so we sat down. But therewere very few people there, and it was sad-lookingand desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made usthink of the empty chair at home. So we got up andwalked down Piccadilly. Jonathan was holding me bythe arm, the way he used to in the old days before Iwent to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’tgo on for some years teaching etiquette and decorumto other girls without the pedantry of it biting intoyourself a bit. But it was Jonathan, and he was myhusband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us,and we didn’t care if they did, so on we walked. I waslooking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheelhat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano’s, when I feltJonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, andhe said under his breath, “My God!” I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear thatsome nervous fit may upset him again. So I turned tohim quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbedChapter 13209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"him. He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging outas, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at atall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustacheand pointed beard, who was also observing the prettygirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not seeeither of us, and so I had a good view of him. His facewas not a good face. It was hard, and cruel, and sen-sual, and big white teeth, that looked all the whiterbecause his lips were so red, were pointed like ananimal’s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraidhe would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he lookedso fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was dis-turbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knewas much about it as he did, “Do you see who it is?” “No, dear,” I said. “I don’t know him, who is it?” Hisanswer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was saidas if he did not know that it was me, Mina, to whom hewas speaking. “It is the man himself!” The poor dear was evidently terrified at something,very greatly terrified. I do believe that if he had nothad me to lean on and to support him he would havesunk down. He kept staring. A man came out of theshop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, whothen drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed onher, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly hefollowed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom.Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if tohimself, “I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.My God, if this be so! Oh, my God! My God! If only Iknew! If only I knew!” He was distressing himself somuch that I feared to keep his mind on the subject byasking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drewaway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. Wewalked a little further, and then went in and sat for awhile in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn,and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.Chapter 13210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyesclosed, and he went quickly into a sleep, with his headon my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing forhim, so did not disturb him. In about twenty minuteshe woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully, “Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me forbeing so rude. Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea some-where.” He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger,as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episodehad reminded him of. I don’t like this lapsing intoforgetfulness. It may make or continue some injury tothe brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do moreharm than good, but I must somehow learn the factsof his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when Imust open the parcel, and know what is written. Oh,Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong,but it is for your own dear sake.Later.—A sad homecoming in every way, the houseempty of the dear soul who was so good to us. Jonathanstill pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady,and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he maybe. “You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenradied five days ago, and that Lucy died the day beforeyesterday. They were both buried today.” Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! PoorMrs. Westenra! Poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to returnto us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such a sweet-ness out of his life! God help us all to bear our troubles.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY-CONT.22 September.—It is all over. Arthur has gone back toRing, and has taken Quincey Morris with him. What afine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of heartsthat he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as any ofus, but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking.Chapter 13211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"If America can go on breeding men like that, she willbe a power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lyingdown, having a rest preparatory to his journey. Hegoes to Amsterdam tonight, but says he returns to-morrow night, that he only wants to make some ar-rangements which can only be made personally. He isto stop with me then, if he can. He says he has work todo in London which may take him some time. Poor oldfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has bro-ken down even his iron strength. All the time of theburial he was, I could see, putting some terrible re-straint on himself. When it was all over, we were stand-ing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking ofhis part in the operation where his blood had beentransfused to his Lucy’s veins. I could see Van Helsing’sface grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was say-ing that he felt since then as if they two had beenreally married, and that she was his wife in the sightof God. None of us said a word of the other operations,and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey wentaway together to the station, and Van Helsing and Icame on here. The moment we were alone in the car-riage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He hasdenied to me since that it was hysterics, and insistedthat it was only his sense of humor asserting itselfunder very terrible conditions.He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down theblinds lest any one should see us and misjudge. Andthen he cried, till he laughed again, and laughed andcried together, just as a woman does. I tried to bestern with him, as one is to a woman under the cir-cumstances, but it had no effect. Men and women areso different in manifestations of nervous strength orweakness! Then when his face grew grave and sternagain I asked him why his mirth, and why at such atime. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, forit was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said, “Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not thinkChapter 13212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have criedeven when the laugh did choke me. But no more thinkthat I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he comejust the same. Keep it always with you that laughterwho knock at your door and say, ‘May I come in?’ isnot true laughter. No! He is a king, and he come whenand how he like. He ask no person, he choose no timeof suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example Igrieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl. Igive my blood for her, though I am old and worn. Igive my time, my skill, my sleep. I let my other suffer-ers want that she may have all. And yet I can laugh ather very grave, laugh when the clay from the spade ofthe sexton drop upon her coffin and say ‘Thud, thud!’to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek.My heart bleed for that poor boy, that dear boy, so ofthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that helive, and with his hair and eyes the same. “There, you know now why I love him so. And yetwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart tothe quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him asto no other man, not even you, friend John, for we aremore level in experiences than father and son, yet evenat such a moment King Laugh he come to me and shoutand bellow in my ear,‘Here I am! Here I am!’ till theblood come dance back and bring some of the sun-shine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friendJohn, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full ofmiseries, and woes, and troubles. And yet when KingLaugh come, he make them all dance to the tune heplay. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the church-yard, and tears that burn as they fall, all dance to-gether to the music that he make with that smilelessmouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he isgood to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women arelike ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us differ-ent ways. Then tears come, and like the rain on theropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain be-Chapter 13213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"come too great, and we break. But King Laugh he comelike the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again, andwe bear to go on with our labor, what it may be.” I did not like to wound him by pretending not to seehis idea, but as I did not yet understand the cause ofhis laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his facegrew stern, and he said in quite a different tone, “Oh, it was the grim irony of it all, this so lovelylady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair aslife, till one by one we wondered if she were trulydead, she laid in that so fine marble house in thatlonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laidthere with the mother who loved her, and whom sheloved, and that sacred bell going “Toll! Toll! Toll!’ sosad and slow, and those holy men, with the white gar-ments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yetall the time their eyes never on the page, and all of uswith the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead,so! Is it not?” “Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’tsee anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your expres-sion makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even ifthe burial service was comic, what about poor Art andhis trouble? Why his heart was simply breaking.” “Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his bloodto her veins had made her truly his bride?” “Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.” “Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John.If so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Thenthis so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with mypoor wife dead to me, but alive by Church’s law, thoughno wits, all gone, even I, who am faithful husband tothis now-no-wife, am bigamist.” “I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” Isaid, and I did not feel particularly pleased with himfor saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm,and said, “Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not myChapter 13214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"feeling to others when it would wound, but only toyou, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you couldhave looked into my heart then when I want to laugh,if you could have done so when the laugh arrived, ifyou could do so now, when King Laugh have pack uphis crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, faraway from me, and for a long, long time, maybe youwould perhaps pity me the most of all.” I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and askedwhy. “Because I know!” And now we are all scattered, and for many a longday loneliness will sit over our roofs with broodingwings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly deathhouse in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming Lon-don, where the air is fresh, and the sun rises overHampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of theirown accord. So I can finish this diary, and God only knows if Ishall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open thisagain, it will be to deal with different people and dif-ferent themes, for here at the end, where the romanceof my life is told, ere I go back to take up the threadof my life-work, I say sadly and without hope, “FINIS”.THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER AHAMPSTEAD MYSTERY The neighborhood of Hampstead is just at presentexercised with a series of events which seem to run onlines parallel to those of what was known to the writ-ers of headlines and “The Kensington Horror,” or “TheStabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” Duringthe past two or three days several cases have occurredof young children straying from home or neglectingto return from their playing on the Heath. In all thesecases the children were too young to give any prop-erly intelligible account of themselves, but the con-Chapter 13215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"sensus of their excuses is that they had been with a“bloofer lady.” It has always been late in the eveningwhen they have been missed, and on two occasionsthe children have not been found until early in thefollowing morning. It is generally supposed in theneighborhood that, as the first child missed gave ashis reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” hadasked him to come for a walk, the others had pickedup the phrase and used it as occasion served. This isthe more natural as the favorite game of the little onesat present is luring each other away by wiles. A corre-spondent writes us that to see some of the tiny totspretending to be the”bloofer lady” is supremely funny.Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lessonin the irony of grotesque by comparing the realityand the picture. It is only in accordance with generalprinciples of human nature that the “bloofer lady”should be the popular role at these al fresco perfor-mances. Our correspondent naively says that even EllenTerry could not be so winningly attractive as some ofthese grubby-faced little children pretend, and evenimagine themselves, to be. There is, however, possibly a serious side to the ques-tion, for some of the children, indeed all who havebeen missed at night, have been slightly torn orwounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as mightbe made by a rat or a small dog, and although of notmuch importance individually, would tend to show thatwhatever animal inflicts them has a system or methodof its own. The police of the division have been in-structed to keep a sharp lookout for straying chil-dren, especially when very young, in and aroundHampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may beabout.Chapter 13216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBEREXTRA SPECIALTHE HAMPSTEAD HORRORANOTHER CHILD INJUREDTHE “BLOOFER LADY”We have just received intelligence that another child,missed last night, was only discovered late in the morn-ing under a furze bush at the Shooter’s Hill side ofHampstead Heath, which is perhaps, less frequentedthan the other parts. It has the same tiny wound inthe throat as has been noticed in other cases. It wasterribly weak, and looked quite emaciated. It too, whenpartially restored, had the common story to tell ofbeing lured away by the “bloofer lady.”CHAPTER 14MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL23 September.—Jonathan is better after a bad night.I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for thatkeeps his mind off the terrible things, and oh, I amrejoiced that he is not now weighed down with theresponsibility of his new position.

And yet that man we saw yesterday!He seemed quite certain of him, poor fellow! I supposeit was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back onsome train of thought. He believes it all himself.

That is the reason of his coming. It is con-cerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not aboutJonathan. Then I shall never know the real truth now!How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of myimagination and tinges everything with something ofits own color. Of course it is about Lucy. That habitChapter 14219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"came back to the poor dear, and that awful night onthe cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgot-ten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. Shemust have told him of her sleep-walking adventure onthe cliff, and that I knew all about it, and now hewants me to tell him what I know, so that he mayunderstand. I hope I did right in not saying anythingof it to Mrs. Westenra. I should never forgive myself ifany act of mine, were it even a negative one, broughtharm on poor dear Lucy. I hope too, Dr. Van Helsingwill not blame me. I have had so much trouble andanxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just atpresent. I suppose a cry does us all good at times, clears theair as other rain does. Perhaps it was reading thejournal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathanwent away this morning to stay away from me a wholeday and night, the first time we have been parted sinceour marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take careof himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him.It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soonnow. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unlesshe asks me. I am so glad I have typewritten out myown journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I canhand it to him. It will save much questioning.Later.—He has come and gone. Oh, what a strangemeeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round. Ifeel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or evena part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journal first,I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor,poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Pleasethe good God, all this may not upset him again. I shalltry to save him from it. But it may be even a consola-tion and a help to him, terrible though it be and awfulin its consequences, to know for certain that his eyesand ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it isall true. It may be that it is the doubt which hauntsChapter 14220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"him, that when the doubt is removed, no matter which,waking or dreaming, may prove the truth, he will bemore satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr.Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever oneif he is Arthur’s friend and Dr. Seward’s, and if theybrought him all the way from Holland to look afterLucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good andkind and of a noble nature. When he comes tomorrowI shall ask him about Jonathan. And then, please God,all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. Iused to think I would like to practice interviewing.Jonathan’s friend on “The Exeter News” told him thatmemory is everything in such work, that you must beable to put down exactly almost every word spoken,even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Herewas a rare interview. I shall try to record it verbatim. It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. Itook my courage a deux mains and waited. In a fewminutes Mary opened the door, and announced “Dr.Van Helsing.” I rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man ofmedium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders setback over a broad, deep chest and a neck well bal-anced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. Thepoise of the head strikes me at once as indicative ofthought and power. The head is noble, well-sized,broad, and large behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven,shows a hard, square chin, a large resolute, mobilemouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but withquick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as thebig bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens.The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almoststraight and then sloping back above two bumps orridges wide apart, such a forehead that the reddishhair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls natu-rally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are setwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern withthe man’s moods. He said to me,Chapter 14221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" “Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent. “That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented. “It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friendof that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, itis on account of the dead that I come.” “Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on methan that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.”And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly, “Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the friend of that poorlittle girl must be good, but I had yet to learn... .” Hefinished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked himwhat it was that he wanted to see me about, so he atonce began. “I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me,but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and therewas none to ask. I know that you were with her atWhitby. She sometimes kept a diary, you need not looksurprised, Madam Mina. It was begun after you hadleft, and was an imitation of you, and in that diaryshe traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walk-ing in which she puts down that you saved her. Ingreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you outof your so much kindness to tell me all of it that youcan remember.” “I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.” “Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for de-tails? It is not always so with young ladies.” “No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I canshow it to you if you like.” “Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful. You will do memuch favor.” I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him abit, I suppose it is some taste of the original applethat remains still in our mouths, so I handed him theshorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, andsaid, “May I read it?” “If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. Heopened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then heChapter 14222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"stood up and bowed. “Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew longthat Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness,but see, his wife have all the good things. And willyou not so much honor me and so help me as to read itfor me? Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over, and I was al-most ashamed. So I took the typewritten copy frommy work basket and handed it to him. “Forgive me,” I said. “I could not help it, but I hadbeen thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wishedto ask, and so that you might not have time to wait,not on my account, but because I know your timemust be precious, I have written it out on the type-writer for you.” He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,”he said. “And may I read it now? I may want to askyou some things when I have read.” “By all means,” I said. “read it over whilst I orderlunch, and then you can ask me questions whilst weeat.” He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his backto the light, and became so absorbed in the papers,whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order thathe might not be disturbed. When I came back, I foundhim walking hurriedly up and down the room, his faceall ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me andtook me by both hands. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what Iowe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens thegate to me. I am dazed, I am dazzled, with so muchlight, and yet clouds roll in behind the light everytime. But that you do not, cannot comprehend. Oh,but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman. Ma-dame,” he said this very solemnly, “if ever AbrahamVan Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trustyou will let me know.

And I have read your diary thatyou have so goodly written for me, and which breathesout truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweetletter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust,not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell alltheir lives, and by day and by hour and by minute,such things that angels can read. And we men whowish to know have in us something of angels’ eyes.Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too,for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is meannature. And your husband, tell me of him. Is he quitewell? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong andhearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, soI said, “He was almost recovered, but he has beengreatly upset by Mr. Hawkins death.” He interrupted, “Oh, yes. I know. I know. I have readyour last two letters.” I went on, “I suppose this upset him, for when wewere in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock.” “A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That is notgood. What kind of shock was it?” “He thought he saw some one who recalled some-thing terrible, something which led to his brain fe-ver.” And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelmme in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror whichhe experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his di-ary, and the fear that has been brooding over me everChapter 14224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical,for I threw myself on my knees and held up my handsto him, and implored him to make my husband wellagain. He took my hands and raised me up, and mademe sit on the sofa, and sat by me. He held my hand inhis, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness, “My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full ofwork that I have not had much time for friendships,but since I have been summoned to here by my friendJohn Seward I have known so many good people andseen such nobility that I feel more than ever, and ithas grown with my advancing years, the loneliness ofmy life. Believe me, then, that I come here full of re-spect for you, and you have given me hope, hope, notin what I am seeking of, but that there are good womenstill left to make life happy, good women, whose livesand whose truths may make good lesson for the chil-dren that are to be.

Ipromise you that I will gladly do all for him that Ican, all to make his life strong and manly, and yourlife a happy one. Now you must eat. You are over-wrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathanwould not like to see you so pale, and what he likenot where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for hissake you must eat and smile. You have told me aboutLucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it dis-tress.

And thentoo, you will tell me of husband Jonathan’s trouble sofar as you can, but not yet. You must eat now, after-wards you shall tell me all.” After lunch, when we went back to the drawing room,he said to me, “And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great learned man,I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool,Chapter 14225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"and Jonathan a madman, that journal is all so strange,and I hesitated to go on.

Ihave been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt.You must be kind to me, and not think me foolish thatI have even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by his manner as well as his wordswhen he said, “Oh, my dear, if you only know howstrange is the matter regarding which I am here, it isyou who would laugh. I have learned not to think littleof any one’s belief, no matter how strange it may be.

You havetaken a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shallgive you a paper to read. It is long, but I have type-written it out. It will tell you my trouble andJonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad,and all that happened. I dare not say anything of it.You will read for yourself and judge.

His brain and his heart are all right, this Iswear, before I have even seen him, so be at rest. Ishall have much to ask him of other things. I am blessedthat today I come to see you, for I have learn all atonce so much that again I am dazzled, dazzled morethan ever, and I must think.“Yours the most faithful,“Abraham Van Helsing.”LETTER, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING25 September, 6:30 P.M.“My dear Dr. Van Helsing, “A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which hastaken a great weight off my mind. And yet, if it betrue, what terrible things there are in the world, andwhat an awful thing if that man, that monster, be re-ally in London! I fear to think. I have this moment,whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying thatChapter 14227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from Launceston andwill be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching withus, please come to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this benot too early for you? You can get away, if you are ina hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you toPaddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall takeit that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.“Believe me,“Your faithful and grateful friend,“Mina Harker.”JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL26 September.—I thought never to write in this diaryagain, but the time has come. When I got home lastnight Mina had supper ready, and when we had suppedshe told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her havinggiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anx-ious she has been about me. She showed me in thedoctor’s letter that all I wrote down was true. It seemsto have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as tothe reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. Ifelt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But,now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count.He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in get-ting to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger,and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him andhunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says.We sat late, and talked it over. Mina is dressing, and Ishall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring himover. He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I cameinto the room where he was, and introduced myself,he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face roundto the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny, “But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you hadChapter 14228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"had a shock.” It was so funny to hear my wife called ‘Madam Mina’by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, andsaid, “I was ill, I have had a shock, but you have curedme already.” “And how?” “By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt,and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I didnot know what to trust, even the evidence of my ownsenses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not knowwhat to do, and so had only to keep on working inwhat had hitherto been the groove of my life. Thegroove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself.Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything,even yourself. No, you don’t, you couldn’t with eye-brows like yours.” He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, “So! Youare a physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour.I am with so much pleasure coming to you to break-fast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an oldman, but you are blessed in your wife.” I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day,so I simply nodded and stood silent. “She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His ownhand to show us men and other women that there is aheaven where we can enter, and that its light can behere on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little anegoist, and that, let me tell you, is much in this age,so sceptical and selfish. And you, sir... . I have readall the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of themspeak of you, so I know you since some days from theknowing of others, but I have seen your true self sincelast night. You will give me your hand, will you not?And let us be friends for all our lives.” We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kindthat it made me quite choky. “And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some morehelp? I have a great task to do, and at the beginning itChapter 14229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"is to know. You can help me here. Can you tell mewhat went before your going to Transylvania? Lateron I may ask more help, and of a different kind, but atfirst this will do.” “Look here, Sir,” I said,“does what you have to doconcern the Count?” “It does,” he said solemnly.” “Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the10:30 train, you will not have time to read them, butI shall get the bundle of papers. You can take themwith you and read them in the train.” After breakfast I saw him to the station. When wewere parting he said, “Perhaps you will come to townif I send for you, and take Madam Mina too.” “We shall both come when you will,” I said. I had got him the morning papers and the Londonpapers of the previous night, and while we were talk-ing at the carriage window, waiting for the train tostart, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenlyseemed to catch something in one of them, “TheWestminster Gazette”, I knew it by the color, and hegrew quite white. He read something intently, groan-ing to himself, “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! Sosoon!” I do not think he remembered me at the mo-ment. Just then the whistle blew, and the train movedoff. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out ofthe window and waved his hand, calling out, “Love toMadam Mina. I shall write so soon as ever I can.”DR. SEWARD’S DIARY26 September.—Truly there is no such thing as final-ity. Not a week since I said “Finis,” and yet here I amstarting fresh again, or rather going on with the record.Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what isdone. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane ashe ever was. He was already well ahead with his flybusiness, and he had just started in the spider lineChapter 14230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"also, so he had not been of any trouble to me. I had aletter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it Igather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. QuinceyMorris is with him, and that is much of a help, for hehimself is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quinceywrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthuris beginning to recover something of his old buoy-ancy, so as to them all my mind is at rest. As formyself, I was settling down to my work with the en-thusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I mightfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy lefton me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened, and what isto be the end God only knows. I have an idea that VanHelsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let outenough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeteryesterday, and stayed there all night. Today he cameback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock, and thrust last night’s “WestminsterGazette” into my hand. “What do you think of that?” he asked as he stoodback and folded his arms. I looked over the paper, for I really did not knowwhat he meant, but he took it from me and pointedout a paragraph about children being decoyed awayat Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until Ireached a passage where it described small puncturewounds on their throats. An idea struck me, and Ilooked up. “Well?” he said. “It is like poor Lucy’s.” “And what do you make of it?” “Simply that there is some cause in common. What-ever it was that injured her has injured them.” I didnot quite understand his answer. “That is true indirectly, but not directly.” “How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a littleinclined to take his seriousness lightly, for, after all,Chapter 14231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrow-ing, anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits, but whenI saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midstof our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked morestern. “Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do notknow what to think, and I have no data on which tofound a conjecture.” “Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you haveno suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of, not afterall the hints given, not only by events, but by me?” “Of nervous prostration following a great loss or wasteof blood.” “And how was the blood lost or wasted?” I shook myhead. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and wenton, “You are a clever man, friend John. You reasonwell, and your wit is bold, but you are too preju-diced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear,and that which is outside your daily life is not of ac-count to you. Do you not think that there are thingswhich you cannot understand, and yet which are, thatsome people see things that others cannot? But thereare things old and new which must not be contem-plated by men’s eyes, because they know, or think theyknow, some things which other men have told them.Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to ex-plain all, and if it explain not, then it says there isnothing to explain. But yet we see around us everyday the growth of new beliefs, which think themselvesnew, and which are yet but the old, which pretend tobe young, like the fine ladies at the opera. I supposenow you do not believe in corporeal transference. No?Nor in materialization. No? Nor in astral bodies. No?Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism....” “Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as he went on, “Then you are satisfied asto it. Yes? And of course then you understand how itChapter 14232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot, alasthat he is no more, into the very soul of the patientthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to takeit that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to letfrom premise to conclusion be a blank? No? Then tellme, for I am a student of the brain, how you accepthypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tellyou, my friend, that there are things done today inelectrical science which would have been deemed un-holy by the very man who discovered electricity, whowould themselves not so long before been burned aswizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was itthat Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘OldParr’one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poorLucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, couldnot live even one day? For, had she live one more day,we could save her. Do you know all the mystery of lifeand death? Do you know the altogether of compara-tive anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities ofbrutes are in some men, and not in others? Can youtell me why, when other spiders die small and soon,that one great spider lived for centuries in the towerof the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, ondescending, he could drink the oil of all the churchlamps? Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay andelsewhere, there are bats that come out at night andopen the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry theirveins, how in some islands of the Western seas thereare bats which hang on the trees all day, and thosewho have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, andthat when the sailors sleep on the deck, because thatit is hot, flit down on them and then, and then in themorning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucywas?” “Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do youmean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat,and that such a thing is here in London in the nine-teenth century?”Chapter 14233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" He waved his hand for silence, and went on, “Can youtell me why the tortoise lives more long than genera-tions of men, why the elephant goes on and on till hehave sees dynasties, and why the parrot never die onlyof bite of cat of dog or other complaint? Can you tellme why men believe in all ages and places that thereare men and women who cannot die? We all know,because science has vouched for the fact, that therehave been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years,shut in one so small hole that only hold him since theyouth of the world. Can you tell me how the Indianfakir can make himself to die and have been buried,and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and thecorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cutagain, and then men come and take away the unbro-ken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead,but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered. Heso crowded on my mind his list of nature’s eccentrici-ties and possible impossibilities that my imaginationwas getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teach-ing me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in hisstudy at Amsterdam. But he used them to tell me thething, so that I could have the object of thought inmind all the time. But now I was without his help, yetI wanted to follow him, so I said, “Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell methe thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as yougo on. At present I am going in my mind from point topoint as a madman, and not a sane one, follows anidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in amidst, jumping from one tussock to another in themere blind effort to move on without knowing whereI am going.” “That is a good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tellyou. My thesis is this, I want you to believe.” “To believe what?” “To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illus-Chapter 14234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"trate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith,‘that faculty which enables us to believe things whichwe know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man. Hemeant that we shall have an open mind, and not let alittle bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, likea small rock does a railway truck. We get the smalltruth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him,but all the same we must not let him think himself allthe truth in the universe.” “Then you want me not to let some previous convic-tion inure the receptivity of my mind with regard tosome strange matter. Do I read your lesson aright?” “Ah, you are my favorite pupil still. It is worth toteach you. Now that you are willing to understand,you have taken the first step to understand. You thinkthen that those so small holes in the children’s throatswere made by the same that made the holes in MissLucy?” “I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly, “Then you are wrong.Oh, would it were so! But alas! No. It is worse, far, farworse.” “In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do youmean?” I cried. He threw himself with a despairing gesture into achair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering hisface with his hands as he spoke. “They were made by Miss Lucy!”CHAPTER 15DR. SEWARD’S DIARY-cont. For a while sheer anger mastered me. It was as if hehad during her life struck Lucy on the face. I smotethe table hard and rose up as I said to him, “Dr. VanHelsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me, and somehowChapter 15235"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would Iwere!” he said. “Madness were easy to bear comparedwith truth like this. Oh, my friend, whey, think you,did I go so far round, why take so long to tell sosimple a thing? Was it because I hate you and havehated you all my life? Was it because I wished to giveyou pain? Was it that I wanted, no so late, revenge forthat time when you saved my life, and from a fearfuldeath? Ah no!” “Forgive me,” said I. He went on, “My friend, it was because I wished tobe gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you haveloved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not expectyou to believe. It is so hard to accept at once anyabstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possiblewhen we have always believed the ‘no’ of it. It is morehard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and ofsuch a one as Miss Lucy. Tonight I go to prove it. Dareyou come with me?” This staggered me. A man does not like to prove sucha truth, Byron excepted from the catagory, jealousy. “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.” He saw my hesitation, and spoke, “The logic is simple,no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock totussock in a misty bog. If it not be true, then proofwill be relief. At worst it will not harm. If it be true!Ah, there is the dread. Yet every dread should help mycause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell youwhat I propose. First, that we go off now and see thatchild in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospi-tal, where the papers say the child is, is a friend ofmine, and I think of yours since you were in class atAmsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, ifhe will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing,but only that we wish to learn. And then....” “And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “Andthen we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyardChapter 15236"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. Ihad it from the coffin man to give to Arthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there wassome fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, how-ever, so I plucked up what heart I could and said thatwe had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing. We found the child awake. It had had a sleep andtaken some food, and altogether was going on well.Dr, Vincent took the bandage from its throat, andshowed us the punctures. There was no mistaking thesimilarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat.They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher, thatwas all. We asked Vincent to what he attributed them,and he replied that it must have been a bite of someanimal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he wasinclined to think it was one of the bats which are sonumerous on the northern heights of London. “Out ofso many harmless ones,” he said, “there may be somewild specimen from the South of a more malignantspecies. Some sailor may have brought one home, andit managed to escape, or even from the Zoological Gar-dens a young one may have got loose, or one be bredthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you,know. Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, Ibelieve, traced up in this direction. For a week after,the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hoodon the Heath and in every alley in the place until this‘bloofer lady’ scare came along, since then it has beenquite a gala time with them. Even this poor little mite,when he woke up today, asked the nurse if he mightgo away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, hesaid he wanted to play with the ‘bloofer lady’.” “I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are send-ing the child home you will caution its parents tokeep strict watch over it. These fancies to stray aremost dangerous, and if the child were to remain outanother night, it would probably be fatal. But in anycase I suppose you will not let it away for some days?”Chapter 15237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" “Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if thewound is not healed.” Our visit to the hospital took more time than we hadreckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we cameout. When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said, “There is not hurry. It is more late than I thought.Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, andthen we shall go on our way.” We dined at ‘Jack Straw’s Castle’ along with a littlecrowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.About ten o’clock we started from the inn. It was thenvery dark, and the scattered lamps made the darknessgreater when we were once outside their individualradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road wewere to go, for he went on unhesitatingly, but, as forme, I was in quite a mixup as to locality. As we wentfurther, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last wewere somewhat surprised when we met even the patrolof horse police going their usual suburban round. Atlast we reached the wall of the churchyard, which weclimbed over. With some little difficulty, for it wasvery dark, and the whole place seemed so strange tous, we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor tookthe key, opened the creaky door, and standing back,politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to pre-cede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, inthe courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastlyoccasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cau-tiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertainingthat the lock was a falling, and not a spring one. Inthe latter case we should have been in a bad plight.Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a match-box and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light.The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed withfresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough,but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hunglank and dead, their whites turning to rust and theirgreens to browns, when the spider and the beetle hadChapter 15238"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"resumed their accustomed dominance, when the time-discolored stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty,dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, theeffect was more miserable and sordid than could havebeen imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea thatlife, animal life, was not the only thing which couldpass away. Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Hold-ing his candle so that he could read the coffin plates,and so holding it that the sperm dropped in whitepatches which congealed as they touched the metal,he made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search inhis bag, and he took out a turnscrew. “What are you going to do?” I asked. “To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began taking out the screws, and fi-nally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead be-neath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemedto be as much an affront to the dead as it would havebeen to have stripped off her clothing in her sleepwhilst living. I actually took hold of his hand to stophim. He only said, “You shall see, “and again fumbling inhis bag took out a tiny fret saw. Striking the turnscrewthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, whichmade me wince, he made a small hole, which was, how-ever, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I hadexpected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. Wedoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have tobecome accustomed to such things, and I drew backtowards the door. But the Professor never stopped fora moment. He sawed down a couple of feet along oneside of the lead coffin, and then across, and down theother side. Taking the edge of the loose flange, hebent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and hold-ing up the candle into the aperture, motioned to meto look.Chapter 15239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty. It wascertainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerableshock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now moresure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened toproceed in his task.”Are you satisfied now, friendJohn?” he asked. I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my natureawake within me as I answered him, “I am satisfiedthat Lucy’s body is not in that coffin, but that onlyproves one thing.” “And what is that, friend John?” “That it is not there.” “That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. Buthow do you, how can you, account for it not beingthere?” “Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of theundertaker’s people may have stolen it.” I felt that Iwas speaking folly, and yet it was the only real causewhich I could suggest. The Professor sighed. “Ah well!” he said,” we musthave more proof. Come with me.” He put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all histhings and placed them in the bag, blew out the light,and placed the candle also in the bag. We opened thedoor, and went out. Behind us he closed the door andlocked it. He handed me the key, saying, “Will youkeep it? You had better be assured.” I laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am boundto say, as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is noth-ing,” I said, “thee are many duplicates, and anyhow itis not difficult to pick a lock of this kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Thenhe told me to watch at one side of the churchyardwhilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew tree, and I saw hisdark figure move until the intervening headstones andtrees hid it from my sight. It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my placeChapter 15240"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time cameone and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angrywith the Professor for taking me on such an errandand with myself for coming. I was too cold and toosleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enoughto betray my trust, so altogether I had a dreary, mis-erable time. Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw some-thing like a white streak, moving between two darkyew trees at the side of the churchyard farthest fromthe tomb. At the same time a dark mass moved fromthe Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly wenttowards it. Then I too moved, but I had to go roundheadstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled overgraves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off anearly cock crew. A little ways off, beyond a line ofscattered juniper trees, which marked the pathway tothe church, a white dim figure flitted in the directionof the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, andI could not see where the figure had disappeared. Iheard the rustle of actual movement where I had firstseen the white figure, and coming over, found the Pro-fessor holding in his arms a tiny child. When he sawme he held it out to me, and said, “Are you satisfiednow?” “No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive. “Do you not see the child?” “Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is itwounded?” “We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one im-pulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he car-rying the sleeping child. When we had got some little distance away, we wentinto a clump of trees, and struck a match, and lookedat the child’s throat. It was without a scratch or scarof any kind. “Was I right?” I asked triumphantly. “We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.Chapter 15241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" We had now to decide what we were to do with thechild, and so consulted about it. If we were to take itto a police station we should have to give some ac-count of our movements during the night. At least, weshould have had to make some statement as to how wehad come to find the child. So finally we decided thatwe would take it to the Heath, and when we heard apoliceman coming, would leave it where he could notfail to find it. We would then seek our way home asquickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge ofHampstead Heath we heard a policeman’s heavy tramp,and laying the child on the pathway, we waited andwatched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern toand fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment,and then we went away silently. By good chance wegot a cab near the ‘Spainiards,’ and drove to town. I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must tryto get a few hours’ sleep, as Van Helsing is to call forme at noon. He insists that I go with him on anotherexpedition.27 September.—It was two o’clock before we found asuitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral heldat noon was all completed, and the last stragglers ofthe mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when,looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees,we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knewthat we were safe till morning did we desire it, butthe Professor told me that we should not want morethan an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense ofthe reality of things, in which any effort of imagina-tion seemed out of place, and I realized distinctly theperils of the law which we were incurring in our un-hallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see ifa woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it nowseemed the height of folly to open the tomb again,when we knew, from the evidence of our own eye-Chapter 15242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"sight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoul-ders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had away of going on his own road, no matter who remon-strated. He took the key, opened the vault, and againcourteously motioned me to precede. The place wasnot so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutter-ably mean looking when the sunshine streamed in. VanHelsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and I followed.He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange,and a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me. There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her thenight before her funeral. She was, if possible, moreradiantly beautiful than ever, and I could not believethat she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder thanbefore, and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom. “Is this a juggle?” I said to him. “Are you convinced now?” said the Professor, in re-sponse, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in away that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lipsand showed the white teeth. “See,” he went on, “theyare even sharper than before. With this and this,” andhe touched one of the canine teeth and that below it,“the little children can be bitten. Are you of beliefnow, friend John?” Once more argumentative hostility woke within me.I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as hesuggested. So, with an attempt to argue of which Iwas even at the moment ashamed, I said, “She mayhave been placed here since last night.” “Indeed? That is so, and by whom?” “I do not know. Someone has done it.” “And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoplesin that time would not look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsingdid not seem to notice my silence. At any rate, heshowed neither chagrin nor triumph. He was lookingintently at the face of the dead woman, raising theeyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more open-Chapter 15243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"ing the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turnedto me and said, “Here, there is one thing which is different from allrecorded. Here is some dual life that is not as the com-mon. She was bitten by the vampire when she was in atrance, sleep-walking, oh, you start. You do not knowthat, friend John, but you shall know it later, and intrance could he best come to take more blood. In tranceshe dies, and in trance she is UnDead, too. So it is thatshe differ from all other. Usually when the UnDead sleepat home,” as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweepof his arm to designate what to a vampire was ‘home’,“their face show what they are, but this so sweet thatwas when she not UnDead she go back to the nothingsof the common dead. There is no malign there, see,and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawnupon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’s theories.But if she were really dead, what was there of terror inthe idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change inmy face, for he said almost joyously, “Ah, you believenow?” I answered, “Do not press me too hard all at once. Iam willing to accept. How will you do this bloodywork?”“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic,and I shall drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so mutilating thebody of the woman whom I had loved. And yet thefeeling was not so strong as I had expected. I was, infact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this be-ing, this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loatheit. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all ob-jective? I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to be-gin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought. Presentlyhe closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said,Chapter 15244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind asto what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining Iwould do now, at this moment, what is to be done.But there are other things to follow, and things thatare thousand times more difficult in that them we donot know. This is simple. She have yet no life taken,though that is of time, and to act now would be totake danger from her forever. But then we may have towant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you,who saw the wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw thewounds so similar on the child’s at the hospital, ifyou, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to bemore rose and more beautiful in a whole week, aftershe die, if you know of this and know of the whitefigure last night that brought the child to the church-yard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe,how then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of thosethings, to believe? “He doubted me when I took him from her kiss whenshe was dying.

He will then argue back that it is we, mistakenones, that have killed her by our ideas, and so he willbe much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure,and that is the worst of all. And he will sometimesthink that she he loved was buried alive, and that willpaint his dreams with horrors of what she must havesuffered, and again, he will think that we may be right,and that his so beloved was, after all, an UnDead. No!I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now,since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand timesmore do I know that he must pass through the bitterwaters to reach the sweet.

It pleases me thatthe UnDead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, that soon the morrow night she may be more eager. There-fore I shall fix some things she like not, garlic and acrucifix, and so seal up the door of the tomb. She isyoung as UnDead, and will heed. Moreover, these areonly to prevent her coming out.

For Miss Lucy or fromher, I have no fear, but that other to whom is therethat she is UnDead, he have not the power to seek hertomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know fromMr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he havefooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy’s life,and we lost, and in many ways the UnDead are strong.He have always the strength in his hand of twentymen, even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucyit also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolfand I know not what. So if it be that he came thitheron this night he shall find me. But none other shall,until it be too late. But it may be that he will notattempt the place.

SEWARD’S DIARY28 September.—It is wonderful what a good night’ssleep will do for one. Yesterday I was almost willingto accept Van Helsing’s monstrous ideas, but now theyseem to start out lurid before me as outrages on com-mon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. Iwonder if his mind can have become in any way un-hinged. Surely there must be some rational explana-tion of all these mysterious things. Is it possible thatthe Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnor-Chapter 15247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"mally clever that if he went off his head he wouldcarry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea ina wonderful way. I am loathe to think it, and indeed itwould be almost as great a marvel as the other to findthat Van Helsing was mad, but anyhow I shall watchhim carefully. I may get some light on the mystery.29 September.—Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room. Hetold us all what he wanted us to do, but especiallyaddressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills werecentered in his. He began by saying that he hoped wewould all come with him too, “for,” he said, “there isa grave duty to be done there. You were doubtlesssurprised at my letter?” This query was directly ad-dressed to Lord Godalming. “I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has beenso much trouble around my house of late that I coulddo without any more. I have been curious, too, as towhat you mean. “Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked,the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myselfthat I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about any-thing.” “Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically. “Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer thebeginning, both of you, than friend John here, whohas to go a long way back before he can even get sofar as to begin.” It was evident that he recognized my return to myold doubting frame of mind without my saying a word.Then, turning to the other two, he said with intensegravity, “I want your permission to do what I think good thisnight. It is, I know, much to ask, and when you knowwhat it is I propose to do you will know, and onlythen how much. Therefore may I ask that you promiseme in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may beChapter 15"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"angry with me for a time, I must not disguise frommyself the possibility that such may be, you shall notblame yourselves for anything.” “That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answerfor the Professor. I don’t quite see his drift, but I swearhe’s honest, and that’s good enough for me.” “I thank you, Sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I havedone myself the honor of counting you one trustingfriend, and such endorsement is dear to me.” He heldout a hand, which Quincey took. Then Arthur spoke out, “Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quitelike to ‘buy a pig in a poke’, as they say in Scotland,and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentle-man or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannotmake such a promise. If you can assure me that whatyou intend does not violate either of these two, then Igive my consent at once, though for the life of me, Icannot understand what you are driving at.” “I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and allI ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemnany act of mine, you will first consider it well and besatisfied that it does not violate your reservations.” “Agreed!” said Arthur. “That is only fair. And nowthat the pourparlers are over, may I ask what it is weare to do?” “I want you to come with me, and to come in secret,to the churchyard at Kingstead.” Arthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way, “Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on, “And when there?” “To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up. “Professor, are you in earnest, or isit some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you arein earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see that hesat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.There was silence until he asked again, “And when inthe tomb?”Chapter 15249"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" “To open the coffin.” “This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “Iam willing to be patient in all things that are reason-able, but in this, this desecration of the grave, of onewho....” He fairly choked with indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him. ”If I couldspare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “Godknows I would. But this night our feet must tread inthorny paths, or later, and for ever, the feet you lovemust walk in paths of flame!” Arthur looked up with set white face and said, “Takecare, sir, take care!” “Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?”said Van Helsing. “And then you will at least know thelimit of my purpose. Shall I go on?” “That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris. After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with aneffort, “Miss Lucy is dead, is it not so? Yes! Then therecan be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead... .” Arthur jumped to his feet, “Good God!” he cried.“What do you mean? Has there been any mistake, hasshe been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish thatnot even hope could soften. “I did not say she was alive, my child. I did not thinkit. I go no further than to say that she might be UnDead.” “UnDead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all anightmare, or what is it?” “There are mysteries which men can only guess at,which age by age they may solve only in part. Believeme, we are now on the verge of one. But I have notdone. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?” “Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm ofpassion. “Not for the wide world will I consent to anymutilation of her dead body. Dr. Van Helsing, you tryme too far. What have I done to you that you shouldtorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do thatyou should want to cast such dishonor on her grave?Are you mad, that you speak of such things, or am IChapter 15250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"mad to listen to them? Don’t dare think more of sucha desecration. I shall not give my consent to anythingyou do. I have a duty to do in protecting her gravefrom outrage, and by God, I shall do it!” Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the timebeen seated, and said, gravely and sternly, “My LordGodalming, I too, have a duty to do, a duty to others,a duty to you, a duty to the dead, and by God, I shalldo it! All I ask you now is that you come with me,that you look and listen, and if when later I make thesame request you do not be more eager for its fulfill-ment even than I am, then, I shall do my duty, what-ever it may seem to me. And then, to follow yourLordship’s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposalto render an account to you, when and where youwill.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with avoice full of pity. “But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger withme. In a long life of acts which were often not pleas-ant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, Ihave never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me thatif the time comes for you to change your mind to-wards me, one look from you will wipe away all thisso sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save youfrom sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myselfso much labor and so much of sorrow? I have comehere from my own land to do what I can of good, atthe first to please my friend John, and then to help asweet young lady, whom too, I come to love. For her,I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness,I gave what you gave, the blood of my veins. I gave it,I who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physi-cian and her friend. I gave her my nights and days,before death, after death, and if my death can do hergood even now, when she is the dead UnDead, she shallhave it freely.” He said this with a very grave, sweetpride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a brokenChapter 15251"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"voice, “Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot un-derstand, but at least I shall go with you and wait.”CHAPTER 16DR SEWARD’S DIARY-cont. It was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when wegot into the churchyard over the low wall. The nightwas dark with occasional gleams of moonlight betweenthe dents of the heavy clouds that scudded across thesky. We all kept somehow close together, with VanHelsing slightly in front as he led the way. When wehad come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur,for I feared the proximity to a place laden with sosorrowful a memory would upset him, but he bore him-self well. I took it that the very mystery of the pro-ceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief.The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a naturalhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved thedifficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us fol-lowed, and he closed the door. He then lit a dark lan-tern and pointed to a coffin. Arthur stepped forwardhesitatingly. Van Helsing said to me, “You were withme here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in thatcoffin?” “It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying, “You hear,and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.’ He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid ofthe coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent. Whenthe lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidentlydid not know that there was a leaden coffin, or at anyrate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent inthe lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant,but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained ofa ghastly whiteness. He was still silent. Van HelsingChapter 16252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked inand recoiled. The coffin was empty! For several minutes no one spoke a word. The si-lence was broken by Quincey Morris, “Professor, I an-swered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t asksuch a thing ordinarily, I wouldn’t so dishonor you asto imply a doubt, but this is a mystery that goes be-yond any honor or dishonor. Is this your doing?” “I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I havenot removed or touched her. What happened was this.Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here,with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin,which was then sealed up, and we found it as now,empty. We then waited, and saw something white comethrough the trees. The next day we came here in day-time and she lay there. Did she not, friend John? “Yes.” “That night we were just in time. One more so smallchild was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmedamongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sun-down, for at sundown the UnDead can move. I waitedhere all night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. Itwas most probable that it was because I had laid overthe clamps of those doors garlic, which the UnDeadcannot bear, and other things which they shun. Lastnight there was no exodus, so tonight before the sun-down I took away my garlic and other things. And soit is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. Sofar there is much that is strange. Wait you with meoutside, unseen and unheard, and things much strangerare yet to be. So,” here he shut the dark slide of hislantern, “now to the outside.” He opened the door,and we filed out, he coming last and locking the doorbehind him. Oh! But it seemed fresh and pure in the night airafter the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to seethe clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moon-Chapter 16253"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"light between the scudding clouds crossing and pass-ing, like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life. Howsweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taintof death and decay. How humanizing to see the redlighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear faraway the muffled roar that marks the life of a greatcity. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving tograsp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mys-tery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclinedagain to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’sconclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the wayof a man who accepts all things, and accepts them inthe spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has atstake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to VanHelsing, he was employed in a definite way. First hetook from his bag a mass of what looked like thin,wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in awhite napkin. Next he took out a double handful ofsome whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbledthe wafer up fine and worked it into the mass betweenhis hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thinstrips, began to lay them into the crevices betweenthe door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhatpuzzled at this, and being close, asked him what itwas that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew nearalso, as they too were curious. He answered, “I am closing the tomb so that theUnDead may not enter.” “And is that stuff you have there going to do it?” “It Is.” “What is that which you are using?” This time thequestion was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently liftedhis hat as he answered. “The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have anIndulgence.” It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical ofChapter 16254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"us, and we felt individually that in the presence ofsuch earnest purpose as the Professor’s, a purposewhich could thus use the to him most sacred of things,it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence wetook the places assigned to us close round the tomb,but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. Ipitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself beenapprenticed by my former visits to this watching hor-ror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiatedthe proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never didtombs look so ghastly white. Never did cypress, oryew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeralgloom. Never did tree or grass wave or rustle so omi-nously. Never did bough creak so mysteriously, andnever did the far-away howling of dogs send such awoeful presage through the night. There was a long spell of silence, big, aching, void,and then from the Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed,and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figureadvance, a dim white figure, which held somethingdark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the mo-ment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driv-ing clouds, and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.We could not see the face, for it was bent down overwhat we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was apause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives insleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. Wewere starting forward, but the Professor’s warninghand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, keptus back. And then as we looked the white figure movedforwards again. It was now near enough for us to seeclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heartgrew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur,as we recognized the features of Lucy Westenra. LucyWestenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness wasturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the pu-rity to voluptuous wantonness.Chapter 16255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" Van Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his ges-ture, we all advanced too. The four of us ranged in aline before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raisedhis lantern and drew the slide. By the concentratedlight that fell on Lucy’s face we could see that the lipswere crimson with fresh blood, and that the streamhad trickled over her chin and stained the purity ofher lawn death robe. We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremu-lous light that even Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed.Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his armand held him up, he would have fallen. When Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucybecause it bore her shape, saw us she drew back withan angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken un-awares, then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes inform and color, but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full ofhell fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. Atthat moment the remnant of my love passed into hateand loathing. Had she then to be killed, I could havedone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyesblazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathedwith a voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made meshudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung tothe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up tonow she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growl-ing over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gavea sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan fromArthur. When she advanced to him with outstretchedarms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his facein his hands. She still advanced, however, and with a languorous,voluptuous grace, said, “Come to me, Arthur. Leavethese others and come to me. My arms are hungry foryou. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my hus-band, come!” There was something diabolically sweet in her tones,Chapter 16256"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"something of the tinkling of glass when struck, whichrang through the brains even of us who heard the wordsaddressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed undera spell, moving his hands from his face, he openedwide his arms. She was leaping for them, when VanHelsing sprang forward and held between them his littlegolden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a sud-denly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as ifto enter the tomb. When within a foot or two of the door, however, shestopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Thenshe turned, and her face was shown in the clear burstof moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiverfrom Van Helsing’s nerves. Never did I see such baffledmalice on a face, and never, I trust, shall such ever beseen again by mortal eyes. The beautiful color becamelivid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell fire,the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of fleshwere the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the pas-sion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a facemeant death, if looks could kill, we saw it at thatmoment. And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eter-nity, se remained between the lifted crucifix and thesacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, “An-swer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?” “Do as you will, friend. Do as you will. There can beno horror like this ever any more.” And he groaned inspirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him,and took his arms. We could hear the click of the clos-ing lantern as Van Helsing held it down. Coming closeto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks someof the sacred emblem which he had placed there. Weall looked on with horrified amazement as we saw,when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal bodyChapter 16257"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"as real at that moment as our own, pass through theinterstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone.We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Pro-fessor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edgesof the door. When this was done, he lifted the child and said,“Come now, my friends. We can do no more till tomor-row. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall allcome before long after that. The friends of the deadwill all be gone by two, and when the sexton locks thegate we shall remain. Then there is more to do, butnot like this of tonight. As for this little one, he is notmuch harmed, and by tomorrow night he shall be well.We shall leave him where the police will find him, ason the other night, and then to home.” Coming close to Arthur, he said, “My friend Arthur,you have had a sore trial, but after, when you lookback, you will see how it was necessary. You are nowin the bitter waters, my child. By this time tomorrowyou will, please God, have passed them, and have drunkof the sweet waters. So do not mourn over-much. Tillthen I shall not ask you to forgive me.” Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we triedto cheer each other on the way. We had left behind thechild in safety, and were tired. So we all slept withmore or less reality of sleep.29 September, night.—A little before twelve o’clockwe three, Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself, calledfor the Professor. It was odd to notice that by com-mon consent we had all put on black clothes. Of course,Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, butthe rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the grave-yard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping outof official observation, so that when the gravediggershad completed their task and the sexton under thebelief that every one had gone, had locked the gate,we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, insteadChapter 16258"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"of his little black bag, had with him a long leatherone, something like a cricketing bag. It was mani-festly of fair weight. When we were alone and had heard the last of thefootsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if byordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb.He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it be-hind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, whichhe lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted,he stuck by melting their own ends, on other coffins,so that they might give light sufficient to work by.When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we alllooked, Arthur trembling like an aspen, and saw thatthe corpse lay there in all its death beauty. But therewas no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing forthe foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape withouther soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard ashe looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing, “Is thisreally Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?” “It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, andyou shall see her as she was, and is.” She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there,the pointed teeth, the blood stained, voluptuousmouth, which made one shudder to see, the whole car-nal and unspirited appearance, seeming like a devilishmockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with hisusual methodicalness, began taking the various con-tents from his bag and placing them ready for use.First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbingsolder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, whenlit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at afierce heat with a blue flame, then his operating knives,which he placed to hand, and last a round woodenstake, some two and a half or three inches thick andabout three feet long. One end of it was hardened bycharring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point.With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in house-holds is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps.Chapter 16259"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"To me, a doctor’s preperations for work of any kindare stimulating and bracing, but the effect of thesethings on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause thema sort of consternation. They both, however, kept theircourage, and remained silent and quiet. When all was ready, Van Helsing said, “Before we doanything, let me tell you this. It is out of the lore andexperience of the ancients and of all those who havestudied the powers of the UnDead. When they becomesuch, there comes with the change the curse of im-mortality. They cannot die, but must go on age afterage adding new victims and multiplying the evils ofthe world. For all that die from the preying of theUndead become themselves Undead, and prey on theirkind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like asthe ripples from a stone thrown in the water. FriendArthur, if you had met that kiss which you know ofbefore poor Lucy die, or again, last night when youopen your arms to her, you would in time, when youhad died, have become nosferatu, as they call it inEastern Europe, and would for all time make more ofthose Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror. Thecareer of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.Those children whose blood she sucked are not as yetso much the worse, but if she lives on, UnDead, moreand more they lose their blood and by her power overthem they come to her, and so she draw their bloodwith that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth,then all cease. The tiny wounds of the throats disap-pear, and they go back to their play unknowing everof what has been. But of the most blessed of all, whenthis now UnDead be made to rest as true dead, thenthe soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again befree. Instead of working wickedness by night and grow-ing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, sheshall take her place with the other Angels. So that,my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shallstrike the blow that sets her free.

He saw too, what we all did,the infinite kindness which suggested that his shouldbe the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy,and not an unholy, memory. He stepped forward andsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his facewas as pale as snow, “My true friend, from the bottomof my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am todo, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said,“Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. Thisstake must be driven through her. It well be a fearfulordeal, be not deceived in that, but it will be only ashort time, and you will then rejoice more than yourpain was great. From this grim tomb you will emergeas though you tread on air. But you must not falterwhen once you have begun. Only think that we, yourtrue friends, are round you, and that we pray for youall the time.” “Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely.”Tell me what I am todo.” “Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place tothe point over the heart, and the hammer in your right.Then when we begin our prayer for the dead, I shallread him, I have here the book, and the others shallfollow, strike in God’s name, that so all may be wellwith the dead that we love and that the UnDead passaway.” Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and whenonce his mind was set on action his hands nevertrembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened hismissal and began to read, and Quincey and I followedChapter 16261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I lookedI could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struckwith all his might. The thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips. Thebody shook and quivered and twisted in wild contor-tions. The sharp white champed together till the lipswere cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimsonfoam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a fig-ure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driv-ing deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilstthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurtedup around it. His face was set, and high duty seemedto shine through it. The sight of it gave us courage sothat our voices seemed to ring through the little vault. And then the writhing and quivering of the bodybecame less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and theface to quiver. Finally it lay still. The terrible task wasover. The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeledand would have fallen had we not caught him. Thegreat drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and hisbreath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been anawful strain on him, and had he not been forced to histask by more than human considerations he could neverhave gone through with it. For a few minutes we wereso taken up with him that we did not look towards thecoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startledsurprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed soeagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated onthe ground, and came and looked too, and then a gladstrange light broke over his face and dispelled alto-gether the gloom of horror that lay upon it. There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing thatwe has so dreaded and grown to hate that the work ofher destruction was yielded as a privilege to the onebest entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life,with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. TrueChapter 16262"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"that there were there, as we had seen them in life, thetraces of care and pain and waste. But these were alldear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew.One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay likesunshine over the wasted face and form was only anearthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reignfor ever. Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoul-der, and said to him, “And now, Arthur my friend, dearlad, am I not forgiven?” The reaction of the terrible strain came as he tookthe old man’s hand in his, and raising it to his lips,pressed it, and said, “Forgiven! God bless you that youhave given my dear one her soul again, and me peace.”He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and lay-ing his head on his breast, cried for a while silently,whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him,“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her deadlips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her tochoose. For she is not a grinning devil now, not anymore a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is thedevil’s UnDead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul iswith Him!” Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent himand Quincey out of the tomb. The Professor and I sawedthe top off the stake, leaving the point of it in thebody. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouthwith garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwedon the coffin lid, and gathering up our belongings,came away. When the Professor locked the door hegave the key to Arthur. Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and thebirds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tunedto a different pitch. There was gladness and mirth andpeace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves onone account, and we were glad, though it was with atempered joy.Chapter 16263"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" Before we moved away Van Helsing said, “Now, myfriends, one step or our work is done, one the mostharrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greatertask, to find out the author of all this or sorrow andto stamp him out. I have clues which we can follow,but it is a long task, and a difficult one, and there isdanger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? Wehave learned to believe, all of us, is it not so? Andsince so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we notpromise to go on to the bitter end?” Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise wasmade. Then said the Professor as we moved off, “Twonights hence you shall meet with me and dine togetherat seven of the clock with friend John. I shall entreattwo others, two that you know not as yet, and I shallbe ready to all our work show and our plans unfold.Friend John, you come with me home, for I have muchto consult you about, and you can help me.

When we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsingfound a telegram waiting for him. “Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Im-portant news. Mina Harker.” The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderfulMadam Mina,” he said, “pearl among women! She ar-rive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your house,friend John. You must meet her at the station. Tele-Chapter 17264"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"graph her en route so that she may be prepared.” When the wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea.Over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harkerwhen abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, asalso of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” hesaid, “and study them well. When I have returned youwill be master of all the facts, and we can then betterenter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there isin them much of treasure. You will need all your faith,even you who have had such an experience as that oftoday. What is here told,” he laid his hand heavily andgravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, “may bethe beginning of the end to you and me and manyanother, or it may sound the knell of the UnDead whowalk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the openmind, and if you can add in any way to the story heretold do so, for it is all important. You have kept adiary of all these so strange things, is it not so? Yes!Then we shall go through all these together when wemeet.” He then made ready for his departure and shortlydrove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way toPaddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes be-fore the train came in. The crowd melted away, afterthe bustling fashion common to arrival platforms, andI was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss myguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty looking girl steppedup to me, and after a quick glance said, “Dr. Seward, isit not?” “And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once, where-upon she held out her hand. “I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy,but....” She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush over-spread her face. The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow setus both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. Igot her luggage, which included a typewriter, and wetook the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I hadsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting roomChapter 17265"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"and a bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker. In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that theplace was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that shewas unable to repress a shudder when we entered. She told me that, if she might, she would come pres-ently to my study, as she had much to say. So here Iam finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilstI await her. As yet I have not had the chance of look-ing at the papers which Van Helsing left with me,though they lie open before me. I must get her inter-ested in something, so that I may have an opportunityof reading them. She does not know how precious timeis, or what a task we have in hand. I must be carefulnot to frighten her. Here she is!MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL29 September.—After I had tidied myself, I went downto Dr. Seward’s study. At the door I paused a moment,for I thought I heard him talking with some one. As,however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked atthe door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered. To my intense surprise, there was no one with him.He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him waswhat I knew at once from the description to be a pho-nograph. I had never seen one, and was much inter-ested. “I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said, “but Istayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thoughtthere was someone with you.” “Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only enteringmy diary.” “Your diary?” I asked him in surprise. “Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spokehe laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite ex-cited over it, and blurted out, “Why, this beats evenshorthand! May I hear it say something?” “Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up toChapter 17266"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and atroubled look overspread his face. “The fact is,” he began awkwardly.”I only keep mydiary in it, and as it is entirely, almost entirely, aboutmy cases it may be awkward, that is, I mean....” Hestopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrass-ment. “You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let mehear how she died, for all that I know of her, I shall bevery grateful. She was very, very dear to me.” To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck lookin his face, “Tell you of her death? Not for the wideworld!” “Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feelingwas coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was tryingto invent an excuse. At length, he stammered out, “Yousee, I do not know how to pick out any particular partof the diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned uponhim, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a dif-ferent voice, and with the naivete of a child, “that’squite true, upon my honor. Honest Indian!” I could not but smile, at which he grimaced.”I gavemyself away that time!” he said. “But do you knowthat, although I have kept the diary for months past,it never once struck me how I was going to find anyparticular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind was made up that the diary ofa doctor who attended Lucy might have something toadd to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Be-ing, and I said boldly, “Then, Dr. Seward, you had bet-ter let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said,“No! No! No! For all the world. I wouldn’t let youknow that terrible story!” Then it was terrible. My intuition was right! For amoment, I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room,Chapter 17267"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"unconsciously looking for something or some oppor-tunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of type-writing on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine,and without his thinking, followed their direction. Asthey saw the parcel he realized my meaning. “You do not know me,” I said. “When you have readthose papers, my own diary and my husband’s also,which I have typed, you will know me better. I havenot faltered in giving every thought of my own heartin this cause. But, of course, you do not know me,yet, and I must not expect you to trust me so far.” He is certainly a man of noble nature. Poor dear Lucywas right about him. He stood up and opened a largedrawer, in which were arranged in order a number ofhollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, andsaid, “You are quite right. I did not trust you because Idid not know you. But I know you now, and let mesay that I should have known you long ago. I knowthat Lucy told you of me. She told me of you too. MayI make the only atonement in my power? Take thecylinders and hear them. The first half-dozen of themare personal to me, and they will not horrify you.Then you will know me better. Dinner will by then beready. In the meantime I shall read over some of thesedocuments, and shall be better able to understand cer-tain things.” He carried the phonograph himself up to my sittingroom and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn some-thing pleasant, I am sure. For it will tell me the otherside of a true love episode of which I know one sidealready.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY29 September.—I was so absorbed in that wonderfuldiary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wifethat I let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. HarkerChapter 17268"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"was not down when the maid came to announce din-ner, so I said, “She is possibly tired. Let dinner wait anhour,” and I went on with my work. I had just finishedMrs. Harker’s diary, when she came in. She lookedsweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushedwith crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late Ihave had cause for tears, God knows! But the relief ofthem was denied me, and now the sight of those sweeteyes, brightened by recent tears, went straight to myheart. So I said as gently as I could, “I greatly fear Ihave distressed you.” “Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied. “But I havebeen more touched than I can say by your grief. Thatis a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It toldme, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It waslike a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one musthear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to beuseful. I have copied out the words on my typewriter,and none other need now hear your heart beat, as Idid.” “No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in alow voice. She laid her hand on mine and said verygravely, “Ah, but they must!” “Must! but why?” I asked. “Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part ofpoor Lucy’s death and all that led to it. Because in thestruggle which we have before us to rid the earth ofthis terrible monster we must have all the knowledgeand all the help which we can get. I think that thecylinders which you gave me contained more than youintended me to know. But I can see that there are inyour record many lights to this dark mystery. You willlet me help, will you not? I know all up to a certainpoint, and I see already, though your diary only tookme to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and howher terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathanand I have been working day and night since ProfessorVan Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get moreChapter 17269"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"information, and he will be here tomorrow to help us.We need have no secrets amongst us. Working togetherand with absolute trust, we can surely be strongerthan if some of us were in the dark.” She looked at me so appealingly, and at the sametime manifested such courage and resolution in herbearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. “Youshall,” I said, “do as you like in the matter. God for-give me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet tolearn of. But if you have so far traveled on the road topoor Lucy’s death, you will not be content, I know, toremain in the dark. Nay, the end, the very end, maygive you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. Wemust keep one another strong for what is before us.We have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eatenyou shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any ques-tions you ask, if there be anything which you do notunderstand, though it was apparent to us who werepresent.”MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL29 September.—After dinner I came with Dr. Sewardto his study. He brought back the phonograph frommy room, and I took a chair, and arranged the phono-graph so that I could touch it without getting up, andshowed me how to stop it in case I should want topause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, withhis back to me, so that I might be as free as possible,and began to read. I put the forked metal to my earsand listened. When the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and all thatfollowed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless.Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. WhenDr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified ex-clamation, and hurriedly taking a case bottle from thecupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few min-utes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl,and only that there came through all the multitude ofChapter 17270"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear Lucy wasat last at peace, I do not think I could have borne itwithout making a scene. It is all so wild and mysteri-ous, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan’sexperience in Transylvania I could not have believed.As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so gotout of my difficulty by attending to something else. Itook the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr.Seward, “Let me write this all out now. We must be ready forDr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegramto Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in Lon-don from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,and I think that if we get all of our material ready,and have every item put in chronological order, weshall have done much. “You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arecoming too. Let us be able to tell them when theycome.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace,and I began to typewrite from the beginning of theseventeenth cylinder. I used manifold, and so took threecopies of the diary, just as I had done with the rest. Itwas late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went abouthis work of going his round of the patients. When hehad finished he came back and sat near me, reading,so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. Howgood and thoughtful he is. The world seems full ofgood men, even if there are monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put inhis diary of the Professor’s perturbation at readingsomething in an evening paper at the station at Exeter,so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I bor-rowed the files of ‘The Westminster Gazette’ and ‘ThePall Mall Gazette’ and took them to my room. I re-member how much the ‘Dailygraph’ and ‘The WhitbyGazette’, of which I had made cuttings, had helped usto understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count271Chapter 17"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Dracula landed, so I shall look through the eveningpapers since then, and perhaps I shall get some newlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keepme quiet.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY30 September.—Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. Hegot his wife’s wire just before starting. He is uncom-monly clever, if one can judge from his face, and fullof energy. If this journal be true, and judging by one’sown wonderful experiences, it must be, he is also aman of great nerve. That going down to the vault asecond time was a remarkable piece of daring. Afterreading his account of it I was prepared to meet agood specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, busi-nesslike gentleman who came here today.LATER.—After lunch Harker and his wife went back totheir own room, and as I passed a while ago I heardthe click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs.Harker says that knitting together in chronologicalorder every scrap of evidence they have. Harker hasgot the letters between the consignee of the boxes atWhitby and the carriers in London who took charge ofthem. He is now reading his wife’s transcript of mydiary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is... . Strange that it never struck me that the very nexthouse might be the Count’s hiding place! Goodnessknows that we had enough clues from the conduct ofthe patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating tothe purchase of the house were with the transcript.Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might havesaved poor Lucy! Stop! That way madness lies! Harkerhas gone back, and is again collecting material. Hesays that by dinner time they will be able to show awhole connected narrative. He thinks that in the mean-time I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a272Chapter 17"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. Ihardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I sup-pose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker putmy cylinders into type! We never could have found thedates otherwise. I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with hishands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment heseemed as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down andtalked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which hetreated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spokeof going home, a subject he has never mentioned tomy knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, hespoke quite confidently of getting his discharge atonce. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harkerand read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, Ishould have been prepared to sign for him after a brieftime of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious.All those out-breaks were in some way linked with theproximity of the Count. What then does this absolutecontent mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied asto the vampire’s ultimate triumph? Stay. He is himselfzoophagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapeldoor of the deserted house he always spoke of ‘master’.This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, af-ter a while I came away. My friend is just a little toosane at present to make it safe to probe him too deepwith questions. He might begin to think, and then....So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of of his,so I have given the attendant a hint to look closelyafter him, and to have a strait waistcoat ready in caseof need.JOHNATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL29 September, in train to London.—When I receivedMr. Billington’s courteous message that he would giveme any information in his power I thought it best togo down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such in-273Chapter 17"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"quiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace thathorrid cargo of the Count’s to its place in London.Later, we may be able to deal with it. Billington jun-ior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought meto his father’s house, where they had decided that Imust spend the night. They are hospitable, with trueYorkshire hospitality, give a guest everything and leavehim to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy,and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington hadready in his office all the papers concerning the con-signment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to seeagain one of the letters which I had seen on the Count’stable before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everythinghad been carefully thought out, and done systemati-cally and with precision. He seemed to have been pre-pared for every obstacle which might be placed byaccident in the way of his intentions being carriedout. To use and Americanism, he had ‘taken no chances’,and the absolute accuracy with which his instructionswere fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care.I saw the invoice, and took note of it.‘Fifty cases ofcommon earth, to be used for experimental purposes’.Also the copy of the letter to Carter Paterson, andtheir reply. Of both these I got copies. This was all theinformation Mr. Billington could give me, so I wentdown to the port and saw the coastguards, the Cus-toms Officers and the harbor master, who kindly putme in communication with the men who had actuallyreceived the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list,and they had nothing to add to the simple description‘fifty cases of common earth’, except that the boxeswere ‘main and mortal heavy’, and that shifting themwas dry work. One of them added that it was hardlines that there wasn’t any gentleman ‘such like as likeyourself, squire’, to show some sort of appreciation oftheir efforts in a liquid form. Another put in a riderthat the thirst then generated was such that even thetime which had elapsed had not completely allayed it.Chapter 17274"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for-ever and adequately, this source of reproach.30 September.—The station master was good enoughto give me a line to his old companion the stationmaster at King’s Cross, so that when I arrived there inthe morning I was able to ask him about the arrival ofthe boxes. He, too put me at once in communicationwith the proper officials, and I saw that their tallywas correct with the original invoice. The opportuni-ties of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here lim-ited. A noble use of them had, however, been made,and again I was compelled to deal with the result inex post facto manner. From thence I went to Carter Paterson’s central of-fice, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They lookedup the transaction in their day book and letter book,and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross office formore details. By good fortune, the men who did theteaming were waiting for work, and the official at oncesent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery ofthe boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeingexactly. The carriers’ men were able to supplement thepaucity of the written words with a few more details.These were, I shortly found, connected almost solelywith the dusty nature of the job, and the consequentthirst engendered in the operators. On my affordingan opportunity, through the medium of the currencyof the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, thisbeneficial evil, one of the men remarked, “That `ere `ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever wasin. Blyme! But it ain’t been touched sence a hundredyears. There was dust that thick in the place that youmight have slep’ on it without ‘urtin’ of yer bones. An’the place was that neglected that yer might ‘ave smelledole Jerusalem in it. But the old chapel, that took thecike, that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t275Chapter 17"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"never git out quick enough. Lor’, I wouldn’t take lessnor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.” Having been in the house, I could well believe him,but if he knew what I know, he would, I think haveraised his terms. Of one thing I am now satisfied. That all those boxeswhich arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeterwere safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. Thereshould be fifty of them there, unless any have sincebeen removed, as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.Later.—Mina and I have worked all day, and we haveput all the papers into order.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL30 September.—I am so glad that I hardly know howto contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction fromthe haunting fear which I have had, that this terribleaffair and the reopening of his old wound might actdetrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitbywith as brave a face as could, but I was sick with ap-prehension. The effort has, however, done him good.He was never so resolute, never so strong, never sofull of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as thatdear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is true grit,and he improves under strain that would kill a weakernature. He came back full of life and hope and deter-mination. We have got everything in order for tonight.I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I supposeone ought to pity anything so hunted as the Count.That is just it. This thing is not human, not even abeast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor Lucy’s death,and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs ofpity in one’s heart.Later.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlierthan we expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, andChapter 17276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. Itwas to me a painful meeting, for it brought back allpoor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Ofcourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemedthat Dr. Van Helsing, too, had been quite ‘blowing mytrumpet’, as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, nei-ther of them is aware that I know all about the pro-posals they made to Lucy. They did not quite knowwhat to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amountof my knowledge. So they had to keep on neutral sub-jects. However, I thought the matter over, and came tothe conclusion that the best thing I could do would beto post them on affairs right up to date. I knew fromDr. Seward’s diary that they had been at Lucy’s death,her real death, and that I need not fear to betray anysecret before the time. So I told them, as well as Icould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, andthat my husband and I, having typewritten them, hadjust finished putting them in order. I gave them each acopy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming gothis and turned it over, it does make a pretty goodpile, he said, “Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?” I nodded, and he went on. “I don’t quite see the drift of it, but you people areall so good and kind, and have been working so ear-nestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to ac-cept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I havehad one lesson already in accepting facts that shouldmake a man humble to the last hour of his life. Be-sides, I know you loved my Lucy... .” Here he turned away and covered his face with hishands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris,with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a mo-ment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out ofthe room. I suppose there is something in a woman’snature that makes a man free to break down beforeher and express his feelings on the tender or emo-tional side without feeling it derogatory to his man-Chapter 17277"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"hood. For when Lord Godalming found himself alonewith me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterlyand openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand.I hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if herever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such athought. There I wrong him. I know he never will. Heis too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could seethat his heart was breaking, “I loved dear Lucy, and Iknow what she was to you, and what you were to her.She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, willyou not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannotmeasure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity canhelp in your affliction, won’t you let me be of somelittle service, for Lucy’s sake?” In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmedwith grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of latebeen suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grewquite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat hispalms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stoodup and then sat down again, and the tears rained downhis cheeks. I felt an infinite pity for him, and openedmy arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head onmy shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst heshook with emotion. We women have something of the mother in us thatmakes us rise above smaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked. I felt this big sorrowing man’s headresting on me, as though it were that of a baby thatsome day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hairas though he were my own child. I never thought atthe time how strange it all was. After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised him-self with an apology, though he made no disguise ofhis emotion. He told me that for days and nights past,weary days and sleepless nights, he had been unableto speak with any one, as a man must speak in his timeof sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy couldChapter 17278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terriblecircumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded,he could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said, as he dried hiseyes, “but I do not know even yet, and none other canever know, how much your sweet sympathy has beento me today. I shall know better in time, and believeme that, though I am not ungrateful now, my grati-tude will grow with my understanding. You will letme be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives, fordear Lucy’s sake?” “For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands.”Ay,and for your own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s es-teem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, youhave won mine today. If ever the future should bringto you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me,you will not call in vain. God grant that no such timemay ever come to you to break the sunshine of yourlife, but if it should ever come, promise me that youwill let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that Ifelt it would comfort him, so I said, “I promise.” As I came along the corridor I say Mr. Morris lookingout of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps.“How is Art?” he said. Then noticing my red eyes, hewent on, “Ah, I see you have been comforting him.Poor old fellow! He needs it. No one but a woman canhelp a man when he is in trouble of the heart, and hehad no one to comfort him.” He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heartbled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and Iknew that when he read it he would realize how muchI knew, so I said to him, “I wish I could comfort allwho suffer from the heart. Will you let me be yourfriend, and will you come to me for comfort if youneed it? You will know later why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took myhand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemedChapter 17279"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, andimpulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rosein his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in histhroat. He said quite calmly, “Little girl, you will neverforget that true hearted kindness, so long as ever youlive!” Then he went into the study to his friend. “Little girl!” The very words he had used to Lucy,and, oh, but he proved himself a friend.CHAPTER 18DR. SEWARD’S DIARY30 September.—I got home at five o’clock, and foundthat Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, buthad already studied the transcript of the various dia-ries and letters which Harker had not yet returnedfrom his visit to the carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennesseyhad written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea,and I can honestly say that, for the first time since Ihave lived in it, this old house seemed like home. Whenwe had finished, Mrs. Harker said, “Dr. Seward, may I ask a favor? I want to see yourpatient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What youhave said of him in your diary interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I couldnot refuse her, and there was no possible reason why Ishould, so I took her with me. When I went into theroom, I told the man that a lady would like to seehim, to which he simply answered, “Why?” “She is going through the house, and wants to seeevery one in it,” I answered. “Oh, very well,” he said, “let her come in, by allmeans, but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swal-lowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before Icould stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, orwas jealous of, some interference. When he had gotChapter 18280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully, “Letthe lady come in,” and sat down on the edge of hisbed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised sothat he could see her as she entered. For a moment Ithought that he might have some homicidal intent. Iremembered how quiet he had been just before he at-tacked me in my own study, and I took care to standwhere I could seize him at once if he attempted tomake a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulnesswhich would at once command the respect of any lu-natic, for easiness is one of the qualities mad peoplemost respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleas-antly, and held out her hand. “Good evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, Iknow you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.” He madeno immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently witha set frown on his face. This look gave way to one ofwonder, which merged in doubt, then to my intenseastonishment he said, “You’re not the girl the doctorwanted to marry, are you? You can’t be, you know, forshe’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, “Oh no! Ihave a husband of my own, to whom I was marriedbefore I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs.Harker.” “Then what are you doing here?” “My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr.Seward.” “Then don’t stay.” “But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might notbe pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was tome, so I joined in, “How did you know I wanted tomarry anyone?” His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pausein which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me,instantly turning them back again, “What an asinineChapter 18281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"question!” “I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker,at once championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respectas he had shown contempt to me, “You will, of course,understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so lovedand honored as our host is, everything regarding himis of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward isloved not only by his household and his friends, buteven by his patients, who, being some of them hardlyin mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes andeffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunaticasylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tenden-cies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors ofnon causa and ignoratio elenche.” I positively opened my eyes at this new development.Here was my own pet lunatic, the most pronounced ofhis type that I had ever met with, talking elementalphilosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentle-man. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence whichhad touched some chord in his memory. If this newphase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her un-conscious influence, she must have some rare gift orpower. We continued to talk for some time, and seeing thathe was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, look-ing at me questioningly as she began, to lead him tohis favorite topic. I was again astonished, for he ad-dressed himself to the question with the impartialityof the completest sanity. He even took himself as anexample when he mentioned certain things. “Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had astrange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friendswere alarmed, and insisted on my being put under con-trol. I used to fancy that life was a positive and per-petual entity, and that by consuming a multitude oflive things, no matter how low in the scale of cre-ation, one might indefinitely prolong life. At times IChapter 18282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to takehuman life. The doctor here will bear me out that onone occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose ofstrengthening my vital powers by the assimilation withmy own body of his life through the medium of hisblood, relying of course, upon the Scriptural phrase,‘For the blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendorof a certain nostrum has vulgarized the truism to thevery point of contempt. Isn’t that true, doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardlyknew what to either think or say, it was hard to imag-ine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies notfive minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that Ishould go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I toldMrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr.Renfield, “Goodbye, and I hope I may see you often,under auspices pleasanter to yourself.” To which, to my astonishment, he replied, “Goodbye,my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet faceagain. May He bless and keep you!” When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I leftthe boys behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerfulthan he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quinceyis more like his own bright self than he has been formany a long day. Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eagernimbleness of a boy. He saw me at once, and rushed upto me, saying, “Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well?So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if needbe. All affairs are settled with me, and I have much totell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so finehusband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they arewith you, too? Good!” As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed,and of how my own diary had come to be of some usethrough Mrs. Harker’s suggestion, at which the Profes-sor interrupted me.Chapter 18283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain,a brain that a man should have were he much gifted,and a woman’s heart. The good God fashioned her for apurpose, believe me, when He made that so good com-bination. Friend John, up to now fortune has madethat woman of help to us, after tonight she must nothave to do with this so terrible affair. It is not goodthat she run a risk so great. We men are determined,nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster? Butit is no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed,her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrorsand hereafter she may suffer, both in waking, from hernerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,she is young woman and not so long married, theremay be other things to think of some time, if not now.You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consultwith us, but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work,and we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him whatwe had found in his absence, that the house whichDracula had bought was the very next one to my own.He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to comeon him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for thenwe might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy.However, ‘the milk that is spilt cries not outafterwards,’as you say. We shall not think of that, butgo on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a silencethat lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before wewent to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker, “Iam told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you andyour husband have put up in exact order all thingsthat have been, up to this moment.” “Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impul-sively, “but up to this morning.” “But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto howgood light all the little things have made. We havetold our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the284Chapter 18"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"worse for it.” Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper fromher pockets, she said, “Dr. Van Helsing, will you readthis, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record oftoday. I too have seen the need of putting down atpresent everything, however trivial, but there is littlein this except what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back,saying, “It need not go in if you do not wish it, but Ipray that it may. It can but make your husband loveyou the more, and all us, your friends, more honoryou, as well as more esteem and love.” She took itback with another blush and a bright smile. And so now, up to this very hour, all the records wehave are complete and in order. The Professor tookaway one copy to study after dinner, and before ourmeeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of ushave already read everything, so when we meet in thestudy we shall all be informed as to facts, and canarrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mys-terious enemy.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL30 September.—When we met in Dr. Seward’s studytwo hours after dinner, which had been at six o’clock,we unconsciously formed a sort of board or commit-tee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table,to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into theroom. He made me sit next to him on his right, andasked me to act as secretary. Jonathan sat next to me.Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Professor, andDr. Seward in the center. The Professor said, “I may, I suppose, take it that weare all acquainted with the facts that are in these pa-pers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on, “Thenit were, I think, good that I tell you something of theChapter 18285"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"kind of enemy with which we have to deal. I shallthen make known to you something of the history ofthis man, which has been ascertained for me. So wethen can discuss how we shall act, and can take ourmeasure according. “There are such beings as vampires, some of us haveevidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof ofour own unhappy experience, the teachings and therecords of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not thatthrough long years I have trained myself to keep anopen mind, I could not have believed until such timeas that fact thunder on my ear.‘See! See! I prove, I prove.’Alas! Had I known at first what now I know, nay, had Ieven guess at him, one so precious life had been sparedto many of us who did love her. But that is gone, andwe must so work, that other poor souls perish not,whilst we can save. The nosferatu do not die like thebee when he sting once. He is only stronger, and beingstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vam-pire which is amongst us is of himself so strong inperson as twenty men, he is of cunning more thanmortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages, he havestill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymol-ogy imply, the divination by the dead, and all thedead that he can come nigh to are for him at com-mand, he is brute, and more than brute, he is devil incallous, and the heart of him is not, he can, within hisrange, direct the elements, the storm, the fog, thethunder, he can command all the meaner things, therat, and the owl, and the bat, the moth, and the fox,and the wolf, he can grow and become small, and hecan at times vanish and come unknown. How then arewe to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall wefind his where, and having found it, how can we de-stroy? My friends, this is much, it is a terrible taskthat we undertake, and there may be consequence tomake the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight286Chapter 18"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"he must surely win, and then where end we? Life isnothings, I heed him not. But to fail here, is not merelife or death. It is that we become as him, that wehenceforward become foul things of the night like him,without heart or conscience, preying on the bodiesand the souls of those we love best. To us forever arethe gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them tous again? We go on for all time abhorred by all, a bloton the face of God’s sunshine, an arrow in the side ofHim who died for man. But we are face to face withduty, and in such case must we shrink? For me, I sayno, but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, hisfair places, his song of birds, his music and his love,lie far behind. You others are young. Some have seensorrow, but there are fair days yet in store. What sayyou?” Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of ourdanger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretchout, but it was life to me to feel its touch, so strong,so self reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand canspeak for itself, it does not even need a woman’s loveto hear its music. When the Professor had done speak-ing my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his, therewas no need for speaking between us. “I answer for Mina and myself,” he said. “Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris,laconically as usual. “I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’ssake, if for no other reason.” Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his goldencrucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side.I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left,Jonathan held my right with his left and stretchedacross to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our sol-emn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but itdid not even occur to me to draw back. We resumedChapter 18287"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort ofcheerfulness which showed that the serious work hadbegun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as busi-nesslike a way, as any other transaction of life. “Well, you know what we have to contend against,but we too, are not without strength. We have on ourside power of combination, a power denied to the vam-pire kind, we have sources of science, we are free toact and think, and the hours of the day and the nightare ours equally. In fact, so far as our powers extend,they are unfettered, and we are free to use them. Wehave self devotion in a cause and an end to achievewhich is not a selfish one. These things are much. “Now let us see how far the general powers arrayedagainst us are restrict, and how the individual cannot.In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampirein general, and of this one in particular. “All we have to go upon are traditions and supersti-tions. These do not at the first appear much, when thematter is one of life and death, nay of more than ei-ther life or death. Yet must we be satisfied, in the firstplace because we have to be, no other means is at ourcontrol, and secondly, because, after all these things,tradition and superstition, are everything. Does notthe belief in vampires rest for others, though not, alas!for us, on them! A year ago which of us would havereceived such a possibility, in the midst of our scien-tific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? Weeven scouted a belief that we saw justified under ourvery eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and thebelief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the mo-ment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he isknown everywhere that men have been. In old Greece,in old Rome, he flourish in Germany all over, in France,in India, even in the Chermosese, and in China, so farfrom us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoplesfor him at this day. He have follow the wake of theberserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav,Chapter 18288"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"the Saxon, the Magyar. “So far, then, we have all we may act upon, and letme tell you that very much of the beliefs are justifiedby what we have seen in our own so unhappy experi-ence. The vampire live on, and cannot die by merepassing of the time, he can flourish when that he canfatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we haveseen amongst us that he can even grow younger, thathis vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as thoughthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum isplenty. “But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat notas others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with himfor weeks, did never see him eat, never! He throws noshadow, he make in the mirror no reflect, as againJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of hishand, witness again Jonathan when he shut the dooragainst the wolves, and when he help him from thediligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as wegather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tearopen the dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina sawhim on the window at Whitby, and as friend John sawhim fly from this so near house, and as my friendQuincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. “He can come in mist which he create, that nobleship’s captain proved him of this, but, from what weknow, the distance he can make this mist is limited,and it can only be round himself. “He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, asagain Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle ofDracula. He become so small, we ourselves saw MissLucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadthspace at the tomb door. He can, when once he find hisway, come out from anything or into anything, nomatter how close it be bound or even fused up withfire, solder you call it. He can see in the dark, nosmall power this, in a world which is one half shutfrom the light. Ah, but hear me through.Chapter 18289"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" “He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay,he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley,than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where helists, he who is not of nature has yet to obey some ofnature’s laws, why we know not. He may not enteranywhere at the first, unless there be some one of thehousehold who bid him to come, though afterwardshe can come as he please. His power ceases, as doesthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. “Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he canonly change himself at noon or at exact sunrise orsunset. These things we are told, and in this record ofours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he cando as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place un-hallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of thesuicide at Whitby, still at other time he can only changewhen the time come. It is said, too, that he can onlypass running water at the slack or the flood of thetide. Then there are things which so afflict him thathe has no power, as the garlic that we know of, and asfor things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, thatwas amongst us even now when we resolve, to them heis nothing, but in their presence he take his place faroff and silent with respect. There are others, too, whichI shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may needthem. “The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him thathe move not from it, a sacred bullet fired into thecoffin kill him so that he be true dead, and as for thestake through him, we know already of its peace, orthe cut off head that giveth rest. We have seen it withour eyes. “Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him,if we obey what we know. But he is clever. I have askedmy friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make290Chapter 18"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"his record, and from all the means that are, he tell meof what he has been. He must, indeed, have been thatVoivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk,over the great river on the very frontier of Turkeyland.If it be so, then was he no common man, for in thattime, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as thecleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravestof the sons of the ‘land beyond the forest.’ That mightybrain and that iron resolution went with him to hisgrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculaswere, says Arminius, a great and noble race, thoughnow and again were scions who were held by theircoevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. Theylearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst themountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devilclaims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records aresuch words as ‘stregoica’ witch, ‘ordog’ and ‘pokol’ Sa-tan and hell, and in one manuscript this very Draculais spoken of as ‘wampyr,’which we all understand toowell. There have been from the loins of this very onegreat men and good women, and their graves makesacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thingis rooted deep in all good, in soil barren of holy memo-ries it cannot rest.” Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was lookingsteadily at the window, and he now got up quietly,and went out of the room. There was a little pause,and then the Professor went on. “And now we must settle what we do. We have heremuch data, and we must proceed to lay out our cam-paign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that fromthe castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all ofwhich were delivered at Carfax, we also know that atleast some of these boxes have been removed. It seemsto me, that our first step should be to ascertain whetherall the rest remain in the house beyond that wall wherewe look today, or whether any more have been re-Chapter 18291"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"moved. If the latter, we must trace... .” Here we were interrupted in a very startling way.Outside the house came the sound of a pistol shot, theglass of the window was shattered with a bullet, whichricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struckthe far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart acoward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to theirfeet, Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threwup the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris’ voicewithout, “Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall comein and tell you about it.” A minute later he came in and said, “It was an idioticthing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker,most sincerely, I fear I must have frightened you terri-bly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talk-ing there came a big bat and sat on the window sill. Ihave got such a horror of the damned brutes from re-cent events that I cannot stand them, and I went outto have a shot, as I have been doing of late of eve-nings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh atme for it then, Art.” “Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing. “I don’t know, I fancy not, for it flew away into thewood.” Without saying any more he took his seat, andthe Professor began to resume his statement. “We must trace each of these boxes, and when we areready, we must either capture or kill this monster inhis lair, or we must, so to speak, sterilize the earth, sothat no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the endwe may find him in his form of man between the hoursof noon and sunset, and so engage with him when heis at his most weak. “And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the enduntil all be well. You are too precious to us to havesuch risk. When we part tonight, you no more mustquestion. We shall tell you all in good time. We aremen and are able to bear, but you must be our star andour hope, and we shall act all the more free that youChapter 18292"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"are not in the danger, such as we are.” All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but itdid not seem to me good that they should brave dan-ger and, perhaps lessen their safety, strength beingthe best safety, through care of me, but their mindswere made up, and though it was a bitter pill for meto swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept theirchivalrous care of me. Mr. Morris resumed the discussion, “As there is notime to lose, I vote we have a look at his house rightnow. Time is everything with him, and swift action onour part may save another victim.” I own that my heart began to fail me when the timefor action came so close, but I did not say anything,for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag ora hindrance to their work, they might even leave meout of their counsels altogether. They have now goneoff to Carfax, with means to get into the house. Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, asif a woman can sleep when those she loves are in dan-ger! I shall lie down, and pretend to sleep, lestJonathan have added anxiety about me when he re-turns.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY1 October, 4 A.M.—Just as we were about to leave thehouse, an urgent message was brought to me fromRenfield to know if I would see him at once, as he hadsomething of the utmost importance to say to me. Itold the messenger to say that I would attend to hiswishes in the morning, I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added, “He seems very importunate,sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don’t know butwhat, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one ofhis violent fits.” I knew the man would not have saidthis without some cause, so I said, “All right, I’ll gonow,” and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for293Chapter 18"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"me, as I had to go and see my patient. “Take me with you, friend John,” said theProfessor.”His case in your diary interest me much,and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case. Ishould much like to see him, and especial when hismind is disturbed.” “May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming. “Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” saidHarker. I nodded, and we all went down the passagetogether. We found him in a state of considerable excitement,but far more rational in his speech and manner than Ihad ever seen him. There was an unusual understand-ing of himself, which was unlike anything I had evermet with in a lunatic, and he took it for granted thathis reasons would prevail with others entirely sane.We all five went into the room, but none of the othersat first said anything. His request was that I would atonce release him from the asylum and send him home.This he backed up with arguments regarding his com-plete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends, “he said, “they will, per-haps, not mind sitting in judgement on my case. Bythe way, you have not introduced me.”I was so much astonished, that the oddness of intro-ducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me atthe moment, and besides, there was a certain dignityin the man’s manner, so much of the habit of equality,that I at once made the introduction, “Lord Godalming,Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas,Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn,“Lord Godalming, I had the honor of seconding yourfather at the Windham, I grieve to know, by your hold-ing the title, that he is no more. He was a man lovedand honored by all who knew him, and in his youthwas, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch,much patronized on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you shouldChapter 18294"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"be proud of your great state. Its reception into theUnion was a precedent which may have far-reachingeffects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics mayhold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power ofTreaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement,when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as apolitical fable. What shall any man say of his pleasureat meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology fordropping all forms of conventional prefix. When anindividual has revolutionized therapeutics by his dis-covery of the continuous evolution of brain matter,conventional forms are unfitting, since they wouldseem to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen,who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possessionof natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective placesin the moving world, I take to witness that I am assane as at least the majority of men who are in fullpossession of their liberties. And I am sure that you,Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well asscientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me asone to be considered as under exceptionalcircumstances.”He made this last appeal with a courtlyair of conviction which was not without its own charm. I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I wasunder the conviction, despite my knowledge of theman’s character and history, that his reason had beenrestored, and I felt under a strong impulse to tell himthat I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would seeabout the necessary formalities for his release in themorning. I thought it better to wait, however, beforemaking so grave a statement, for of old I knew thesudden changes to which this particular patient wasliable. So I contented myself with making a generalstatement that he appeared to be improving very rap-idly, that I would have a longer chat with him in themorning, and would then see what I could do in thedirection of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly,Chapter 18295"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend mywish. I desire to go at once, here, now, this very hour,this very moment, if I may. Time presses, and in ourimplied agreement with the old scytheman it is of theessence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessaryto put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Sewardso simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure itsfulfilment.” He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative inmy face, turned to the others, and scrutinized themclosely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he wenton, “Is it possible that I have erred in my supposi-tion?” “You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as Ifelt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he saidslowly, “Then I suppose I must only shift my ground ofrequest. Let me ask for this concession, boon, privi-lege, what you will. I am content to implore in such acase, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of oth-ers. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of myreasons, but you may, I assure you, take it from methat they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and springfrom the highest sense of duty. “Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would ap-prove to the full the sentiments which animate me.Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best andtruest of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growingconviction that this sudden change of his entire intel-lectual method was but yet another phase of his mad-ness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer,knowing from experience that he would, like all luna-tics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing wasgazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushyeyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentra-tion of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone whichdid not surprise me at the time, but only when IChapter 18296"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"thought of it afterwards, for it was as of one address-ing an equal, “Can you not tell frankly your real rea-son for wishing to be free tonight? I will undertakethat if you will satisfy even me, a stranger, withoutprejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind,Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on hisown responsibility, the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignantregret on his face. The Professor went on, “Come, sir,bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason inthe highest degree, since you seek to impress us withyour complete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanitywe have reason to doubt, since you are not yet re-leased from medical treatment for this very defect. Ifyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisestcourse, how can we perform the duty which you your-self put upon us? Be wise, and help us, and if we canwe shall aid you to achieve your wish.” He still shook his head as he said, “Dr. Van Helsing, Ihave nothing to say. Your argument is complete, andif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment,but I am not my own master in the matter. I can onlyask you to trust me. If I am refused, the responsibilitydoes not rest with me.” I thought it was now time to end the scene, whichwas becoming too comically grave, so I went towardsthe door, simply saying, “Come, my friends, we havework to do. Goodnight.” As, however, I got near the door, a new change cameover the patient. He moved towards me so quickly thatfor the moment I feared that he was about to makeanother homicidal attack. My fears, however, weregroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly,and made his petition in a moving manner. As he sawthat the very excess of his emotion was militatingagainst him, by restoring us more to our old rela-tions, he became still more demonstrative. I glancedat Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in hisChapter 18297"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"eyes, so I became a little more fixed in my manner, ifnot more stern, and motioned to him that his effortswere unavailing. I had previously seen something ofthe same constantly growing excitement in him whenhe had to make some request of which at the time hehad thought much, such for instance, as when hewanted a cat, and I was prepared to see the collapseinto the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realized, for when he foundthat his appeal would not be successful, he got intoquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees,and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive sup-plication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, withthe tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole faceand form expressive of the deepest emotion. “Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me imploreyou, to let me out of this house at once. Send me awayhow you will and where you will, send keepers withme with whips and chains, let them take me in a straitwaistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol, butlet me go out of this. You don’t know what you do bykeeping me here. I am speaking from the depths of myheart, of my very soul. You don’t know whom youwrong, or how, and I may not tell. Woe is me! I maynot tell. By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear,by your love that is lost, by your hope that lives, forthe sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and savemy soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t youunderstand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know thatI am sane and earnest now, that I am no lunatic in amad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hearme! Hear me! Let me go, let me go, let me go!” I thought that the longer this went on the wilder hewould get, and so would bring on a fit, so I took himby the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this, we have hadquite enough already. Get to your bed and try to be-have more discreetly.”Chapter 18298"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently forseveral moments. Then, without a word, he rose andmoving over, sat down on the side of the bed. Thecollapse had come, as on former occasions, just as Ihad expected. When I was leaving the room, last of our party, hesaid to me in a quiet, well-bred voice, “You will, Itrust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind,later on, that I did what I could to convince you tonight.”CHAPTER 19JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL1 October, 5 A.M.—I went with the party to the searchwith an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina soabsolutely strong and well. I am so glad that she con-sented to hold back and let us men do the work. Some-how, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearfulbusiness at all, but now that her work is done, andthat it is due to her energy and brains and foresightthat the whole story is put together in such a waythat every point tells, she may well feel that her partis finished, and that she can henceforth leave the restto us. We were, I think, all a little upset by the scenewith Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his roomwe were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, “Say, Jack, if thatman wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about the sanestlunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that hehad some serious purpose, and if he had, it was prettyrough on him not to get a chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsingadded, “Friend John, you know more lunatics than Ido, and I’m glad of it, for I fear that if it had been tome to decide I would before that last hysterical out-burst have given him free. But we live and learn, andin our present task we must take no chance, as myChapter 19299"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"friend Quincey would say. All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamykind of way, “I don’t know but that I agree with you.If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would havetaken my chance of trusting him, but he seems so mixedup with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I amafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. Ican’t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervorfor a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with histeeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and master’,and he may want to get out to help him in some dia-bolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and therats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose heisn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He cer-tainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we havedone what is best. These things, in conjunction withthe wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand onhis shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way, “FriendJohn, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in avery sad and terrible case, we can only do as we deembest. What else have we to hope for, except the pity ofthe good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes,but now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle,as he remarked, “That old place may be full of rats,and if so, I’ve got an antidote on call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house,taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on thelawn when the moonlight shone out. When we got tothe porch the Professor opened his bag and took out alot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting theminto four little groups, evidently one for each. Thenhe spoke. “My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, andwe need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merelyspiritual. Remember that he has the strength of twentymen, and that, though our necks or our windpipes areChapter 19300"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"of the common kind, and therefore breakable orcrushable, his are not amenable to mere strength. Astronger man, or a body of men more strong in allthan him, can at certain times hold him, but they can-not hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, there-fore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this nearyour heart.” As he spoke he lifted a little silver cruci-fix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him, “putthese flowers round your neck,” here he handed to mea wreath of withered garlic blossoms, “for other en-emies more mundane, this revolver and this knife, andfor aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which youcan fasten to your breast, and for all, and above all atthe last, this, which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put inan envelope and handed to me. Each of the others wassimilarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where are the skeletonkeys? If so that we can open the door, we need notbreak house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.” Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his me-chanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in goodstead. Presently he got one to suit, after a little playback and forward the bolt yielded, and with a rustyclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rustyhinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlinglylike the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward’s diary ofthe opening of Miss Westenra’s tomb, I fancy that thesame idea seemed to strike the others, for with oneaccord they shrank back. The Professor was the firstto move forward, and stepped into the open door. “In manus tuas, Domine!”he said, crossing himself ashe passed over the threshold. We closed the door be-hind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps weshould possibly attract attention from the road. TheProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might notbe able to open it from within should we be in a hurrymaking our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and pro-301Chapter 19"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"ceeded on our search. The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of oddforms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacityof our bodies threw great shadows. I could not for mylife get away from the feeling that there was someoneelse amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, sopowerfully brought home to me by the grim surround-ings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania. I thinkthe feeling was common to us all, for I noticed thatthe others kept looking over their shoulders at everysound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself do-ing. The whole place was thick with dust. The floor wasseemingly inches deep, except where there were re-cent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp Icould see marks of hobnails where the dust wascracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust,and in the corners were masses of spider’s webs, whereonthe dust had gathered till they looked like old tat-tered rags as the weight had torn them partly down.On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, witha time-yellowed label on each. They had been usedseveral times, for on the table were several similar rentsin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed whenthe Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said, “You know this place,Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you knowit at least more than we do. Which is the way to thechapel?” I had an idea of its direction, though on my formervisit I had not been able to get admission to it, so Iled the way, and after a few wrong turnings foundmyself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed withiron bands. “This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned hislamp on a small map of the house, copied from the fileof my original correspondence regarding the purchase.With a little trouble we found the key on the bunchChapter 19302"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"and opened the door. We were prepared for some un-pleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint,malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps,but none of us ever expected such an odor as we en-countered. None of the others had met the Count at allat close quarters, and when I had seen him he waseither in the fasting stage of his existence in his roomsor, when he was bloated with fresh blood, in a ruinedbuilding open to the air, but here the place was smalland close, and the long disuse had made the air stag-nant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of somedry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But asto the odor itself, how shall I describe it? It was notalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortalityand with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but itseemed as though corruption had become itself cor-rupt. Faugh! It sickens me to think of it. Every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to theplace and intensified its loathsomeness. Under ordinary circumstances such a stench wouldhave brought our enterprise to an end, but this was noordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose inwhich we were involved gave us a strength which roseabove merely physical considerations. After the invol-untary shrinking consequent on the first nauseouswhiff, we one and all set about our work as thoughthat loathsome place were a garden of roses. We made an accurate examination of the place, theProfessor saying as we began, “The first thing is to seehow many of the boxes are left, we must then examineevery hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannotget some clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to show how many remained,for the great earth chests were bulky, and there wasno mistaking them. There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming sud-denly turn and look out of the vaulted door into theChapter 19303"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instantmy heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out fromthe shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of theCount’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes,the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a mo-ment, for, as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw aface, but it was only the shadows,” and resumed hisinquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and steppedinto the passage. There was no sign of anyone, and asthere were no corners, no doors, no aperture of anykind, but only the solid walls of the passage, therecould be no hiding place even for him. I took it thatfear had helped imagination, and said nothing. A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly backfrom a corner, which he was examining. We all fol-lowed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedlysome nervousness was growing on us, and we saw awhole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled likestars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole placewas becoming alive with rats. For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save LordGodalming, who was seemingly prepared for such anemergency. Rushing over to the great iron-bound oakendoor, which Dr. Seward had described from the out-side, and which I had seen myself, he turned the keyin the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the dooropen. Then, taking his little silver whistle from hispocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered frombehind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, andafter about a minute three terriers came dashing roundthe corner of the house. Unconsciously we had allmoved towards the door, and as we moved I noticedthat the dust had been much disturbed. The boxes whichhad been taken out had been brought this way. Buteven in the minute that had elapsed the number of therats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm overthe place all at once, till the lamplight, shining ontheir moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes,Chapter 19304"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"made the place look like a bank of earth set with fire-flies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold sud-denly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneouslylifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubriousfashion. The rats were multiplying in thousands, andwe moved out. Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carryinghim in, placed him on the floor. The instant his feettouched the ground he seemed to recover his courage,and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled beforehim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of ascore, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted inthe same manner, had but small prey ere the wholemass had vanished. With their going it seemed as if some evil presencehad departed, for the dogs frisked about and barkedmerrily as they made sudden darts at their prostratefoes, and turned them over and over and tossed themin the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to findour spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of thedeadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door,or the relief which we experienced by finding our-selves in the open I know not, but most certainly theshadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe,and the occasion of our coming lost something of itsgrim significance, though we did not slacken a whit inour resolution. We closed the outer door and barredand locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, beganour search of the house. We found nothing throughoutexcept dust in extraordinary proportions, and all un-touched save for my own footsteps when I had mademy first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit anysymptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned tothe chapel they frisked about as though they had beenrabbit hunting in a summer wood. The morning was quickening in the east when weemerged from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken thekey of the hall door from the bunch, and locked theChapter 19305"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into hispocket when he had done. “So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently suc-cessful. No harm has come to us such as I feared mightbe and yet we have ascertained how many boxes aremissing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first,and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous, stephas been accomplished without the bringing there-into our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her wak-ing or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds andsmells of horror which she might never forget. Onelesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to ar-gue a particulari, that the brute beasts which are tothe Count’s command are yet themselves not amenableto his spiritual power, for look, these rats that wouldcome to his call, just as from his castle top he sum-mon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother’scry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell fromthe so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have othermatters before us, other dangers, other fears, and thatmonster... . He has not used his power over the bruteworld for the only or the last time tonight. So be itthat he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us op-portunity to cry ‘check’in some ways in this chess game,which we play for the stake of human souls. And nowlet us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we havereason to be content with our first night’s work. Itmay be ordained that we have many nights and daysto follow, if full of peril, but we must go on, and fromno danger shall we shrink.” The house was silent when we got back, save for somepoor creature who was screaming away in one of thedistant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield’sroom. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing him-self, after the manner of the insane, with needlessthoughts of pain. I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Minaasleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my earChapter 19306"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"down to hear it. She looks paler than usual. I hope themeeting tonight has not upset her. I am truly thankfulthat she is to be left out of our future work, and evenof our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a womanto bear. I did not think so at first, but I know betternow. Therefore I am glad that it is settled. There maybe things which would frighten her to hear, and yet toconceal them from her might be worse than to tell herif once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her,till at least such time as we can tell her that all isfinished, and the earth free from a monster of the netherworld. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keepsilence after such confidence as ours, but I must beresolute, and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight’sdoings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that hashappened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.1 October, later.—I suppose it was natural that weshould have all overslept ourselves, for the day was abusy one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Minamust have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept tillthe sun was high, I was awake before her, and had tocall two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, shewas so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did notrecognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blankterror, as one looks who has been waked out of a baddream. She complained a little of being tired, and I lether rest till later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that sev-eral were taken in any of these removals we may beable to trace them all. Such will, of course, immenselysimplify our labor, and the sooner the matter is at-tended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snellingtoday.Chapter 19307"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"DR. SEWARD’S DIARY1 October.—It was towards noon when I was awakenedby the Professor walking into my room. He was morejolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evidentthat last night’s work has helped to take some of thebrooding weight off his mind. After going over theadventure of the night he suddenly said, “Your patientinterests me much. May it be that with you I visit himthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can goalone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to finda lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told himthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then Ishould not have to keep him waiting, so I called anattendant and gave him the necessary instructions.Before the Professor left the room I cautioned himagainst getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he answered, “I want him to talk of himselfand of his delusion as to consuming live things. Hesaid to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yester-day, that he had once had such a belief. Why do yousmile, friend John?” “Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laidmy hand on the typewritten matter.”When our saneand learned lunatic made that very statement of howhe used to consume life, his mouth was actually nau-seous with the flies and spiders which he had eatenjust before Mrs. Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said. “Yourmemory is true, friend John. I should have remem-bered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought andmemory which makes mental disease such a fascinat-ing study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out ofthe folly of this madman than I shall from the teach-ing of the most wise. Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was throughthat in hand. It seemed that the time had been veryChapter 19308"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in thestudy. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he stood at thedoor. “Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is fin-ished, and I am free. I can go with you now, if youlike.” “It is needless, I have seen him!” “Well?” “I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Ourinterview was short. When I entered his room he wassitting on a stool in the center, with his elbows on hisknees, and his face was the picture of sullen discon-tent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and withsuch a measure of respect as I could assume. He madeno reply whatever. ‘Don’t you know me?’ I asked. Hisanswer was not reassuring. “I know you well enough,you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you wouldtake yourself and your idiotic brain theories some-where else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!’ Not aword more would he say, but sat in his implacablesullenness as indifferent to me as though I had notbeen in the room at all. Thus departed for this timemy chance of much learning from this so clever luna-tic, so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a fewhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. FriendJohn, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is nomore to be pained, no more to be worried with ourterrible things. Though we shall much miss her help,it is better so.” “I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered ear-nestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this mat-ter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of it. Things are quitebad enough for us, all men of the world, and who havebeen in many tight places in our time, but it is noplace for a woman, and if she had remained in touchwith the affair, it would in time infallibly have wreckedher.”Chapter 19309"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harkerand Harker, Quincey and Art are all out following upthe clues as to the earth boxes.

This morning Islept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and thoughJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke tome before he went out, never more sweetly or ten-derly, but he never mentioned a word of what hadhappened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet hemust have known how terribly anxious I was. Poordear fellow! I suppose it must have distressed him evenmore than it did me. They all agreed that it was bestthat I should not be drawn further into this awful work,and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anythingfrom me! And now I am crying like a silly fool, when Iknow it comes from my husband’s great love and fromthe good, good wishes of those other strong men. Thathas done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tellme all. And lest it should ever be that he should thinkfor a moment that I kept anything from him, I stillkeep my journal as usual. Then if he has feared of mytrust I shall show it to him, with every thought of myheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangelysad and low-spirited today. I suppose it is the reac-tion from the terrible excitement. Last night I went to bed when the men had gone,simply because they told me to. I didn’t feel sleepy,and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I kept think-ing over everything that has been ever since Jonathancame to see me in London, and it all seems like a hor-rible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to someChapter 19310"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matterhow right it me be, to bring on the very thing whichis most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to Whitby,perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. Shehadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard till I came,and if she hadn’t come there in the day time with meshe wouldn’t have walked in her sleep. And if she hadn’tgone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn’thave destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go toWhitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what hascome over me today. I must hide it from Jonathan, forif he knew that I had been crying twice in one morn-ing... . I, who never cried on my own account, andwhom he has never caused to shed a tear, the dearfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold faceon, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it. I sup-pose it is just one of the lessons that we poor womenhave to learn.... I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. Iremember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs anda lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultu-ous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is some-where under this. And then there was silence over ev-erything, silence so profound that it startled me, andI got up and looked out of the window. All was darkand silent, the black shadows thrown by the moon-light seeming full of a silent mystery of their own.Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grimand fixed as death or fate, so that a thin streak ofwhite mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slow-ness across the grass towards the house, seemed tohave a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think thatthe digression of my thoughts must have done me good,for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creepingover me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so Igot out and looked out of the window again. The mistwas spreading, and was now close up to the house, sothat I could see it lying thick against the wall, asChapter 19311"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"though it were stealing up to the windows. The poorman was more loud than ever, and though I could notdistinguish a word he said, I could in some way recog-nize in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part.Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knewthat the attendants were dealing with him. I was sofrightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothesover my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was notthen a bit sleepy, at least so I thought, but I musthave fallen asleep, for except dreams, I do not remem-ber anything until the morning, when Jonathan wokeme. I think that it took me an effort and a little timeto realize where I was, and that it was Jonathan whowas bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, andwas almost typical of the way that waking thoughtsbecome merged in, or continued in, dreams. I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathanto come back. I was very anxious about him, and I waspowerless to act, my feet, and my hands, and my brainwere weighted, so that nothing could proceed at theusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Thenit began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, anddank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face,and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around.The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, butturned down, came only like a tiny red spark throughthe fog, which had evidently grown thicker and pouredinto the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shutthe window before I had come to bed. I would havegot out to make certain on the point, but some leadenlethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will.I lay still and endured, that was all. I closed my eyes,but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonder-ful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conve-niently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker andthicker and I could see now how it came in, for I couldsee it like smoke, or with the white energy of boilingwater, pouring in, not through the window, butChapter 19312"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"through the joinings of the door. It got thicker andthicker, till it seemed as if it became concentratedinto a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through thetop of which I could see the light of the gas shininglike a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brainjust as the cloudy column was now whirling in theroom, and through it all came the scriptural words “apillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was itindeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to mein my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both theday and the night guiding, for the fire was in the redeye, which at the thought gat a new fascination forme, till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed toshine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such asLucy told me of in her momentary mental wanderingwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the win-dows of St. Mary’s Church. Suddenly the horror burstupon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen thoseawful women growing into reality through the whirl-ing mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I musthave fainted, for all became black darkness. The lastconscious effort which imagination made was to showme a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would un-seat one’s reason if there were too much of them. Iwould get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribesomething for me which would make me sleep, onlythat I fear to alarm them. Such a dream at the presenttime would become woven into their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do not,I shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose ofchloral, that cannot hurt me for once, and it will giveme a good night’s sleep. Last night tired me more thanif I had not slept at all.2 October 10 P.M.—Last night I slept, but did notdream. I must have slept soundly, for I was not wakedby Jonathan coming to bed, but the sleep has not re-Chapter 19313"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"freshed me, for today I feel terribly weak and spirit-less. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying downdozing. In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he mightsee me. Poor man, he was very gentle, and when Icame away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me.Some way it affected me much. I am crying when Ithink of him. This is a new weakness, of which I mustbe careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew Ihad been crying. He and the others were out till din-ner time, and they all came in tired. I did what I couldto brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort didme good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinnerthey sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke to-gether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted totell each other of what had occurred to each duringthe day. I could see from Jonathan’s manner that hehad something important to communicate. I was notso sleepy as I should have been, so before they went Iasked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of somekind, as I had not slept well the night before. He verykindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gaveto me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as itwas very mild... . I have taken it, and am waiting forsleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not donewrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fearcomes, that I may have been foolish in thus deprivingmyself of the power of waking. I might want it. Herecomes sleep. Goodnight.CHAPTER 20JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL1 October, evening.—I found Thomas Snelling in hishouse at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in acondition to remember anything. The very prospect ofbeer which my expected coming had opened to himChapter 20314"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"had proved too much, and he had begun too early onhis expected debauch. I learned, however, from his wife,who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only theassistant of Smollet, who of the two mates was theresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, andfound Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in hisshirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer. He is adecent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliabletype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. Heremembered all about the incident of the boxes, andfrom a wonderful dog-eared notebook, which he pro-duced from some mysterious receptacle about the seatof his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entriesin thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the des-tinations of the boxes. There were, he said, six in thecartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another sixwhich he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. Ifthen the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refugesof his over London, these places were chosen as thefirst of delivery, so that later he might distribute morefully. The systematic manner in which this was donemade me think that he could not mean to confine him-self to two sides of London. He was now fixed on thefar east on the northern shore, on the east of the south-ern shore, and on the south. The north and west weresurely never meant to be left out of his diabolicalscheme, let alone the City itself and the very heart offashionable London in the south-west and west. I wentback to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us ifany other boxes had been taken from Carfax. He replied, “Well guv’nor, you’ve treated me very‘an’some”, I had given him half a sovereign, “an I’ll tellyer all I know. I heard a man by the name of Bloxamsay four nights ago in the ‘Are an’ ‘Ounds, in Pincher’sAlley, as ‘ow he an’ his mate ‘ad ‘ad a rare dusty job ina old ‘ouse at Purfleet. There ain’t a many such jobs asthis ‘ere, an’ I’m thinkin’ that maybe Sam Bloxam couldChapter 20315"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell me where to find him. I toldhim that if he could get me the address it would beworth another half sovereign to him. So he gulpeddown the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that hewas going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said, “Look ‘ere, guv’nor,there ain’t no sense in me a keepin’ you ‘ere. I may findSam soon, or I mayn’t, but anyhow he ain’t like to bein a way to tell ye much tonight. Sam is a rare onewhen he starts on the booze. If you can give me aenvelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address onit, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it yetonight. But ye’d better be up arter ‘im soon in themornin’, never mind the booze the night afore.” This was all practical, so one of the children went offwith a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper,and to keep the change. When she came back, I ad-dressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollethad again faithfully promised to post the address whenfound, I took my way to home. We’re on the trackanyhow. I am tired tonight, and I want to sleep. Minais fast asleep, and looks a little too pale. Her eyeslook as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve nodoubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it maymake her doubly anxious about me and the others.But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointedand worried in such a way now than to have her nervebroken. The doctors were quite right to insist on herbeing kept out of this dreadful business. I must befirm, for on me this particular burden of silence mustrest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with herunder any circumstances. Indeed, It may not be a hardtask, after all, for she herself has become reticent onthe subject, and has not spoken of the Count or hisdoings ever since we told her of our decision.2 October, evening—A long and trying and excitingChapter 20316"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"day. By the first post I got my directed envelope witha dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was writtenwith a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand, “SamBloxam, Korkrans, 4 Poters Cort, Bartel Street,Walworth. Arsk for the depite.” I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far fromwell. I determined not to wake her, but that when Ishould return from this new search, I would arrangefor her going back to Exeter. I think she would behappier in our own home, with her daily tasks to in-terest her, than in being here amongst us and in igno-rance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and toldhim where I was off to, promising to come back andtell the rest so soon as I should have found out any-thing. I drove to Walworth and found, with some diffi-culty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me,as I asked for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court.However, when I had found the court, I had no diffi-culty in discovering Corcoran’s lodging house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the“depite,” he shook his head, and said, “I dunno ‘im.There ain’t no such a person ‘ere. I never ‘eard of ‘im inall my bloomin’ days. Don’t believe there ain’t nobodyof that kind livin’ ‘ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’s letter, and as I read it it seemedto me that the lesson of the spelling of the name ofthe court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked. “I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track. Phoneticspelling had again misled me. A half crown tip put thedeputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned thatMr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beeron the previous night at Corcoran’s, had left for hiswork at Poplar at five o’clock that morning. He couldnot tell me where the place of work was situated, buthe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us,” and with this slender clue I had toChapter 20317"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"start for Poplar. It was twelve o’clock before I got anysatisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at acoffee shop, where some workmen were having theirdinner. One of them suggested that there was beingerected at Cross Angel Street a new “cold storage”building, and as this suited the condition of a “new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interviewwith a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both ofwhom were appeased with the coin of the realm, putme on the track of Bloxam. He was sent for on mysuggestion that I was willing to pay his days wages tohis foreman for the privilege of asking him a few ques-tions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fel-low, though rough of speech and bearing. When I hadpromised to pay for his information and given him anearnest, he told me that he had made two journeysbetween Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had takenfrom this house to the latter nine great boxes, “mainheavy ones,” with a horse and cart hired by him forthis purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of thehouse in Piccadilly, to which he replied, “Well, guv’nor,I forgits the number, but it was only a few door from abig white church, or somethink of the kind, not longbuilt. It was a dusty old ‘ouse, too, though nothin’ tothe dustiness of the ‘ouse we tooked the bloomin’ boxesfrom.” “How did you get in if both houses were empty?” “There was the old party what engaged me a waitin’in the ‘ouse at Purfleet. He ‘elped me to lift the boxesand put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was thestrongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller, witha white moustache, one that thin you would think hecouldn’t throw a shadder.” How this phrase thrilled through me! “Why, ‘e took up ‘is end o’ the boxes like they waspounds of tea, and me a puffin’ an’ a blowin’ afore Icould upend mine anyhow, an’ I’m no chicken, nei-Chapter 20318"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"ther.” “How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” Iasked. “He was there too. He must ‘a started off and gotthere afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an’opened the door ‘isself an’ ‘elped me carry the boxesinto the ‘all.” “The whole nine?” I asked. “Yus, there was five in the first load an’ four in thesecond. It was main dry work, an’ I don’t so well re-member ‘ow I got ‘ome.” I interrupted him, “Were the boxes left in the hall?” “Yus, it was a big ‘all, an’ there was nothin’ else init.” I made one more attempt to further matters. “Youdidn’t have any key?” “Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, heopened the door ‘isself an’ shut it again when I druvoff. I don’t remember the last time, but that was thebeer.” “And you can’t remember the number of the house?” “No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that.It’s a ‘igh ‘un with a stone front with a bow on it, an’‘igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, ‘avin’ ‘adto carry the boxes up with three loafers what comeround to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s,an’ they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more.But ‘e took one of them by the shoulder and was liketo throw ‘im down the steps, till the lot of them wentaway cussin’.” I thought that with this description I could find thehouse, so having paid my friend for his information, Istarted off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painfulexperience. The Count could, it was evident, handlethe earth boxes himself. If so, time was precious, fornow that he had achieved a certain amount of distri-bution, he could, by choosing his own time, completethe task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I dischargedChapter 20319"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"my cab, and walked westward. Beyond the Junior Con-stitutional I came across the house described and wassatisfied that this was the next of the lairs arrangedby Dracula. The house looked as though it had beenlong untenanted. The windows were encrusted withdust, and the shutters were up. All the framework wasblack with time, and from the iron the paint had mostlyscaled away. It was evident that up to lately there hadbeen a large notice board in front of the balcony. Ithad, however, been roughly torn away, the uprightswhich had supported it still remaining. Behind the railsof the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,whose raw edges looked white. I would have given agood deal to have been able to see the notice boardintact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue tothe ownership of the house. I remembered my experi-ence of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and Icould not but feel that I could find the former ownerthere might be some means discovered of gaining ac-cess to the house. There was at present nothing to be learned from thePiccadilly side, and nothing could be done, so I wentaround to the back to see if anything could be gath-ered from this quarter. The mews were active, thePiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I askedone or two of the grooms and helpers whom I sawaround if they could tell me anything about the emptyhouse. One of them said that he heard it had latelybeen taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He toldme, however, that up to very lately there had been anotice board of “For Sale” up, and that perhapsMitchell, Sons, & Candy the house agents could tell mesomething, as he thought he remembered seeing thename of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seemtoo eager, or to let my informant know or guess toomuch, so thanking him in the usual manner, I strolledaway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn nightwas closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learnedChapter 20320"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a direc-tory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office inSackville Street. The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave inmanner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion.Having once told me that the Piccadilly house, whichthroughout our interview he called a “mansion,” wassold, he considered my business as concluded. When Iasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes athought wider, and paused a few seconds before reply-ing, “It is sold, sir.” “Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but Ihave a special reason for wishing to know who pur-chased it.” Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows stillmore. “It is sold, sir,” was again his laconic reply. “Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me knowso much.” “But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of theirclients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell,Sons, & Candy.” This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and therewas no use arguing with him. I thought I had bestmeet him on his own ground, so I said, “Your clients,sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of theirconfidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card. “In this instance I amnot prompted by curiosity, I act on the part of LordGodalming, who wishes to know something of the prop-erty which was, he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion on affairs.He said, “I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr.Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lord-ship. We once carried out a small matter of rentingsome chambers for him when he was the HonorableArthur Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’saddress I will consult the House on the subject, andwill, in any case, communicate with his lordship byChapter 20321"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"tonight’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so fardeviate from our rules as to give the required infor-mation to his lordship.” I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an en-emy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward’sand came away. It was now dark, and I was tired andhungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Com-pany and came down to Purfleet by the next train. I found all the others at home. Mina was lookingtired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to bebright and cheerful. It wrung my heart to think that Ihad had to keep anything from her and so caused herinquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night ofher looking on at our conferences, and feeling the stingof our not showing our confidence. It took all my cour-age to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her outof our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled,or else the very subject seems to have become repug-nant to her, for when any accidental allusion is madeshe actually shudders. I am glad we made our resolu-tion in time, as with such a feeling as this, our grow-ing knowledge would be torture to her. I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery tillwe were alone, so after dinner, followed by a littlemusic to save appearances even amongst ourselves, Itook Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. Thedear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, andclung to me as though she would detain me, but therewas much to be talked of and I came away. Thank God,the ceasing of telling things has made no differencebetween us. When I came down again I found the others all gath-ered round the fire in the study. In the train I hadwritten my diary so far, and simply read it off to themas the best means of letting them get abreast of myown information. When I had finished Van Helsing said, “This has beena great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we areChapter 20322"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them allin that house, then our work is near the end. But ifthere be some missing, we must search until we findthem. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt thewretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morrisspoke, “Say! How are we going to get into that house?” “We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalmingquickly. “But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax,but we had night and a walled park to protect us. Itwill be a mighty different thing to commit burglary inPiccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don’t seehow we are going to get in unless that agency duckcan find us a key of some sort.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood upand walked about the room. By-and-by he stoppedand said, turning from one to another of us, “Quincey’shead is level. This burglary business is getting seri-ous. We got off once all right, but we have now a rarejob on hand. Unless we can find the Count’s key bas-ket.” As nothing could well be done before morning, andas it would be at least advisable to wait till LordGodalming should hear from Mitchell’s, we decided notto take any active step before breakfast time. For agood while we sat and smoked, discussing the matterin its various lights and bearings. I took the opportu-nity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. Iam very sleepy and shall go to bed... . Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing isregular. Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles,as though she thinks even in her sleep. She is still toopale, but does not look so haggard as she did thismorning. Tomorrow will, I hope, mend all this. Shewill be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!323Chapter 20"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"DR. SEWARD’S DIARY1 October.—I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. Hismoods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keeptouch of them, and as they always mean somethingmore than his own well-being, they form a more thaninteresting study. This morning, when I went to seehim after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner wasthat of a man commanding destiny. He was, in fact,commanding destiny, subjectively. He did not reallycare for any of the things of mere earth, he was in theclouds and looked down on all the weaknesses andwants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learnsomething, so I asked him, “What about the flies thesetimes?” He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way, sucha smile as would have become the face of Malvolio, ashe answered me, “The fly, my dear sir, has one strikingfeature. It’s wings are typical of the aerial powers ofthe psychic faculties. The ancients did well when theytypified the soul as a butterfly!” I thought I wouldpush his analogy to its utmost logically, so I saidquickly, “Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled lookspread over his face as, shaking his head with a deci-sion which I had but seldom seen in him. He said, “Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is allI want.” Here he brightened up. “I am pretty indiffer-ent about it at present. Life is all right. I have all Iwant. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wishto study zoophagy!” This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on. “Then youcommand life. You are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority. “Ohno! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the at-tributes of the Deity. I am not even concerned in Hisespecially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellec-Chapter 20324"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"tual position I am, so far as concerns things purelyterrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch oc-cupied spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the momentrecall Enoch’s appositeness, so I had to ask a simplequestion, though I felt that by so doing I was lower-ing myself in the eyes of the lunatic. “And why withEnoch?” “Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not like to ad-mit it, so I harked back to what he had denied. “Soyou don’t care about life and you don’t want souls.Why not?” I put my question quickly and somewhatsternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded, for an instant he unconsciouslyrelapsed into his old servile manner, bent low beforeme, and actually fawned upon me as he replied. “Idon’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’tuse them if I had them. They would be no manner ofuse to me. I couldn’t eat them or... .” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spreadover his face, like a wind sweep on the surface of thewater. “And doctor, as to life, what is it after all? Whenyou’ve got all you require, and you know that youwill never want, that is all. I have friends, good friends,like you, Dr. Seward.”This was said with a leer of inex-pressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack themeans of life!” I think that through the cloudiness of his insanityhe saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fellback on the last refuge of such as he, a dogged si-lence. After a short time I saw that for the present itwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so Icame away. Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I wouldnot have come without special reason, but just atpresent I am so interested in him that I would gladlyChapter 20325"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything tohelp pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues,and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsingsits in my study poring over the record prepared bythe Harkers. He seems to think that by accurate knowl-edge of all details he will light up on some clue. Hedoes not wish to be disturbed in the work, withoutcause. I would have taken him with me to see the pa-tient, only I thought that after his last repulse he mightnot care to go again. There was also another reason.Renfield might not speak so freely before a third per-son as when he and I were alone. I found him sitting in the middle of the floor on hisstool, a pose which is generally indicative of somemental energy on his part. When I came in, he said atonce, as though the question had been waiting on hislips. “What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been cor-rect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, evenwith the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all aroundhim, and up and down, as though he expected to findsome inspiration for an answer. “I don’t want any souls!” He said in a feeble, apolo-getic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind,and so I determined to use it, to “be cruel only to bekind.” So I said, “You like life, and you want life?” “Oh yes! But that is all right. You needn’t worry aboutthat!” “But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life withoutgetting the soul also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, “Anice time you’ll have some time when you’re flyingout here, with the souls of thousands of flies and spi-ders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering andmoaning all around you. You’ve got their lives, youknow, and you must put up with their souls!”Chapter 20326"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" Something seemed to affect his imagination, for heput his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwingthem up tightly just as a small boy does when his faceis being soaped. There was something pathetic in itthat touched me. It also gave me a lesson, for it seemedthat before me was a child, only a child, though thefeatures were worn, and the stubble on the jaws waswhite. It was evident that he was undergoing someprocess of mental disturbance, and knowing how hispast moods had interpreted things seemingly foreignto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind aswell as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I askedhim, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear methrough his closed ears, “Would you like some sugarto get your flies around again?” He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook hishead. With a laugh he replied, “Not much! Flies arepoor things, after all!” After a pause he added, “But Idon’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.” “Or spiders?” I went on. “Blow spiders!

There isn’tanything in them to eat or... .” He stopped suddenlyas though reminded of a forbidden topic. “So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the secondtime he has suddenly stopped at the word ‘drink’. Whatdoes it mean?” Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse,for he hurried on, as though to distract my attentionfrom it, “I don’t take any stock at all in such matters.‘Rats and mice and such small deer,’ as Shakespeare hasit, ‘chicken feed of the larder’ they might be called.I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as wellask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks,as to try to interest me about the less carnivora, whenI know of what is before me.” “I see,” I said.”You want big things that you can makeyour teeth meet in?

For a few moments he sat despondently. Sud-denly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing andall the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To hellwith you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do youplague me about souls? Haven’t I got enough to worry,and pain, to distract me already, without thinking ofsouls?” He looked so hostile that I thought he was in foranother homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm,and said apologetically, “Forgive me, Doctor. I forgotmyself. You do not need any help. I am so worried inmy mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you onlyknew the problem I have to face, and that I am work-ing out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me.Pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat. I want tothink and I cannot think freely when my body is con-fined. I am sure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control, so when the attendantscame I told them not to mind, and they withdrew.Renfield watched them go. When the door was closedhe said with considerable dignity and sweetness, “Dr.Seward, you have been very considerate towards me.Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so Icame away. There is certainly something to ponderover in this man’s state. Several points seem to makewhat the American interviewer calls “a story,” if onecould only get them in proper order. Here they are:Chapter 20328"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" Will not mention “drinking.” Fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul”of anything. Has no dread of wanting “life” in the future. Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, thoughhe dreads being haunted by their souls. Logically all these things point one way! He hasassurance of some kind that he will acquire some higherlife. He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul.Then it is a human life he looks to! And the assurance...? Merciful God! The Count has been to him, and thereis some new scheme of terror afoot!Later.—I went after my round to Van Helsing and toldhim my suspicion. He grew very grave, and after think-ing the matter over for a while asked me to take himto Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heardthe lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do inthe time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that hehad spread out his sugar as of old. The flies, lethargicwith the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room.We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previ-ous conversation, but he would not attend. He wenton with his singing, just as though we had not beenpresent. He had got a scrap of paper and was folding itinto a notebook. We had to come away as ignorant aswe went in. His is a curious case indeed.

SEWARD’S DIARY2 October.—I placed a man in the corridor last night,and told him to make an accurate note of any soundhe might hear from Renfield’s room, and gave him in-structions that if there should be anything strange hewas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gatheredround the fire in the study, Mrs. Harker having goneto bed, we discussed the attempts and discoveries ofthe day. Harker was the only one who had any result,and we are in great hopes that his clue may be animportant one. Before going to bed I went round to the patient’sroom and looked in through the observation trap. Hewas sleeping soundly, his heart rose and fell with regu-lar respiration. This morning the man on duty reported to me that alittle after midnight he was restless and kept sayinghis prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that wasChapter 20330"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"all. He replied that it was all he heard. There was some-thing about his manner, so suspicious that I asked himpoint blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep,but admitted to having “dozed” for a while. It is toobad that men cannot be trusted unless they arewatched. Today Harker is out following up his clue, and Artand Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinksthat it will be well to have horses always in readiness,for when we get the information which we seek therewill be no time to lose. We must sterilize all the im-ported earth between sunrise and sunset. We shall thuscatch the Count at his weakest, and without a refugeto fly to. Van Helsing is off to the British Museum look-ing up some authorities on ancient medicine. The oldphysicians took account of things which their follow-ers do not accept, and the Professor is searching forwitch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.

We seem at last to be onthe track, and our work of tomorrow may be the be-ginning of the end. I wonder if Renfield’s quiet hasanything to do with this. His moods have so followedthe doings of the Count, that the coming destructionof the monster may be carried to him some subtle way.If we could only get some hint as to what passed in hismind, between the time of my argument with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might af-ford us a valuable clue.

SEWARD’S DIARY3 October.—Let me put down with exactness all thathappened, as well as I can remember, since last I madean entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgot-ten. In all calmness I must proceed. When I came to Renfield’s room I found him lying onthe floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.When I went to move him, it became at once apparentthat he had received some terrible injuries. Thereseemed none of the unity of purpose between the partsof the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As theface was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised,as though it had been beaten against the floor. Indeedit was from the face wounds that the pool of bloodoriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body saidto me as we turned him over, “I think, sir, his back isbroken. See, both his right arm and leg and the wholeside of his face are paralysed.” How such a thing couldhave happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gath-ered in as he said, “I can’t understand the two things.He could mark his face like that by beating his ownhead on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once atthe Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay handson her. And I suppose he might have broken his neckby falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink.But for the life of me I can’t imagine how the twothings occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’tbeat his head, and if his face was like that before thefall out of bed, there would be marks of it.” I said to him, “Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him tokindly come here at once. I want him without aninstant’s delay.”Chapter 21332"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":" The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Pro-fessor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared.When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenlyat him a moment, and then turned to me. I think herecognized my thought in my eyes, for he said veryquietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant, “Ah,a sad accident! He will need very careful watching,and much attention. I shall stay with you myself, butI shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in afew minutes join you.” The patient was now breathing stertorously and itwas easy to see that he had suffered some terrible in-jury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity,bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidentlybeen thinking and had his mind made up, for almostbefore he looked at the patient, he whispered to me,“Send the attendant away. We must be alone with himwhen he becomes conscious, after the operation.” I said, “I think that will do now, Simmons. We havedone all that we can at present. You had better goyour round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let meknow instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.” The man withdrew, and we went into a strict exami-nation of the patient. The wounds of the face weresuperficial. The real injury was a depressed fracture ofthe skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said, “We mustreduce the pressure and get back to normal condi-tions, as far as can be. The rapidity of the suffusionshows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole mo-tor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain willincrease quickly, so we must trephine at once or itmay be too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at thedoor. I went over and opened it and found in the cor-ridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slip-pers, the former spoke, “I heard your man call up Dr.Chapter 21333"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I wokeQuincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep.Things are moving too quickly and too strangely forsound sleep for any of us these times. I’ve been think-ing that tomorrow night will not see things as theyhave been. We’ll have to look back, and forward a littlemore than we have done. May we come in?” I nodded, and held the door open till they had en-tered, then I closed it again. When Quincey saw theattitude and state of the patient, and noted the hor-rible pool on the floor, he said softly, “My God! Whathas happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told him briefly, and added that we expected hewould recover consciousness after the operation, for ashort time, at all events. He went at once and sat downon the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him.We all watched in patience. “We shall wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enoughto fix the best spot for trephining, so that we maymost quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot, forit is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing.” The minutes during which we waited passed with fear-ful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, andfrom Van Helsing’s face I gathered that he felt somefear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreadedthe words Renfield might speak. I was positively afraidto think. But the conviction of what was coming wason me, as I have read of men who have heard the deathwatch. The poor man’s breathing came in uncertaingasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would openhis eyes and speak, but then would follow a prolongedstertorous breath, and he would relapse into a morefixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds anddeath, this suspense grew and grew upon me. I couldalmost hear the beating of my own heart, and the bloodsurging through my temples sounded like blows froma hammer. The silence finally became agonizing. Ilooked at my companions, one after another, and saw334Chapter 21"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"from their flushed faces and damp brows that theywere enduring equal torture. There was a nervous sus-pense over us all, as though overhead some dread bellwould peal out powerfully when we should least ex-pect it. At last there came a time when it was evident thatthe patient was sinking fast. He might die at any mo-ment. I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyesfixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke,“There is no time to lose. His words may be worthmany lives. I have been thinking so, as I stood here. Itmay be there is a soul at stake! We shall operate justabove the ear.” Without another word he made the operation. For afew moments the breathing continued to be stertor-ous. Then there came a breath so prolonged that itseemed as though it would tear open his chest. Sud-denly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild,helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments,then it was softened into a glad surprise, and from hislips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, andas he did so, said, “I’ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them totake off the strait waistcoat. I have had a terribledream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move.What’s wrong with my face? It feels all swollen, and itsmarts dreadfully.” He tried to turn his head, but even with the efforthis eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put itback. Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone, “Tellus your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his face brightened, throughits mutilation, and he said, “That is Dr. Van Helsing.How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water,my lips are dry, and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed... .” He stopped and seemed fainting. I called quietly toQuincey, “The brandy, it is in my study, quick!” Heflew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandyand a carafe of water. We moistened the parched lips,Chapter 21335"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain hadbeen working in the interval, for when he was quiteconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an ago-nized confusion which I shall never forget, and said,“I must not deceive myself. It was no dream, but all agrim reality.” Then his eyes roved round the room. Asthey caught sight of the two figures sitting patientlyon the edge of the bed he went on, “If I were not surealready, I would know from them.” For an instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleepbut voluntarily, as though he were bringing all hisfaculties to bear. When he opened them he said, hur-riedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed,“Quick, Doctor, quick, I am dying! I feel that I havebut a few minutes, and then I must go back to death,or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have some-thing that I must say before I die. Or before my poorcrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that nightafter you left me, when I implored you to let me goaway. I couldn’t speak then, for I felt my tongue wastied. But I was as sane then, except in that way, as Iam now. I was in an agony of despair for a long timeafter you left me, it seemed hours. Then there came asudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become coolagain, and I realized where I was. I heard the dogsbark behind our house, but not where He was!” As he spoke, Van Helsing’s eyes never blinked, buthis hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard.He did not, however, betray himself. He nodded slightlyand said, “Go on,” in a low voice. Renfield proceeded. “He came up to the window inthe mist, as I had seen him often before, but he wassolid then, not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like aman’s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth,the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight whenhe turned to look back over the belt of trees, to wherethe dogs were barking. I wouldn’t ask him to come inChapter 21336"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"at first, though I knew he wanted to, just as he hadwanted all along. Then he began promising me things,not in words but by doing them.” He was interrupted by a word from the Professor,“How?” “By making them happen. Just as he used to send inthe flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat oneswith steel and sapphire on their wings. And big moths,in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to meunconsciously, “The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphin-ges, what you call the ‘Death’s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping, “Then he be-gan to whisper.‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,millions of them, and every one a life. And dogs to eatthem, and cats too. All lives! All red blood, with yearsof life in it, and not merely buzzing flies!’ I laughed athim, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then thedogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.He beckoned me to the window. I got up and lookedout, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call outwithout using any words. A dark mass spread over thegrass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire. Andthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and Icould see that there were thousands of rats with theireyes blazing red, like His only smaller. He held up hishand, and they all stopped, and I thought he seemedto be saying, ‘All these lives will I give you, ay, andmany more and greater, through countless ages, if youwill fall down and worship me!’ And then a red cloud,like the color of blood, seemed to close over my eyes,and before I knew what I was doing, I found myselfopening the sash and saying to Him, ‘Come in, Lordand Master!’ The rats were all gone, but He slid intothe room through the sash, though it was only openan inch wide, just as the Moon herself has often comein through the tiniest crack and has stood before mein all her size and splendor.”Chapter 21337"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":" His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips withthe brandy again, and he continued, but it seemed asthough his memory had gone on working in the inter-val for his story was further advanced. I was about tocall him back to the point, but Van Helsing whisperedto me, “Let him go on. Do not interrupt him. He can-not go back, and maybe could not proceed at all ifonce he lost the thread of his thought.” He proceeded, “All day I waited to hear from him,but he did not send me anything, not even a blowfly,and when the moon got up I was pretty angry withhim. When he did slide in through the window, thoughit was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad withhim. He sneered at me, and his white face looked outof the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went onas though he owned the whole place, and I was noone. He didn’t even smell the same as he went by me. Icouldn’t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harkerhad come into the room.” The two men sitting on the bed stood up and cameover, standing behind him so that he could not seethem, but where they could hear better. They wereboth silent, but the Professor started and quivered.His face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.Renfield went on without noticing, “When Mrs. Harkercame in to see me this afternoon she wasn’t the same.It was like tea after the teapot has been watered.”Here we all moved, but no one said a word. He went on, “I didn’t know that she was here till shespoke, and she didn’t look the same. I don’t care forthe pale people. I like them with lots of blood in them,and hers all seemed to have run out. I didn’t think ofit at the time, but when she went away I began tothink, and it made me mad to know that He had beentaking the life out of her.” I could feel that the restquivered, as I did. But we remained otherwise still.“So when He came tonight I was ready for Him. I sawthe mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heardChapter 21338"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"that madmen have unnatural strength. And as I knew Iwas a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use mypower. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come outof the mist to struggle with me. I held tight, and Ithought I was going to win, for I didn’t mean Him totake any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. Theyburned into me, and my strength became like water.He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling toHim, He raised me up and flung me down. There was ared cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and themist seemed to steal away under the door.” His voice was becoming fainter and his breath morestertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively. “We know the worst now,” he said. “He is here, andwe know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us bearmed, the same as we were the other night, but loseno time, there is not an instant to spare.” There was no need to put our fear, nay our convic-tion, into words, we shared them in common. We allhurried and took from our rooms the same things thatwe had when we entered the Count’s house. The Pro-fessor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor hepointed to them significantly as he said, “They neverleave me, and they shall not till this unhappy businessis over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common en-emy that we deal with Alas! Alas! That dear MadamMina should suffer!” He stopped, his voice was break-ing, and I do not know if rage or terror predominatedin my own heart. Outside the Harkers’ door we paused. Art and Quinceyheld back, and the latter said, “Should we disturb her?” “We must,” said Van Helsing grimly. “If the door belocked, I shall break it in.” “May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual tobreak into a lady’s room!” Van Helsing said solemnly, “You are always right. Butthis is life and death. All chambers are alike to thedoctor. And even were they not they are all as one toChapter 21339"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"me tonight. Friend John, when I turn the handle, ifthe door does not open, do you put your shoulderdown and shove. And you too, my friends. Now!” He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door didnot yield. We threw ourselves against it. With a crashit burst open, and we almost fell headlong into theroom. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw acrosshim as he gathered himself up from hands and knees.What I saw appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristleson the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to standstill. The moonlight was so bright that through the thickyellow blind the room was light enough to see. On thebed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his faceflushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwardswas the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stooda tall, thin man, clad in black. His face was turnedfrom us, but the instant we saw we all recognized theCount, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead.With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker’s hands,keeping them away with her arms at full tension. Hisright hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forc-ing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdresswas smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickleddown the man’s bare chest which was shown by historn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terribleresemblance to a child forcing a kitten’s nose into asaucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst intothe room, the Count turned his face, and the hellishlook that I had heard described seemed to leap into it.His eyes flamed red with devilish passion. The greatnostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide andquivered at the edge, and the white sharp teeth, be-hind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, clampedtogether like those of a wild beast. With a wrench,which threw his victim back upon the bed as thoughhurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. ButChapter 21340"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and washolding towards him the envelope which containedthe Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just aspoor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and coweredback. Further and further back he cowered, as we, lift-ing our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenlyfailed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky.And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey’smatch, we saw nothing but a faint vapor. This, as welooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoilfrom its bursting open, had swung back to its old po-sition. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs.Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath andwith it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, sodespairing that it seems to me now that it will ring inmy ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay inher helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly,with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood whichsmeared her lips and cheeks and chin. From her throattrickled a thin stream of blood. Her eyes were madwith terror. Then she put before her face her poorcrushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the redmark of the Count’s terrible grip, and from behind themcame a low desolate wail which made the terriblescream seem only the quick expression of an endlessgrief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the cov-erlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after lookingat her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of theroom. Van Helsing whispered to me, “Jonathan is in a stu-por such as we know the Vampire can produce. We cando nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few momentstill she recovers herself. I must wake him!” He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and withit began to flick him on the face, his wife all the whileholding her face between her hands and sobbing in away that was heart breaking to hear. I raised the blind,and looked out of the window. There was much moon-Chapter 21341"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"shine, and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris runacross the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of agreat yew tree. It puzzled me to think why he wasdoing this. But at the instant I heard Harker’s quickexclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, andturned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be,was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for afew seconds, and then full consciousness seemed toburst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, andturned to him with her arms stretched out, as thoughto embrace him. Instantly, however, she drew them inagain, and putting her elbows together, held her handsbefore her face, and shuddered till the bed beneathher shook. “In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker criedout. “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What hashappened? What is wrong? Mina, dear what is it? Whatdoes that blood mean? My God, my God! Has it cometo this!” And, raising himself to his knees, he beat hishands wildly together.”Good God help us! Help her!Oh, help her!” With a quick movement he jumped from bed, andbegan to pull on his clothes, all the man in him awakeat the need for instant exertion. “What has happened?Tell me all about it!” he cried without pausing. “Dr.Van Helsing you love Mina, I know. Oh, do somethingto save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard herwhile I look for him!” His wife, through her terror and horror and distress,saw some sure danger to him. Instantly forgetting herown grief, she seized hold of him and cried out. “No! No! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I havesuffered enough tonight, God knows, without the dreadof his harming you. You must stay with me. Stay withthese friends who will watch over you!” Her expres-sion became frantic as she spoke. And, he yielding toher, she pulled him down sitting on the bedside, andChapter 21342"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"clung to him fiercely. Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Pro-fessor held up his golden crucifix, and said with won-derful calmness, “Do not fear, my dear. We are here,and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can ap-proach. You are safe for tonight, and we must be calmand take counsel together.” She shuddered and was silent, holding down her headon her husband’s breast. When she raised it, his whitenightrobe was stained with blood where her lips hadtouched, and where the thin open wound in the neckhad sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drewback, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst chokingsobs. “Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him nomore. Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now hisworst enemy, and whom he may have most cause tofear.” To this he spoke out resolutely, “Nonsense, Mina. Itis a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hearit of you. And I shall not hear it from you. May Godjudge me by my deserts, and punish me with morebitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act orwill of mine anything ever come between us!” He put out his arms and folded her to his breast.And for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at usover her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damplyabove his quivering nostrils. His mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and morefaint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studiedcalmness which I felt tried his nervous power to theutmost. “And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well Iknow the broad fact. Tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had happened and he lis-tened with seeming impassiveness, but his nostrilstwitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruth-less hands of the Count had held his wife in that ter-343Chapter 21"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"rible and horrid position, with her mouth to the openwound in his breast. It interested me, even at thatmoment, to see that whilst the face of white set pas-sion worked convulsively over the bowed head, thehands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knockedat the door. They entered in obedience to our sum-mons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly. I un-derstood him to mean if we were to take advantage oftheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of theunhappy husband and wife from each other and fromthemselves. So on nodding acquiescence to him he askedthem what they had seen or done. To which LordGodalming answered. “I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or inany of our rooms. I looked in the study but, thoughhe had been there, he had gone. He had, however... .”He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor droopingfigure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely, “Go on, friend Arthur. Wewant here no more concealments. Our hope now is inknowing all.

All the manuscript had been burned,and the blue flames were flickering amongst the whiteashes. The cylinders of your phonograph too werethrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.” Here I interrupted. “Thank God there is the othercopy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he wenton. “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign ofhim. I looked into Renfield’s room, but there was notrace there except... .” Again he paused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely. So he bowed his headand moistening his lips with his tongue, added, “ex-cept that the poor fellow is dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to theChapter 21344"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"other of us she said solemnly, “God’s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping back some-thing. But, as I took it that it was with a purpose, Isaid nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked, “And you,friend Quincey, have you any to tell?” “A little,” he answered. “It may be much eventually,but at present I can’t say. I thought it well to know ifpossible where the Count would go when he left thehouse. I did not see him, but I saw a bat rise fromRenfield’s window, and flap westward. I expected tosee him in some shape go back to Carfax, but he evi-dently sought some other lair. He will not be backtonight, for the sky is reddening in the east, and thedawn is close. We must work tomorrow!” He said the latter words through his shut teeth. Fora space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was si-lence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound ofour hearts beating. Then Van Helsing said, placing his hand tenderly onMrs. Harker’s head, “And now, Madam Mina, poor dear,dear, Madam Mina, tell us exactly what happened. Godknows that I do not want that you be pained, but it isneed that we know all. For now more than ever has allwork to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly ear-nest. The day is close to us that must end all, if it maybe so, and now is the chance that we may live andlearn.” The poor dear lady shivered, and I could see the ten-sion of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer toher and bent her head lower and lower still on hisbreast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held outone hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and afterstooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. Theother hand was locked in that of her husband, whoheld his other arm thrown round her protectingly. Aftera pause in which she was evidently ordering herthoughts, she began.Chapter 21345"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":" “I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindlygiven me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemedto become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fan-cies began to crowd in upon my mind. All of themconnected with death, and vampires, with blood, andpain, and trouble.” Her husband involuntarily groanedas she turned to him and said lovingly, “Do not fret,dear. You must be brave and strong, and help methrough the horrible task. If you only knew what aneffort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, youwould understand how much I need your help. Well, Isaw I must try to help the medicine to its work withmy will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutelyset myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon havecome to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan com-ing in had not waked me, for he lay by my side whennext I remember. There was in the room the same thinwhite mist that I had before noticed. But I forget nowif you know of this. You will find it in my diary whichI shall show you later. I felt the same vague terrorwhich had come to me before and the same sense ofsome presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but foundthat he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was hewho had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried,but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear,and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heartsank within me. Beside the bed, as if he had steppedout of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turnedinto his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stooda tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once fromthe description of the others. The waxen face, the highaquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin whiteline, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teethshowing between, and the red eyes that I had seemedto see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary’s Churchat Witby. I knew, too, the red scar on his foreheadwhere Jonathan had struck him. For an instant myheart stood still, and I would have screamed out, onlyChapter 21346"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"that I was paralyzed. In the pause he spoke in a sortof keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke toJonathan. “`Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him anddash his brains out before your very eyes.’ I was ap-palled and was too bewildered to do or say anything.With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon myshoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat withthe other, saying as he did so, ‘First, a little refresh-ment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet.It is not the first time, or the second, that your veinshave appeased my thirst!’ I was bewildered, andstrangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I sup-pose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is,when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, myGod, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon mythroat!” Her husband groaned again. She clasped hishand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he werethe injured one, and went on. “I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a halfswoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I knownot, but it seemed that a long time must have passedbefore he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away.I saw it drip with the fresh blood! ”The remembranceseemed for a while to overpower her, and she droopedand would have sunk down but for her husband’s sus-taining arm. With a great effort she recovered herselfand went on. “Then he spoke to me mockingly, `And so you, likethe others, would play your brains against mine. Youwould help these men to hunt me and frustrate me inmy design! You know now, and they know in part al-ready, and will know in full before long, what it is tocross my path.

Now youshall come to my call. When my brain says “Come!” toyou, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding. Andto that end this!’ With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his longsharp nails opened a vein in his breast.

As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern skybegan to quicken, and everything became more andmore clear. Harker was still and quiet. But over hisface, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey lookwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light,till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shotup, the flesh stood darkly out against the whiteninghair.

It is now six o’clock, and we are to meet inthe study in half an hour and take something to eat,for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that ifwe do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best willbe, God knows, required today. I must keep writing atevery chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big andlittle, must go down. Perhaps at the end the littlethings may teach us most. The teaching, big or little,could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worsethan we are today. However, we must trust and hope.Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears runningdown her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trialthat our faith is tested. That we must keep on trust-ing, and that God will aid us up to the end. The end!Oh my God! What end?... To work! To work! When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come backfrom seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into whatwas to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when heand Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room belowthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in aheap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and thebones of the neck were broken. Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty inthe passage if he had heard anything. He said that hehad been sitting down, he confessed to half dozing,when he heard loud voices in the room, and thenRenfield had called out loudly several times, “God! God!God!” After that there was a sound of falling, and whenhe entered the room he found him lying on the floor,face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsingasked if he had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and hesaid he could not say. That at first it had seemed toChapter 22349"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"him as if there were two, but as there was no one inthe room it could have been only one. He could swearto it, if required, that the word “God” was spoken bythe patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that hedid not wish to go into the matter. The question of aninquest had to be considered, and it would never doto put forward the truth, as no one would believe it.As it was, he thought that on the attendant’s evidencehe could give a certificate of death by misadventurein falling from bed. In case the coroner should de-mand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarilyto the same result. When the question began to be discussed as to whatshould be our next step, the very first thing we de-cided was that Mina should be in full confidence. Thatnothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should bekept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom,and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sor-rowful, and in such a depth of despair. “There must be no concealment,” she said. “Alas! Wehave had too much already. And besides there is noth-ing in all the world that can give me more pain than Ihave already endured, than I suffer now! Whatever mayhappen, it must be of new hope or of new courage tome!” Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke,and said, suddenly but quietly, “But dear Madam Mina,are you not afraid. Not for yourself, but for othersfrom yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shonewith the devotion of a martyr as she answered, “Ahno! For my mind is made up!” “To what?” he asked gently, whilst we were all verystill, for each in our own way we had a sort of vagueidea of what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as thoughshe was simply stating a fact, “Because if I find inChapter 21350"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"myself, and I shall watch keenly for it, a sign of harmto any that I love, I shall die!” “You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely. “I would. If there were no friend who loved me, whowould save me such a pain, and so desperate an ef-fort!” She looked at him meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down, but now he rose and came closeto her and put his hand on her head as he said sol-emnly: “My child, there is such an one if it were foryour good. For myself I could hold it in my accountwith God to find such an euthanasia for you, even atthis moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But mychild... .” For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sobrose in his throat. He gulped it down and went on,“There are here some who would stand between youand death. You must not die. You must not die by anyhand, but least of all your own. Until the other, whohas fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must notdie. For if he is still with the quick Undead, your deathwould make you even as he is. No, you must live! Youmust struggle and strive to live, though death wouldseem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death him-self, though he come to you in pain or in joy. By theday, or the night, in safety or in peril! On your livingsoul I charge you that you do not die. Nay, nor thinkof death, till this great evil be past.” The poor dear grew white as death, and shook andshivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiverat the incoming of the tide. We were all silent. Wecould do nothing. At length she grew more calm andturning to him said sweetly, but oh so sorrowfully, asshe held out her hand, “I promise you, my dear friend,that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so. Till,if it may be in His good time, this horror may havepassed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all felt that ourhearts were strengthened to work and endure for her,Chapter 22351"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"and we began to discuss what we were to do. I told herthat she was to have all the papers in the safe, and allthe papers or diaries and phonographs we might here-after use, and was to keep the record as she had donebefore. She was pleased with the prospect of anythingto do, if “pleased” could be used in connection withso grim an interest. As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyoneelse, and was prepared with an exact ordering of ourwork. “It is perhaps well,” he said, “that at our meetingafter our visit to Carfax we decided not to do any-thing with the earth boxes that lay there. Had we doneso, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and woulddoubtless have taken measures in advance to frustratesuch an effort with regard to the others. But now hedoes not know our intentions. Nay, more, in all prob-ability, he does not know that such a power exists tous as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot use themas of old. “We are now so much further advanced in our knowl-edge as to their disposition that, when we have exam-ined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the verylast of them. Today then, is ours, and in it rests ourhope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morningguards us in its course. Until it sets tonight, that mon-ster must retain whatever form he now has. He is con-fined within the limitations of his earthly envelope.He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear throughcracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a door-way, he must open the door like a mortal. And so wehave this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilizethem. So we shall, if we have not yet catch him anddestroy him, drive him to bay in some place where thecatching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I started up for I could not contain myself atthe thought that the minutes and seconds so preciouslyladen with Mina’s life and happiness were flying fromChapter 22352"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"us, since whilst we talked action was impossible. ButVan Helsing held up his hand warningly. “Nay, friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the quick-est way home is the longest way, so your proverb say.We shall all act and act with desperate quick, whenthe time has come. But think, in all probable the keyof the situation is in that house in Piccadilly. The Countmay have many houses which he has bought. Of themhe will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things.He will have paper that he write on. He will have hisbook of cheques. There are many belongings that hemust have somewhere. Why not in this place so cen-tral, so quiet, where he come and go by the front orthe back at all hours, when in the very vast of thetraffic there is none to notice. We shall go there andsearch that house. And when we learn what it holds,then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrasesof hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we run down our oldfox, so? Is it not?” “Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wastingthe precious, precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said, “Andhow are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?” “Any way!” I cried. “We shall break in if need be.” “And your police? Where will they be, and what willthey say?” I was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to de-lay he had a good reason for it. So I said, as quietly asI could, “Don’t wait more than need be. You know, Iam sure, what torture I am in.” “Ah, my child, that I do. And indeed there is no wishof me to add to your anguish. But just think, what canwe do, until all the world be at movement. Then willcome our time. I have thought and thought, and itseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.Now we wish to get into the house, but we have nokey. Is it not so?” I nodded. “Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner ofChapter 22353"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"that house, and could not still get in. And think therewas to you no conscience of the housebreaker, whatwould you do?” “I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him towork to pick the lock for me.” “And your police, they would interfere, would theynot?” “Oh no! Not if they knew the man was properly em-ployed.” “Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “allthat is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, andthe belief of your policemen as to whether or not thatemployer has a good conscience or a bad one. Yourpolice must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh soclever, in reading the heart, that they trouble them-selves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, yougo take the lock off a hundred empty houses in thisyour London, or of any city in the world, and if youdo it as such things are rightly done, and at the timesuch things are rightly done, no one will interfere. Ihave read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house inLondon, and when he went for months of summer toSwitzerland and lock up his house, some burglar comeand broke window at back and got in. Then he wentand made open the shutters in front and walk out andin through the door, before the very eyes of the po-lice. Then he have an auction in that house, and ad-vertise it, and put up big notice. And when the daycome he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods ofthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder,and he sell him that house, making an agreement thathe pull it down and take all away within a certaintime. And your police and other authority help himall they can. And when that owner come back from hisholiday in Switzerland he find only an empty holewhere his house had been. This was all done en regle,and in our work we shall be en regle too. We shall notgo so early that the policemen who have then little toChapter 22354"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"think of, shall deem it strange. But we shall go afterten o’clock, when there are many about, and suchthings would be done were we indeed owners of thehouse.” I could not but see how right he was and the terribledespair of Mina’s face became relaxed in thought. Therewas hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on, “When once within that housewe may find more clues. At any rate some of us canremain there whilst the rest find the other places wherethere be more earth boxes, at Bermondsey and MileEnd.” Lord Godalming stood up. “I can be of some use here,”he said. “I shall wire to my people to have horses andcarriages where they will be most convenient.” “Look here, old fellow,” said Morris, “it is a capitalidea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking, but don’t you think that one of your snappycarriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway ofWalworth or Mile End would attract too much atten-tion for our purpose? It seems to me that we ought totake cabs when we go south or east. And even leavethem somewhere near the neighborhood we are goingto.” “Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor. “Hishead is what you call in plane with the horizon. It is adifficult thing that we go to do, and we do not wantno peoples to watch us if so it may.” Mina took a growing interest in everything and I wasrejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was help-ing her to forget for a time the terrible experience ofthe night. She was very, very pale, almost ghastly, andso thin that her lips were drawn away, showing herteeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mentionthis last, lest it should give her needless pain, but itmade my blood run cold in my veins to think of whathad occurred with poor Lucy when the Count hadsucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teethChapter 22355355355"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"growing sharper, but the time as yet was short, andthere was time for fear. When we came to the discussion of the sequence ofour efforts and of the disposition of our forces, therewere new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed thatbefore starting for Piccadilly we should destroy theCount’s lair close at hand. In case he should find it outtoo soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in ourwork of destruction. And his presence in his purelymaterial shape, and at his weakest, might give us somenew clue. A s to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by theProfessor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should allenter the house in Piccadilly. That the two doctorsand I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming andQuincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End anddestroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Pro-fessor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadillyduring the day, and that if so we might be able tocope with him then and there. At any rate, we mightbe able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenu-ously objected, and so far as my going was concerned,for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina. Ithought that my mind was made up on the subject,but Mina would not listen to my objection. She saidthat there might be some law matter in which I couldbe useful. That amongst the Count’s papers might besome clue which I could understand out of my experi-ence in Transylvania. And that, as it was, all thestrength we could muster was required to cope withthe Count’s extraordinary power. I had to give in, forMina’s resolution was fixed. She said that it was thelast hope for her that we should all work together. “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear. Things havebeen as bad as they can be. And whatever may happenmust have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go,my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as wellalone as with any one present.”356Chapter 22"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":" So I started up crying out, “Then in God’s name let uscome at once, for we are losing time. The Count maycome to Piccadilly earlier than we think.” “Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand. “But why?” I asked. “Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “thatlast night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?” Did I forget! Shall I ever...can I ever! Can any of usever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard tokeep her brave countenance, but the pain overmas-tered her and she put her hands before her face, andshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not in-tended to recall her frightful experience. He had sim-ply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in hisintellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified athis thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “dear, dear, Madam Mina,alas! That I of all who so reverence you should havesaid anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips ofmine and this stupid old head do not deserve so, butyou will forget it, will you not?” He bent low besideher as he spoke. She took his hand, and looking at him through hertears, said hoarsely, “No, I shall not forget, for it iswell that I remember. And with it I have so much inmemory of you that is sweet, that I take it all to-gether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast isready, and we must all eat that we may be strong.” Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to becheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was thebrightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over,Van Helsing stood up and said, “Now, my dear friends,we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed,as we were on that night when first we visited ourenemy’s lair. Armed against ghostly as well as carnalattack?” We all assured him.Chapter 22357"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":" “Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in anycase quite safe here until the sunset. And before thenwe shall return ... if ... . We shall return! But beforewe go let me see you armed against personal attack. Ihave myself, since you came down, prepared yourchamber by the placing of things of which we know,so that He may not enter. Now let me guard yourself.On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer inthe name of the Father, the Son, and... . There was a fearful scream which almost froze ourhearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina’sforehead, it had seared it ... had burned into the fleshas though it had been a piece of whitehot metal. Mypoor darling’s brain had told her the significance ofthe fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain ofit, and the two so overwhelmed her that her over-wrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly. The echoof the scream had not ceased to ring on the air whenthere came the reaction, and she sank on her knees onthe floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beau-tiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle,she wailed out. “Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my pol-luted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon myforehead until the Judgement Day.” They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in anagony of helpless grief, and putting my arms aroundheld her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful heartsbeat together, whilst the friends around us turned awaytheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsingturned and said gravely. So gravely that I could nothelp feeling that he was in some way inspired, and wasstating things outside himself. “It may be that you may have to bear that mark tillGod himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on theJudgement Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth andof His children that He has placed thereon. And oh,Chapter 22358"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love yoube there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God’sknowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leaveyour forehead as pure as the heart we know. For sosurely as we live, that scar shall pass away when Godsees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Tillthen we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience toHis Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments ofHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His biddingas that other through stripes and shame. Through tearsand blood. Through doubts and fear, and all that makesthe difference between God and man.” There was hope in his words, and comfort. And theymade for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and si-multaneously we each took one of the old man’s handsand bent over and kissed it. Then without a word weall knelt down together, and all holding hands, sworeto be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves toraise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom,each in his own way, we loved. And we prayed for helpand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, aparting which neither of us shall forget to our dyingday, and we set out. To one thing I have made up my mind. If we find outthat Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shallnot go into that unknown and terrible land alone. Isuppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meantmany. Just as their hideous bodies could only rest insacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruitingsergeant for their ghastly ranks. We entered Carfax without trouble and found allthings the same as on the first occasion. It was hard tobelieve that amongst so prosaic surroundings of ne-glect and dust and decay there was any ground forsuch fear as already we knew. Had not our minds beenmade up, and had there not been terrible memories tospur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with ourChapter 22359"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in thehouse. And in the old chapel the great boxes lookedjust as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood be-fore him, “And now, my friends, we have a duty hereto do. We must sterilize this earth, so sacred of holymemories, that he has brought from a far distant landfor such fell use. He has chosen this earth because ithas been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon,for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified tosuch use of man, now we sanctify it to God.” As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and awrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases wasthrown open. The earth smelled musty and close, butwe did not somehow seem to mind, for our attentionwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from hisbox a piece of the Scared Wafer he laid it reverentlyon the earth, and then shutting down the lid began toscrew it home, we aiding him as he worked. One by one we treated in the same way each of thegreat boxes, and left them as we had found them to allappearance. But in each was a portion of the Host.When we closed the door behind us, the Professor saidsolemnly, “So much is already done. It may be thatwith all the others we can be so successful, then thesunset of this evening may shine of Madam Mina’s fore-head all white as ivory and with no stain!” As we passed across the lawn on our way to the sta-tion to catch our train we could see the front of theasylum. I looked eagerly, and in the window of myown room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nod-ded to tell that our work there was successfully ac-complished. She nodded in reply to show that she un-derstood. The last I saw, she was waving her hand infarewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought thestation and just caught the train, which was steamingin as we reached the platform. I have written this inthe train.Chapter 22360"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock.—Just before we reachedFenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me, “Quinceyand I will find a locksmith. You had better not comewith us in case there should be any difficulty. For un-der the circumstances it wouldn’t seem so bad for usto break into an empty house. But you are a solicitorand the Incorporated Law Society might tell you thatyou should have known better.” I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even ofodium, but he went on, “Besides, it will attract lessattention if there are not too many of us. My title willmake it all right with the locksmith, and with anypoliceman that may come along. You had better gowith Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park.Somewhere in sight of the house, and when you seethe door opened and the smith has gone away, do youall come across. We shall be on the lookout for you,and shall let you in.” “The advice is good!” said Van Helsing, so we said nomore. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, wefollowing in another. At the corner of Arlington Streetour contingent got out and strolled into the GreenPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which somuch of our hope was centered, looming up grim andsilent in its deserted condition amongst its more livelyand spruce-looking neighbors. We sat down on a benchwithin good view , and began to smoke cigars so as toattract as little attention as possible. The minutesseemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for thecoming of the others. At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it,in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris.And down from the box descended a thick-set work-ing man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morrispaid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.Together the two ascended the steps, and LordGodalming pointed out what he wanted done. Theworkman took off his coat leisurely and hung it onChapter 22361"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to apoliceman who just then sauntered along. The police-man nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling downplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it,he took out a selection of tools which he proceeded tolay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up,looked in the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to hisemployers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled,and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys. Select-ing one of them, he began to probe the lock, as iffeeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bithe tried a second, and then a third. All at once thedoor opened under a slight push from him, and he andthe two others entered the hall. We sat still. My owncigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing’s went cold al-together. We waited patiently as we saw the workmancome out and bring his bag. Then he held the doorpartly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst hefitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to LordGodalming, who took out his purse and gave him some-thing. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put onhis coat and departed. Not a soul took the slightestnotice of the whole transaction. When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed thestreet and knocked at the door. It was immediatelyopened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood LordGodalming lighting a cigar. “The place smells so vilely,” said the latter as wecame in. It did indeed smell vilely. Like the old chapelat Carfax. And with our previous experience it wasplain to us that the Count had been using the placepretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keep-ing together in case of attack, for we knew we had astrong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we didnot know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining room, which lay at the back of thehall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes onlyout of the nine which we sought! Our work was notChapter 22362"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"over, and would never be until we should have foundthe missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window whichlooked out across a narrow stone flagged yard at theblank face of a stable, pointed to look like the frontof a miniature house. There were no windows in it, sowe were not afraid of being overlooked. We did notlose any time in examining the chests. With the toolswhich we had brought with us we opened them, oneby one, and treated them as we had treated those oth-ers in the old chapel. It was evident to us that theCount was not at present in the house, and we pro-ceeded to search for any of his effects. After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, frombasement to attic, we came to the conclusion that thedining room contained any effects which might be-long to the Count. And so we proceeded to minutelyexamine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorderon the great dining room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in agreat bundle, deeds of the purchase of the houses atMile End and Bermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, andpens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrappingpaper to keep them from the dust. There were also aclothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin.The latter containing dirty water which was reddenedas if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys ofall sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to theother houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalmingand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the vari-ous addresses of the houses in the East and the South,took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set outto destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of usare, with what patience we can, waiting their return,or the coming of the Count.Chapter 22363"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23DR. SEWARD’S DIARY3 October.—The time seemed teribly long whilst wewere waiting for the coming of Godalming and QuinceyMorris. The Professor tried to keep our minds activeby using them all the time. I could see his beneficentpurpose, by the side glances which he threw from timeto time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in amisery that is appalling to see. Last night he was afrank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face,full of energy, and with dark brown hair. Today he is adrawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matcheswell with the hollow burning eyes and grief-writtenlines of his face. His energy is still intact. In fact, heis like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, forif all go well, it will tide him over the despairing pe-riod. He will then, in a kind of way, wake again to therealities o f life. Poor fellow, I thought my own troublewas bad enough, but his... ! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doinghis best to keep his mind active. What he has beensaying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing in-terest. So well as I can remember, here it is: “I have studied, over and over again since they cameinto my hands, all the papers relating to this monster,and the more I have studied, the greater seems thenecessity to utterly stamp him out. All through thereare signs of his advance. Not only of his power, but ofhis knowledge of it. As I learned from the researchesof my friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life amost wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alche-mist. Which latter was the highest development of thescience knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain,a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew nofear and no remorse. He dared even to attend theChapter 23364"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledgeof his time that he did not essay. “Well, in him the brain powers survived the physicaldeath. Though it would seem that memory was not allcomplete. In some faculties of mind he has been, andis, only a child. But he is growing, and some thingsthat were childish at the first are now of man’s stat-ure. He is experimenting, and doing it well. And if ithad not been that we have crossed his path he wouldbe yet, he may be yet if we fail, the father or furthererof a new order of beings, whose road must lead throughDeath, not Life.” Harker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayedagainst my darling! But how is he experimenting? Theknowledge may help us to defeat him!” “He has all along, since his coming, been trying hispower, slowly but surely. That big child-brain of his isworking. Well for us, it is as yet, a child-brain. Forhad he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things hewould long ago have been beyond our power. How-ever, he means to succeed, and a man who has centu-ries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festinalente may well be his motto.” “I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, dobe more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble aredulling my brain.” The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulderas he spoke, “Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you notsee how, of late, this monster has been creeping intoknowledge experimentally. How he has been makinguse of the zoophagous patient to effect his entry intofriend John’s home. For your Vampire, though in allafterwards he can come when and how he will, must atthe first make entry only when asked thereto by aninmate. But these are not his most important experi-ments. Do we not see how at the first all these so greatboxes were moved by others. He knew not then butthat must be so. But all the time that so great child-Chapter 23365"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"brain of his was growing, and he began to considerwhether he might not himself move the box. So hebegan to help. And then, when he found that this beall right, he try to move them all alone. And so heprogress, and he scatter these graves of him. And nonebut he know where they are hidden. “He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.So that only he use them in the night, or at such timeas he can change his form, they do him equal well, andnone may know these are his hiding place! But, mychild, do not despair, this knowledge came to him justtoo late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilize asfor him. And before the sunset this shall be so. Thenhe have no place where he can move and hide. I de-layed this morning that so we might be sure. Is therenot more at stake for us than for him? Then why notbe more careful than him? By my clock it is one hourand already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quinceyare on their way to us. Today is our day, and we mustgo sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! There are fiveof us when those absent ones return.” Whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knockat the hall door, the double postman’s knock of thetelegraph boy. We all moved out to the hall with oneimpulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us tokeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. Theboy handed in a dispatch. The Professor closed thedoor again, and after looking at the direction, openedit and read aloud. “Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come fromCarfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. Heseems to be going the round and may want to see you:Mina.” There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker’s voice,“Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said, “Godwill act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and donot rejoice as yet. For what we wish for at the momentChapter 23"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"may be our own undoings.” “I care for nothing now,” he answered hotly, “exceptto wipe out this brute from the face of creation. Iwould sell my soul to do it!” “Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “Goddoes not purchase souls in this wise, and the Devil,though he may purchase, does not keep faith. But Godis merciful and just, and knows your pain and yourdevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, howher pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wildwords. Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to thiscause, and today shall see the end. The time is comingfor action. Today this Vampire is limit to the powersof man, and till sunset he may not change. It will takehim time to arrive here, see it is twenty minutes pastone, and there are yet some times before he can hithercome, be he never so quick. What we must hope for isthat my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.” About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’stelegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at thehall door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as isgiven hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it madethe Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We lookedat each other, and together moved out into the hall.We each held ready to use our various armaments, thespiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. VanHelsing pulled back the latch, and holding the doorhalf open, stood back, having both hands ready foraction. The gladness of our hearts must have shownupon our faces when on the step, close to the door, wesaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They camequickly in and closed the door behind them, the formersaying, as they moved along the hall. “It is all right. We found both places. Six boxes ineach and we destroyed them all.” “Destroyed?” asked the Professor. “For him!” We were silent for a minute, and thenQuincey said, “There’s nothing to do but to wait here.Chapter 23367"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"If, however, he doesn’t turn up by five o’clock, we muststart off. For it won’t do to leave Mrs. Harker aloneafter sunset.” “He will be here before long now,’ said Van Helsing,who had been consulting his pocketbook. “Nota bene,in Madam’s telegram he went south from Carfax. Thatmeans he went to cross the river, and he could only doso at slack of tide, which should be something beforeone o’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us.He is as yet only suspicious, and he went from Carfaxfirst to the place where he would suspect interferenceleast. You must have been at Bermondsey only a shorttime before him. That he is not here already showsthat he went to Mile End next. This took him sometime, for he would then have to be carried over theriver in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shallnot have long to wait now. We should have ready someplan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance.Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Beready!” He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for weall could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of thehall door. I could not but admire, even at such a moment, theway in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In allour hunting parties and adventures in different partsof the world, Quincey Morris had always been the oneto arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I hadbeen accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the oldhabit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swiftglance around the room, he at once laid out our planof attack, and without speaking a word, with a ges-ture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker,and I were just behind the door, so that when it wasopened the Professor could guard it whilst we twostepped between the incomer and the door. Godalmingbehind and Quincey in front stood just out of sightready to move in front of the window. We waited in asuspense that made the seconds pass with nightmareChapter 23368"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall.The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,at least he feared it. Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room.Winning a way past us before any of us could raise ahand to stay him. There was something so pantherlikein the movement, something so unhuman, that itseemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.The first to act was Harker, who with a quick move-ment, threw himself before the door leading into theroom in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, ahorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showingthe eyeteeth long and pointed. But the evil smile asquickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain.His expression again changed as, with a single impulse,we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we hadnot some better organized plan of attack, for even atthe moment I wondered what we were to do. I did notmyself know whether our lethal weapons would availus anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he hadready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sud-den cut at him. The blow was a powerful one. Only thediabolical quickness of the Count’s leap back saved him.A second less and the trenchant blade had shornthrough his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundleof bank notes and a stream of gold fell out. The ex-pression of the Count’s face was so hellish, that for amoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throwthe terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. In-stinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse,holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I felt amighty power fly along my arm, and it was withoutsurprise that I saw the monster cower back before asimilar movement made spontaneously by each one ofus. It would be impossible to describe the expressionof hate and baffled malignity, of anger and hellish rage,which came over the Count’s face. His waxen hue be-Chapter 23369"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"came greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burningeyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on thepallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant,with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker’s arm, erehis blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the moneyfrom the floor, dashed across the room, threw himselfat the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the fall-ing glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hearthe “ting” of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fellon the flagging. We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from theground. He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flaggedyard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turnedand spoke to us. “You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces allin a row, like sheep in a butcher’s. You shall be sorryyet, each one of you! You think you have left me with-out a place to rest, but I have more. My revenge is justbegun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on myside. Your girls that you all love are mine already. Andthrough them you and others shall yet be mine, mycreatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals whenI want to feed. Bah!” With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly throughthe door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fas-tened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut.The first of us to speak was the Professor. Realizingthe difficulty of following him through the stable, wemoved toward the hall. “We have learnt something... much! Notwithstand-ing his brave words, he fears us. He fears time, he fearswant! For if not, why he hurry so? His very tone be-tray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money?You follow quick. You are hunters of the wild beast,and understand it so. For me, I make sure that nothinghere may be of use to him, if so that he returns.” As he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket,Chapter 23370"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"took the title deeds in the bundle as Harker had leftthem, and swept the remaining things into the openfireplace, where he set fire to them with a match. Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard,and Harker had lowered himself from the window tofollow the Count. He had, however, bolted the stabledoor, and by the time they had forced it open therewas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to makeinquiry at the back of the house. But the mews wasdeserted and no one had seen him depart. It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was notfar off. We had to recognize that our game was up.With heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor whenhe said, “Let us go back to Madam Mina. Poor, poordear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done, andwe can there, at least, protect her. But we need notdespair. There is but one more earth box, and we musttry to find it. When that is done all may yet be well.” I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could tocomfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down,now and again he gave a low groan which he could notsuppress. He was thinking of his wife. With sad hearts we came back to my house, where wefound Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance ofcheerfulness which did honor to her bravery and un-selfishness. When she saw our faces, her own becameas pale as death. For a second or two her eyes wereclosed as if she were in secret prayer. And then she said cheerfully, “I can never thank youall enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she spoke, she took her husband’s grey head inher hands and kissed it. “Lay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet bewell, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in Hisgood intent.” The poor fellow groaned. There was noplace for words in his sublime misery. We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and Ithink it cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps,Chapter 23371"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"the mere animal heat of food to hungry people, fornone of us had eaten anything since breakfast, or thesense of companionship may have helped us, but any-how we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow asnot altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everythingwhich had passed. And although she grew snowy whiteat times when danger had seemed to threaten her hus-band, and red at others when his devotion to her wasmanifested she listened bravely and with calmness.When we came to the part where Harker had rushed atthe Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband’sarm, and held it tight as though her clinging couldprotect him from any harm that might come. She saidnothing, however, till the narration was all done, andmatters had been brought up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband’s hand she stoodup amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give anyidea of the scene. Of that sweet, sweet, good, goodwoman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and ani-mation, with the red scar on her forehead, of whichshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding ofour teeth, remembering whence and how it came. Herloving kindness against our grim hate. Her tender faithagainst all our fears and doubting. And we, knowingthat so far as symbols went, she with all her goodnessand purity and faith, was outcast from God. “Jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like mu-sic on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness,“Jonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, Iwant you to bear something in mind through all thisdreadful time. I know that you must fight. That youmust destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy sothat the true Lucy might live hereafter. But it is not awork of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all thismisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what willbe his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worserpart that his better part may have spiritual immortal-Chapter 23372"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"ity. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it maynot hold your hands from his destruction.” As she spoke I could see her husband’s face darkenand draw together, as though the passion in him wereshriveling his being to its core. Instinctively the claspon his wife’s hand grew closer, till his knuckles lookedwhite. She did not flinch from the pain which I knewshe must have suffered, but looked at him with eyesthat were more appealing than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, al-most tearing his hand from hers as he spoke. “May God give him into my hand just for long enoughto destroy that earthly life of him which we are aim-ing at. If beyond it I could send his soul forever andever to burning hell I would do it!” “Oh, hush! Oh, hush in the name of the good God.Don’t say such things, Jonathan, my husband, or youwill crush me with fear and horror. Just think, mydear... . I have been thinking all this long, long day ofit... that... perhaps... some day... I, too, may needsuch pity, and that some other like you, and with equalcause for anger, may deny it to me! Oh, my husband!My husband, indeed I would have spared you such athought had there been another way. But I pray thatGod may not have treasured your wild words, exceptas the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorelystricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs goin evidence of what he has suffered, who all his lifehas done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrowshave come.” We men were all in tears now. There was no resistingthem, and we wept openly. She wept, too, to see thather sweeter counsels had prevailed. Her husband flunghimself on his knees beside her, and putting his armsround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. VanHelsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room,leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God. Before they retired the Professor fixed up the roomChapter 23373"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs.Harker that she might rest in peace. She tried to schoolherself to the belief, and manifestly for her husband’ssake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle,and was, I think and believe, not without its reward.Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either ofthem was to sound in case of any emergency. Whenthey had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arrangedthat we should sit up, dividing the night between us,and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady.The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shallbe off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in, for his is the sec-ond watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall goto bed.JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL3-4 October, close to midnight.—I thought yesterdaywould never end. There was over me a yearning forsleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake wouldbe to find things changed, and that any change mustnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussedwhat our next step was to be, but we could arrive atno result. All we knew was that one earth box re-mained, and that the Count alone knew where it was.If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years.And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, Idare not think of it even now. This I know, that if everthere was a woman who was all perfection, that one ismy poor wronged darling. I loved her a thousand timesmore for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that mademy own hate of the monster seem despicable. SurelyGod will not permit the world to be the poorer by theloss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are alldrifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor.Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping withoutdreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, withChapter 23374"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"such terrible memories to ground them in. She has notbeen so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then,for a while, there came over her face a repose whichwas like spring after the blasts of March. I thought atthe time that it was the softness of the red sunset onher face, but somehow now I think it has a deepermeaning. I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary...weary to death. However, I must try to sleep. Forthere is tomorrow to think of, and there is no rest forme until... .Later—I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakenedby Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startledlook on her face. I could see easily, for we did notleave the room in darkness. She had placed a warninghand over my mouth, and now she whispered in myear, “Hush! There is someone in the corridor!” I gotup softly, and crossing the room, gently opened thedoor. Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris,wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as hewhispered to me, “Hush! Go back to bed. It is all right.One of us will be here all night. We don’t mean to takeany chances!” His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I cameback and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadowof a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put herarms round me and said softly, “Oh, thank God forgood brave men!” With a sigh she sank back again tosleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though Imust try again.4 October, morning.—Once again during the night Iwas wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a goodsleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was makingthe windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flamewas like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly, “Go, call the Professor. Iwant to see him at once.”Chapter 23375"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":" “Why?” I asked. “I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in thenight, and matured without my knowing it. He musthypnotize me before the dawn, and then I shall beable to speak. Go quick, dearest, the time is gettingclose.” I went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on themattress, and seeing me, he sprang to his feet. “Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm. “No,” I replied. “But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsingat once.” “I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’sroom. Two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in theroom in his dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and LordGodalming were with Dr. Seward at the door askingquestions. When the Professor saw Mina a smile, a posi-tive smile ousted the anxiety of his face. He rubbed his hands as he said, “Oh, my dear MadamMina, this is indeed a change. See! Friend Jonathan,we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back tous today!” Then turning to her, he said cheerfully, “Andwhat am I to do for you? For at this hour you do notwant me for nothing.” “I want you to hypnotize me!” she said. “Do it be-fore the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, andspeak freely. Be quick, for the time is short!” Withouta word he motioned her to sit up in bed. Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passesin front of her, from over the top of her head down-ward, with each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fix-edly for a few minutes, during which my own heartbeat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis wasat hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stockstill. Only by the gentle heaving of her bosom couldone know that she was alive. The Professor made a fewmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that hisforehead was covered with great beads of perspira-Chapter 23376"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"tion. Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem thesame woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes,and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new tome. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professormotioned to me to bring the others in. They came ontiptoe, closing the door behind them, and stood atthe foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not tosee them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing’svoice speaking in a low level tone which would notbreak the current of her thoughts. “Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way. “I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call itsown.” For several minutes there was silence. Mina satrigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly. The rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room wasgrowing lighter. Without taking his eyes from Mina’sface, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind.I did so, and the day seemed just upon us. A red streakshot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itselfthrough the room. On the instant the Professor spokeagain. “Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention. It wereas though she were interpreting something. I haveheard her use the same tone when reading her short-hand notes. “I do not know. It is all strange to me!” “What do you see?” “I can see nothing. It is all dark.” “What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in theProfessor’s patient voice. “The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and littlewaves leap. I can hear them on the outside.” “Then you are on a ship?’” We all looked at each other, trying to glean some-thing each from the other. We were afraid to think.

There is the creaking of a chain, and the loudtinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the ratchet.” “What are you doing?” “I am still, oh so still. It is like death!” The voicefaded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, andthe open eyes closed again. By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in thefull light of day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands onMina’s shoulders, and laid her head down softly on herpillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments,and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in won-der to see us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.She seemed, however, to know the situation withouttelling, though she was eager to know what she hadtold. The Professor repeated the conversation, andshe said, “Then there is not a moment to lose. It maynot be yet too late!” Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the doorbut the Professor’s calm voice called them back. “Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, wasweighing anchor at the moment in your so great Portof London. Which of them is it that you seek? God bethanked that we have once again a clue, though whitherit may lead us we know not. We have been blind some-what. Blind after the manner of men, since we canlook back we see what we might have seen lookingforward if we had been able to see what we might haveseen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?

Let us take bath, and dress, and havebreakfast which we all need, and which we can eatcomfortably since he be not in the same land with us.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked, “Butwhy need we seek him further, when he is gone awayfrom us?” He took her hand and patted it as he replied, “Askme nothing as yet. When we have breakfast, then Ianswer all questions.” He would say no more, and weseparated to dress. After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He lookedat her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully,“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more thanever must we find him even if we have to follow him tothe jaws of Hell!” She grew paler as she asked faintly, “Why?” “Because,” he answered solemnly, “he can live forcenturies, and you are but mortal woman.

Already the certainty that the Count isout of the country has given her comfort. And com-fort is strength to her. For my own part, now that hishorrible danger is not face to face with us, it seemsalmost impossible to believe in it. Even my own ter-rible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a longforgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in thebright sunlight. Alas! How can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thoughtmy eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling’s whiteforehead. Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief.Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all thediaries again and again. Somehow, although the real-ity seem greater each time, the pain and the fear seemless. There is something of a guiding purpose manifestthroughout, which is comforting. Mina says that per-haps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It maybe! I shall try to think as she does. We have neverspoken to each other yet of the future. It is better towait till we see the Professor and the others after theirinvestigations. The day is running by more quickly than I ever thoughta day could run for me again. It is now three o’clock.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL5 October, 5 P.M.—Our meeting for report. Present:Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr.Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.

Omme Ignotumpro magnifico. And so with heavy hearts we start tofind what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. Hewas in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails be-ing set. These not so important as to go in your list ofthe shipping in the Times, and so we go, by sugges-tion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where arenote of all ships that sail, however so small. There wefind that only one Black Sea bound ship go out withthe tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail fromDoolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence to other portsand up the Danube. ‘So!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereonis the Count.’ So off we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, andthere we find a man in an office. From him we inquireo f the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much,and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellowall the same. And when Quincey give him somethingfrom his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and putit in a so small bag which he have hid deep in hisclothing, he still better fellow and humble servant tous. He come with us, and ask many men who are roughand hot. These be better fellows too when they havebeen no more thirsty. They say much of blood andbloom, and of others which I comprehend not, thoughI guess what they mean. But nevertheless they tell usall things which we want to know. “They make known to us among them, how last af-ternoon at about five o’clock comes a man so hurry. Atall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth sowhite, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he beall in black, except that he have a hat of straw whichsuit not him or the time. That he scatter his money inmaking quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the BlackChapter 24382"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Sea and for where. Some took him to the office andthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but haltat shore end of gangplank, and ask that the captaincome to him. The captain come, when told that he willbe pay well, and though he swear much at the first heagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tellhim where horse and cart can be hired. He go thereand soon he come again, himself driving cart on whicha great box. This he himself lift down, though it takeseveral to put it on truck for the ship. He give muchtalk to captain as to how and where his box is to beplace. But the captain like it not and swear at him inmany tongues, and tell him that if he like he can comeand see where it shall be. But he say ‘no,’ that he comenot yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon thecaptain tell him that he had better be quick, withblood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood,before the turn of the tide, with blood. Then the thinman smile and say that of course he must go when hethink fit, but he will be surprise if he go quite sosoon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thinman make him bow, and thank him, and say that hewill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboardbefore the sailing. Final the captain, more red thanever, and in more tongues, tell him that he doesn’twant no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and alsowith blood, in his ship, with blood on her also. Andso, after asking where he might purchase ship forms,he departed. “No one knew where he went `or bloomin’ well cared’as they said, for they had something else to think of,well with blood again. For it soon became apparent toall that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as wasexpected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river,and it grew, and grew. Till soon a dense fog envelopedthe ship and all around her. The captain swore poly-glot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood,but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose, andChapter 24383"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, thethin man came up the gangplank again and asked tosee where his box had been stowed. Then the captainreplied that he wished that he and his box, old andwith much bloom and blood, were in hell. But the thinman did not be offend, and went down with the mateand saw where it was place, and came up and stoodawhile on deck in fog. He must have come off by him-self, for none notice him. Indeed they thought not ofhim, for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all wasclear again. My friends of the thirst and the languagethat was of bloom and blood laughed, as they toldhow the captain’s swears exceeded even his usual poly-glot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, whenon questioning other mariners who were on movementup and down the river that hour, he found that few ofthem had seen any of fog at all, except where it layround the wharf. However, the ship went out on theebb tide, and was doubtless by morning far down theriver mouth. She was then, when they told us, wellout to sea. “And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have torest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with thefog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth.To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick. Andwhen we start to go on land more quick, and we meethim there. Our best hope is to come on him when inthe box between sunrise and sunset. For then he canmake no struggle, and we may deal with him as weshould. There are days for us, in which we can makeready our plan. We know all about where he go. Forwe have seen the owner of the ship, who have shownus invoices and all papers that can be. The box weseek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to anagent, one Ristics who will there present his creden-tials. And so our merchant friend will have done hispart. When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so,Chapter 24384"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, wesay ‘no,’ for what is to be done is not for police or ofthe customs. It must be done by us alone and in ourown way.” When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked himif he were certain that the Count had remained on boardthe ship. He replied, “We have the best proof of that,your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance thismorning.” I asked him again if it were really necessary thatthey should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathanleaving me, and I know that he would surely go if theothers went. He answered in growing passion, at firstquietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angryand more forceful, till in the end we could not but seewherein was at least some of that personal dominancewhich made him so long a master amongst men. “Yes, it is necessary, necessary, necessary! For yoursake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity.This monster has done much harm already, in the nar-row scope where he find himself, and in the short timewhen as yet he was only as a body groping his so smallmeasure in darkness and not knowing. All this have Itold these others. You, my dear Madam Mina, will learnit in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that ofyour husband. I have told them how the measure ofleaving his own barren land, barren of peoples, andcoming to a new land where life of man teems till theyare like the multitude of standing corn, was the workof centuries. Were another of the Undead, like him, totry to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centu-ries of the world that have been, or that will be, couldaid him. With this one, all the forces of nature thatare occult and deep and strong must have worked to-gether in some wonderous way. The very place, wherehe have been alive, Undead for all these centuries, isfull of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world.There are deep caverns and fissures that reach noneChapter 24385"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"know whither. There have been volcanoes, some ofwhose openings still send out waters of strange prop-erties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,there is something magnetic or electric in some ofthese combinations of occult forces which work forphysical life in strange way, and in himself were fromthe first some great qualities. In a hard and warliketime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve,more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man.In him some vital principle have in strange way foundtheir utmost. And as his body keep strong and growand thrive, so his brain grow too. All this withoutthat diabolic aid which is surely to him.

He infectyou in such wise, that even if he do no more, you haveonly to live, to live in your own old, sweet way, andso in time, death, which is of man’s common lot andwith God’s sanction, shall make you like to him. Thismust not be! We have sworn together that it must not.Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish. That the world,and men for whom His Son die, will not be given overto monsters, whose very existence would defame Him.He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and wego out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more.Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise. Andlike them, if we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said, “But will not the Count takehis rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from En-gland, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the villagefrom which he has been hunted?” “Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, forme, and I shall adopt him.

Look at his persis-tence and endurance. With the child-brain that was tohim he have long since conceive the idea of coming toa great city. What does he do? He find out the place ofall the world most of promise for him. Then he delib-erately set himself down to prepare for the task. Hefind in patience just how is his strength, and what arehis powers.

Whatmore may he not do when the greater world of thoughtis open to him. He that can smile at death, as we knowhim. Who can flourish in the midst of diseases thatkill off whole peoples. Oh! If such an one was to comefrom God, and not the Devil, what a force for goodmight he not be in this old world of ours. But we arepledged to set the world free.

It would be at once his sheath and his ar-mor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, whoare willing to peril even our own souls for the safetyof one we love. For the good of mankind, and for thehonor and glory of God.” After a general discussion it was determined that fortonight nothing be definitely settled. That we shouldChapter 24387"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the properconclusions. Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are to meetagain, and after making our conclusions known to oneanother, we shall decide on some definite cause of ac-tion... . I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.

My surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caughtsight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead,and I knew that I was still unclean.DR. SEWARD’S DIARY5 October.—We all arose early, and I think that sleepdid much for each and all of us. When we met at earlybreakfast there was more general cheerfulness than anyof us had ever expected to experience again. It is really wonderful how much resilience there is inhuman nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matterwhat, be removed in any way, even by death, and wefly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.More than once as we sat around the table, my eyesopened in wonder whether the whole of the past dayshad not been a dream. It was only when I caught sightof the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I wasbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravelyrevolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realizethat the cause of all our trouble is still existent. EvenMrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for wholespells. It is only now and again, when something re-calls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terriblescar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hourand decide on our course of action. I see only oneimmediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather thanreason. We shall all have to speak frankly. And yet Ifear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker’stongue is tied. I know that she forms conclusions ofChapter 24388"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"her own, and from all that has been I can guess howbrilliant and how true they must be. But she will not,or cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned thisto Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over whenwe are alone. I suppose it is some of that horrid poi-son which has got into her veins beginning to work.The Count had his own purposes when he gave her whatVan Helsing called “the Vampire’s baptism of blood.”Well, there may be a poison that distills itself out ofgood things. In an age when the existence of ptomainesis a mystery we should not wonder at anything! Onething I know, that if my instinct be true regardingpoor Mrs. Harker’s silences, then there is a terribledifficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us.The same power that compels her silence may compelher speech. I dare not think further, for so I should inmy thoughts dishonor a noble woman!Later.—When the Professor came in, we talked overthe state of things. I could see that he had somethingon his mind, which he wanted to say, but felt somehesitancy about broaching the subject. After beatingabout the bush a little, he said, “Friend John, there issomething that you and I must talk of alone, just atthe first at any rate. Later, we may have to take theothers into our confidence.” Then he stopped, so I waited. He went on, “MadamMina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fearsthus endorsed. Van Helsing continued. “With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must thistime be warned before things go too far. Our task isnow in reality more difficult than ever, and this newtrouble makes every hour of the direst importance. Ican see the characteristics of the vampire coming inher face. It is now but very, very slight. But it is to beseen if we have eyes to notice without prejudge. Herteeth are sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard.Chapter 24389"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"But these are not all, there is to her the silence nowoften, as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak,even when she wrote that which she wished to be knownlater. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by ourhypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is itnot more true that he who have hypnotize her first,and who have drink of her very blood and make herdrink of his, should if he will, compel her mind todisclose to him that which she know?” I nodded acquiescence. He went on, “Then, what wemust do is to prevent this. We must keep her ignorantof our intent, and so she cannot tell what she knownot. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of it, but it must be. When today wemeet, I must tell her that for reason which we will notto speak she must not more be of our council, but besimply guarded by us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in pro-fuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which hemight have to inflict upon the poor soul already sotortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfortto him if I told him that I also had come to the sameconclusion. For at any rate it would take away thepain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I ex-pected. It is now close to the time of our general gathering.Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting,and his painful part of it. I really believe his purposeis to be able to pray alone.Later.—At the very outset of our meeting a great per-sonal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing andmyself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her hus-band to say that she would not join us at present, asshe thought it better that we should be free to discussour movements without her presence to embarrass us.The Professor and I looked at each other for an in-stant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For myChapter 24390"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realized thedanger herself, it was much pain as well as much dan-ger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by aquestioning look and answer, with finger on lip, topreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should havebeen able to confer alone again. We went at once intoour Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first, “TheCzarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning.It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever madeat least three weeks to reach Varna. But we can traveloverland to the same place in three days. Now, if weallow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing tosuch weather influences as we know that the Countcan bring to bear, and if we allow a whole day andnight for any delays which may occur to us, then wehave a margin of nearly two weeks. “Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave hereon 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varnaa day before the ship arrives, and able to make suchpreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shallall go armed, armed against evil things, spiritual aswell as physical.” Here Quincey Morris added, “I understand that theCount comes from a wolf country, and it may be thathe shall get there before us. I propose that we addWinchesters to our armament. I have a kind of beliefin a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sortaround. Do you remember, Art, when we had the packafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given thenfor a repeater apiece!” “Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be.Quincey’s head is level at times, but most so when thereis to hunt, metaphor be more dishonor to science thanwolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we cando nothing here. And as I think that Varna is not fa-miliar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It isas long to wait here as there. Tonight and tomorrowChapter 24391"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"we can get ready, and then if all be well, we four canset out on our journey.” “We four?” said Harker interrogatively, looking fromone to another of us. “Of course!” answered the Professor quickly. “Youmust remain to take care of your so sweet wife!” Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hol-low voice, “Let us talk of that part of it in the morn-ing. I want to consult with Mina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing towarn him not to disclose our plan to her, but he tookno notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed.For answer he put his finger to his lips and turnedaway.JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNALOctober, afternoon.—For some time after our meetingthis morning I could not think. The new phases ofthings leave my mind in a state of wonder which al-lows no room for active thought. Mina’s determina-tion not to take any part in the discussion set methinking. And as I could not argue the matter withher, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from asolution now. The way the others received it, toopuzzled me. The last time we talked of the subject weagreed that there was to be no more concealment ofanything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmlyand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved andher face beams with happiness. Thank God, there aresuch moments still for her.Later.—How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’s happysleep, and I came as near to being happy myself as Isuppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, andthe earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower,the silence of the room grew more and more solemn tome. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at meChapter 24392"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"tenderly said, “Jonathan, I want you to promise mesomething on your word of honor. A promise made tome, but made holily in God’s hearing, and not to bebroken though I should go down on my knees andimplore you with bitter tears. Quick, you must makeit to me at once.” “Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make atonce. I may have no right to make it.” “But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual inten-sity that her eyes were like pole stars, “it is I whowish it. And it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. VanHelsing if I am not right. If he disagrees you may doas you will. Nay, more if you all agree, later you areabsolved from the promise.” “I promise!”I said, and for a moment she looked su-premely happy. Though to me all happiness for herwas denied by the red scar on her forehead. She said, “Promise me that you will not tell me any-thing of the plans formed for the campaign againstthe Count. Not by word, or inference, or implication,not at any time whilst this remains to me!” And shesolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was inearnest, and said solemnly, “I promise!” and as I saidit I felt that from that instant a door had been shutbetween us.Later, midnight.—Mina has been bright and cheerfulall the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed totake courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety.As a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloomwhich weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We allretired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child.It is wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remainsto her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank Godfor it, for then at least she can forget her care. Per-haps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall try it. Oh! For a dreamless sleep.Chapter 24393"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"6 October, morning.—Another surprise. Mina woke meearly, about the same time as yesterday, and asked meto bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that it was anotheroccassion for hypnotism, and without question wentfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some suchcall, for I found him dressed in his room. His door wasajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door ofour room. He came at once. As he passed into the room,he asked Mina if the others might come, too. “No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be neces-sary. You can tell them just as well. I must go withyou on your journey.” Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After amoment’s pause he asked, “But why?” “You must take me with you. I am safer with you,and you shall be safer, too.” “But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that yoursafety is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, towhich you are, or may be, more liable than any of usfrom... from circumstances... things that have been.”He paused embarrassed. As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed toher forehead. “I know. That is why I must go. I can tellyou now, whilst the sun is coming up. I may not beable again. I know that when the Count wills me Imust go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret,I must by wile.

I couldonly clasp her hand. I could not speak. My emotionwas too great for even the relief of tears. She went on. “You men are brave and strong. You arestrong in your numbers, for you can defy that whichwould break down the human endurance of one whohad to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, sinceyou can hypnotize me and so learn that which even Imyself do not know.”Chapter 24394"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":" Dr. Van Helsing said gravely, “Madam Mina, you are,as always, most wise. You shall with us come. Andtogether we shall do that which we go forth toachieve.” When he had spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence mademe look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep.She did not even wake when I had pulled up the blindand let in the sunlight which flooded the room. VanHelsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. Wewent to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming,Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on. “Inthe morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now todeal with a new factor, Madam Mina. Oh, but her soulis true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as shehas done. But it is most right, and we are warned intime. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna wemust be ready to act the instant when that ship ar-rives.” “What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconi-cally. The Professor paused before replying, “We shall atthe first board that ship. Then, when we have identi-fied the box, we shall place a branch of the wild roseon it. This we shall fasten, for when it is there nonecan emerge, so that at least says the superstition. Andto superstition must we trust at the first. It was man’sfaith in the early, and it have its root in faith still.Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, whennone are near to see, we shall open the box, and... andall will be well.” “I shall not wait for any opportunity,” said Morris.“When I see the box I shall open it and destroy themonster, though there were a thousand men lookingon, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next mo-ment!” I grasped his hand instinctively and found it asfirm as a piece of steel.

My will is made, and all complete.Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it should not beso, then the others who have been so good to us shallhave remainder. It is now drawing towards the sunset. Mina’s uneasi-ness calls my attention to it. I am sure that there issomething on her mind which the time of exact sunsetwill reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowingtimes for us all. For each sunrise and sunset opens upsome new danger, some new pain, which however, mayin God’s will be means to a good end.

I think that none of us were surprised when we wereasked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time ofsunset. We have of late come to understand that sun-rise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom.When her old self can be manifest without any con-trolling force subduing or restraining her, or incitingher to action. This mood or condition begins somehalf hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, andlasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the cloudsare still aglow with the rays streaming above the ho-rizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, asif some tie were loosened, and then the absolute free-dom quickly follows. When, however, the freedomceases the change back or relapse comes quickly,preceeded only by a spell of warning silence. Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained,and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put itdown myself to her making a violent effort at the ear-liest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete con-trol of herself. Then, motioning her husband to sitbeside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband’s hand in hers, she began, “Weare all here together in freedom, for perhaps the lasttime! I know that you will always be with me to theend.” This was to her husband whose hand had, as wecould see, tightened upon her. “In the morning we goout upon our task, and God alone knows what may bein store for any of us. You are going to be so good toChapter 25397"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"me to take me with you. I know that all that braveearnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whosesoul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is at any rateat stake, you will do. But you must remember that Iam not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, inmy soul, which may destroy me, which must destroyme, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends,you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake.And though I know there is one way out for me, youmust not and I must not take it!” She looked appeal-ingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with herhusband. “What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarsevoice. “What is that way, which we must not, may not,take?” “That I may die now, either by my own hand or thatof another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.I know, and you know, that were I once dead you couldand would set free my immortal spirit, even as you didmy poor Lucy’s. Were death, or the fear of death, theonly thing that stood in the way I would not shrink todie here now, amidst the friends who love me. Butdeath is not all. I cannot believe that to die in such acase, when there is hope before us and a bitter task tobe done, is God’s will. Therefore, I on my part, give uphere the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into thedark where may be the blackest things that the worldor the nether world holds!” We were all silent, for we knew instinctively thatthis was only a prelude. The faces of the others wereset, and Harker’s grew ashen grey. Perhaps, he guessedbetter than any of us what was coming. She continued, “This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note the quaint legal phrase whichshe used in such a place, and with all seriousness. “Whatwill each of you give? Your lives I know,” she went onquickly, “that is easy for brave men. Your lives areGod’s, and you can give them back to Him, but whatChapter 25398"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"will you give to me?” She looked again questionly,but this time avoided her husband’s face. Quinceyseemed to understand, he nodded, and her face lit up.“Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for theremust be no doubtful matter in this connection be-tween us now. You must promise me, one and all, evenyou, my beloved husband, that should the time come,you will kill me.” “What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’s, but itwas low and strained. “When you shall be convinced that I am so changedthat it is better that I die that I may live. When I amthus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment’sdelay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head,or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!” Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He kneltdown before her and taking her hand in his said sol-emnly, “I’m only a rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps,lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but Iswear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that,should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from theduty that you have set us. And I promise you, too,that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtfulI shall take it that the time has come!” “My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as bending over, she kissed his hand. “I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!”said VanHelsing. “And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them inturn kneeling to her to take the oath. I followed, my-self. Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with agreenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness ofhis hair, and asked, “And must I, too, make such apromise, oh, my wife?” “You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearn-ing of pity in her voice and eyes. “You must not shrink.You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me.Our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time.Chapter 25399"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Think, dear, that there have been times when bravemen have killed their wives and their womenkind, tokeep them from falling into the hands of the enemy.Their hands did not falter any the more because thosethat they loved implored them to slay them.

Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgot-ten your mercy in poor Lucy’s case to him who loved.”She stopped with a flying blush, and changed herphrase, “to him who had best right to give her peace.If that time shall come again, I look to you to make ita happy memory of my husband’s life that it was hisloving hand which set me free from the awful thrallupon me.” “Again I swear!” came the Professor’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sighof relief she leaned back and said, “And now one wordof warning, a warning which you must never forget.This time, if it ever come, may come quickly and un-expectedly, and in such case you must lose no time inusing your opportunity. At such a time I myself mightbe... nay! If the time ever come, shall be, leagued withyour enemy against you. “One more request,” she became very solemn as shesaid this, “it is not vital and necessary like the other,but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke. There was noneed to speak. “I want you to read the Burial Service.” She was in-terrupted by a deep groan from her husband. Takinghis hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and con-tinued. “You must read it over me some day. Whatevermay be the issue of all this fearful state of things, itwill be a sweet thought to all or some of us.

How can I, how could anyone, tell of that strangescene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror,and withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can seenothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holyor emotional, would have been melted to the hearthad he seen that little group of loving and devotedfriends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowinglady. Or heard the tender passion of her husband’s voice,as in tones so broken and emotional that often he hadto pause, he read the simple and beautiful service fromthe Burial of the Dead. I cannot go on... words... andv-voices... f-fail m-me! She was right in her instinct. Strange as it was, bi-zarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt itspotent influence at the time, it comforted us much.And the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker’s comingrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so fullof despair to any of us as we had dreaded.JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL15 October, Varna.—We left Charing Cross on the morn-ing of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and tookthe places secured for us in the Orient Express. Wetraveled night and day, arriving here at about fiveo’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to seeif any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest ofus came on to this hotel, “the Odessus.” The journeymay have had incidents. I was, however, too eager toChapter 25401"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina Catherinecomes into port there will be no interest for me inanything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well,and looks to be getting stronger. Her color is comingback. She sleeps a great deal. Throughout the journeyshe slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sun-set, however, she is very wakeful and alert. And it hasbecome a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her atsuch times. At first, some effort was needed, and hehad to make many passes. But now, she seems to yieldat once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action isneeded. He seems to have power at these particularmoments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him.He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first, “Nothing, all is dark.” And to the second, “I can hear the waves lappingagainst the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas andcordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind ishigh.... I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throwsback the foam.” It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea,hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming hasjust returned. He had four telegrams, one each daysince we started, and all to the same effect. That theCzarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd’s fromanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London thathis agent should send him every day a telegram sayingif the ship had been reported. He was to have a mes-sage even if she were not reported, so that he mightbe sure that there was a watch being kept at the otherend of the wire. We had dinner and went to bed early. Tomorrow weare to see the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can,about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives.Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on theboat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if hetakes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running wa-ter of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship.Chapter 25402"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"As he dare not change to man’s form without suspi-cion, which he evidently wishes to avoid, he must re-main in the box. If, then, we can come on board aftersunrise, he is at our mercy, for we can open the boxand make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, beforehe wakes. What mercy he shall get from us all will notcount for much. We think that we shall not have muchtrouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! Thisis the country where bribery can do anything, and weare well supplied with money. We have only to makesure that the ship cannot come into port between sun-set and sunrise without our being warned, and we shallbe safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!16 October.—Mina’s report still the same. Lappingwaves and rushing water, darkness and favoring winds.We are evidently in good time, and when we hear ofthe Czarina Catherine we shall be ready. As she mustpass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.17 October.—Everything is pretty well fixed now, Ithink, to welcome the Count on his return from histour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied thatthe box sent aboard might contain something stolenfrom a friend of his, and got a half consent that hemight open it at his own risk. The owner gave him apaper telling the Captain to give him every facility indoing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also asimilar authorization to his agent at Varna. We haveseen the agent, who was much impressed withGodalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all sat-isfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes willbe done. We have already arranged what to do in case we getthe box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing andSeward will cut off his head at once and drive a stakethrough his heart.

For myself, I should take the chance only toothankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave nostone unturned to carry out our intent. We have ar-ranged with certain officials that the instant the Cza-rina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a spe-cial messenger.24 October.—A whole week of waiting.

Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, didnot show any signs of emotion. After all, it is notstrange that she did not, for we took special care notto let her know anything about it, and we all triednot to show any excitement when we were in her pres-Chapter 25404"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"ence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed,no matter how we might have tried to conceal it. Butin this way she is greatly changed during the pastthree weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and thoughshe seems strong and well, and is getting back some ofher color, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talkof her often. We have not, however, said a word to theothers. It would break poor Harker’s heart, certainlyhis nerve, if he knew that we had even a suspicion onthe subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, herteeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic con-dition, for he says that so long as they do not beginto sharpen there is no active danger of a change inher. If this change should come, it would be necessaryto take steps! We both know what those steps wouldhave to be, though we do not mention our thoughtsto each other. We should neither of us shrink from thetask, awful though it be to contemplate. “Euthanasia”is an excellent and a comforting word! I am gratefulto whoever invented it. It is only about 24 hours’ sail from the Dardanellesto here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has comefrom London. She should therefore arrive some time inthe morning, but as she cannot possibly get in beforenoon, we are all about to retire early. We shall get upat one o’clock, so as to be ready.25 October, Noon.—No news yet of the ship’s arrival.Mrs. Harker’s hypnotic report this morning was thesame as usual, so it is possible that we may get newsat any moment. We men are all in a fever of excite-ment, except Harker, who is calm. His hands are coldas ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edgeof the great Ghoorka knife which he now always car-ries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the Count ifthe edge of that “Kukri” ever touches his throat, drivenby that stern, ice-cold hand! Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs.405Chapter 25"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Harker today. About noon she got into a sort of leth-argy which we did not like.

When,however, her husband mentioned casually that she wassleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, wewent to her room to see for ourselves. She was breath-ing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that weagreed that the sleep was better for her than anythingelse. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is nowonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, doesher good.Later.—Our opinion was justified, for when after a re-freshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemedbrighter and better than she had been for days. Atsunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Whereverhe may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying tohis destination. To his doom, I trust!26 October.—Another day and no tidings of the Cza-rina Catherine. She ought to be here by now. That sheis still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs.Harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same.It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times,for fog. Some of the steamers which came in last eveningreported patches of fog both to north and south of theport. We must continue our watching, as the ship maynow be signalled any moment.27 October, Noon.—Most strange. No news yet of theship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night andthis morning as usual. “Lapping waves and rushingwater,” though she added that “the waves were veryfaint.” The telegrams from London have been the same,“no further report.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious,and told me just now that he fears the Count is escap-Chapter 25"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"ing us.

Vice Consul, Varna “CzarinaCatherine reported entering Galatz at one o’clock to-day.”DR. SEWARD’S DIARY28 October.—When the telegram came announcing thearrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock toany of us as might have been expected. True, we didnot know whence, or how, or when, the bolt wouldcome. But I think we all expected that somethingstrange would happen. The day of arrival at Varna madeus individually satisfied that things would not be justas we had expected. We only waited to learn where thechange would occur. None the less, however, it was asurprise. I suppose that nature works on such a hope-ful basis that we believe against ourselves that thingswill be as they ought to be, not as we should knowthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon tothe angels, even if it be a will-o’-the-wisp to man. VanHelsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, asthough in remonstrance with the Almighty. But he saidnot a word, and in a few seconds stood up with hisface sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathingheavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in won-der at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened hisbelt with that quick movement which I knew so well.In our old wandering days it meant “action.” Mrs.Chapter 25407"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on herforehead seemed to burn, but she folded her handsmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled, actu-ally smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is with-out hope, but at the same time his action belied hiswords, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt ofthe great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start for Galatz?” said VanHelsing to us generally. “At 6:30 tomorrow morning!” We all started, for theanswer came from Mrs. Harker. “How on earth do you know?” said Art. “You forget, or perhaps you do not know, thoughJonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I amthe train fiend. At home in Exeter I always used tomake up the time tables, so as to be helpful to myhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I alwaysmake a study of the time tables now. I knew that ifanything were to take us to Castle Dracula we shouldgo by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so Ilearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there arenot many to learn, as the only train tomorrow leavesas I say.” “Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor. “Can’t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head, “I fear not. This land isvery different from yours or mine. Even if we did havea special, it would probably not arrive as soon as ourregular train. Moreover, we have something to pre-pare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friendArthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrangethat all be ready for us to go in the morning.

John will stay with Madam Mina and me,and we shall consult. For so if time be long you maybe delayed.

Something is shifting from mein some strange way, and I feel freer than I have beenof late!” The three younger men looked happier at the mo-ment as they seemed to realize the significance of herwords. But Van Helsing and I, turning to each other,met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothingat the time, however. When the three men had gone out to their tasks VanHelsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of thediaries and find him the part of Harker’s journal at theCastle. She went away to get it. When the door was shut upon her he said to me, “Wemean the same! Speak out!” “Here is some change. It is a hope that makes mesick, for it may deceive us.” “Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get themanuscript?” “No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity ofseeing me alone.” “You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I amtaking a great, a terrible, risk. But I believe it is right.In the moment when Madam Mina said those wordsthat arrest both our understanding, an inspiration cameto me. In the trance of three days ago the Count senther his spirit to read her mind. Or more like he tookher to see him in his earth box in the ship with waterrushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.

As she camein, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting toVan Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his facebrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumbhe said, “Friend John, to you with so much experiencealready, and you too, dear Madam Mina, that are young,here is a lesson.

See Iread here what Jonathan have written. “That other of his race who, in a later age, again andagain, brought his forces over The Great River intoTurkey Land, who when he was beaten back, came again,and again, and again, though he had to come alonefrom the bloody field where his troops were beingslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ulti-mately triumph. “What does this tell us?

It is so constant, in all countries and at alltimes, that even police, who know not much from phi-losophy, come to know it empirically, that it is. Thatis to be empiric. The criminal always work at onecrime, that is the true criminal who seems predesti-nate to crime, and who will of none other. This crimi-nal has not full man brain. He is clever and cunningand resourceful, but he be not of man stature as toChapter 25411"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"brain. He be of child brain in much. Now this criminalof ours is predestinate to crime also. He, too, havechild brain, and it is of the child to do what he havedone. The little bird, the little fish, the little animallearn not by principle, but empirically. And when helearn to do, then there is to him the ground to startfrom to do more. ‘Dos pou sto,’ said Archimedes. ‘Giveme a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’ To do once,is the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain.And until he have the purpose to do more, he con-tinue to do the same again every time, just as he havedone before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes areopened, and that to you the lightning flash show allthe leagues, “for Mrs. Harker began to clap her handsand her eyes sparkled. He went on, “Now you shall speak. Tell us two drymen of science what you see with those so bright eyes.”He took her hand and held it whilst he spoke. His fin-ger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought in-stinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke. “The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordauand Lombroso would so classify him, and qua criminalhe is of an imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a diffi-culty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is aclue, and the one page of it that we know, and thatfrom his own lips, tells that once before, when in whatMr. Morris would call a‘tight place,’ he went back tohis own country from the land he had tried to invade,and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himselffor a new effort. He came again better equipped forhis work, and won. So he came to London to invade anew land. He was beaten, and when all hope of successwas lost, and his existence in danger, he fled backover the sea to his home. Just as formerly he had fledback over the Danube from Turkey Land.” “Good, good! Oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. Amoment later he said to me, as calmly as though weChapter 25412"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"had been having a sick room consultation, “Seventy-two only, and in all this excitement. I have hope.” Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation,“But go on. Go on! There is more to tell if you will. Benot afraid. John and I know. I do in any case, and shalltell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!” “I will try to. But you will forgive me if I seem tooegotistical.” “Nay! Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of youthat we think.” “Then, as he is criminal he is selfish. And as his intel-lect is small and his action is based on selfishness, heconfines himself to one purpose. That purpose is re-morseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leavinghis forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent onbeing safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness freesmy soul somewhat from the terrible power which heacquired over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh,I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy!My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour.And all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance ordream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.” The Professor stood up, “He has so used your mind,and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the shipthat carried him rushed through enveloping fog up toGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation forescaping from us. But his child mind only saw so far.And it may be that as ever is in God’s Providence, thevery thing that the evil doer most reckoned on for hisselfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. Thehunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmistsays. For now that he think he is free from every traceof us all, and that he has escaped us with so manyhours to him, then his selfish child brain will whisperhim to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself offfrom knowing your mind, there can be no knowledgeof him to you. There is where he fail! That terriblebaptism of blood which he give you makes you free toChapter 25413"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in yourtimes of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At suchtimes you go by my volition and not by his. And thispower to good of you and others, you have won fromyour suffering at his hands. This is now all more pre-cious that he know it not, and to guard himself haveeven cut himself off from his knowledge of our where.We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that Godis with us through all this blackness, and these manydark hours. We shall follow him, and we shall notflinch. Even if we peril ourselves that we become likehim. Friend John, this has been a great hour, and ithave done much to advance us on our way. You mustbe scribe and write him all down, so that when theothers return from their work you can give it to them,then they shall know as we do.” And so I have written it whilst we wait their return,and Mrs. Harker has written with the typewriter allsince she brought the MS to us.CHAPTER 26DR. SEWARD’S DIARY29 October.—This is written in the train from Varna toGalatz. Last night we all assembled a little before thetime of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well ashe could, so far as thought, and endeavor, and oppor-tunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our jour-ney, and for our work when we get to Galatz. Whenthe usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared her-self for her hypnotic effort, and after a longer andmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than hasbeen usually necessary, she sank into the trance. Usu-ally she speaks on a hint, but this time the Professorhad to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty reso-lutely, before we could learn anything. At last heranswer came.Chapter 26414"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":" “I can see nothing. We are still. There are no waveslapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly run-ning against the hawser. I can hear men’s voices call-ing, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in therowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere, the echo of itseems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead,and ropes and chains are dragged along. What is this?There is a gleam of light. I can feel the air blowingupon me.” Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively,from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both herhands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. VanHelsing and I looked at each other with understand-ing. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and lookedat her intently, whilst Harker’s hand instinctivelyclosed round the hilt of his Kukri. There was a longpause. We all knew that the time when she could speakwas passing, but we felt that it was useless to say any-thing. Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes saidsweetly, “Would none of you like a cup of tea? Youmust all be so tired!” We could only make her happy, and so acqueisced.She bustled off to get tea. When she had gone VanHelsing said, “You see, my friends. He is close to land.He has left his earth chest. But he has yet to get onshore. In the night he may lie hidden somewhere, butif he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do nottouch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case hecan, if it be in the night, change his form and jump orfly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot es-cape. And if he be carried, then the customs men maydiscover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he es-cape not on shore tonight, or before dawn, there willbe the whole day lost to him. We may then arrive intime. For if he escape not at night we shall come onhim in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy. For hedare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he beChapter 26415"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"discovered.” There was no more to be said, so we waited in pa-tience until the dawn, at which time we might learnmore from Mrs. Harker. Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxi-ety, for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stagewas even longer in coming than before, and when itcame the time remaining until full sunrise was so shortthat we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throwhis whole soul into the effort. At last, in obedience tohis will she made reply. “All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, andsome creaking as of wood on wood.” She paused, andthe red sun shot up. We must wait till tonight. And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz inan agony of expectation. We are due to arrive betweentwo and three in the morning. But already, at Bucharest,we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get intill well after sunup. Thus we shall have two more hyp-notic messages from Mrs. Harker! Either or both maypossibly throw more light on what is happening.Later.—Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it cameat a time when there was no distraction. For had itoccurred whilst we were at a station, we might nothave secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs.Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even lessreadily than this morning. I am in fear that her powerof reading the Count’s sensations may die away, justwhen we want it most. It seems to me that her imagi-nation is beginning to work. Whilst she has been inthe trance hitherto she has confined herself to the sim-plest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mis-lead us. If I thought that the Count’s power over herwould die away equally with her power of knowledgeit would be a happy thought. But I am afraid that itmay not be so. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical,Chapter 26416"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"“Something is going out. I can feel it pass me like acold wind. I can hear, far off, confused sounds, as ofmen talking in strange tongues, fierce falling water,and the howling of wolves.” She stopped and a shud-der ran through her, increasing in intensity for a fewseconds, till at the end, she shook as though in a palsy.She said no more, even in answer to the Professor’simperative questioning. When she woke from thetrance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, buther mind was all alert. She could not remember any-thing, but asked what she had said. When she was told,she pondered over it deeply for a long time and insilence.30 October, 7 A.M.—We are near Galatz now, and I maynot have time to write later. Sunrise this morning wasanxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the in-creasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. Theyproduced no effect, however, until the regular time,when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only aminute before the sun rose. The Professor lost no timein his questioning. Her answer came with equal quickness, “All is dark.I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and thecreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There isanother sound, a queer one like... .” She stopped andgrew white, and whiter still. “Go on, go on! Speak, I command you!” said VanHelsing in an agonized voice. At the same time therewas despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was redden-ing even Mrs. Harker’s pale face. She opened her eyes,and we all started as she said, sweetly and seeminglywith the utmost unconcern. “Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know Ican’t?I don’t remember anything.” Then, seeing the lookof amazement on our faces, she said, turning from oneto the other with a troubled look, “What have I said?417Chapter 26"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"What have I done? I know nothing, only that I waslying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak,I command you!’ It seemed so funny to hear you orderme about, as if I were a bad child!” “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, sadly, “it is proof, if proofbe needed, of how I love and honor you, when a wordfor your good, spoken more earnest than ever, canseem so strange because it is to order her whom I amproud to obey!” The whistles are sounding. We are nearing Galatz. Weare on fire with anxiety and eagerness.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL30 October.—Mr. Morris took me to the hotel whereour rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he beingthe one who could best be spared, since he does notspeak any foreign language. The forces were distrib-uted much as they had been at Varna, except that LordGodalming went to the Vice Consul, as his rank mightserve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to theofficial, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and thetwo doctors went to the shipping agent to learn par-ticulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.Later.—Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul isaway, and the Vice Consul sick. So the routine workhas been attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging,and offered to do anything in his power.JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL30 October.—At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr.Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff,the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. They hadreceived a wire from London, in answer to LordGodalming’s telegraphed request, asking them to showus any civility in their power. They were more thanChapter 26418"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"kind and courteous, and took us at once on board theCzarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the riverharbor. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name,who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his lifehe had never had so favorable a run. “Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expectit that we should have to pay for it wi’ some rare pieceo’ ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It’s no cannyto run frae London to the Black Sea wi’ a wind ahintye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’ on yer sailfor his ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer athing. Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a head-land, a fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us, till whenafter it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thingcould we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’ oot bein’ able tosignal. An’ til we came to the Dardanelles and had towait to get our permit to pass, we never were withinhail o’ aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail andbeat about till the fog was lifted. But whiles, I thochtthat if the Deil was minded to get us into the BlackSea quick, he was like to do it whether we would orno. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to ourmiscredit wi’the owners, or no hurt to our traffic, an’the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad bedecently grateful to us for no hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of supersti-tion and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing,who said, “Mine friend, that Devil is more clever thanhe is thought by some, and he know when he meet hismatch!” The skipper was not displeased with the compliment,and went on, “When we got past the Bosphorus themen began to grumble. Some o’ them, the Roumanians,came and asked me to heave overboard a big box whichhad been put on board by a queer lookin’ old man justbefore we had started frae London. I had seen themspeer at the fellow, and put out their two fingers whenthey saw him, to guard them against the evil eye. Man!Chapter 26419"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectlyrideeculous! I sent them aboot their business prettyquick, but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt awee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn’tsay it was again the big box. Well, on we went, and asthe fog didn’t let up for five days I joost let the windcarry us, for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres,well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’t, well,we’d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, wehad a fair way and deep water all the time. And twodays ago, when the mornin’ sun came through the fog,we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right orwrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. Ihad to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a handspike. An’when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head inhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or noevil eye, the property and the trust of my owners werebetter in my hands than in the river Danube. They had,mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in,and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I’d letit lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’talthegither. We didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’had to remain the nicht at anchor. But in the mornin’,braw an’ airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboardwi’ an order, written to him from England, to receive abox marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch thematter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a’reet, an’ gla d I was to be rid o’ the dam’ thing, for Iwas beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil didhave any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’ it wasnane ither than that same!” “What was the name of the man who took it?” askedDr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness. “I’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” he answered, and steppingdown to his cabin, produced a receipt signed“Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse 16 was theaddress. We found out that this was all the CaptainChapter 26420"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"knew, so with thanks we came away. We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of ratherthe Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep,and a fez. His arguments were pointed with specie, wedoing the punctuation, and with a little bargaining hetold us what he knew. This turned out to be simple butimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Villeof London, telling him to receive, if possible beforesunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which wouldarrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he wasto give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealtwith the Slovaks who traded down the river to theport. He had been paid for his work by an Englishbank note, which had been duly cashed for gold atthe Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had cometo him, he had taken him to the ship and handed overthe box, so as to save parterage. That was all he knew.We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to findhim. One of his neighbors, who did not seem to bearhim any affection, said that he had gone away twodays before, no one knew whither. This was corrobo-rated by his landlord, who had received by messengerthe key of the house together with the rent due, inEnglish money. This had been between ten and eleveno’clock last night. We were at a standstill again. Whilst we were talking one came running and breath-lessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had beenfound inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter,and that the throat had been torn open as if by somewild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran offto see the horror, the women crying out. “This is thework of a Slovak!” We hurried away lest we shouldhave been in some way drawn into the affair, and sodetained. As we came home we could arrive at no definite con-clusion. We were all convinced that the box was on itsway, by water, to somewhere, but where that might bewe would have to discover. With heavy hearts we cameChapter 26421"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"home to the hotel to Mina. When we met together, the first thing was to consultas to taking Mina again into our confidence.

It is all done. Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he musthave suffered, what he must be suffering now. He lieson the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his wholebody appears in collapse. His brows are knit. His faceis drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking,and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concen-tration of his thoughts. Oh! if I could only help at all.I shall do what I can. I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me allthe papers that I have not yet seen. Whilst they areresting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I mayarrive at some conclusion. I shall try to follow theProfessor’s example, and think without prejudice onthe facts before me... . I do believe that under God’s providence I have madea discovery. I shall get the maps and look over them. I am more than ever sure that I am right.

This is evi-dent. For had he power to move himself as he wishedhe could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in someother way. He evidently fears discovery or interfer-ence, in the state of helplessness in which he must be,confined as he is between dawn and sunset in hiswooden box.(b) How is he to be taken?—Here a process of exclu-sions may help us. By road, by rail, by water?1. By Road.—There are endless difficulties, especiallyin leaving the city.(x) There are people. And people are curious, and in-vestigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what mightbe in the box, would destroy him.(y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroiofficers to pass.(z) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear.And in order to prevent his being betrayed he has re-pelled, so far as he can, even his victim, me!2. By Rail.—There is no one in charge of the box. Itwould have to take its chance of being delayed, anddelay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True,he might escape at night. But what would he be, if leftin a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to?This is not what he intends, and he does not mean torisk it.3. By Water.—Here is the safest way, in one respect,but with most danger in another. On the water he ispowerless except at night. Even then he can only sum-Chapter 26423"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"mon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But werehe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, help-less, and he would indeed be lost. He could have thevessel drive to land, but if it were unfriendly land,wherein he was not free to move, his position wouldstill be desperate. We know from the record that he was on the water,so what we have to do is to ascertain what water. The first thing is to realize exactly what he has doneas yet. We may, then, get a light on what his task is tobe.Firstly.—We must differentiate between what he didin London as part of his general plan of action, whenhe was pressed for moments and had to arrange as besthe could. Secondly we must see, as well as we can surmise itfrom the facts we know of, what he has done here. As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive atGalatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest weshould ascertain his means of exit from England. Hisimmediate and sole purpose then was to escape. Theproof of this, is the letter of instructions sent toImmanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the boxbefore sunrise. There is also the instruction to PetrofSkinsky. These we must only guess at, but there musthave been some letter or message, since Skinsky cameto Hildesheim. That, so far, his plans were successful we know. TheCzarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick jour-ney. So much so that Captain Donelson’s suspicions werearoused. But his superstition united with his canni-ness played the Count’s game for him, and he ran withhis favoring wind through fogs and all till he broughtup blindfold at Galatz. That the Count’s arrangementswere well made, has been proved. Hildesheim clearedthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinskytook it, and here we lose the trail. We only know thatChapter 26424"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"the box is somewhere on the water, moving along. Thecustoms and the octroi, if there be any, have beenavoided. Now we come to what the Count must have done af-ter his arrival, on land, at Galatz. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sun-rise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, weask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as deal-ing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to theport. And the man’s remark, that the murder was thework of a Slovak, showed the general feeling againsthis class. The Count wanted isolation. My surmise is this, that in London the Count decidedto get back to his castle by water, as the most safe andsecret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany,and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovakswho took the boxes to Varna, for there they wereshipped to London. Thus the Count had knowledge ofthe persons who could arrange this service. When thebox was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, hecame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructedhim what to do as to arranging the carriage of the boxup some river. When this was done, and he knew thatall was in train, he blotted out his traces, as hethought, by murdering his agent. I have examined the map and find that the river mostsuitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either thePruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that inmy trance I heard cows low and water swirling levelwith my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count inhis box, then, was on a river in an open boat, pro-pelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banksare near and it is working against stream. There wouldbe no such if floating down stream. Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth,but we may possibly investigate further. Now of thesetwo, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but theChapter 26425"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runsup round the Borgo Pass.

The others kept shaking me byboth hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said, “Our dear MadamMina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have beenwhere we were blinded. Now we are on the track onceagain, and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is athis most helpless. And if we can come on him by day,on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, buthe is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this boxlest those who carry him may suspect. For them tosuspect would be to prompt them to throw him in thestream where he perish. This he knows, and will not.Now men, to our Council of War, for here and now, wemust plan what each and all shall do.” “I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” saidLord Godalming. “And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chancehe land,” said Mr. Morris. “Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neithermust go alone. There must be force to overcome forceif need be. The Slovak is strong and rough, and hecarries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongstthem they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris, “I have brought some Winchesters.They are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may bewolves. The Count, if you remember, took some otherprecautions. He made some requisitions on others thatMrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand. Wemust be ready at all points.” Dr. Seward said, “I think I had better go with Quincey.We have been accustomed to hunt together, and weChapter 26426"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"two, well armed, will be a match for whatever maycome along. You must not be alone, Art. It may benecessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust,for I don’t suppose these fellows carry guns, wouldundo all our plans. There must be no chances, thistime. We shall not rest until the Count’s head and bodyhave been separated, and we are sure that he cannotreincarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathanlooked at me. I could see that the poor dear was tornabout in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me.But then the boat service would, most likely, be theone which would destroy the... the... Vampire. (Whydid I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. VanHelsing spoke, “Friend Jonathan, this is to you fortwice reasons. First, because you are young and braveand can fight, and all energies may be needed at thelast. And again that it is your right to destroy him.That, which has wrought such woe to you and yours.Be not afraid for Madam Mina. She will be my care, if Imay. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as once.And I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as needbe, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be ofother service. I can fight in other way. And I can die,if need be, as well as younger men. Now let me saythat what I would is this. While you, my LordGodalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swiftlittle steamboat up the river, and whilst John andQuincey guard the bank where perchance he might belanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart ofthe enemy’s country. Whilst the old fox is tied in hisbox, floating on the running stream whence he cannotescape to land, where he dares not raise the lid of hiscoffin box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leavehim to perish, we shall go in the track where Jonathanwent, from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our wayto the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina’s hypnoticChapter 26427"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"power will surely help, and we shall find our way, alldark and unknown otherwise, after the first sunrisewhen we are near that fateful place. There is much tobe done, and other places to be made sanctify, so thatthat nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly, “Do you meanto say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bringMina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with thatdevil’s illness, right into the jaws of his deathtrap?Not for the world! Not for Heaven or Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and thenwent on, “Do you know what the place is? Have youseen that awful den of hellish infamy, with the verymoonlight alive with grisly shapes, and ever speck ofdust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster inembryo? Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon yourthroat?” Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my fore-head he threw up his arms with a cry, “Oh, my God,what have we done to have this terror upon us?” andhe sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he spoke in clear, sweettones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed usall. “Oh, my friend, it is because I would save MadamMina from that awful place that I would go. God forbidthat I should take her into that place. There is work,wild work, to be done before that place can be purify.Remember that we are in terrible straits. If the Countescape us this time, and he is strong and subtle andcunning, he may choose to sleep him for a century,and then in time our dear one,” he took my hand,“would come to him to keep him company, and wouldbe as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You havetold us of their gloating lips. You heard their ribaldlaugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Countthrew to them. You shudder, and well may it be. For-give me that I make you so much pain, but it is neces-Chapter 26428"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"sary. My friend, is it not a dire need for that which Iam giving, possibly my life? If it, were that any onewent into that place to stay, it is I who would have togo to keep them company.” “Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shookhim all over, “we are in the hands of God!”Later.—Oh, it did me good to see the way that thesebrave men worked. How can women help loving menwhen they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave!And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power ofmoney! What can it not do when basely used. I felt sothankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and both he andMr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willingto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our littleexpedition could not start, either so promptly or sowell equipped, as it will within another hour. It is notthree hours since it was arranged what part each of uswas to do. And now Lord Godalming and Jonathan havea lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start ata moment’s notice. Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have halfa dozen good horses, well appointed. We have all themaps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40train tonight for Veresti, where we are to get a car-riage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are bringing agood deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriageand horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have noone whom we can trust in the matter. The Professorknows something of a great many languages, so weshall get on all right. We have all got arms, even forme a large bore revolver. Jonathan would not be happyunless I was armed like the rest. Alas! I cannot carryone arm that the rest do, the scar on my foreheadforbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by tell-ing me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves.The weather is getting colder every hour, and thereare snow flurries which come and go as warnings.Chapter 26429"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Later.—It took all my courage to say goodby to mydarling. We may never meet again. Courage, Mina! TheProfessor is looking at you keenly. His look is a warn-ing. There must be no tears now, unless it may be thatGod will let them fall in gladness.JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL30 October, night.—I am writing this in the light fromthe furnace door of the steam launch. Lord Godalmingis firing up. He is an experienced hand at the work, ashe has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames,and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our plans,we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, andthat if any waterway was chosen for the Count’s escapeback to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza atits junction, would be the one. We took it, that some-where about the 47th degree, north latitude, wouldbe the place chosen for crossing the country betweenthe river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in run-ning at good speed up the river at night. There is plentyof water, and the banks are wide enough apart to makesteaming, even in the dark, easy enough. LordGodalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enoughfor the present for one to be on watch. But I cannotsleep, how can I with the terrible danger hanging overmy darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.Only for that faith it would be easier to die than tolive, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr. Morris andDr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started.They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off toget on higher lands where they can see a good stretchof river and avoid the following of its curves. Theyhave, for the first stages, two men to ride and leadtheir spare horses, four in all, so as not to excite curi-osity. When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly,they shall themselves look after the horses. It may beChapter 26430"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"necessary for us to join forces. If so they can mountour whole party. One of the saddles has a moveablehorn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required. It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we arerushing along through the darkness, with the cold fromthe river seeming to rise up and strike us, with all themysterious voices of the night around us, it all comeshome. We seem to be drifting into unknown placesand unknown ways. Into a whole world of dark anddreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnacedoor... .31 October.—Still hurrying along. The day has come,and Godalming is sleeping. I am on watch. The morn-ing is bitterly cold, the furnace heat is grateful, thoughwe have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only afew open boats, but none of them had on board anybox or package of anything like the size of the one weseek. The men were scared every time we turned ourelectric lamp on them, and fell on their knees andprayed.1 November, evening.—No news all day. We have foundnothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed intothe Bistritza, and if we are wrong in our surmise ourchance is gone. We have overhauled every boat, bigand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for aGovernment boat, and treated us accordingly. We sawin this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, wherethe Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanianflag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boatwhich we have overhauled since then this trick hassucceeded. We have had every deference shown to us,and not once any objection to whatever we chose toask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boatpassed them, going at more than usual speed as shehad a double crew on board. This was before they cameto Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boatChapter 26431"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth.At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so shemust have passed there in the night. I am feeling verysleepy. The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me,and nature must have rest some time. Godalming in-sists that he shall keep the first watch. God bless himfor all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.2 November, morning.—It is broad daylight. That goodfellow would not wake me. He says it would have beena sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting mytrouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have sleptso long, and let him watch all night, but he was quiteright. I am a new man this morning. And, as I sit hereand watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessaryboth as to minding the engine, steering, and keepingwatch. I can feel that my strength and energy are com-ing back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and VanHelsing. They should have got to Veresti about noonon Wednesday. It would take them some time to getthe carriage and horses. So if they had started andtravelled hard, they would be about now at the BorgoPass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to thinkwhat may happen. If we could only go faster. But wecannot. The engines are throbbing and doing their ut-most. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are get-ting on. There seem to be endless streams running downthe mountains into this river, but as none of them arevery large, at present, at all events, though they aredoubtless terrible in winter and when the snow melts,the horsemen may not have met much obstruction. Ihope that before we get to Strasba we may see them.For if by that time we have not overtaken the Count,it may be necessary to take counsel together what todo next.Chapter 26432"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"DR. SEWARD’S DIARY2 November.—Three days on the road. No news, andno time to write it if there had been, for every mo-ment is precious. We have had only the rest needfulfor the horses. But we are both bearing it wonder-fully. Those adventurous days of ours are turning upuseful. We must push on. We shall never feel happy tillwe get the launch in sight again.3 Novenber.—We heard at Fundu that the launch hadgone up the Bistritza. I wish it wasn’t so cold. Thereare signs of snow coming. And if it falls heavy it willstop us. In such case we must get a sledge and go on,Russian fashion.4 Novenber.—Today we heard of the launch having beendetained by an accident when trying to force a way upthe rapids. The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid ofa rope and steering with knowledge. Some went uponly a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fit-ter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launchin trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with localhelp, and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that theboat is not any better for the accident, the peasantrytell us that after she got upon smooth water again,she kept stopping every now and again so long as shewas in sight. We must push on harder than ever. Ourhelp may be wanted soon.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL31 October.—Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professortells me that this morning at dawn he could hardlyhypnotize me at all, and that all I could say was, “darkand quiet.” He is off now buying a carriage and horses.He says that he will later on try to buy additionalChapter 26433"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"horses, so that we may be able to change them on theway. We have something more than 70 miles before us.The country is lovely, and most interesting. If only wewere under different conditions, how delightful itwould be to see it all. If Jonathan and I were drivingthrough it alone what a pleasure it would be. To stopand see people, and learn something of their life, andto fill our minds and memories with all the color andpicturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful countryand the quaint people! But, alas!Later.—Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got thecarriage and horses. We are to have some dinner, andto start in an hour. The landlady is putting us up ahuge basket of provisions. It seems enough for a com-pany of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, andwhispers to me that it may be a week before we canget any food again. He has been shopping too, and hassent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps,and all sorts of warm things. There will not be anychance of our being cold. We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what mayhappen to us. We are truly in the hands of God. Healone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all thestrength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watchover my beloved husband. That whatever may happen,Jonathan may know that I loved him and honored himmore than I can say, and that my latest and truestthought will be always for him.CHAPTER 27MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL1 November.—All day long we have travelled, and at agood speed. The horses seem to know that they arebeing kindly treated, for they go willingly their fullChapter 27434"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"stage at best speed. We have now had so many changesand find the same thing so constantly that we are en-couraged to think that the journey will be an easyone. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he tells the farmersthat he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well tomake the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or cof-fee, or tea, and off we go. It is a lovely country. Full ofbeauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people arebrave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nicequalities. They are very, very superstitious. In the firsthouse where we stopped, when the woman who servedus saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herselfand put out two fingers towards me, to keep off theevil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of puttingan extra amount of garlic into our food, and I can’tabide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not totake off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their sus-picions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no driverwith us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal. But Idaresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard be-hind us all the way. The Professor seems tireless. Allday he would not take any rest, though he made mesleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotizedme, and he says I answered as usual, “darkness, lap-ping water and creaking wood.” So our enemy is stillon the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, butsomehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. Iwrite this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horsesto be ready. Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, helooks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is setas firmly as a conqueror’s. Even in his sleep he is in-tense with resolution. When we have well started Imust make him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him thatwe have days before us, and he must not break downwhen most of all his strength will be needed... . All isready. We are off shortly.2 November, morning.—I was successful, and we tookChapter 27435"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"turns driving all night. Now the day is on us, brightthough cold. There is a strange heaviness in the air. Isay heaviness for want of a better word. I mean that itoppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warmfurs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypno-tized me. He says I answered “darkness, creaking woodand roaring water,” so the river is changing as theyascend. I do hope that my darling will not run anychance of danger, more than need be, but we are inGod’s hands.2 November, night.—All day long driving. The coun-try gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of theCarpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from usand so low on the horizon, now seem to gather roundus and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits. Ithink we make an effort each to cheer the other, inthe doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing saysthat by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. Thehouses are very few here now, and the Professor saysthat the last horse we got will have to go on with us,as we may not be able to change. He got two in addi-tion to the two we changed, so that now we have arude four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient andgood, and they give us no trouble. We are not worriedwith other travellers, and so even I can drive. We shallget to the Pass in daylight. We do not want to arrivebefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest inturn. Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us? We go toseek the place where my poor darling suffered so much.God grant that we may be guided aright, and that Hewill deign to watch over my husband and those dearto us both, and who are in such deadly peril.

D., of Purefleet, London, in case I may notsee him. It may explain. It is morning, and I write bya fire which all the night I have kept alive, MadamMina aiding me. It is cold, cold. So cold that the greyheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settlefor all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it.It seems to have affected Madam Mina. She has been soheavy of head all day that she was not like herself.She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual soalert, have done literally nothing all the day. She evenhave lost her appetite. She make no entry into herlittle diary, she who write so faithful at every pause.Something whisper to me that all is not well. How-ever, tonight she is more vif. Her long sleep all dayhave refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweetand bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotize her,but alas! with no effect. The power has grown less andless with each day, and tonight it fail me altogether.Well, God’s will be done, whatever it may be, andwhithersoever it may lead! Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write notin her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fash-ion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded. We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterdaymorning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got readyfor the hypnotism. We stopped our carriage, and gotdown so that there might be no disturbance. I made acouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yieldherself as usual, but more slow and more short timethan ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As before, came theanswer, “darkness and the swirling of water.” Then shewoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way andsoon reach the Pass. At this time and place, she be-come all on fire with zeal. Some new guiding power bein her manifested, for she point to a road and say,Chapter 27437"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"“This is the way.” “How know you it?” I ask. “Of course I know it,’ she answer, and with a pause,add, “Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote ofhis travel?” At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see thatthere be only one such byroad. It is used but little,and very different from the coach road from theBukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard,and more of use. So we came down this road. When we meet otherways, not always were we sure that they were roads atall, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen, thehorses know and they only. I give rein to them, andthey go on so patient. By and by we find all the thingswhich Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary ofhim. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. Atthe first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep. She try, and shesucceed. She sleep all the time, till at the last, I feelmyself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her. For Iknow that she have suffer much, and sleep at times beall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all ofsudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something.I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, andthe good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I lookdown and find Madam Mina still asleep. It is now notfar off sunset time, and over the snow the light of thesun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw greatlong shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. Forwe are going up, and up, and all is oh, so wild androcky, as though it were the end of the world. Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake withnot much trouble, and then I try to put her to hyp-notic sleep. But she sleep not, being as though I werenot. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her andmyself in dark, so I look round, and find that the sunChapter 27438"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"have gone down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn andlook at her. She is now quite awake, and look so wellas I never saw her since that night at Carfax when wefirst enter the Count’s house. I am amaze, and not atease then. But she is so bright and tender and thought-ful for me that I forget all fear. I light a fire, for wehave brought supply of wood with us, and she preparefood while I undo the horses and set them, tethered inshelter, to feed. Then when I return to the fire shehave my supper ready. I go to help her, but she smile,and tell me that she have eat already. That she was sohungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and Ihave grave doubts. But I fear to affright her, and so Iam silent of it. She help me and I eat alone, and thenwe wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her tosleep while I watch. But presently I forget all of watch-ing. And when I sudden remember that I watch, I findher lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with sobright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur, and Iget much sleep till before morning. When I wake I tryto hypnotize her, but alas! Though she shut her eyesobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up,and up, and then sleep come to her too late, but soheavy that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, andplace her sleeping in the carriage when I have har-nessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep,and she look in her sleep more healthy and more red-der than before. And I like it not. And I am afraid,afraid, afraid! I am afraid of all things, even to thinkbut I must go on my way. The stake we play for is lifeand death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.5 November, morning.—Let me be accurate in every-thing, for though you and I have seen some strangethings together, you may at the first think that I, VanHelsing, am mad. That the many horrors and the solong strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain. All yesterday we travel, always getting closer to themountains, and moving into a more and more wildChapter 27439"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"and desert land. There are great, frowning precipicesand much falling water, and Nature seem to have heldsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep.And though I did have hunger and appeased it, I couldnot waken her, even for food. I began to fear that thefatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she iswith that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I to myself,“if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be thatI do not sleep at night.” As we travel on the roughroad, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind therewas, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed,and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun lowdown. But all was indeed changed. The frowning moun-tains seemed further away, and we were near the topof a steep rising hill, on summit of which was such acastle as Jonathan tell of in his diary. At once I ex-ulted and feared. For now, for good or ill, the end wasnear. I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotizeher, but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere thegreat dark came upon us, for even after down sun theheavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and allwas for a time in a great twilight. I took out the horsesand fed them in what shelter I could. Then I make afire, and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake andmore charming than ever, sit comfortable amid herrugs. I got ready food, but she would not eat, simplysaying that she had not hunger. I did not press her,knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for Imust needs now be strong for all. Then, with the fearon me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for hercomfort, round where Madam Mina sat. And over thering I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine sothat all was well guarded. She sat still all the time, sostill as one dead. And she grew whiter and even whitertill the snow was not more pale, and no word she said.But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I couldChapter 27440"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"know that the poor soul shook her from head to feetwith a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown morequiet, “Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wishedto make a test of what she could. She rose obedient,but when she have made a step she stopped, and stoodas one stricken. “Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, andcoming back, sat down in her place. Then, looking atme with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, shesaid simply, “I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced,for I knew that what she could not, none of those thatwe dreaded could. Though there might be danger toher body, yet her soul was safe! Presently the horses began to scream, and tore attheir tethers till I came to them and quieted them.When they did feel my hands on them, they whinniedlow as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quietfor a time. Many times through the night did I cometo them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all natureis at lowest, and every time my coming was with quietof them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and Iwas about stepping forth to replenish it, for now thesnow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, asthere ever is over snow, and it seemed as though thesnow flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as ofwomen with trailing garments. All was in dead, grimsilence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, asif in terror of the worst. I began to fear, horrible fears.But then came to me the sense of safety in that ringwherein I stood. I began too, to think that myimaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and theunrest that I have gone through, and all the terribleanxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan’shorrid experience were befooling me. For the snowflakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round,till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of thoseChapter 27441"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"women that would have kissed him. And then the horsescowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as mendo in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them,so that they could break away. I feared for my dearMadam Mina when these weird figures drew near andcircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, andsmiled at me. When I would have stepped to the fire toreplenish it, she caught me and held me back, andwhispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, solow it was. “No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, “Butyou? It is for you that I fear!” Whereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, andsaid, “Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in allthe world from them than I am,” and as I wondered atthe meaning of her words, a puff of wind made theflame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned,for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer,but keeping ever without the Holy circle. Then theybegan to materialize till, if God have not taken awaymy reason, for I saw it through my eyes. There werebefore me in actual flesh the same three women thatJonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissedhis throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the brighthard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy color, the vo-luptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear MadamMina. And as their laugh came through the silence ofthe night, they twined their arms and pointed to her,and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathansaid were of the intolerable sweetness of the waterglasses, “Come, sister. Come to us. Come!” In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and myheart with gladness leapt like flame. For oh! the ter-ror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told astory to my heart that was all of hope. God be thankedshe was not, yet of them. I seized some of the fire-Chapter 27442"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"wood which was by me, and holding out some of theWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drewback before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. Ifed the fire, and feared them not. For I knew that wewere safe within the ring, which she could not leaveno more than they could enter. The horses had ceasedto moan, and lay still on the ground. The snow fell onthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that therewas for the poor beasts no more of terror. And so we remained till the red of the dawn began tofall through the snow gloom. I was desolate and afraid,and full of woe and terror. But when that beautifulsun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figuresmelted in the whirling mist and snow. The wreaths oftransparent gloom moved away towards the castle, andwere lost. Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned toMadam Mina, intending to hypnotize her. But she layin a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could notwake her. I tried to hypnotize through her sleep, butshe made no response, none at all, and the day broke.I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have seen thehorses, they are all dead. Today I have much to dohere, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high. Forthere may be places where I must go, where that sun-light, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to mea safety. I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I willdo my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps, and Godbe thanked! She is calm in her sleep... .JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL4 November, evening.—The accident to the launch hasbeen a terrible thing for us.

Thank Godfor that mercy at all events, though the proving it hasbeen dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping withinthe Holy circle, I took my way to the castle. The black-smith hammer which I took in the carriage from Verestiwas useful, though the doors were all open I brokethem off the rusty hinges, lest some ill intent or illchance should close them, so that being entered I mightnot get out. Jonathan’s bitter experience served mehere. By memory of his diary I found my way to theold chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The airwas oppressive. It seemed as if there was some sul-phurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. EitherChapter 27444"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off thehowl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear MadamMina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had mebetween his horns. Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but leftsafe from the Vampire in that Holy circle. And yet eventhere would be the wolf! I resolve me that my worklay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, ifit were God’s will. At any rate it was only death andfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it butbeen for myself the choice had been easy, the maw ofthe wolf were better to rest in than the grave of theVampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work. I knew that there were at least three graves to find,graves that are inhabit. So I search, and search, and Ifind one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so fullof life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as thoughI have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in theold time, when such things were, many a man who setforth to do such a task as mine, found at the last hisheart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, anddelay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascina-tion of the wanton Undead have hypnotize him. Andhe remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vam-pire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fairwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouthpresent to a kiss, and the man is weak. And there re-main one more victim in the Vampire fold. One moreto swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Undead!... There is some fascination, surely, when I am movedby the mere presence of such an one, even lying as shelay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dustof centuries, though there be that horrid odor such asthe lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved. I,Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motivefor hate. I was moved to a yearning for delay whichseemed to paralyze my faculties and to clog my verysoul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep,Chapter 27445"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"and the strange oppression of the air were beginningto overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing intosleep, the open eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweetfascination, when there came through the snow stilledair a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that itwoke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was thevoice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard. Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, andfound by wrenching away tomb tops one other of thesisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to lookon her as I had on her sister, lest once more I shouldbegin to be enthrall. But I go on searching until, pres-ently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to onemuch beloved that other fair sister which, likeJonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atomsof the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantlybeautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very in-stinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex tolove and to protect one of hers, made my head whirlwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul wailof my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears.And, before the spell could be wrought further uponme, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this timeI had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as Icould tell. And as there had been only three of theseUndead phantoms around us in the night, I took itthat there were no more of active Undead existent.There was one great tomb more lordly than all therest. Huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it wasbut one word.DRACULAThis then was the Undead home of the King Vampire,to whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spokeeloquent to make certain what I knew.

Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had itbeen but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three!To begin twice more after I had been through a deed ofhorror. For it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy,what would it not be with these strange ones who hadsurvived through centuries, and who had beenstrenghtened by the passing of the years. Who would,if they could, have fought for their foul lives... . Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work. Had Inot been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of theliving over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could nothave gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, thoughtill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand.Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and thegladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolu-tion came, as realization that the soul had been won,I could not have gone further with my butchery. I couldnot have endured the horrid screeching as the stakedrove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lipsof bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and leftmy work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, Ican pity them now and weep, as I think of them placideach in her full sleep of death for a short moment erefading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severedthe head of each, before the whole body began to meltaway and crumble into its native dust, as though thedeath that should have come centuries agone had atlast assert himself and say at once and loud, “I amhere!” Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances thatnever more can the Count enter there Undead. When I stepped into the circle where Madam Minaslept, she woke from her sleep and, seeing me, criedout in pain that I had endured too much. “Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place!Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, comingtowards us.” She was looking thin and pale and weak.Chapter 27447"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"But her eyes were pure and glowed with fervor. I wasglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mindwas full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep. And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, wego eastward to meet our friends, and him, whom MadamMina tell me that she know are coming to meet us.MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL6 November.—It was late in the afternoon when theProfessor and I took our way towards the east whenceI knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast,though the way was steeply downhill, for w e had totake heavy rugs and wraps with us. We dared not facethe possibility of being left without warmth in thecold and the snow. We had to take some of our provi-sions too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and sofar as we could see through the snowfall, there wasnot even the sign of habitation. When we had goneabout a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking andsat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw wherethe clear line of Dracula’s castle cut the sky. For wewere so deep under the hill whereon it was set thatthe angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountainswas far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, percheda thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice,and with seemingly a great gap between it and thesteep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There wassomething wild and uncanny about the place. We couldhear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off,but the sound, even though coming muffled throughthe deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew fromthe way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that hewas trying to seek some strategic point, where we wouldbe less exposed in case of attack. The rough roadwaystill led downwards. We could trace it through thedrifted snow. In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so IChapter 27448"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot,a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrancelike a doorway between two boulders. He took me bythe hand and drew me in. “See!” he said, “here you will be in shelter. And ifthe wolves do come I can meet them one by one.” He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me,and got out some provisions and forced them uponme. But I could not eat, to even try to do so was re-pulsive to me, and much as I would have liked to pleasehim, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He lookedvery sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his fieldglasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock,and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out, “Look! Madam Mina, look!Look!” I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock. Hehanded me his glasses and pointed. The snow was nowfalling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for ahigh wind was beginning to blow. However, there weretimes when there were pauses between the snow flur-ries and I could see a long way round. From the heightwhere we were it was possible to see a great distance.And far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I couldsee the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks andcurls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us andnot far off, in fact so near that I wondered we had notnoticed before, came a group of mounted men hurry-ing along. In the midst of them was a cart, a longleiter wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog’stail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road.Outlined against the snow as they were, I could seefrom the men’s clothes that they were peasants or gyp-sies of some kind. On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leapedas I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. Theevening was now drawing close, and well I knew thatat sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisonedChapter 27449"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"there, would take new freedom and could in any ofmany forms elude pursuit. In fear I turned to the Pro-fessor. To my consternation, however, he was not there.An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rockhe had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter inlast night. When he had completed it he stood beside me againsaying, “At least you shall be safe here from him!” Hetook the glasses from me, and at the next lull of thesnow swept the whole space below us. “See,” he said,“they come quickly. They are flogging the horses,and galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in a hollow voice, “They areracing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’s willbe done!” Down came another blinding rush of drivingsnow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soonpassed, however, and once more his glasses were fixedon the plain. Then came a sudden cry, “Look! Look! Look! See,two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south.It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look be-fore the snow blots it all out!” I took it and looked.The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris. Iknew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off.Looking around I saw on the north side of the comingparty two other men, riding at breakneck speed. Oneof them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, ofcourse, to be Lord Godalming. They too, were pursu-ing the party with the cart. When I told the Professorhe shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and after lookingintently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laidhis Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulderat the opening of our shelter. “They are all converging,” he said.”When the timecomes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” I got outmy revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speak-ing the howling of wolves came louder and closer.Chapter 27450"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavyflakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining moreand more brightly as it sank down towards the farmountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I couldsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos andthrees and larger numbers. The wolves were gatheringfor their prey. Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. Thewind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was drivenwith fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. Attimes we could not see an arm’s length before us. Butat others, as the hollow sounding wind swept by us, itseemed to clear the air space around us so that wecould see afar off. We had of late been so accustomedto watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew withfair accuracy when it would be. And we knew thatbefore long the sun would set. It was hard to believethat by our watches it was less than an hour that wewaited in that rocky shelter before the various bodiesbegan to converge close upon us. The wind came nowwith fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadilyfrom the north. It seemingly had driven the snow cloudsfrom us, for with only occasional bursts, the snow fell.We could distinguish clearly the individuals of eachparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enoughthose pursued did not seem to realize, or at least tocare, that they were pursued. They seemed, however,to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun droppedlower and lower on the mountain tops. Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and Icrouched down behind our rock, and held our weap-ons ready. I could see that he was determined thatthey should not pass. One and all were quite unawareof our presence. All at once two voices shouted out to, “Halt!” Onewas my Jonathan’s, raised in a high key of passion.The other Mr. Morris’ strong resolute tone of quiet com-Chapter 27451"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"mand. The gypsies may not have known the language,but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tonguethe words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in,and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashedup at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on theother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid lookingfellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved themback, and in a fierce voice gave to his companionssome word to proceed. They lashed the horses whichsprang forward. But the four men raised their Win-chester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commandedthem to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing andI rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons atthem. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tight-ened their reins and drew up. The leader turned tothem and gave a word at which every man of the gypsyparty drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol,and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joinedin an instant. The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threwhis horse out in front, and pointed first to the sun,now close down on the hill tops, and then to the castle,said something which I did not understand. For an-swer, all four men of our party threw themselves fromtheir horses and dashed towards the cart. I should havefelt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger,but that the ardor of battle must have been upon meas well as the rest of them. I felt no fear, but only awild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quickmovement of our parties, the leader of the gypsiesgave a command. His men instantly formed round thecart in a sort of undisciplined endeavor, each one shoul-dering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carryout the order. In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on oneside of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other,were forcing a way to the cart. It was evident thatthey were bent on finishing their task before the sunChapter 27452"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinderthem. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashingknives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of thewolves behind, appeared to even attract their atten-tion. Jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest single-ness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in frontof him. Instinctively they cowered aside and let himpass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, andwith a strength which seemed incredible, raised thegreat box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground.In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force topass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All thetime I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperatelyforward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flashas he won a way through them, and they cut at him.He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at firstI thought that he too had come through in safety. Butas he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumpedfrom the cart, I could see that with his left hand hewas clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurt-ing through his fingers. He did not delay notwith-standing this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy,attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize offthe lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the otherfrantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of bothmen the lid began to yield. The nails drew with ascreeching sound, and the top of the box was thrownback. By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves coveredby the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalmingand Dr. Seward, had given in and made no further re-sistance. The sun was almost down on the mountaintops, and the shadows of the whole group fell uponthe snow. I saw the Count lying within the box uponthe earth, some of which the rude falling from thecart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, justlike a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with theChapter 27453"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"horrible vindictive look which I knew so well. As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and thelook of hate in them turned to triumph. But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash ofJonathan’s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shearthrough the throat. Whilst at the same moment Mr.Morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart. It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, andalmost in the drawing of a breath, the whole bodycrumbled into dust and passed from our sight. I shall be glad as long as I live that even in thatmoment of final dissolution, there was in the face alook of peace, such as I never could have imaginedmight have rested there. The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the redsky, and every stone of its broken battlements wasarticulated against the light of the setting sun. The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause ofthe extraordinary disappearance of the dead man,turned, without a word, and rode away as if for theirlives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon theleiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desertthem. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe dis-tance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone. Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned onhis elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side. Theblood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him,for the Holy circle did not now keep me back, so didthe two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and thewounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. Witha sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that ofhis own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in myface, for he smiled at me and said, “I am only toohappy to have been of service! Oh, God!” he cried sud-denly, struggling to a sitting posture and pointing tome. “It was worth for this to die! Look! Look!” The sun was now right down upon the mountain top,Chapter 27454"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it wasbathed in rosy light. With one impulse the men sankon their knees and a deep and earnest “Amen” brokefrom all as their eyes followed the pointing of his fin-ger. The dying man spoke, “Now God be thanked that allhas not been in vain! See! The snow is not more stain-less than her forehead! The curse has passed away!” And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence,he died, a gallant gentleman.NOTE Seven years ago we all went through the flames. Andthe happiness of some of us since then is, we think,well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy toMina and to me that our boy’s birthday is the sameday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His motherholds, I know, the secret belief that some of our bravefriend’s spirit has passed into him. His bundle of nameslinks all our little band of men together. But we callhim Quincey. In the summer of this year we made a journey toTransylvania, and went over the old ground which was,and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories. Itwas almost impossible to believe that the things whichwe had seen with our own eyes and heard with ourown ears were living truths. Every trace of all that hadbeen was blotted out. The castle stood as before, rearedhigh above a waste of desolation. When we got home we were talking of the old time,which we could all look back on without despair, forGodalming and Seward are both happily married. I tookthe papers from the safe where they had been eversince our return so long ago. We were struck with thefact, that in all the mass of material of which the recordis composed, there is hardly one authentic document.Nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the laterChapter 27455"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and VanHelsing’s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one,even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of sowild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said,with our boy on his knee. “We want no proofs. We ask none to believe us! Thisboy will some day know what a brave and gallantwoman his mother is. Already he knows her sweetnessand loving care. Later on he will understand how somemen so loved her,that they did dare much for her sake.JONATHAN HARKERChapter 27456For more great literature inPortable Document File format,be sure to visit our Web site again:http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/jimspdf.htm"}]
