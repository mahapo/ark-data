Being a priestess clearly means I ama woman priest. Being a magician and also a woman is less obvious. It's hard tofind a teacher who can talk to a woman magician. I often feel treated as I am“other,” “outside,” struggling to read myself into the role.Lon Milo DuQuette never makes me feel like that. I've always had the sense thathe is talking directly to me, inviting me into the fascinating world of magic.His primary purpose as a teacher and a writer is not to display his knowledge(which is broad and deep) or his magical accomplishments (which are magnificent)but to open the door so that we can share that knowledge and have thoseexperiences. He centers not on his own needs as teacher but on the needs of thestudent. He shares his knowledge without fuss, laying out study plans that don'tskip steps or hold back secrets but instead make practice possible. His magic isnot for himself only; he practices in order to share. As a writer, a teacher,and a magician, he is generous.His great genius is to make magic accessible. The esoteric arts have built upover the centuries into bewildering layers of ideas and systems. The texts, whenthey are in English at all, are often written in an older form of the language.Just translating antique ideas into contemporary English is a service in itself.For example, with all deference to the prophet Aleister Crowley, his prose is asdense as Shakespeare. It needs an introduction, an explanation of the obscurephrases, a translator. Lon Milo DuQuette provides that translation.This book is a collection of introductions and prefaces to books. In thesepages, Enochian language, tarot, Qabbalah, geomancy, all seem like keys tounderstanding the universe and ourselves. It's clear these studies and practiceshave changed Lon's life and his delight shines on every page. Reading the booksin this list would constitute a mighty magical education.Lon excels at introducing other magicians. He is equally at home with long-deadmasters of antiquity and the newest generation of innovators. He has known themost influential magickians of his lifetime and tells us he is profoundlygrateful to the people who taught him. His mentors, Grady McMurtry and PhyllisSeckler and Israel Regardie, are among the people who trained directly withAleister Crowley. They died in his lifetime; Lon is our bridge to thatgeneration of Thelemites.In these pages he tells the story of his initiation into Ordo Templi Orientis.As I have come to know Lon directly through my own membership in the order, Ihave come to deeply appreciate his lifetime of service. His tireless work hashelped to build and shape O.T.O. into the worldwide magickal order it is today.When Grady and Phyllis picked him to be their initiate they chose wisely, and weare the beneficiaries.If you have a chance to attend one of his lectures or classes, jump at it! Ifyou find that you are scheduled against one of his presentations, you might findyour audience sparse indeed. He's a hard act to follow too. I was once offered achance to present at a conference in his stead when he had to withdraw becauseof a conflict. I said “I'm honored that you thought of me and I'd love to do it.But . . . you know I'm not funny, right?” Lon is one of those genuinely wisepeople who also have the gift of humor. Being able to laugh is one of the keysto success, he says, especially if you can laugh at yourself.These days Lon is as likely to give a concert as a lecture. From the fieryanthem “Class Warfare” to the searing indictment “If We Believed” to thecrooning lullaby “Sweet Babalon” the audience sings along. He gives voice to thepains and fears and joys of a magical life. Music threads through this book, inliner notes for a musical presentation of the tarot, in an address to anaudience about to hear Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the musicality of the prose.In these introductions to other people's work we get to know Lon through thebooks and people he loves. He is exactly the right kind of guru—funny, kind,accessible, stern when severity is called for, and demanding that the studentstake responsibility for the learning. Hilarious anecdotes segue intobreathtaking vistas of insight. He is speaking a lived revelation, singing thetruth of the soul: the earth is sunlight incarnate, we are the earth's children,our embodiment is the call to spiritual awareness that we are all eternal.The best description of Lon Milo DuQuette is his own description of DonaldMichael Kraig.In the final analysis, the only meaningful credential a magician can present tothe world is the magician. Has he or she evolved through the agency of magic? Ishe or she a wiser, more balanced, more disciplined, more enlightened, moreengaged, more self-aware individual? Is the individual a better friend, a betterteacher, a better citizen, a better human being because of his or herinvolvement in this most personal of spiritual art forms? Most importantly, doesthe magician have the ability to laugh at magician?Lon Milo DuQuette is one of the greatest teachers of our time. In theseintroductions he shows us the magician that he is, demonstrating how to embody amagical life. He tells us that he writes the books he wanted to read. As a womanmagician I too am writing the books I needed when I was starting out. I look toLon as the exemplar of the writer as teacher; I could not have a better one.Brandy Williamsauthor of Practical Magic"},{"pageContent":"PREFACEI'm a very lucky man. I've endured seventy-two years in relatively good health.I've always managed to reside with my family in a part of the universe that iswarm, sunny, and relatively safe. I am blessed to be married to beautiful saintof a wife and father to a brilliant doctor of a son. Month-after-month,year-after-year I somehow scrape up the rent and put food on the table. TheDuQuettes live modestly. We've never owned a house, a new car, or a credit card.Considering the fact that I am a bit of a bum, that I possess little ambition,have never made any long-term plans or set any life goals—I am happy as anyhuman being deserves to be.In 1950 I was lucky when that pain in my hip was Perthes bone disease and notpolio.In 1955, I was lucky to catch the first cultural wave of dawning rock ‘n’ rolland television.In 1960 I was lucky to be given a guitar.In 1965 I was lucky to become socially awakened and impelled to involve myselfin the peace, and civil rights and social justice movements.In 1966 I was lucky to be introduced to LSD and the subtle wisdom of the I Chingand the Tao, and the teachings of Lao Tzu and Buddha, Yogananda, YogiRamacharakra, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Alan Watts and Timothy Leary.In 1967 I was lucky to become so prophetically “inspired” while on LSD that Itelephoned Constance in Nebraska and proposed marriage. (I was profoundly luckyshe said “Yes” (though she says the jury's still out whether or not she waslucky!)In 1969 I was lucky to sign an artist/songwriter recording contract with EpicRecords.In 1971 I was lucky when I accidentally enrolled in the Lee Strasberg Theatreand Film Institute.1In 1972 I was lucky to be amused and fascinated by writings of Aleister Crowley.In 1975 I was lucky to meet and be initiated by the aging disciples of Crowley'smagical orders and formally began my study and practice of Western CeremonialMagick.In 1988 I received a phone call from one of my favorite contemporary authors,Christopher S. Hyatt, PhD. A year or so earlier I had initiated him into ourlocal lodge of Ordo Templi Orientis in Newport Beach. He asked if I would careto contribute a chapter to his new book onWesternTantra.2 I had never thoughtabout writing anything professionally but it felt like something I might enjoy,so I said “Sure!” I borrowed a friend's word processor and wrote up a few wordsthat I felt would be appropriate. In 1990 Dr. Hyatt called again and asked if Iwould be interested in co-authoring a book with him about the magical andqabalistic aspects of Tarot vis-a-vis his Jungian theories on the subject. Itold him I was completely unqualified to comment authoritatively and suggestedhe try someone else. When he asked who? I was hard pressed to come up with thename of a living authority. It dawned on me in the years I had been blissfullystudying and practicing this stuff most of my personal mentors had died.I said, “Sure!” and for the next two years Dr. Hyatt and I would write fourbooks together, and I would contribute to a handful of other books released bythe same publisher. Since then, and for the last quarter century, I've enjoyedwonderful relationships with other fine publishers and have written a number ofbooks on Magick, Tarot, Qabalah, Freemasonry, indeed, whatever subjects I mightcare to write about.Over the years, it has been my good fortune to make the acquaintance of some ofthe most talented and important esoteric writers of my generation, some of whom,from time-to-time, have graciously invited me to contribute introductions orforewords to their books. For me, this is a great honor and privilege. I takethese opportunities very seriously because they oblige me to do my best to cutto the chase and distill my thoughts on any particular subject and do it assuccinctly as possible. As a literary form, however, such introductory materialis often skimmed over or ignored by the reader who is understandably anxious toget on to the meat of the text.I was sad to think that these short writings would likely remain the mostoverlooked of all my works. So, I especially want to thank the various authorsand publishers of the works represented here for allowing me to share them onceagain. As the various works span a broad range of magical subjects and decadesof my own evolving understanding and opinions I have grouped the essays togetherin the broadest subject categories, fully expecting the reader not to feelobliged to read the essays in strict order but to jump around as interest andspirit moves. I am leaving it to the reader's wise use of the Contents page tonavigate his or her way around.1 I had been waiting alone in the lobby of the studio while my friendauditioned. Suddenly, John Marley, the famed character actor, stuck his head outof a studio door and shouted, “Next!” “What the hell?” I thought and followedhim into the bowels of the studio and he introduced me to another greatcharacter actor, Gerald S. O'Loughlin, who sat me down and asked me in his besttough New York police detective voice, “So! Why do you wanna be an actah?” “Idon't want to be an actor.” I said. “I just want to be truthful in living my owndrama.” I guess that was just the kind of answer a method acting school waslooking for. I was accepted without having to audition.2 Christopher S. Hyatt, PhD, Secrets of Western Tantra.

I can saywithout hesitation that Aleister Crowley (who died a few months before I wasborn) and Israel Regardie (who I had the pleasure of meeting and correspondingwith) top my list of teachers, heroes, and mentors. I consider it an example oftrue magical kismet that my life circumstances have conspired to allow me towrite about some of the very same works that inspired me in my youth; works thatlaunched me on my fifty-year adventures in magick, writing, and teaching. I feelthat it is profoundly appropriate that I begin this anthology of literaryappetizers with my introductory words to several of the books that firstintroduced me to magick in general, and the works of Aleister Crowley inparticular."},{"pageContent":"THE TREE OF LIFEA Study in MagicImage [images/line.jpg]FOREWORD FOR THE 2017 EDITION1But it is only man himself who may tauten the string of the bow.—ISRAEL REGARDIEMy life is Magick.2 Ultimately, the same can be said of everyone's life formagick in the truest sense of the word is the mechanism of consciousness, andconsciousness is the nature of existence itself. Such vaporous musing, howeverprofound and accurate, is a rather obscure way to open a discussion on thetheories and practices of modern occultism and not at all what someone isexpecting to hear when they ask you, “What is Magick?”Since the early 1970s when I was first exposed to it as a spiritual art form,magick in its many varieties has been my passion. This passion soon developedinto practice; and mastering the practice continues to be for me an on-goingadventure in self-transformation and self-realization. Magick is my “Way.”Gradually, over the years, I have been able to share my observations andcommentaries on magical subjects in published platforms and (very late in life)these projects have earned for me a modest literary career. Frequently, in mycapacity as a practitioner and commentator on the subject of magick, I have theopportunity to travel and discuss my books and hold workshops. Obviously, I amnot a shy person, and on long flights, I enjoy talking to the people seated nextto me on the plane and learning about their lives. They, in turn, inquire aboutme and what I do, and I'm always happy to make the attempt.” I write, and I'mflying to ________ to lecture about one of my books.” “Oh really. What kind ofbooks do you write?” This is when I agonize as how best to respond. I try to beas truthful as possible but people can be superstitious and fearful and noteveryone will be enriched by exposure to things that disturb them for one reasonor another. Why spoil the few hours we have together? Perhaps it is best tochange the subject to pleasant things in life we have in common, like movies,and food, or bragging about how well our children and grandchildren are doing.But I almost always take the bait and end up saying something like, “My newestbook is about Magick, tarot cards, and the Hebrew Qabalah.”Dead silence. Blank stare. Or, if I'm lucky, they change the subject. If I'm notlucky they become actually interested and ask, “Magick? Oh! That soundsinteresting. Tell me about magick.”It's a well-known fact of esoteric life that there is no such thing as “Magick101.” Even on a fourteen-hour flight to Beijing it is impossible to properlyintroduce anyone to Magick. But do I ever learn? No.After explaining that Magick with a “k” is not pulling a rabbit out of a hat orsawing a woman in two, I try to start at the beginning. “Well do you know aboutthe Sumerians?” I might ask. “They were big before the Egyptians . . . verystrange folks, the Sumerians . . . well, they saw everything in life as ahierarchy of natural forces that they identified (metaphorically) as gods,angels, and demons which they attempted to influence and control. They organizedthis unseen population in anal-retentive detail according to their understandingof elements, planetary spheres, zodiac signs . . . bla bla bla. . . .You've probably heard of the Egyptian Book of the Dead? Right! Well that wasreally cool—sort of a state-of-the-art how-to manual that taught how to actuallymanipulate frequencies of consciousness as we pass through phases of the deathcoma . . . bla bla bla. . . .The Greeks figured out that existence, time, space and everything, are merelyaspects of consciousness . . . bla bla bla. . . .Then a bunch of very smart Jewish guys (called Qabalists) loved what the Greekswere doing with numbers and started playing with consciousness in breathtakinglyelegant mathematical terms, and organized infinite amounts of abstractinformation in perpetually replicating fractals of alpha-numeric patterns thatwhen observed would explain everything (if we just look hard enough atanything.) . . . bla bla bla. . . .Christian mystics and ecstatic Islamic saints eventually observed that Love(yes, Love) is the true nature of reality, and that Love can be focused as anactual, objective, living force as tangible as gravity. And if we get reallygood at falling in Love we can trigger within ourselves the big cosmic awakeningthat Christ and all the saints and Holy people have been talking about forthousands of years . . . bla bla bla. . . .Abra-melin the Mage tried to explain it all by revealing that each of us ispossessed with a personal god that he called the Holy Guardian Angel which isreally the embodiment of the Love force . . . bla bla bla. . . .Alchemy . . . bla bla bla. . . .Have you heard of the Rosicrucians? Well, they were like alchemists but with anagenda! Nobody knows who they really were . . . or even if they ever reallyexisted, but I guess it doesn't matter because they wrapped up some of thecoolest ideas of Greek hermeticism along with mystic Christianity and by doingso accidentally triggered the Protestant Reformation . . . bla bla bla. . . .Freemasonry loved all this qabalistic, alchemical and hermetic stuff because itcould be rationally and intellectually approached, so they tried to wake upeverybody by asking smart folks to look at all everything in life, includingpolitics, from logical and scientific point of view. Soon everyone was realizinghow silly and superstitious is was for people to believe that kings and queenswere any better than they were, and that it was stupid that nations kept havingwars with each other. So, the Freemasons institutionalized everything under thebanner of the “Universal Brotherhood of Man.” Well, that triggered the“Enlightenment” and inadvertently started the French and American Revolutions .. . bla bla bla. . . .Oh my God! did I mention the Knights Templar? Now there's a story! . . . bla blabla. . . .Elphas Levi said all this stuff should rightly be called “Magic!” Oh! and, bythe way tarot cards are the flash cards of Qabalah and Alchemy and are connectedwith the Greeks and the Jews and the Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians andthe Masons . . . bla bla bla. . . .MacGregor Mathers . . . bla bla bla. . . .Golden Dawn . . . bla bla bla. . . .Aleister Crowley—they called him a Satanist but if he was a Satanist he was agood kind of Satanist!I hope you're following this. Oh look! We're landing!Magick is an art form, and would-be magicians (like all would-be artists) eitherinitially resonate to the styles and forms of the art or they don't. You areeither touched and fascinated by Magick's mysteries or you're not. If you are sotouched, then it doesn't matter what end of the Magick pool you dive into, it'sgoing to be the deep end. No matter where or how you start your journey, that iswhere you begin.Today we are blessed (and cursed) with the internet, and with the opportunity tohave at our fingertips the collective knowledge of the ages. Technical andphilosophical questions that only a few short years ago could have only beenanswered by visiting a library and combing stacks of books (many needing to betranslated), or by enrolling in post-graduate university courses, can now beresearched and answered in seconds while sitting in your underwear at home.It's true. We have the “Knowledge of the Ages” at our fingertips. But unless wecan digest and apply that knowledge for our own enlightenment we have not earnedthe “Wisdom of the Ages.” Wisdom is what occult studies are about, and Wisdomdoesn't come from reading. Wisdom comes only as the by-product ofself-realization and self-transformation, and that's what magick is about.The occult revival of the late nineteenth century was a watershed for all whoresonate with the art of magick. Ignited in part in 1875 by the foundation ofthe Theosophical Society and the works of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and others,the English-speaking world was introduced to the sublime subtleties of Buddhism,Hinduism, and yoga. Health movements and metaphysical new-thought mutations ofChristianity gave progressive adherents permission to think outside the orthodoxbox. German, French, Russian, and English “Rosicrucian” societies scouredancient libraries for medieval grimoires, alchemical and qabalistic texts, andfragments of magical and Hermetic manuscripts written in Greek, and Hebrew andLatin.In 1888, The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was formed, and (primarilythrough the efforts of its visionary chief adept, Samuel MacGregor Mathers),ingeniously churned the cream of two-thousand years of esoteric systems andpractices, into rich magick butter—a Masonic-style, degree-structured initiatorysociety—breathtakingly Egyptian in motif, and patently qabalistic in structure.For a few short years, the Golden Dawn served as a “one-stop-shopping center” ofmagick, and (for English-speaking aspirants) it was the only game in town.Unfortunately, it was a secret game. The players were bound by terrifying oathsnever to reveal the details of the instruction, practices, ceremonies, or thenames of other members. Predictably, human frailties, infighting and, schismbrought an awkward and early end to the Golden Dawn in the first years of thetwentieth-century. Various “continuations” of the original organizationincluding the Stella Matutina (a very active Golden Dawn hybrid that served asyoung Israel Regardie's “Golden Dawn.”) continued to operate sporadically withvarying degrees of success. But the secret rituals and knowledge lectures weresoon published, and the golden-years of the Golden Dawn would never return totheir former glories.By 1932, when young Israel Regardie penned The Tree of Life: a Study in Magic,the occult world had clearly entered the post-Golden Dawn age. The pioneergeneration had (with few notable exceptions) disappeared completely orretrenched. Those brave young souls who were about to become the next wave ofmagicians were (like the curious person sitting next to me on the airplane) notarmed with adequate background information necessary for them to make aninformed decision about magick. Regardie saw the need for a fundamental, yetcomprehensive summary of the world of practical magick as it was understoodpracticed in the twentieth century, and he took it upon himself to create it. I,for one, am glad he did, because in 1972 when I first read The Tree of Life, Iwas a naïve dilettante, poorly-armed with bits and pieces of tantalizing magicallore and not having a clue as to what the big picture was.I had never heard of Regardie, and I bought the book simply because I waslooking for some information about the diagram called the “Tree of Life” tosupplement my preliminary dabbles with hermetic qabalah. Instead I found myselfface-to-face with a mini liberal arts education in the histories, theories, andpractices of 2,000 years of magical systems and techniques (complete with raretranslations and key excerpts from classic documents).The reader may be a bit put off (as I was) by Regardie's writing style and whatappears to be his transparent attempts at sounding overly mature, occult andrecondite. Sometimes it just sounds like he's trying to impress us with hisbrilliant vocabulary. My suspicions were confirmed that this was his intention:At our first meeting in 1976 I happened to mention how hard it was for me towade through parts of The Tree of Life. He laughed and rolled his eyes andconfessed,“Oh, dear God! I was a boy! And wished to prove I was every bit as loquacious asOld Crow.”3Overly loquacious or not, The Tree of Life stands as a founding document ofmodern magick that will continue to open the door to Magick for generations tofollow.1 Written for Israel Regardie, The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic, Scottsdale,Arizona: New Falcon Publications, 2017.2 “Magic(k)” being a modern convention to distinguish the spiritual art formfrom stage “magic” or prestidigitation.3 i.e. Aleister Crowley."},{"pageContent":"THE LEGEND OF ALEISTER CROWLEYA Study of the FactsImage [images/line.jpg]FOREWORD FOR THE 2016 EDITION1Look! It doesn't matter if Crowley was a Satanist, he was a good kind ofSatanist, and you'll just love him! Trust me.—ROBERT (MAD BOB) PATTONYou've probably heard things about Aleister Crowley (1875–1947). Perhaps you'veheard monstrous things—hideous things—terrifying things—disgusting and ghastlythings. On the other hand, you might have heard wonderful things—funnythings—astonishing things—inspiring things—even supernatural and sacred things?Anyone who thinks they know something about Crowley will most likely voice avery strong opinion either unfavorable or favorable.Detractors are quick to vilify him as the Devil himself—insane, perverse, andevil; while his admirers lionize him as a genius; an enlightened holy man; asaint; a Buddha; Prophet of a New Aeon. It's been nearly seventy years sinceEdward Alexander (Aleister) Crowley drew his last breath, and opinions about himremain as passionately polarized as they were in 1930 when The Legend ofAleister Crowley was first published.As you will learn in Dr. Regardie's fine introductory words (penned in 1969),this slim little volume was originally written and compiled by Crowley's friendand publisher, P.R. Stephensen, to serve as a testament to (and showcase samplerof) Crowley's extraordinary talents and contributions to the world of Englishliterature and philosophy. The book was also an undisguised attempt to mount arational defense of Crowley's character and reputation that had been mercilesslyand irrationally attacked by the press since the turn of the century.Stephensen's efforts to redeem Crowley, however, would not be immediately oruniversally successful. It saddens me to say that today, eighty-five years afterits initial publication, the world needs to read this book more than ever.The Legend of Aleister Crowley was my first real introduction to the personalityand works of Aleister Crowley. I first read it at a pivotal season in my ownlife, shortly after our son was born in 1972. To say it was a watershed momentin my life would be a monumental understatement. I would go on to spend thebetter part of the next forty years of my life studying Crowley; digesting hiswritings; meeting and learning from people who had known him when he was alive;practicing his magical and meditation techniques, and attempting to live thephilosophy of life he so passionately espoused. However, my first few stumblingencounters with the works of the man who called himself the Beast 666 wereawkward and comically terrifying.I was a 24-year old failed yogi and fledgling western mystic poseur working myway through the monographs of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC2, the TraditionalMartinist Order3, and the Builders of the Adytum4. I fancied myself a bit of aheretic and spiritual rebel, but I certainly wanted nothing to do with anythingthat smacked of black magick or Satanism5.Everything I had read about Aleister Crowley up to that point was bad. My occultdictionary listed him as a black magician who ate human flesh and sacrificed 120babies one year. My blue-haired Rosicrucian elders told me he was the devilhimself. My fellow Martinists cautioned me not to even utter his name. Mytarot-loving friends in the BOTA warned me that his teachings were sexuallyperverse, and that he advocated performing grotesque and unnatural sexual actson tarot cards. But, for some curious reason, the more my mystical colleaguestried to dissuade me, the more fascinated I became. Who was this guy?As I have written elsewhere, I bought a deck of his Thoth Tarot cards . . .then, hysterically gave them away . . . then, took them back after talking withMad Bob, our family friend (and spiritual mentor) who soundly upbraided me formy display of spiritual cowardice.“Crowley was cool. He was a genius and a holy man. If you're really seriousabout mastering magick and the Hermetic arts you're going to have to dig deepinto what this guy's about.”“But everyone says he was a Satanist. Was he a Satanist?” I asked Bob.“No. He wasn't a Satanist!” Then he paused. “Well, Yes. I guess you could say hewas.” Then he disagreed with himself once more. “No . . . not really!” Finallyhe said, “Look! It doesn't matter if Crowley was a Satanist, he was a good kindof Satanist, and you'll just love him! Trust me.”6I took Bob at his word, and soon after our curious conversation I had theopportunity to read Crowley's The Book of Thoth, the work that was written latein his life to accompany the Thoth Tarot cards. I felt like a grammar-schoolstudent trying to read post-graduate papers on magick, philosophy, alchemy,qabalah, astrology, and comparative religion. Even though I understood only afraction of a fraction of what I read, I found Crowley to be brilliant, funny,and someone who had obviously mastered the spiritual arts of which he wrote sopassionately. Furthermore it became breathtakingly evident to that Crowley hadactually achieved the expanded levels of consciousness his magical practices andmeditations are designed to trigger.Crowley was the real deal, I thought. And if that means he was a Satanist, thenhe was a good kind of Satanist . . . and I just loved him!The Book of Thoth, and the Thoth Tarot cards however, provided precious littleinformation about who Crowley was; what his background was; why he was soadmired and hated. I wanted to know more. At the time, books by and aboutCrowley were very rare if they existed at all. One afternoon in a Laguna Beachbookstore a beautiful black cat named Catalina guided me to an odd little bookthat would provide me a clearer picture of Crowley the man, the poet, and thephilosopher.“Any books by Aleister Crowley?”7 I asked the owner. . . .She looked at me as if I asked her for a book about baby torture, and answeredthat she didn't think she had any Crowley but pointed to the cat sleepingserenely on the second shelf of the bookcase in the adjacent room. “If I haveanything it will be in the shelf behind Catalina . . . that is, if you can gether to move.”Sure enough, peeking just behind the somewhat obese feline was what appeared tobe a damaged paperbound edition of The Legend of Aleister Crowley. It didn'tlook at all impressive or scary. In fact it looked rather shoddily produced—thecover almost bare of adornment or color with only a simple graphic of eye in atriangle and the words:Image [images/p15-01.jpg]I have to confess the titillating language of the crudely-printed blurbs on thecover intrigued me no end. I stroked Catalina and thanked her, then immediatelypurchased the book from the shocked proprietor and rushed home to read it.I was especially impressed with the Introduction by Israel Regardie (1907–1985).I recognized the name because I had already read his classic text, The Tree ofLife8 as part of my self-guided efforts to learn the qabalah. He had beenCrowley's secretary in the late 1920s and lived and with him in France andGermany during an especially colorful period in Crowley's life.Regardie was just a couple years older than my own father and so in my eyesrepresented a generational link between Crowley and me. His frank, contemporarywriting style was pleasantly palatable and served to lift the verbose,intimidating, larger-than-life Crowley out of the fog of superstitious mythologyand place him in the clear objective light of psychology and philosophy. Knowingthat this respected and august author thought so highly of Crowley was veryreassuring, and the fact he put his seal of approval on this little bookprofoundly elevated its importance in my estimation.The signature line of Regardie's Introduction revealed that he lived in StudioCity, California a little over fifty miles from Costa Mesa where I lived.Suddenly the vaporous fancies of magical history and legend crystalized into theobjective space-time coordinates of my own backyard. “Perhaps I could actuallymeet this guy someday.” I thought. (Indeed, the gods soon conspired to make thisfantasy a reality. In less than two years I found myself sitting in Regardie'sliving room in Study City sipping champagne cocktails and discussing magick andAleister Crowley with my magical neighbor-hero. Regardie and I remained friendsuntil his death in 1985.)I don't have to remind the reader that 1972 was a long time ago, and the worldhas changed dramatically in the last thirty-five years. Crowley's reputation, ifnot totally redeemed, has undergone a fairer, more balanced evaluation in thecourt of public opinion (at least among the educated and well-informed). Booksby Crowley and about Crowley are abundant and readily available around the worldand in many languages. His teachings and occult organizations flourishworldwide, and his contributions to modern art, literature, and philosophy areincreasingly acknowledged and recognized.In 2002 the BBC aired a television documentary, “Great Britons,” based on a pollthe network conducted to learn who the British people considered the top onehundred “greatest British people in history.” There, in 73rd place (nestledcomfortably between King Henry V (of Shakespeare fame) and Robert the Bruce (ofMel Gibson's Braveheart fame), was occultist, ceremonial magician, poet,painter, novelist and mountaineer—Aleister Crowley.I will close these introductory words by heartily encouraging the reader to makethe effort if he or she wishes to learn more about Crowley. For me, my laborthese last forty years has been well repaid, and my life, my consciousness, and(I dare say . . . my spiritual happiness) has been enriched by the life, theteachings, the magick, and the extraordinary legend of Aleister Crowley. Iencourage anyone wishing a more thorough and scholarly comment on The Legend ofAleister Crowley . . . to also obtain and read Mr. Stephen King's excellent 2007edition published by Helios Books; and to also avail themselves of IsraelRegardie's own biography of Crowley, The Eye in the Triangle.91 Written for P.R.

At the time of my involvement TMO was closely aligned with theRosicrucian Order (AMORC).4 The Builders of the Adytum (BOTA) is primarily a correspondence school of theWestern mystery tradition which traces its roots and traditions to the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn and esoteric Freemasonry. Founded by Paul Foster Casein 1922 and based in Los Angeles, California, it was led at the time of myinvolvement by Case's successor, Ann Davies. BOTA focuses primarily on theHermetic Qabalah and the qabalistic aspecst of the Tarot.5 At the time I was an ignorant and superstitious young fool who had no ideathat “Black Magick” and “Satanism” (as I fearfully imagined them to be) did notexist in objective reality. Today, while I do not call myself either a blackmagician or Satanist or even care to use the terms to describe what I believe orpractice, I know quite a few perfectly brilliant and intelligent individuals whoare quite comfortable identifying themselves as such. Everyone I've met ishonest and sincere, and in my opinion, as liberated and possessed of high moralintegrity as those who follow less colorful and exotic spiritual paths.6 Lon Milo DuQuette, My Life with the Spirits, York Beach, Maine: RedWheel/Weiser, 1999, pp. 69-70.7 At the time, I was still incorrectly pronouncing Crowley's name “Craw-lee”instead of “Crow-ley” (which rhymes with Holy).8 Israel Regardie, The Tree of Life: a Study in Magick, New York: Samuel Weiser,1972; originally published 1932.9 Israel Regardie, The Eye of the Triangle, Las Vegas: New Falcon Publications,2nd New Falcon edition, 2014; originally published 1932."},{"pageContent":"THE EYE IN THE TRIANGLEIntroduction to Dr. Israel Regardie's Definitive Work on Aleister CrowleyImage [images/line.jpg]FOREWORD FOR THE 2017 EDITION1Crowley once said that if a man wanted to begin the study of Magic because hewished to evoke a demon to kill his enemy, that would be all right too. For thestudent would soon discover the hierarchical structure of the world of magic.That is to say, the demon in question could not be controlled or ordered untilthe student had made contact with the entity immediately superior. And thisentity would only be beseeched to function in terms of his superior—and so on.Very shortly, then, the student would be constrained to invoke, in a directline, the God or spiritual force ruling over all such operations. In that case,he would have to unite his consciousness with that of the God. By that time, somany transformations in consciousness would have taken place, that the originalmalefic intent would have disappeared and been replaced by other more worthy andhigher aspirations.—ISRAEL REGARDIEI never met Aleister Crowley. He died seven months and eleven days before I wasborn. No! I do not believe I am Aleister Crowley. I have never entertained thefantasy that I am or was Aleister Crowley. In fact, since earliest childhoodI've been haunted by rather clear memory/visions of who I probably was in atleast one previous life, and I assure you none of these memories have anythingto do with Aleister Crowley or, indeed, any person of legendary or notablehistorical significance.Over the past forty years, however, because of my dubious reputation as somekind of magical authority, I've been contacted by a fair number individuals whohave informed me with straight-faced earnestness they are the living incarnationof Aleister Crowley, the Beast 666, and that I must immediately write a bookrecognizing them as such. They proffer abundant evidence; qabalisticsynchronicities; birthdates, address or telephone numbers, recurring dreams ofwild orgies, and shopping receipts totaling $6.66.When I first met Dr. Francis (Israel) Regardie (1976) we discovered we both hadquite a collection of such colorful contacts. We swapped a couple of accounts,then resolved then and there it would be great fun to pool our Crowleyincarnation stories and letters in a book that we would title, Liber Nutz. Weboth were half serious about the project and in the years that followed he wouldoccasionally call and send me out to investigate another neighborhood Crowleymanifestation. Predictably, the whimsical project never manifested. Regardiedied in 1985 and with him Liber Nutz.No matter what you may have read to the contrary on the internet, I was notRegardie's “magical apprentice.” Nor was I his formal student. I was never“personally initiated” by him into any kind of Golden Dawn, or A∴A∴ or O.T.O.,2or anything. I can, however, proudly (and with no small measure of awe andhumility) claim him as one of my earliest and most influential magical mentors.He made himself available whenever I had specific questions about magick andCrowley, and he was generous with his time, information and opinions. He wasalso supportive of our O.T.O. Lodge3 in Newport Beach, and donated duplicatebooks from his own substantial library, and other magical trinkets.Before I met him, however, he was (in my mind at least) an unapproachable god—amysterious mythological character straight out of the distant legendary past;like Merlin, or John Dee, or Cagliostro, or Woodman and Westcott, Mathers, andAleister Crowley.In 1972 Constance gave birth to a beautiful baby boy,4 and the DuQuettes weremagically transformed from a young hippy couple to a family. It was also theyear I abandoned a drug-energized decade of dangerously successful work as amusician and recording artist, and pretentiously began my Holy Grail quest forrespectability and stability. (Forty-five years later I must sadly confess I amstill failing spectacularly in this quest.) However, during that youthfultransitional period, I did discover something even more precious than thepoisonous anesthetizia of American middle-class predictability. I found Magick,and the works of Edward Alexander (Aleister) Crowley.As any magician will tell you, magick isn't anything like most people think itis. In fact, magick isn't anything like anyone thinks it is. Magick stops beingmagick when someone can explain it to you; and magick stops being magick whenyou think you can explain it to others. It's a real paradox, and it's supposedto be a paradox. It's all very Zen.Still, for some of us, we are irresistibly drawn to the art-form of magick (andmake no mistake, magick is a most colorful and powerful spiritual art-form), notbecause we believe it is the only path to enlightenment (or even that it is agood one), but because something magical (already bubbling away inside us) tellsus it is our path.In 1928, a twenty-year old British-born American art student, Francis IsraelRegudy (later Regardie), was snared by this attraction and bravely abandoned hisprivileged family home in Washington D.C. and set sail for Paris to become alive-in disciple of the notorious Aleister Crowley, the self-proclaimed WorldTeacher and Prophet of the New Aeon.As the reader will soon discover, The Eye in the Triangle is Regardie's extendedcommentary on his years with the Great Beast and the life and works of hisinfamous former employer. Moreover, the book is an attempt at an insightful, ifnot completely objective, analysis of the psychological processes that causedCrowley to “tick” so peculiarly. At the same time Regardie's observations mightalso give us some insight as to what might have been making Regardie “tick” sopeculiarly.You may find much in The Eye in the Triangle that is dated by today'spsychologically sophisticated standards. Jung is no longer so new and daring,and as far as sexual matters go there is very little that today unsettles us inthe least.In the mid 1970s when I first read The Eye in the Triangle it was the onlyproper biography of Crowley available. John Symonds' 1951 laughably bad, TheGreat Beast5 and Crowley's own Confessions of Aleister Crowley6 (wonderful, buthardly complete or objective) were pretty much the only things I could get myhands on. Things are mercifully better for students today, and Dr. RichardKaczynski's, Perdurabo—The Life of Aleister Crowley,7 will likely remain themost complete, accurate, and objective Crowley biography for many years to come.As an apologist for Crowley, Regardie must be given high marks for rising abovethe cruel, small, and nasty injuries Crowley inflicted upon him as a young manin the years following their association. I believe it was not easy for him todo this. I don't believe he did it as some form of 12-Step forgiveness gestureto make himself feel better in his final years. Rather, I simply believe he cameto a place in his life where he could put the entire wonderful and painfulexperience in prospective; he recognized that the brilliance of Crowley's geniustranscended and eclipsed his myriad (and serious) human flaws; he recognized itwas his duty to mankind—his duty to the advancement of human thought—to allowthe world to see the blazing sun of Crowley's genius and the soul-liberatingmessage he tried to deliver.Obviously, I am a very big admirer of Crowley and his work (this is due in largepart to Dr. Regardie and his various works on the subject of magick.) I singCrowley's praises a lot. I write books that are extended commentaries onCrowley's works. He constantly amazes and inspires me. He is my Holy Prophet. Onthe other hand, in reading Crowley I will run across something he said or wrotesometime during his seventy-two incredible years that shocks me—that disgustsme—that outrages me. I know for certain that I would not have liked AleisterCrowley on a personal level. We would not have gotten on. In that respect, I'mglad he's dead.But . . . Crowley was a genius.Have you ever been (un)lucky enough to spend time in close proximity to a real,over-the-top bona fide genius for any length of time? an artist? a writer? afilmmaker? a dancer? a mathematician?I have.It's hard! It's frustrating. Sometimes it's even dangerous! . . . not becausethe genius is trying to be a rude, thoughtless and arrogant. To we mortals itmay seem like the genius is behaving like an insane jerk. But the genius, moreoften than not, is completely oblivious (or unconcerned) to the effects he orshe has on others. It's because the art of the genius is the soul of the genius.The body, the mind, the personality, the character, the appetites, the dreams,the hopes, the fears are only servants to their art—and God help anyone oranything that gets in way of the genius and his or her art.Crowley was a genius, and his body of work is a masterpiece—just as real amasterpiece as a Beethoven Symphony, or a painting by da Vinci, or a work byMichelangelo.It's true, Aleister Crowley had many monstrous shortcomings, but so didBeethoven and da Vinci and Michelangelo. They all were mad as hatters. Theystill created immortal, consciousness-elevating works. Through their genius,they manifested truth. And truth is bigger than any fragile and illusionarypersonality. It took Regardie many years to put behind him the stings ofpersonal injuries he suffered from Crowley's pen-point; but he eventually did;and we are all enriched his act of posthumous magnanimity.The image of the “Eye in the Triangle” of course has many magical and mysticalconnotations. It is certainly a profound and appropriate title for Regardie'streatment of the life and works of Aleister Crowley. I believe, however, that italso represented the opening of Regardie's own eye to the spiritual significanceof Crowley's contribution to the evolution of human consciousness, and to theimportance of his own vital role and responsibility in presenting it to theworld.And now, I don't wish to take more of the reader's time with these introductorywords. So, I would like to close with something I wrote over thirty years agofor my own amusement and for the amusement of my friends and colleagues who knewand loved Dr. Francis (Israel) Regardie.Shortly after Regardie died in 1985, testimonials and memorials poured into thehandful of occult and metaphysical-themed publications. Most of these InMemoriams had one thing in common; they nearly all spent a great deal of thearticle telling the reader how much Regardie admired and respected them! I wasembarrassed and somewhat ashamed of my magical colleagues for their tastelessexploitation of the moment, so I wrote a parody (under a magical nom de plume)mocking their self-serving articles. I prevailed upon a sympathetic editor ofprominent esoteric magazine of the day who was kind enough to publish it. If youthink it sounds ridiculous and absurd . . . . believe me . . . it is not nearlyas ridiculous and absurd as some of the “real” In Memoriams published after hisdeath,This silly little parody is my most sincere thank you gift to Regardie; my wayof telling him how much I truly loved, respected, and admired him. I know hewould be laughing the loudest.ISRAEL REGARDIE HIS FAVORITE STUDENT REMEMBERSBy Frater Stonehenge Equinox(As told to Lon Milo DuQuette)Image [images/line1.jpg]It wasn't long after Israel Regardie met me that his health began to fail. Eventhough we met in person only twice I still managed to have a profound effectupon his life. They say you never have a second chance to make a good firstimpression, and, if I say so myself, Regardie's first impression of me was alasting one.At the time, I did not know his address, so I staked out his Post Office box inStudio City. After three days, he finally arrived to pick up his mail. He almostmissed his chance to meet me for, alas, I had fallen asleep on the sidewalk nearthe newspaper racks in front of the building. Destiny, however, could not bethwarted and the gods guided his tiny footsteps to tread upon my left hand andforearm.Luckily, he was not hurt badly in the fall, and as I helped him gather his mailfrom the gutter I seized the opportunity to introduce myself.“Equinox is my name, Stonehenge Equinox. You're the reason I'm into magick.”He responded with an astounding display of mental telepathy.“I don't suppose you're insured?” he asked (not concealing the fact that healready knew the answer).I followed him to his car where I displayed my tattoos and treated him to animpromptu performance of my original Diagonal Pillar Ritual. He feigneddisinterest, but I could tell he was favorably impressed. Great magicians don'tneed words to communicate with each other, and so I was not surprised to see himspeed off in his car without uttering a sound (although he did gesture).Our next meeting was more mystical and intimate. As providence ordained, I foundhis phone number scrawled on the restroom wall at the Bodhi Tree Bookstore inWest Hollywood and immediately gave him a call. Playfully disguising my voice, Itold him I had thrown my back out and made an appointment for a chiropracticadjustment.There's no question that the man was omniscient, but he seemed genuinelysurprised to see me when I and my (then) girlfriend, Diana Ishtar SophiaMorgana, appeared at his door.The dear man asked if I had come for the spinal adjustment, and voiced hisdelight that I had brought someone to help me home. What a saint! And you know,he was right. After his treatment, I was unable to walk for three weeks!Thus began a five-year odyssey of intense spiritual correspondence. Every FridayI mailed him my magical record, dream diary, semen sigils, and excerpts from my(still) unfinished novel, Sex Wizards of Phlegm. Each week, like clockwork, myletters and packages were returned to me seemingly unopened and unedited.However, to a trained clairvoyant such as myself, adept in traveling in thespirit vision, these “silent messages” were a treasure-chest of deeply personalmagical instruction and encouragement. Each page dripped with his energy and allwere alive with psychically transmitted practical advice, initiatory ordeals,and occult secrets. It was in this manner that he consecrated me “Psychopomp ofNorth Hollywood.”Then, shortly before his death, he chose to abandon our astral correspondenceand communicate to me on the material plane by actually writing me a letter. Itwas in this last letter that he poignantly revealed his deep personal affectionfor me by beginning his message by addressing me as “Dear. . . .”It was also in this letter that he revealed a mystic precognition of his ownimpending death.After advising me on matters of mental health, personal hygiene and the properuse of the English language, he closed with these chillingly prophetic words . ..“It will not be necessary for you to ever contact me again!1 Israel Regardie, The Eye in the Triangle: Introduction to Dr. IsraelRegardie's Definitive Work on Aleister Crowley, Scottsdale, Arizona: New FalconPublications, 2017.2 We were both members of the Masonic youth organization, the Order of DeMolay,and upon discovery of this fact both stood up, and exchanged the Sign, Grip, andSecret Word of a DeMolay initiate.3 Heru-ra-ha Lodge, Ordo Templi Orientis, chartered Jan. 7th 1978 by HymenaeusAlpha, 777 (Grady L.

For nearly 302 years I have, by means both traditional andforbidden, endeavored to cause changes to occur in my life in conformity to whatI have perceived to be my Will. I say “perceived” to be my Will, because it isnot until one has developed a significant level of illumination that one canwith any degree of certainty know what one's Will really is.Please don't assume that just because I have practiced magick for such a longtime that I possess an unclouded vision of my true Will or that I considermyself an illuminated master. I do not. What I do possess, however, is a greatdeal of magical experience, and experience is the potential breeding-ground ofwisdom. Naturally, that potentiality disintegrates if I can't remember theseexperiences so that I might apply their lessons to my magical life. For thisreason, it is vitally important that a magician keep a record of his or herexploits.For me, reviewing old magical diaries is never a pleasant experience. Every timeI open and read one of my ancient journals I am paralyzed by a combination ofnauseating embarrassment and wonder. I grit my teeth and squirm as I relive thethoughts and dreams of that shallow, self-centered, naive, ego-blinded youngfool who gawked back at me from the mirrors of yesterday.Painful as it has been, reviewing my magical records has afforded me theopportunity to chart the general trajectory and momentum of my spiritualevolution. I have even been able, in several instances, to pinpoint the exactminute my magical efforts have actually caused change to occur in conformitywith my Will—times that have dramatically changed my life, and the lives ofothers. In fact, at this very moment, you are reading the words on this page asthe result of a magical operation I set in motion twenty-six years ago. As amatter of fact, it was twenty-six years ago today.In the autumn of 1974 I was enmeshed in what I will politely described as aturning point in my life. I was twenty-six years old, married, with atwo-year-old son. I was desperately trying to wean myself from a very unhealthycareer as a musician and struggling to bring some semblance of stability anddirection to my life. Several years prior to this, to address an intensespiritual hunger, I entered the initiatory world of the WesternMysteries—specifically, the degree work of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC and theBuilders of the Adytum (BOTA).As fascinating as my studies were, they were just that—studies. My life neededchanging. I didn't want to just study magick; I wanted to perform magick—butwhat kind of magick? I had heard some pretty scary things about the evils ofmagick, so I was desperate to find a safe place to start.Early in January 1975, in an old and stuffy little occult bookstore in NorthLong Beach, I purchased How to Make and Use Talismans by Israel Regardie. Itrusted Regardie, having read several of his classic magical texts. This littlebook, however, was different. It was actually a how-to book of practical magick.Regardie's sane and straightforward explanation of the fundamentals oftalismanic magick instantly dispelled my superstitious doubts. His generousoffering of charts, diagrams and illustrations (which I promptly copied andpasted into my magical diary) made it a treasure-trove of easy-to-useinformation. I couldn't wait to graduate from student to practitioner. Afterreading it through several times I knew exactly where I needed to begin.In Chapter Two, Regardie suggests that planetary talismans can be helpful inovercoming unfavorable aspects that might be afflicting one's astrologicalchart. I knew I had difficult aspects in my natal chart so I contacted mybrother, Marc (the astrologer), to see which planet could use a little extrahelp. “All of them,” he coldly informed me. But, because it rules my chart, hesuggested I first try to make friends with the Moon.With Regardie's little book as my guide, I started gathering symbols for a Lunartalisman on January 23. At midnight on the 27th, after anointing it with dropsof dew that had formed in the moonlight falling on my 1952 Chrysler, Iconsecrated it with as much ceremony as I was capable of devising.My Moon talisman was the most beautiful thing I had ever made. It was a doublecircle model made of card stock. I extracted the sigils of the Lunar spirit andintelligence from the kamea in the book and carefully drew them in silver paintagainst a field of deep violet drawing ink on the front and back of one of thecircles. On the other circle I painted a sliver image of the elephant god,Ganesha (to whom the Moon is sacred) on one side, and on the other side theappropriate planetary and geomantic symbols. Around one perimeter I wrote inHebrew the divine and angelic names, and on the reverse side part of the 72Psalm “. . . abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.” When it wasfinished I lovingly slipped it inside a linen bag I had sewn with violet thread.On the flap I embroidered a silver crescent moon.I was very proud of myself, but I still didn't feel like much of a magician. Idid carry it around for a few days and felt tremendously empowered—but empoweredto do what I didn't know. I wasn't sure what I should do next. The answer came(as so many important answers do) while I was taking a shower. I should make allof the planetary talismans!For the next four months, with the help of Regardie's How to Make and UseTalismans and using my ever-improving artistic and magical skills, I created andconsecrated a full set of seven planetary talismans. Each one was more beautifuland worshipful than its predecessor. The order in which I created them wasdictated by the severity of the planetary afflictions in my natal chart. Iconsecrated the Mars talisman on February 12. By then I had taught myself theSupreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram and Hexagram which from then on becamepart of my consecration rituals.Jupiter was next on February 27, followed by Venus exactly one month later. TheVenus talisman evoked the most remarkable reactions. My dreams were filled withvividly erotic encounters such as I had not experienced since adolescence. Theycontinued until April 4 when I consecrated my talisman of Mercury when my dreamsturned anxious and confusing. (Oh well!)I started the Saturn talisman on May 10th and consecrated it at midnight on the13th. The next day I started to collect the symbols for my seventh and lastplanetary talisman. Sol took 10 days to complete. I consecrated it during alunar eclipse that took place on May 24th. My arsenal of planetary talismans wasfinally complete.Throughout this entire talisman-making period and the months that followed, lifeat the DuQuette house was a litany of chaos, frustration and despair. In anattempt to make money doing something other than singing in saloons, I accepteda house-painting job and we moved to the San Gabriel Valley. As it turned out Iwould never be paid for my (admittedly inept) labor and we found ourselvesstranded in the smoggiest town in California with no job and no money.July 11th dawned with the prospect of the worst birthday of my life. About 11:15in the morning I shut myself in my bedroom temple. I lit a candle and put it onmy altar top. I half-heartedly performed the banishing rituals of the pentagramand hexagram and sat down and tried to meditate. I couldn't. To cheer myself, Iremoved my cherished talismans from their bags and lingered on every detail oftheir splendor. As I turned them in my fingers I whispered the words of powerand the names of the gods, angels and spirits inscribed on each one of them.Finally, as if to bring order to my otherwise unordered universe, I placed theSun in the center of the altar top and surrounded it with the six remainingplanets in their proper hexagram positions. They were so beautiful—so perfect.For a moment I didn't know how to feel. I was alternately depressed andelated—depressed that these talismans were the only things perfect in my life,and elated that at least something was perfect in my life. I looked at theclock. It was almost noon and time to rejoin my wife and son for birthday cake.They were both giggling in the kitchen. Their laughter made me giggle too, andin a cliché epiphany worthy of a Frank Capra film, I realized that there werelots of perfect things in my life.My melancholy lifted. I credited the talismans for my change of mood. As I gazedat them there on the altar top I realized that they would never be morebeautiful or meaningful to me than they were at that moment. In just a few weekstheir colors would start to fade, the inks would crack, the edges wear. In a fewyears I would probably lose some of them, and those that remained would shrivelinto crumbling corpses. How could I preserve them forever just like this—at thezenith of their strength—in an environment where their beauty would never beeffaced—a place where their power would never diminish? There was only oneanswer, and it returned to me on the same thought-wave that had carried myquestion.These talismans were no good to me sitting on my altar top or tucked away intheir sterile little bags. They would have to literally become part of me. No!More than that—I must use their magick to make me someone else—someone new. Imust reabsorb my precious planetary children and plant them in the womb of myown soul. I must impregnate myself with their magical potency and by doing sobeget upon myself a new self.One by one I joyously plunged the seven talismans into the magick fire of thealtar candle, and inhaled their light and heat as the frail husks of paper andink were reduced to a clean white ash.It was noon, July 11, 1975—the first moment of my life as a magician.1 Written for an unpublished second edition of Israel Regardie, How to Make andUse Talismans.

There are those who willargue the objective reality of spirits and demons, and those who will argue thateven objective reality is subjective.

Passionate young students crowded the eaves and pressed hungry earsto the windows to hear an unprecedented lecture on mathematics.The speaker was an extraordinary young Englishman whose commentaries upon thepropositions of Euclid had stunned and delighted the great minds of theUniversity at Louvain and court of Charles V at Brussels. Not yet thirty yearsold, he was being hailed as the “New Agrippa,” the heir to the greatPhilosopher-Magicians and the first English “Magus.”His name was John Dee and he was destined to become the “ornament of the Age,”one of the most influential figures of Renaissance England . . . also one of themost vilified.To adequately profile the life and accomplishments of John Dee would require aseries of tomes the size of the one you are now holding. Yet with very fewexceptions, it has only been recently that biographers have begun to scratch thesurface and explore the incredible details that have been denied to the publicfor over three hundred years.He was mathematician, physician, mechanician, geographer and chemist. He wastutor to royal families both in England and abroad. His private book collectionat his home in Mortlake was Elizabethan England's great library. He wasengineer, antiquarian, scientist and theologian. No vain dablerk, he was masterof these and a score of other arts and sciences. His inventions andcontributions profoundly affect his world.Why then is he not celebrated with the other luminaries of the Elizabethanperiod? Why has his name fallen through the cracks of the history of WesternCivilization?“Caller of Devils, Arch Conjurer, Necromancer, Invocator of damned Spirits,Sorcerer, Witch, Enchanter, Black Magician” . . . these were occupations alsoattributed to John Dee. These accusations dogged him throughout his lifetime anddefined his reputation after his death.I will not even attempt to elaborate the details of this unbelievably eventfullife. I leave that to two most excellent modern biographies: Elizabethan Magic2by Robert Turner, and especially Peter French's John Dee, The World of anElizabethan Magus.3 But a brief sketch at this point I think is in order.John Dee was born on July 13, 1527 to Rowland Dee and Johanna Wild. The family(who could trace their ancestry to Roderick the Great, an early Prince of Wales)was not wealthy but could boast what could be called a middle-class income. Hisfather, a gentleman server to Henry VIII, was not without connections at court.In 1542, his father sent him to Cambridge where young Dee budgeted his time toenable him to routinely study eighteen hours a day. Four years later Henry VIIIfounded Trinity College and Dee received a fellowship as an under-reader ofGreek.At Trinity, he also delighted in the study of engineering and mechanics and hevolunteered to be a member of the stage crew in the production of the play PAXby Aristophanes. Amusingly, this was where his reputation as a Black Magicianbegan. His unique mechanical innovations were responsible for seeminglymiraculous stage effects. The illusion of the Scarbeus flying up to heaven witha man on its back provoked rumors of supernatural assistance—and indeed, theequipment constructed by Dee to accomplish this illusion incorporated advancedtechnology and invention not taught at Cambridge.In 1547, he took his first trip abroad to consult with the learned men of theday in the Netherlands. A year later he received his Master of Arts fromCambridge and enrolled in Louvain. His reputation throughout Europe wasstartling. Scholars of many countries traveled to confer with him and invitationfrom kings and emperors were routinely, but politely, refused.Back in England, however, his reputation as a sorcerer was enhanced when, in1555, the administration of Queen Mary had him imprisoned because of a falseaccusation of Lawde vayne practices of calculing and conjuring to enchant theQueen. He soon extricated himself from this fall from grace and when Elizabethwas crowned in 1558 Dee was a frequent and welcome visitor at court. He was evengiven the honor of casting the horoscope determining the date and hour of thecoronation ceremony—ironic, as his astrological practice was part of his problemwith Queen Mary.Elizabeth conferred often with Dee on matters of state, international policiesand most importantly England's adventurous explorations at sea. His knowledge ofgeography, history and science was unequaled and many of the remarkableachievements of the Virgin Queen should be credited to his sage council. Shebecame his patron and protector.This royal protection would be needed, for as his reputation as aPhilosopher-Magus grew, so did rumors and accusations of black magic. The vulgarelement saw his odd, eccentric genius as proof he was in league with the devil.His study of Hermeticism (a perfectly natural endeavor for a Renaissancescholar) was viewed by many with suspicion and fear. His house and library atMortlake were ransacked by a mob of neighbors in 1583 while he was on thecontinent, and he was slandered in print as “Doctor Dee the great Conjurer” byProtestant extremist John Foxe. Dee succeeded in halting the slander but thedamage was done.Dee obviously felt that the discretion he exhibited at home in England would beunnecessary on the more enlightened continent. For six years between 1583 and1589 he and skryer Edward Kelley practiced various forms of cabalistic andangelic evocation quite openly.Upon his return to England (at Elizabeth's request) he continued to be harassedand accused. Elizabeth was too distracted with court intrigues to offer muchsupport.Dee's last years were unhappy. The plague claimed his third wife, Jane Fromand,who mothered all eight of his children. His own health failing, he was pressuredby plots of his fellows to give up his position as Warden of Manchester College.He returned to Mortlake with his daughter Katherine who was to be his nurse inthe last years.In December of 1608 after King James I ignored Dee's attempt to clear his nameby being tried as a conjurer, Dee died peacefully at Mortlake.Meric Casubon did not intend to immortalize Dr. John Dee when he publishedportion of Dee's magician diaries in 1659. Quite the contrary, it is clear thathe wished to diminish Dee's considerable reputation by perpetuating a portraitof a gullible and spiritually naïve academician whose unwholesome obsession withdreams of communicating with angels led to his social and financial ruin.Titillating the reader with warnings that the material, “. . . might be deemedand termed A Work of Darkness” Casaubon spent the time and considerable expenseto vilify the memory of a man considered by many of his contemporaries to be thegreatest mathematician and philosopher of his Age, can be discovered in thecomplex and dangerous intrigues surrounding the social/political/religiousupheaval of the Puritan Revolution.Throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth Period (1642-1660) Casaubon remained aloyal and vocal supporter of the Anglican Church. As a recognized and respectedclassical scholar he was stunned when in 1644, by order of the government, hisposition at Canterbury and accompanying salary were suspended.Disenfranchised, he sought to avenge himself upon the Puritan government byattacking one of the fundamental tenants of the faith; namely, the belief thatindividuals, independent of the offices and inspiration of the Church, couldreceive spiritual guidance directly from divine sources.If Casaubon could demonstrate that even the great Dr. Dee was victim of diabolicdeception, perhaps the spiritual cause célèbre of Calvin and Cromwell might alsobe no less a product of Satanic delusion. As he would hang if he publicly statethe latter, he chose to attempt to prove the former.The government of the Commonwealth was indeed upset over the publication a ATrue & Faithful Relation of What Passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee . .. and Some Spirits (as Casaubon titled the work). However, so many copies wereinitially printed and distributed that all official attempts to suppress itfailed.In the minds of the public, the rumors of Dee's involvement in “Black Magic”were true—confirmed by his own words, in his own diaries. Casaubon had succeededin sacrificing the reputation of Renaissance England's greatestPhilosopher-Magus upon the altar of vulgar expediency.Nevertheless, we owe Meric Casaubon a profound debt of gratitude; for no matterhow unworthy his motives, his work has served as an ark—a time capsule which haspreserved one of the most remarkable magical records of all time.THE METHOD OF SCIENCE, THE AIM OF RELIGIONTo the modern student of magic, A True and Faithful Relation . . . is a treasurewithout equal. We experience almost voyeuristic self-consciousness as theintimate nature of the record unfolds. We become eaves-droppers on the detailsof the most remarkable magical event ever recorded.To Dee, Magick was Science. He took excellent notes; recording each experiencewith the precision of modern scientific notation. He did not wish to talk withAngels so he could bewitch his neighbor's cow or seduce the girl next door. Hesincerely desired more information about the laws of nature and the underlyingprinciples of Creation.Like Henry Cornelius Agrippa and Giordano Bruno, Dee was conscious of the factthat he was perhaps the most learned man of his day. Everything that was knownto Man was known to him. He was the world's foremost authority on a score ofsubjects from geography to mechanics. Where does a man who knows more thananother person on earth turn when he still has questions. The answer was God, ormore accurately, God's messengers to Man, The Angels who throughout biblicalliterature appeared to pious men to teach the knowledge that was hidden frommortals. The Patriarch Enoch was once such man who found favor in the presenceof God—hence Dee used the word “Enochian” to describe his efforts.From 1582 to 1589 Dee and his “skryer,” Edward Kelly, plunged almost daily intothe black obsidian mirror that was their doorway to the “Angelic” world. Despitehis somewhat dubious reputation, Kelly was a gifted clairvoyant. It was obviousfrom the earliest sessions that something extraordinary was taking place. Bothmen seemed genuinely surprised by the success of the initial contacts, theawkwardness of these early session is touchingly amusing.Questions concerning world politics and matters of State dominated these firstencounters but as the sessions continued it became clear that the Angels had anagenda of their own.Dee and Kelly were informed that the Angelic world could be more easily accessedand communications more efficiently facilitated if the magician actually spokethe language of the Angels. The Communicating Angels then proceeded, in the mostcomplex and extraordinary manner, to teach them the angelic language. This eventis without parallel in magical history. Israel Regardie in his massive work, TheComplete Golden Dawn System of Magic4 writes:The Enochian Language is not just a haphazard combination and compilation ofdivine and angelic names drawn from the [Enochian] tablets. Apparently, it is atrue language with a grammar and syntax of its own. Only a superficial study ofthe invocations suffice to indicate this to be a fact. The invocations are notstrings of words and barbarous names, but are sentences which can be translatedin a meaningful way and not merely transliterated.Eighteen invocations, or “Calls,” written in the Angelic language, comprise asystem whereby the magician can access the unseen elemental universe underlyingthe phenomenal world. A nineteenth Call is used to penetrate the spiritual worldknown in the system as the Thirty Aethyrs. These correspond roughly to theascending planes of consciousness of the Qabalistic universe and explored by themagician in the same manner as “path workings.It is ironic that Dee and Kelly did not utilize much of the technicalinformation dictated to them. They seemed to be almost entirely absorbed in theprocess of obtaining the data.It would be over three hundred years before the material Dee and Kelly laboredso hard to obtain would be organized into a magical system by Golden Dawn geniusS. L. MacGregor Mathers who recognized the intrinsic value of the survivingdiary material. The records found in A True and Faithful Relation . . . suppliedthe bulk of this information.The two major branches of modern practical Enochian Magic (Elemental andAethyrical) were grafted by Mathers to the Adeptus Minor curriculum of theGolden Dawn. In 1898, Aleister Crowley joined the Golden Dawn and in 1900attained the Grade of Adeptus Minor. The passion of his exploration of theEnochian system far exceeded the efforts of his predecessors and in 1909, whilewalking across the North African Sahara, he completed his systematicexplorations of the thirty worlds of the Aethyrs and chronicled them in hismasterpiece, The Vision and the Voice. Hermetic scholars have seriously comparedthis document to the visionary works of William Blake and the prophetic writingsof Ezekiel and Saint John the Divine.Interest in Enochian Magick has mushroomed extraordinarily in the last tenyears5 and books on the subject command a respectable amount of shelf space inoccult bookstores worldwide. Some of the material is excellent, offering theserious student the opportunity of experiencing something unique—a magicalsystem that really works. Sadly, many other works are of less value and, in myopinion, do a disservice to the seeker. Especially disturbing are thepresumptuous attempts of some authors to “guide” the vision of readers,intimating that the operations are failures if they do not match those theauthor suggests should be expected. Recently attempts have been made tostandardize the methodology of the operating procedures and create a form ofModern Enochian Orthodoxy which is absurd.Ironically, the one work that very few student have ever had access to is theone work they would find most interesting and helpful. It is the first Enochianbook anyone should read, and until now, it was almost impossible to find.We own a great debt of gratitude to Herman Slater6 for making this treasureavailable to the public. The enduring quality of this edition of A True andFaithful Relation . . . will ensure that his remarkable work will survive forcenturies to come.1 Written for John Dee, A True and Faithful Relation of What Passed for ManyYears Between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits.

TheologyAll through and through with ardour keen!Here now I stand, poor fool, and seeI'm just as wise as formerly.2In Act I of Goethe's Faust, the melancholic hero broods alone in his chamber andreflects upon the vainness of earthly knowledge and education. He opens a bookof magic and gazes in almost sensual wonder upon the lines and symbols on adiagram of the Macrocosm. Upon waves of ecstasy he gives voice to the passionthat since the dawn of consciousness has consumed the student of the mysteries.What rapture, ah! at once is flowingThrough all my senses at the sight of this!I feel a youthful life, its holy bliss,Through nerve and vein run on, new-glowing.Was it a god who wrote these signs that stillMy inner tumult and that fillMy wretched heart with ecstasy?Unveiling with mysterious potencyThe powers of Nature round about me here?Am I a god? All grows so clear to me!In these pure lineaments I seeCreative Nature's self before my soul appear.Now first I understand what he, the sage, has said:“The world of spirits is not shut away;Thy sense is closed, thy heart is dead!Up, Student! bathe without dismayThy earthly breast in morning-red!”3The archetype for the book that fired Goethe's imagination, and in the playinitiated Faust's memorable career as magus, was in all likelihood a real book—abook of forbidden knowledge that evoked every mystical cliché of the dramaticimagination; a massive and heavily illuminated work of alchemy, astrology,theology, magic, and cabbala which in 17194 dropped like a living culture intothe fertile medium of western syncretic thought; a book that for the remainderof the 18th century would revolutionize the Rosicrucian, Masonic, and Hermeticmovements throughout Europe; a book with which Goethe, and the brightest starsin the firmament of European esotericism were intimately familiar—Georg vonWelling's5 Opus Mago-cabbalisticum et Theosophicum.For the modern student of the western mystery traditions, especially those whosestudies and practices spring from the teachings and ceremonies propagated by theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, it would be difficult to overestimate theimportance of von Welling's work. It served as the primary instructional text ofthe Gold- und Rosenkreuzer (Golden Rosicrucians), a highly prestigious Hermeticorder founded in 1777, whose forms, doctrines, and teachings would infect andenergize the worlds of mystic Christianity and esoteric Freemasonry. Indeed, thefirst degree lecture of the Gold- und Rosenkreuzer was lifted almost word forword from the fourth section of Vol. I of von Welling's Opus.A hundred years later the nine-degree initiatory structure of the GoldenRosicrucians would provide the founding fathers of Societas Rosicruciana inAnglia (Rosicrucian Society in England) the archetype for their organization.SRIA's offspring, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, in turn, would givebirth to the magical, hermetic, and New Age movements of the 20th and 21stcenturies.In fact, it does not seem to me too far fetched to suggest that this GermanGolden Rosicrucian/British SRIA pollination may well have provided the historicbasis for the fanciful (and likely unhistorical) legend which suggests theGolden Dawn's authority was derived from a certain German adept whose“colleagues” after her death withdrew their direct support of the Order. Butthis is a matter best left to the historians of this colorful period.It's fair for the readers of this new edition to ask, “If Opus Mago-cabalisticumet Theosophicum is such an important and historic document, why haven't I heardof it?” The answer is almost unbelievably simple. Significant as the work is, ithas until now never been translated into English. For nearly 300 years itsmysteries and treasures have been reserved exclusively for those with aneloquent and profound mastery of the German language.While there is a measure of truth to the statement that a translation of anypiece of written material is inferior to the original, the gods have smiled withparticular warmth upon this project by alchemically uniting (like Salt, Sulfur,and Mercury) the elements of vision and support, in the person of PatriciaBaker; the brilliance of the translator, Joseph McVeigh, professor of GermanStudies at Smith College; and the polished astuteness of Weiser Books, arguablythe most venerable English-language publisher of esoteric material in the world.The result is an historic and invaluable contribution to the universe ofesoteric literature.That being said, it will become almost immediately apparent to even the mostknowledgeable and sophisticated reader that von Welling's work is not easyreading. Indeed, much of it, especially those sections concerning Salt, Sulfur,and Mercury, seem to consist primarily of lengthy and redundant ramblings filledwith superstitious and comically inaccurate observations of nature and the mostunscientific of scientific conclusions. I confess, before I finished reading thefirst chapters of Volume One I was having serious doubts as to the relevance ofthis book, and stopped to ask myself how much more I wanted to learn about salt!Eventually, as I wearily neared the beginning of Chapter IV of Volume One, Ifound myself slowing down and synchronizing more comfortably with the unhurried,almost hypnotic pace of von Welling's writing. His avuncular wit began to peekthough as I paused to savor how he was saying things. As my blood pressurelowered and my patience rose I found myself surrendering to the images andcharacters of an archaic and divinely naïve alternate universe—the irrationalfairytale reality of the alchemist.Then, and only then was I in the space where von Welling himself could speakdirectly to my earlier frustrations:However, we must ask for the reader's understanding, that we did not presentthis material prior to the previous three chapters, as might have beenappropriate, for this was not possible according to the mago-cabbalisticapproach to writing. The reader is certainly aware of the manner in which theHoly Spirit “writes,” and in which it guided Moses by its most holy power, as hewas describing the beginning of creation (which reached its endpoint in thecreation of man). However, there is also the mago-cabbalistic style whichtypically begins with the characteristics or designations of things. We couldnot proceed in any other manner, than we did, and thus had to follow this style,because the beings concentrated within man represent the characteristics oftheir own essences, just as the human creature represents the compositecharacter of all of them together.6I cannot, nor do I, expect anyone else to squeeze the comparable blood ofillumination from the same turnip of text. What should be universally obvious,however, is the message von Welling seems to be sending to those who have earsto hear—the message that this book is written in a peculiar manner that onlythose who have already undergone a certain modification to their consciousnesswill be able to appreciate. Recall the words of Faust:The world of spirits is not shut away;Thy sense is closed, thy heart is dead!By carefully crafting his introductory material von Welling administers analmost psychedelic dose of words and images that opens our senses and resurrectsour hearts—readjusts and redefines our inner vocabulary so that we are all, asit were, on the same page as to the characteristics or designations of things heis discussing.I wish I could say that this modification of consciousness is enough toimmediately make the Opus easy to comprehend, but unfortunately I cannot. Thereis yet another layer of cerement that swaths the body of the text that must beunwrapped by the diligent student. It must be remembered that at the time thebook was written and published its subject matter touched on themes and theoriesthat if spoken about in plain language would most certainly attract thecondemnation and persecution of the church and established academicinstitutions. The consequences of such negative attention, even in the firsthalf of the 18th century, could be gruesomely unpleasant.With so many taboos imposed upon published material and public discussion it isimpossible to escape the obvious fact that von Welling employed the complex (andfor most of the world, incomprehensible) language of alchemy, astrology, magic,and even Holy Scripture to simultaneously conceal his ideas from the profane,while revealing them to the initiated. These, in my opinion, include mysticalsecrets of the human body and (even more dangerous) the powers andpotentialities of human sexuality. After all, what powers do humans possess thatare more God-like than those surrounding the conception and birth of anotherhuman being—the creation of a perfect vessel for an incarnating soul? This issurely a subject any alchemist worth his salt would find eminently suitable forresearch and experimentation.While I certainly do not question the sincerity of von Welling's devotion to theChristian faith, it appears in many instances he invokes Deity and quotesscripture not so much as a demonstration of piety but for the benefit of heretichunters who most certainly would be scrutinizing his work. It is a venerable andeffective technique of the cabbalist to camouflage esoteric discourses asscholarly elucidations upon Bible verses. As long as the “Holy Scriptures” wereused as the springboard for discussion von Welling remained relatively free tosoar to wondrous (perhaps even heretical) heights.To navigate through this mago-cabbalistic approach to writing is a majorchallenge to the modern reader of ancient alchemical, magical, and cabbalistictexts. One is faced, page after page, with having to hear what is being said inwhat is not being said, and having to ignore what should be ignored in what isbeing said. Still, it is clear von Welling could be audaciously outspoken. InChapter VIII of Volume Two he doesn't hesitate to rip into his contemporaries inthe most uncamouflaged terms:We can only wonder at how so many illustrious men could be so wrong in theirinterpretations of Revelation. On the other hand, their erroneous ways are notsurprising when one considers their adamancy, prejudice and arrogance, whichprevents them from considering the text correctly.7He sounds like quite a character.I confess most of what I've learned about von Welling has been gleaned from thepages of Opus Mago-Cabalisticum et Theosophicum. He was born in 1655 in centralGermany near the city of Kassel and until two years before his death in 1727,earned a comfortable living as Director of Building and Mines for the state ofBaden-Durlach in southwestern Germany. It is clear that he didn't consider thisposition just a job. He had a passion for mining and geology and his expertisein these fields is apparent (sometimes to an irritating degree) in his writing.He apparently made no secret of his interest in alchemy as well. Travelliterature of the Baden area still proudly points tourists to buildings thatonce housed his alchemical laboratories.Von Welling was not an academic snob. As Professor McVeigh's translationartfully demonstrates, he was quite plainspoken, at times even bucolic. Nowhereis his irascible, Mark Twain-like candor more evident than at the beginning ofChapter Five of Volume Three: On Religion According to the Clear and DistinctMeaning of Sacred Scripture and the True Mago-Cabbala, Based on the Same. Hiswords of condemnation aimed at all who would in the name of orthodoxy suppressfreedom of thought and exploration ring true today as they did in 1719. I canthink of no better way to close this Foreword.In the name of God we now move to a topic which will surely earn us the censureof orthodox scholars. Many of these gentlemen believe they alone have the rightand ability to teach and write about theological matters, and that priestscannot err in matters of the Law. Thus, they will attack anyone who is not amember of their guild the moment he dares to speak on such topics. They willcriticize, fault, judge and condemn in a most unpleasant manner anything hemight say that doesn't conform with their ideas. And if they cannot findanything in his statement to criticize or condemn, they are mean enough tosimply reject the author's work because he is not a member of their order andwas not educated like them in their discipline at the best schools, which theyfeel gives them the privilege of speaking and writing about theology. However,neither Christ the Lord nor his disciples came from their order of priests andtheologians, nor did Christ and His true teachers and disciples attend the topschools of theology. Rather, the disciples studied in the school of Christ andHis Holy Spirit. Therefore, no upstanding and enlightened theologian wouldapprove of the insane and downright idolatrous illusions of the orthodoxheretic-makers. And so we will not expect a reasonable judgment from them, basedon the rules of Christ. Their mocking and faulting will not affect us. And so,let us move on to our principle purpose here.81 Written for Georg Von Welling, Opus Mago-Cabalisticum Et Theosophicum.Newburyport, Massachusetts: Weiser Books, 2006.2 Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Faust, trans. by George Madison Priest, New York:Alfred A.

WaiteEven the most Pollyanna-ish among us will not deny that there is muchunpleasantness in the world around us; wars and disease, hatred and discord.There seems to be no limit to the crimes and atrocities our kind is capable andwilling to inflict on others of our kind. It's easy for us to disparage as“evil” the fundamental character of human nature, and ultimately resignourselves to lives of quiet desperation, surviving day-to-day by means of ourmoment-to-moment success in choosing the lesser evils.It is easy to grow cynical and discouraged when pondering the state of affairson planet Earth. The nightly newscasts lay out a dinnertime smorgasbord ofmilitary conflicts, famines, civil unrest, and economic ruin. It is cold comfortto observe that there has never been a season in all of recorded history thathas been free of such suffering, injustice, and shameful displays of “man'sinhumanity to man.” One can argue quite convincingly that civilization, indeedall human enterprise has always been, and forever shall be, driven by the crueland ignoble motives of greed and avarice of the human heart.It is also not too much of a jump in logic to assume that all thisunpleasantness (which we are helpless to resist or vanquish) is the result of amaster plan hatched by villains whose embrace of absolute evil has reachedperverted spiritual dimensions.Everywhere we turn—on the internet, in the newspapers, on television andradio—conspiracy theories and theorists assail us with plots and intrigueshatched by governments and industries (and secret societies that run thegovernments and industries) who allegedly use information as dis-information toconfuse and befuddle us, making us pawns in some monstrous plan for worlddomination, space alien cuisine, or something transcendently naughty.Ironically, many of these conspiracy theories and theorists seem to have fallenvictim to their own distrust of the obvious, and with the wagging finger ofaccusatory paranoia have singled out the very organizations and movements mostvocally opposed to the evils they fear and despise. Such is danger of trying toout dis-inform the dis-informed.Thus, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, and the Illuminati, societies andmovements that were founded upon the most admirable ideals of freedom of thoughtand the “Brotherhood of Man” are now the “agents of Satan,” or the monolithicChurch, or the world bankers, or the Jews, or reptilian space aliens.At the same time, unless we have allowed ourselves to be completely overwhelmedby the depressing conditions wrought by the world's evils we are forced toacknowledge what appears to be evidence of evolving consciousness—in particularthe breathtaking advances in human thought, arts, and sciences—quantum leaps inconsciousness that in a few short decades have elevated the conversation fromarguments over how many days it took for God to create heaven and earth, towhether or not a particle traveling faster than the speed of light movesbackwards in time.The Theosophic and magical movements of the late 19th century optimisticallylatched on to the idea that such a master plan does indeed exist—that it is“good”—that it is facilitated by enlightened beings who have transcendently“good” motives, and that humanity advances and evolves spiritually at leastpartially because of their secret efforts on our behalf. Such is the premise(and the promise) of The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary.The inimitable occultist and writer, Arthur Edward Waite, (who suggested thetext to a young and impressionable Aleister Crowley) offers us most thorough anderudite introduction to this edition of the classic work. And it is withparticular pleasure that I present it now to you.1 Written for Karl von Eckartshausen, trans by Isabel de Steiger, The Cloud Uponthe Sanctuary, Weiser Book Collection edition, Newburyport, Massachusetts:Weiser Books, 2012."},{"pageContent":"LIGHT ON THE PATHImage [images/line.jpg]INTRODUCTION TO THE 2012 EDITION1The years between 1875 and 1904 stand as a watershed moment in the history ofspiritual movements—it was the moment when the sublime mystical sciences of theEast cautiously reached out to touch the awakening consciousness of thematerialist West and for a moment it looked as if the meeting heralded thebeginning of a beautiful friendship. 1875 saw the births of both theTheosophical Society and Aleister Crowley, but it was also starting gun of amigration of ‘oriental’ ideas and an assortment of “gurus” to the shores ofEngland and America. In 1893, a World's Parliament of Religions was held as partof the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The two-week event was the firstmajor interfaith conclave of spiritual leaders from both the Eastern and Westerntraditions. Christian Science's Mary Baker Eddy was in attendance, as well asSwami Vivekananda. It could be argued that the ecumenical, new thought, new age,mind-body-spirit movements of the 20th and 21st centuries were born in Chicagoin those warm days of September 1893.It must have been a very exciting time—a season that held the promise of a worldunited by the common bond of those sublimely simple and universal principles atthe heart of all religions and spiritual movements. Tragically, the insanity ofthe First World War would all but strangle the child of this enlightenedoptimism, and the decades that followed would more darkly cloud the vision toall but the most die-hard esotericists.Eighteen eighty-eight saw the birth of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn inEngland and in the years that followed a number of documents began to circulatein the magical and Theosophical circles. For all appearance these works had beenpoised, waiting in the wings as it were, for the precisely right moment to bepublished. The 1897 Mathers translation of The Sacred Magick of Abramelin theMage was one such text that caused a stir among English speaking magicians. Itmore than any other single work elevated the magical practice of the Middle Agesto the level of the self-transformational disciplines of the East. But for theless flamboyant the tiny book “Light on the Path” written down by M.C.materialized on the scene and was instantly hailed as a modern sacred text parexcellence.M.C. was the noted Theosophist and prolific author Mabel Collins (1851 –1927)but she does not take direct credit for its authorship. Indeed, althoughspeculations still abound, it is still not completely clear who might have“dictated” the text or what the circumstances for its creation actually were.The work must stand on its own. It is breathtakingly eloquent in its simplicity,reminiscent of the profound and subtle elegance of the Tao Te Ching.To understand the level of awe in which this little volume was held bycontemporary luminaries I can do no better than to refer to the Introductionpenned by Yogi Ramacharaka (William Walker Atkinson) which would later appear inthe Yogi Publications edition. The wisdom of Light on the Path is timeless andas fresh and relevant today as it was at the turn of the twentieth century. Toboth neophyte and adept alike I offer my sincere hope that this little treasurewill be a beacon of Light on your Path.The following treatise, “Light on the Path,” is a classic among occultists, andis the best guide known for those who have taken the first step on the Path ofAttainment. Its writer has veiled the meaning of the rules in the way alwayscustomary to mystics, so that to the one who has no grasp of the Truth thesepages will probably appear to be a mass of contradictions and practically devoidof sense. But to the one who a glimpse of the inner life has been given, thesepages will be a treasury of the rarest jewels, and each time he opens it he willsee new gems.To many this little book will be the first revelation of that which they havebeen all their lives blindly seeking. To many it will be the first bit ofspiritual bread given to satisfy the hunger of the soul. To many it will be thefirst cup of water from the spring of life given to quench the thirst which hasconsumed them. Those for whom this book is intended will recognize its message,and after reading it they will never be the same as before it came to them. Asthe poet has said: “Where I pass all my children know me,” and so will theChildren of the Light recognize this book as for them. As for the others, we canonly say that they will in time be ready for this great message.The book is intended to symbolize the successive steps of the neophyte inoccultism as he progresses in the lodge work. The rules are practically thosewhich were give to the neophytes in the great lodge of the Brotherhood inancient Egypt, and which for generations have been taught by guru to chela inIndia. The peculiarity of the rules herein laid down, is that their innermeaning unfolds as the student progresses on The Path. Some will be able tounderstand a number of these rules, while the others will see but dimly even thefirst steps. The student, however, will find that when he has firmly planted hisfoot on one of these steps, he will find the one just ahead becoming dimlyilluminated, so as t give him confidence to take the next step.Let none be discouraged; the fact that this book attracts you is the message toyou that it is intended for you, and will in time unfold its meaning. Read itover and over often, and you will find veil after veil lifted, though veil uponveil still remains between you and the Absolute. It will be noticed by you thatthe words of the book will remain in your mind, and will become a part of you.You will learn to love this book, and will want it always with you. It will beas music to your soul. To those who know not this book, we would say that it notour work, but was written down by “M. C.,” a student of occultism, presumably atthe dictation of someone high in authority. Its words and teaching bear witnessto the nobility and grandeur of the soul who aspired to it. To us, it is as aguiding star. May it be the same to you. Peace be unto you.Yogi Ramacharaka1 Written for M. C.

Some, like IsraelRegardie, Robert Anton Wilson, Phyllis Seckler, Grady McMurtry, Helen ParsonsSmith, Christopher S. Hyatt, and David Wilson (aka S. Jason Black), have (atleast for the moment) shuffled off this mortal coil; many others, I'm delightedto say, are still here and continue to bless us with their work, wisdom andexperience. Occupying a prominent and respected chair among this august circleof adepts is my dear friend, Donald Michael Kraig.2I will no doubt embarrass him with my comments. If so, I must be resolute andremind him that it was he who invited me to pen the Foreword to this new editionof his classic tome, Modern Magick, and that he'll just have to swallow (likethe good boy he is) the undiluted medicine of my praise and admiration.The measure of a magician is not to be weighed against the number of books he orshe has written; or the amount of money amassed, or the number of fawningdisciples held in tow (although Donald continues to earn a respectable trove ofall these things). In the final analysis, the only meaningful credential amagician can present to the world is the magician. Has he or she evolved throughthe agency of magick? Is he or she a wiser, more balanced, more disciplined,more enlightened, more engaged, more self-aware individual? Is the individual abetter friend, a better teacher, a better citizen, a better human being becauseof his or her involvement in this most personal of spiritual art forms? Mostimportantly, does the magician have the ability to laugh at magician?The world of magical literature is blessed with an abundance of scholars andhistorians. Magick is, after all, an extremely colorful and fascinating subject.Unfortunately, the field is also cursed with individuals who appear to beexploiting their photographic memories and encyclopedic knowledge of esotericanot as a tool of self mastery and self discovery, but as a vehicle in which toflee themselves and a life of honest self-examination—individuals who make theart of magick their lives, rather than applying the art to make their livesmagick.If I were to give the novice magician one piece of advice at the beginning ofhis or her career, it would be, “Study and practice magick, but please! Have alife!” When shopping for instruction, avoid like the plague the pompous,pretentious, paranoid poseur, with little or no sense of humor—steer clear ofthe “master” who has no interests or vocabulary outside the confines of his orher self-referential magical universe. Most especially, shun those who spend aninordinate amount of time and ink attacking the character and work of rivalmagicians, authors, teachers and/or anyone else who would dare write and teachon the same subjects.Donald Michael Kraig is the antithesis of such creatures. It is evidenteverywhere in his writing. He is profoundly secure in the knowledge of who andwhat he is. He gives generously of the knowledge and wisdom he has gained fromyears of study and practice. More importantly he gives generously of himself. Inthe final analysis, it is all the magician has to give.1 Written for Donald Michael Kraig, Modern Magick: Twelve Lessons in the HighMagickal Arts, St. Paul, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications; revised, expandeded., 2010.2 This written in 2010.

H. MÜLLER'SPOLARIA. THE GIFT OF THE WHITE STONE;2“The above declaration is known as the ‘Oath of the Abyss.’ Whosoever utters itwith full magical intention invokes a terrible curse upon themselves, for theyare either hopelessly deluded and committing an act of supreme spiritualpresumption; or they have balanced and perfected all aspects of what most of usconsider to be the “self” and are now prepared to take the last irrevocable steptoward becoming more than human. In both cases, the world will presume they havegone mad.”On the summer solstice of 1916 Charles Robert John Stansfeld Jones (FraterAchad)3, an accountant from Vancouver, and A∴ A∴Neophyte (1° = 10□)4, formallytook the Oath of the Abyss, thereby laying claim (in accordance with thetraditions of that august fraternity) to the initiatory title Master of theTemple (8° = 3).Jones dutifully reported this event in a telegram to Aleister Crowley, hissuperior in the Order, who nine months earlier in September labored in vain (hethought) to beget a child with his “Scarlet Woman” Jeanne Robert Foster.5Crowley was amazed by circumstances of Jones' initiation and the timing of theevent. He wrote in his Confessions . . .“Every cause must produce its proper effect; so that, in this case, the son whomI willed to beget came to birth on a plane other than the material . . . What Ihad really done was therefore to beget a Magical Son. So, precisely nine monthsafterwards, that is, at the summer solstice of 1916, Frater O.I.V. (the Motto ofC. Stansfeld Jones as a Probationer) entirely without my knowledge became a Babeof the Abyss.”6Jones' remarkable success also represented in Crowley's mind a stunningvalidation of the A∴A ∴ system of magical attainment. The proud “father” gushed. . .“I could only conclude that his success was almost wholly due to the excellenceof the system which I had given to the world. In short, it was the justificationof my whole life, the unique and supreme reward of my immeasurable toils.”7Crowley's confidence in Achad was further bolstered by a string of discoveriesJones would soon make—vital Qabalistic keys that unlocked fundamental mysteriesof The Book of the Law8 and the Aeon of Horus. Some of these were outlined in atiny book, Liber 319 which Jones sent Crowley in 1919. Crowley couldn't behappier with the revelations; “Your key opens the Palace.”10It seemed in Achad Crowley truly had found the “one” foretold in The Book of theLaw; “. . . the one to follow thee;”11 the one “. . . who shall discover the Keyof it all.”12—the magical child and brilliant heir-apparent to the Great Beastand Prophet of the Aeon of Horus.Perhaps he had. But the father-son relationship these two great adepts sharedwould not endure to the end. Eventually it would become strained to the breakingpoint, and amazingly, we know the exact day this beautiful relationship began tosour. We have a written record of the precise moment—the moment Frater Achadexperienced either a quantum leap in consciousness, or else stepped off thezenith edge of supernal adeptship into the abyss of occult madness.13It happened on May 31st, 1922 as Jones was writing the fourth chapter of Q. B.L. or The Bride's Reception—a moment that would literally turn the Qabalisticuniverse upside down.“I had written thus far (May 31st, 1922 E. V.) when I was rewarded with theopening up of SECRETS so wonderful that they have changed my whole conception ofthe Plan of the Qabalah, and have indeed proved not alone a LIGHTNING FLASH todestroy THE HOUSE OF GOD but a SERPENT of WISDOM to reconstruct it, and yetagain a STAR which explains all SYMBOLISM. This matter being of suchTRANSCENDENT IMPORTANCE will be dealt with in the form of Appendixes to thisVolume which will be obtainable under certain special conditions. Meanwhile themain plan of this book will be followed as originally intended, since it isnecessary that the Student should have a clear and comprehensive grasp of theold system before he could appreciate the New.”14Fortunately for us, Jones did indeed follow the original plan of of the textthrough to completion and saved elucidations on his revolutionary theories forthe book's Appendixes. This thoughtful gesture, in my opinion, renders the maintext of Q.B.L. the clearest, most understandable, and practical introduction tothe study of Qabalah written to that date. It also effectively prepares the moreQabalistically educated reader for the provocative ideas presented in theAppendixes—concepts that suggest that the traditional allocation of the lettersof the Hebrew alphabet upon the 22 Paths of the Tree of Life should be inessence reversed in their positions.Such a suggestion isn't necessarily heretical, especially when posited from thepoint of view of a Master of the Temple (8° = 3□), an adept whose consciousnessabides above the Abyss that separates the Supernal Triad of the Tree of Life,(Kether-Chokmah-Binah)—an Abyss below which division is the result ofcontradiction, and above which contradiction is unity.Crowley, however, was not impressed with what he considered to be Achad's flawedand immature grasp of this “rule of Contraries.” He would later write,15“But this rule must be applied with skill and discretion, if error is to beavoided. It is a lamentable fact that worthy Zelator of A∴ A., one Frater Achad,having been taught (patiently enough) by the Seer to use this formula, was luredby his vanity to suppose that he had discovered it himself, and proceeded toapply it indiscriminately. He tried to stand the Serpent of Wisdom on its head,and argued that as he was a (1° = 10□), of the Order, he must equally be a (10°= 1□)! As The Book of Lies [chap. 63]16 says, “I wrenched DOG backwards to findGod; now God barks!” He would have been better advised to reverse his adored ONEand taken a dose of ENO!”(“ONE” in Hebrew is “Achad.” “ENO” is the brand name of an English laxative.)A year later, in 1923 upon receipt of Achad's next book, The Egyptian Revival,Crowey voiced in his diary his exasperation with the direction his “son” wastaking.“What line shall I take with regard to Frater Achad's books? (I have justreceived The Egyptian Revival & a threat of others.) The point is this—thebooks—even apart from the absurd new attribution proposed for the Paths—are sohopelessly bad in almost every way—English, style, sense, point of view, oheverything! –yet they may do good to people they are written for. My realconcern is lest he get too much ubris [Hubris] and come a real cropper.”17His fears become (at least in Crowley's mind) a reality. He wrote in Magick inTheory and Practice,18“One who ought to have known better tried to improve the Tree of Life by turningthe Serpent of Wisdom upside down! Yet he could not even make his schemesymmetrical: his little remaining good sense revolted at the supreme atrocities.Yet he succeeded in reducing the whole Magical Alphabet to nonsense, and shewingthat he had never understood its real meaning.“The absurdity of any such disturbance of the arrangement of the Paths isevident to any sober student from such examples as the following. Binah, theSupernal Understanding, is connected with Tiphereth, the Human Consciousness, byZain, Gemini, the Oracles of the Gods, or the Intuition. That is, theattribution represents a psychological fact: to replace it by The Devil iseither humour or plain idiocy. Again, the card “Fortitude,” Leo, balancesMajesty and Mercy with Strength and Severity: what sense is there in putting“Death,” the Scorpion, in its stead? There are twenty other mistakes in the newwonderful illuminated-from-on-high attribution; the student can therefore besure of twenty more laughs if he cares to study it.”19But tell us how you really feel Mr. Crowley!Of course, it can be argued that Crowley was simply jealous of Achad'sdiscoveries, the speed of his initiatory advancement, and his independentspirit. After all, Crowley could be viciously cruel and petty. It must bepointed out, however, that no matter how bitterly he railed against Jones' newdoctrines he always acknowledged and praised his role as the discoverer of theQabalistic key to Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law.The fact remains that Jones' behavior as the years progressed lead many tobelieve that he suffered bouts of mental illness. Such things are hard to prove,especially where magicians are concerned, and should not necessarily castnegative aspersions upon the quality of his work done during healthier times, ornegate the real possibility such behavior manifested because Jones wasenraptured in inscrutably high levels of consciousness.Yes, he would join the Roman Catholic Church in an attempt to transmute thisworld religion into one that accepts the Law of Thelema and the formula of theAge of Horus. But was that an act of insanity or simply the bold and audaciousact of a Thelemic hero? Yes, he would be put away for flinging aside hisraincoat to expose his nakedness to the masses of Vancouver. But are the nakedSadhus of India imprisoned for indecency?It is easy for us (especially those of us whose initiatory careers place usconspicuously low on the Tree of Life) to point to these incidents and speculatehow Achad's premature advance to Master of the Temple caused his ultimate fallinto the madness of Daäth (the false Sephira, “Knowledge” that resides in theAbyss itself) to become a Black Brother. In truth, very few people on the faceof the earth are qualified to make that judgment. Certainly not I.Achad himself, however, gives us a chilling hint of his thoughts on this matterin a 1948 letter to Gerald Yorke.“If this New Æon is what it seems to be, it will have lifted the Curse of theMagus and destroyed the Glamour and Lies and Madness of the Supernal Paths. Thatwould leave one in Daäth—and represent real Attainment—the becoming one withThose Who Know.”20Speculation and controversy aside, Frater Achad remains one of the mostinteresting and important magical figures of the 20th century. His initialQabalistic discoveries continue to yield new and provocative ideas concerningThe Book of the Law and other Holy Books of Thelema. Most exciting, in myopinion, is work currently under way on development of a Qabalah based upon theletters of the English alphabet,21 which, while not an Achad “discovery” per se,is based in part on his Liber 31.Q. B. L. or The Bride's Reception is a masterpiece of Qabalah and controversy.Its importance to the world of modern occult literature can be measured not onlyby its value as a remarkably understandable textbook of the fundamentalprinciples of Qabalah, but also because it offers us a rare glimpse into theheart and mind of a brilliant and sincere seeker of wisdom and truth.1 Written for Frater Achad, Q.B.L.: Being a Qabalistic Treatise on the Natureand Use of the Tree of Life, Newburyport, Massachusetts: Weiser Books, 2005.2 From The Starry Wisdom, by Lon Milo DuQuette, Preface to Polaria, by W.

After all, I have spent the better part of myadult life shunning those centres of pestilence who dared discuss or interpretthe contents of Liber AL vel Legis.3 I was especially distrustful of the poorsouls who, in exchange for a coronation ceremony and the deed to certain realestate in Scotland, were prepared to assume the mantle of spiritual leadershipof the world. Indeed, by 1983 my collection of letters from individualsrevealing themselves to be the incarnation of Aleister Crowley, or the “one tofollow,” or “. . . his child & that strangely . . .” or the child of somebody'sbowels,” rivaled that of Dr. Regardie.4 Indeed, shortly before his death thedear man and I even entertained the idea of pooling our letters andcommunications in a book called Liber Nutz.The authors of nearly every one of these colorful documents claimed to have“cracked the code” of The Book of the Law and as proof offered elaborateexplanations of the string of numbers and letters (words) that begin the 76thverse of the Second Chapter of Liber AL vel Legis:4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L.For example: the father of one “one to follow” was named Kenneth. The Hebrewword for father being “AB” it was perfectly obvious that ABK referred to hisfather—whose address at the time of the nativity of his child (& that strangely)was 4637 GILMORE ST. But, owing to phenomena arising from the obliquity of theearth's axis between 1904 and the date of his birth, the actual coordinates ofhis birth were shifted to just across the street at 4638. “What more proof couldyou want?” he asked. I didn't answer, but I did call Regardie and shared thestory. We laughed like schoolyard bullies.Today I am somewhat ashamed of my arrogant dismissals of what I now see assincere and poignant pleas for spiritual validation from seekers who weredesperately trying far better than I to apply the complex and colorful mythos ofThelema directly to their own lives. At the time, however, my cynicism hardenedwith each new revelation and so did my disdain for these stillborn prophets withtheir roaring narcissism, delusions of grandeur, defective Hebrew, disjointedgematria, faulty arithmetic, poor command of the English language, and the utterincapacity to grasp the fact that whoever read their letters would immediatelyconclude they were mad as hatters.Like most Thelemites, I did my own share of puttering. In the late 70s I tookthree yellow legal pads and determined the numeration for each word of Liber AL.I did this in a very orthodox manner by treating each English letter as itsHebrew counterpart(s). This was a singularly unsatisfying project. I wasperpetually frustrated with uncertainties—uncertainty over whether or not this“t” is Tau or a Teth; or if that “x” is a Tzaddi or a Cheth, or of that “o” is aVau or an Ayin. Despair followed frustration when my wife, Constance, (who hatesthe Qabalah) continually pummeled me with the obvious fact that Liber AL was notwritten in Hebrew so why on earth should the letters of its words be translatedinto Hebrew. My defense was feeble;“For one reason,” I explained to her with sweet condescension, “to see theirrelationships to significant traditional Qabalistic words and concepts.” “Andwhere do those words and concepts come from?” she asked. (She knew the answer.She was just being mean.)“The Bible . . . mostly.” I mumbled.“Well, the Bible's not my Holy Book, and The Book of the Law doesn't need theBible to prop it up! Show me a Qabalah in English . . . one that uses The Bookof the Law and not the Bible!”Of course, she was (and is always) right. I eventually abandoned this avenue ofresearch and became, for the most part, contented to appeal exclusively toCrowley's writings for insights and inspiration. As far as exploring the Englishalphabet—I toyed half-heartedly with Liber Trigrammaton the same way a childpushes his broccoli around his plate, but that was it. I did, however, make onepathetic (yet remarkably successful) foray into Liber AL practical magick.I projected the numbers and letters from II. 76 upon a kamea of Sol, thusly:4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A LI printed it on gold/yellow card stock and laminated it in plastic. Our firsttest-run of this talisman was to see if it could help us find a new place tolive. This may not sound like very serious magick, but if you've ever attemptedto find a reasonably inexpensive house to lease in Newport Beach California thenI'm afraid you don't really know the meaning of the words “impossible miracle.”Our technique was simplicity itself. We taped the square to the dashboard of ourcar and drove around the neighborhood where we most desired to live. As rentalrates in the new neighborhood were completely out of the price range we couldafford, we wisely armed ourselves with a bottle of wine to assure we would notbe dissuaded by common sense.Without going into details (that are fascinating to us, but I'm sure are oflittle interest to the reader) I will simply report that in the ensuingtwenty-five years we have needed to celebrate this ritual six times to locatenew homes. It has always worked to the amazement of our neighbors and friendsand to our own immense satisfaction.I mention this magick square not to prove what a clever boy I was or to tout thepower inherent in The Book of the Law. I bring it up only to point out therather sad spiritual state into which I had allowed myself to drift. There Iwas, a hot-shot Thelemite. I militantly preached that Liber AL vel Legis was therevelatory instrument of the age. I studied it daily and supported that study byperforming rituals based upon its deities and formulae; by reading,memorization, and meditation. I was the best damned Book of the Law thumper intown! But the most practical thing I had ever done with it was to concoct acrude talisman for house hunting! Hell! Why not just get a sun-bleached buffalobone, scratch a few markings on it with a sharp stone, and hurl it at the moon?Well, maybe I'm being a bit hard on myself. The young fool, having neither thewit to see the enormity of his ignorance, nor the good sense to forsake thequest, eventually grew to be an old fool. Don't get me wrong. I don't think Iwasted a minute on my magical education. I may have early on abandoned mytinkering with the Chapter II, verse 76, but I did spend the next twenty-fiveyears or so immersing myself in the words, images and concepts that form thebuilding-blocks of the magnificent edifice that is Thelema.I speak particularly of the treasures to be found in Liber AL vel Legis and the13 Holy Books. What an absolute thrill it is, at this rather late point in mymagical life, to finally get a glimpse of what certainly appears to me to be themathematical mortar that unites these great scriptural stones. Please do notthink that I am presuming to speak for anyone other than myself when I voice mycomments in this place. I am not writing as a spokesperson for any of the fineorganizations to which I belong, and whose kind forbearance suffer mymembership. However, as an individual, I cannot hide my personal enthusiasmconcerning the English Qaballa (based upon the ALWHS . . . etc. progression) andmarvelous work being done by Jake Stratton-Kent and others who are continuing todevelop and enrich it. They deserve the admiration and thanks of every studentof modern magick.Liber 187 is a particularly brilliant example how rituals and exercises can becreated from this marvelous structure. After I read it for the first time Iwrote Jake and told him “It's so clean, it squeaks!” It is indeed so clean itsqueaks—English words and phrases relating to other English words andphrases—magick words—familiar words that course through the dynamic matrix of asmall collection of spiritual literature that I personally hold sacred.Perhaps an old dog can learn a new trick or two. I certainly intend to find out.1 Written for Jake Stratton-Kent.

It's a way of looking at things. It's a wayof organizing your universe so neatly that you eventually discover your ownplace in it.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD2I am an old hippie. In 1967, however, I was a young hippie. I had very longhair, dressed in colorful sweatshirts and karate pants. I went barefoot a lot.More importantly, I had enthusiastically embarked (with the aide of psychoactivechemicals and the works of Paramahansa Yogananda, Alan Watts, Dr. Timothy Leary,and Beatles) upon a journey of self-exploration and discovery that continues tothis day.The mid 1960s were a cosmic aberration—a crack in space-time. It was certainly aremarkable season of history; an exhilarating and magical age to be alive andyoung. In that golden moment it was possible for a shallow young bumpkin fromNebraska—possessed of no more intelligence or wisdom than a turnip—to stumblenaively into the sanctum sanctorum of Montsalvat, and with cud-chewingnonchalance take a good long slurp from the Holy Grail. I came away from thoseearly psychedelic experiences with the Technicolor realization that God isconsciousness—consciousness is the secret of existence—consciousness is thesecret of life—and that I am consciousness.Mind-expanding drugs were just what was needed to blast open the heavilybarricaded doors of my constipated and medieval perception, but once that gatewas duly and truly breached I was faced with the fact that the obstacles thatremained on my path would be far more subtle and difficult to remove. Theseocclusions would require the use of more delicate ordnance. For spiritualnutrients I grazed upon the obligatory classics of Buddhist and Hinduliterature, and I graduated from drugs to the quiet disciplines of meditationand eastern mysticism. I cut my hair, went vegetarian and fancied myself a yogi.Yes! I was all prepared to be a first-class eastern mystic—at least I thoughtthat's where I was going. Something, however, just didn't seem right. On anintellectual level I had no difficulty grasping the mystical concept that I (myreal self) was something profoundly more than my body and my thoughts and myemotions. I understood that my real self was in essence the perfect reflectionof the absolute and Supreme Consciousness (that great “whatever-it-is” withinwhich resides everything, and of which the manifested universe is just anexpression). It was perfectly clear to me that if I could only strip away allthe things that I was not then the only thing remaining would be exactly that! .. . The Only Thing—and that only thing would be both the Supreme Consciousnessand me!This, I concluded with youthful certainty was what eastern mystics were shootingfor. This level of consciousness is the profound “nothingness” of Nirvana—thewall-to-wall totality of Samadhi. All I had to do was strip down to my mostnaked me—and when I got there my “I”-ness would disappear into the big“whatever-it-is”-ness of the Supreme Consciousness.But alas, I was a very poor meditator. Oh, I could look like a pretty goodmeditator. I could sit still in my asana for long periods of time with a fullteacup and saucer balanced on my head.3 My skill in pranayama was admirable, andI could hold the clear image of working pendulum clock in my mind's eye foreternal micro-seconds at a time. But something was profoundly wrong with mywork; and I'll wager that the astute reader has probably already identifiedexactly what was wrong with my view of this whole enlightenment business. Here .. . I'll say it for you . . .“Mr. DuQuette, for a mystic you use the word ‘I’ an awful lot. Aren't yousuppose to lose your ego as you near enlightenment?”Bingo! Guilty as charged! I knew, of course, that eventually we must transcendidentity with the ego to become the absolute Supreme Consciousness (just as wemust transcend our identity with the body and the emotions and the mind). Butfor the life of me I couldn't remove the objective “me” in the subjective“dissolution-of-me” process. I couldn't shake the idea of how cool I was goinglook gaining enlightenment—how cool I was going to look with no ego!At first I felt a little embarrassed about all this. But, as seriousself-condemnation has never been one of my virtues, I soon came to the giddyrealization that I was simply trying to play eastern software on my westernhardware. Perhaps I was hardwired by nature and western civilization not to seekdivine union by stripping away all the things I am not, but instead by unitingmyself with all the things that I am. Profound emptiness and profound fullnessare one-and-the-same. The disciplines of the east oblige the mystic to lookinward for union with God; and that's great for the eastern, introspectivedisposition. The western psyche, on the other hand, is inclined to lookoutwards. We love scripture and ritual drama that gives outward expression toinward realities. In either case the supreme goal is the same. Which approachone takes is simply a matter of one's cultural temperament. I'm as western asthey come. So I'm an “out-y.”I turned my attention to what the West might have to offer, and began my searchfor ‘western software’—a western equivalent to the Tao—a western equivalent toZen, and I more or less found what I was looking for in the Qabalah.My introduction to the Qabalah was the indirect result of my youthfulinvolvement with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC.4 Encouraged by my older brotherMarc, I had joined the Order in the early 1970s in hopes it would give mesomething spiritual and wholesome to occupy my nervous energy as I transitionedfrom the recording artist's life of sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll to thedocility of a domesticated husband and father.AMORC's monograph teachings were delivered promptly each week by mail and werean offbeat combination of solitary ritual meditations and Junior High scienceand chemistry experiments. Much as I had hated school I found the AMORC materialoddly fascinating and inspiring. I was nothing short of ecstatic when I attendedmy first “convocation” service at a local lodge in Long Beach. I discovered thenand there that I absolutely loved dressing up in spooky robes, intoning strangechants, and strutting around in the dark.As I ascended up the degree structure of the organization I learned that certainmystical perks could be redeemed. I was informed by a fellow member that when Ireached a certain degree level I would qualify to order and receive additionalmonograph instructions in certain mystically related subjects. One suchextracurricular monograph series was on “The Holy Kabbalah,” and I impatientlyawaited the time when I would be qualified to register for the teachings. Whenthat day finally arrived I sent off a money order for the course and eagerlyawaited my initiation into the mysteries of the Holy Kabbalah.The six monographs arrived in one envelope and I read all six in one sitting.There was the brief historical sketch and a bibliography, but no meditations, norituals, or exercises. Indeed, there was nothing that made any sense to me atall. In fact, most of the text was filled with dire warnings to the studentabout what the Kabbalah is not. I cannot resist satirically paraphrasing:Kabbalah is spelled “Kabbalah.” If you run across literature that spells it withonly one “B” it is not really Kabbalah and you should run away from it. If yourun across literature that spells it with a “Q” or a “C” or indeed in any wayother than “Kabbalah” it is not real Kabbalah and you should stop reading andrun away.Kabbalah is not something that is written down so don't expect to discoveranything about it by reading stuff. Kabbalah is only passed orally from onepious Jewish man over the age of 40 but under 80, who is rich enough to have alot of leisure time to devote to studying Kabbalah, to another Jewish man overthe age of 40 but under 80 who is also rich enough to have a lot of leisure timeto devote to studying Kabbalah.Kabbalah has nothing to do with a diagram called the Tree of Life. . . . If yousee a Tree of Life . . . run away! Kabbalah has nothing to do with the TarotCards. . . . If you see Tarot cards . . . run away! Kabbalah has nothing to dowith magic . . . If you see anything to do with magic . . . run away!Kabbalah is the secret, esoteric, hidden, forbidden, furtive, and most likelydangerous study of the Holy Bible and it is certainly not for presumptuous youngdilettantes like you. In fact you should be embarrassed for even being curiousas to what Kabbalah might be about. Thank you for waiting two years for thesemonographs and for sending $15.00. Now . . . RUN AWAY!5That was in 1972. Things have changed in the world of Qabalah! Kabbalah, Cabala,Qabalah is everywhere; books, lessons, teachings, organizations, even videos,movies, and CDs can be purchased, attended, viewed and listened to whenever youlike. What remains a rarity, however, are competent, practical instructions asto how to actually incorporate the fundamentals of Qabalah into one's daily lifeand routine. For me it has been a hit and miss comedy of errors and accidentaltriumphs, and perhaps that's how it should always be. But it is clear to me thatthe work needn't be harder on the poor student than absolutely necessary.How can today's serious student actually begin the process of inoculatinghimself or herself with the virus of qabalistic thought—that divine dis-easethat eventually incubates in the soul and hatches as illumination? How does amodern mystic go about connecting everything in the universe with everythingelse until there is no “anything else” left?In an attempt to answer those questions I wrote a little book that I whimsicallycalled, The Chicken Qabalah6. It was quite frankly the text I wished I couldhave read when I first began my Qabalah adventure. Over the years the book hasbeen well received, and for the most part I am satisfied that my labor has beenrewarded. I am especially gratified that it was chosen by Ms. Anita Kraft as oneof the source books for her marvelous Qabalah Workbook for Magicians. Her workis that rarest of magical tools, an elegant, hands-on course in practicalQabalah. A book that obliges you to roll up your sleeves and do things with theQabalah. I am particularly thrilled because reading her book has afforded me theopportunity to witness a new generation of qabalistic magician whose brillianceshines not only from the fact that she “gets it” in the traditional sense, butalso because she is pushing the technology forward in fresh, innovative, andexhilarating ways. I am proud to be in a small measure associated with itspublication.In closing I would like to leave you with the last seventy-two words uttered myfavorite Qabalah teacher and (until his mysterious disappearance a few yearsago) our family's life-long spiritual counselor, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. Thedear man once told me, “Ron”—he never could remember my name—” Ron, the Qabalahis not a belief system. It's a way of looking at things. It's a way oforganizing your universe so neatly that you eventually discover your own placein it.”It is my sincerest wish that this little book will aid and comfort you as youorganize your universe so neatly that you will eventually discover your ownplace in it.Bless you all.

Indeed, I was counseled that if Iwere to use the cards to tell fortunes it would cripple me spiritually. I tookmy teachers at their word and proceeded for the next three years to use thecards for meditation purposes only.Part of the school's curriculum was the requirement that each student paint hisor her own deck of tarot cards trumps. The course provided an unpainted deck ofthe 22 trumps bearing clean black outlines of the figures on each card and verystrict coloring instructions. Each card took two weeks to color during whichtime certain texts and meditations were assigned. I must admit that at the endof forty-four weeks I knew every detail of the cards.The mystical power inherent in the images was apparent from the first weeks ofmy study. The evening I completed coloring The Fool would become one of the mostmemorable of nights of my life. During the night I experienced the mostmarvelous vision. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced (even in the60s!). It was so intense that even after I woke up and turned on the light, theliving images continued to play across the screen of my vision.I won't bore you with the curiously personal details of this nocturnalinitiation. It is enough to say that it was an initiation—not an initiation intothe bricks and mortar “order” that mailed me my monographs each week, but intothe “temple” of tarot itself. I knew without a shadow of doubt that my two weekswith The Fool card had reprogrammed my psyche and triggered a glimpse of ahigher lever of consciousness. What would become of me when I finished the wholedeck? I thought.Now, over thirty years later, tarot continues to play a central role in my life.It is my constant companion. Its perfect Qabalistic structure and constructionis a constant source of wonder and illumination. It is the spyglass, counselor,and commentator of an examined life, and I view the streaming events of myever-changing existence as the shuffling, spreading, and reshuffling of thecards. My relationship with the cards has long ago transcended the stage of, “Ohmy! The damned Prince of Cups is beating me with the 3 of Disks again.” Thecards have ceased to be metaphoric cartoons of my intellect and reasoningprocess, and have literally become communicating angels of my intuitional life.In the language of tarot I am moving from the world of Swords to the world ofCups, and tarot gives me the secret language, the vocabulary to voice suchineffable spiritual subtleties. That is perhaps tarot's greatest gift to thestudent of the soul—the ability to communicate with the various parts of ourbeing—to give form and meaning to parts of our psyche that are formless andindefinable. The secret language. The gift of the god Thoth.I've long since abandoned my eschewing of tarot as a divinatory tool. This isnot to say that I consider my readings for other people to be a form offortunetelling. Tarot, or indeed any oracle, cannot show us the future ordirectly answer our questions. Tarot is simply vehicle of perfection, andeternal truth is revealed in perfection. Used with proper attention such oraclesserve to announce the status not of the future, but of the Great Now. It's theperson who consults the oracle who must somehow glimpse the future or hear theanswer to his or her question in that announcement.That being said, I can honestly say that I have never consciously made animportant decision based upon information I've received from a tarot reading(especially my own) or any other form of divination. This is not because I don'thave confidence in the wisdom and efficacy of oracles, but because I am aself-centered, self-involved, bull-headed old fool who seldom takes wise advicefrom any of his friends or family, let alone from a pack of cards or the role ofthe dice.I have, however, encountered adepts whose tarot insights are eminently worthy ofdecision-making counsel. Two of them, in fact, are the authors of this book forwhich I am proud to pen this brief Foreword. The Amberstones are dear friends (Iofficiated at their wedding.) and directors of one of the most respected tarotschools in the world. Their tarot credentials are impeccable, but their greatestqualification to speak with authority on this sacred subject is the fact theycomfortably embody in their lives a conspicuous level of balance, wisdom andsanity. In short, they are walking examples of lives illuminated through contactand mastery of the secret language of tarot.1 Written for Ruth Ann and Wald Amberstone The Secret Language of Tarot, YorkBeach, Maine: Weiser Books, 2008.2 The “Hermetic Qabalah” is a facet of the Hebrew Kabbalah embraced and utilizedby students of magick and the Western Mystery traditions."},{"pageContent":"TAROT AND PSYCHOLOGYSpectrums of PossibilityImage [images/line.jpg]FOREWORD TO THE 2000 EDITION1Promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thingof all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark . . . againstthe black tide of mud . . . of occultism.—FREUD WRITING TO JUNG, 1913I knew that I would never be able to accept such an attitude. What Freud seemedto mean by “occultism” was virtually everything that philosophy and religion,including the rising contemporary science of parapsychology, had learned aboutthe psyche.—JUNG'S REACTION TO FREUD'S STATEMENTFor at least five centuries the Tarot has tenaciously survived the condemnationof church, the persecution of state and the ridicule of academia. Long theinstrument of fortune-tellers and persons of dubious if not felonious character,the Tarot enters the new millennium still in the guise of a fallen angel.However, unlike Milton's rebellious protagonist, the Tarot now hoversdangerously close to redemption. I am pleased, but not at all surprised, tolearn that these ancient and evocative images are now attracting the seriousattention of modern mental health professionals. Foremost among this is ArthurRosengarten, PhD whose provocative and thoroughly readable work is the subjectof these brief words.Since the mid-nineteenth century, adepts of Western Hermeticism have attemptedto demonstrate that the Tarot is constructed in strict conformity with thefundamental principles of Hebrew mysticism known as the Kabbalah. They assertedthat images of the Tarot, especially those displayed on the 22 trump cards, arevisual personifications of various aspects of Deity which had been categorizedwith anal retentive zeal by unnamed Hebrew sages at some time in the distantpast.The ancient Hebrew philosophers built upon the scriptural premise that Man wascreated in the image of God. Later esotericists, observing the phenomena ofrepeating patterns in nature, and remembering the Hermetic axiom “as above, sobelow,” tended to agree, albeit with less parochial bias. They reasoned that ifthe images of the Tarot were metaphors of aspects of divine consciousness then,it followed, they also must be reflected on the human level as key components ofthe psyche—archetypal citizens of the mind which each of us share with ourfellows.While I do not presume to speak with any measure of authority on mattersrelating to the field of psychology, I do feel somewhat qualified to speak onmatters touching on Kabbalah and Tarot. It is clear to me that the “mystical”concept of the archetypal images of the Tarot is identical in essence with thoseof Jung's Universal Collective Unconscious. Moreover, I firmly believe thatunder certain circumstances the images of the Tarot can trigger, activate,subdue, direct, or empower the specific dynamics these archetypes represent.Regrettably, few professionals are aware of the practical potential of theTarot. Fewer still are as yet willing to risk the condemnation of colleagues byembarking upon a course of study that would enable them to skillfully employthis tool in a therapeutic environment. A master of both disciplines, Dr.Rosengarten remains somewhat immune to such concerns. He is a pioneer in thepurest sense of the word. Not only has he courageously ventured into unchartedterritory, he has lingered along the way to break ground and erect landmarks forthe benefit of those who will inevitably follow.Ironically, the antagonism, real or imagined, that exists between the Tarot andPsychology parallels in many respects the fundamental differences betweenEastern and Western mysticism. The Eastern mystic, by tradition (and perhapsbecause of temperament), is taught to quietly plunge inwardly to meet the myriadfacets of self of their own turf. Furthermore, to overcome the distractions ofmind which hinder this inner self-communion, he or she strives with ruthlessmeditative fervor to virtually assassinate the harpies of thought, creating asit were a vacuum into which pure illumination will theoretically pour.The Western mind, on the other hand, prefers to deal objectively with subjectivematters. We want to reach in, personify them, pull them out, throw them down infront of us and have it out with them here and now. But dealing objectively withinternal realities is impossible if one is unable to recognize and engage themas such. For what more perfect tool could one ask than a deck of colorfularchetypal images that can me manipulated at will in nearly infinitecombination. As the author points out:In a typical ten card spread, the chances of reproducing an exact duplicationare simply staggering when one calculates the probability from a deck of 78highly differentiated cards. But with Tarot, a transpersonal commonality isequally brought to bear upon human individuality and difference. This perhaps iswhy Tarot's light shines through all quadrants of the psychological universe andmay be applicable in varying degrees to diverse theoretical persuasions.The symbolic language of Tarot compacts multiple levels of meaning into eachcard illustration and synchronistically one soon learns that there are noaccidents in Tarot (or life), or put differently, accidents themselves areinherently meaningful. Universal themes of human experience unfold withinoriginal permutation of the Tarot matrix, reflecting countless variation oncommon myths, such as the perennial stages of human suffering and attainment,the psychological tasks and demand of human development, and the mysteries andpotentials of the human spirit.Rosengarten's landmark work spans the abyss that yawns between psychology andmysticism. Remarkably, it does so without diminishment to either art or science;indeed, both are immeasurably enriched by his unique contributions. It isobvious that this is a work written primarily for the continuing education ofmental health professionals. (Certainly its meticulous notes, exhaustivereferences, bibliography and heroic index set it apart from nearly every book onTarot ever published.) Nevertheless, we of the Tarot/metaphysical communityshould welcome it with particular gratitude and interest for it offers us a rareand entirely new look at an ancient tradition.1 Written for Arthur Rosengarten PhD, Tarot and Psychology: Sprectrums ofPossibility, Vadnais Heights, Minnesota: Paragon House, 2000."},{"pageContent":"MUSIC OF THE TAROTImage [images/line.jpg]LINER NOTES FOR THE 1998 ALBUM1For centuries the beautiful and mysterious images of the Tarot have captivatedthe imagination of Western Civilization. The earliest examples date from the14th Century and (it is commonly believed) were introduced to Europe by nomadicGypsies who used the 78 cards as a fortune-telling device. But, as modernstudents have discovered, the Tarot is much more than a parlor game; it is aliving, evolving pictorial storybook of the Divine. The entire deck isstructured and organized in concordance with the ancient principles of theHebrew Qabalah. Each card not only represents a Divine aspect of nature, butvisually triggers the corresponding psychic center in the human consciousness.MAJOR ARCANA (THE TRUMPS)PART 1: THE FOOL THROUGH THE LOVERSDivine wisdom is foolishness to we mortals. What made the pre-existent Absoluteforsake the perfect bliss of Nothingness in order to initiate creation? Wecannot answer. We only know that the Universe springs from the Great Zero.Appropriately, our odyssey begins as a babe in a blue egg; or a handsome youngFool, neither male nor female gazing guilelessly into the sky before steppingoff a precipice into a vast abyss. Tumbling through the void, the Fool becomesthe All, and is transformed into a progression of archetypal characters andimages.As the Magus, the All has become the self-conscious, directed, concentratedWill. This Cosmic Magician functions as a conduit, transferring that which isabove to that which is below. The weapons of his magick are: the Wand with whichhe creates; the Cup with which he preserves; the Dagger with which he destroys;and the Disk with which he redeems the world. His counterpart is the HighPriestess. Only the Virginal Goddess of eternity is worthy to become the GreatMother of Fertility. Her chaste truth is of such purity that it can be veiledonly by undulating waves of Light. As the Magus is the Will of creation, theHigh Priestess is the idea.The union of the Magus and the High Priestess transforms them both; she into theEmpress, the Great Mother Goddess, gate of all life; and he into the Emperor,Lord of patriarchal power, imperious director of energy. His marriage to theEmpress is of primary importance to the governance of the cosmos, for theirchild, the Hierophant, will unite the Macrocosm (the world of the Gods) with theMicrocosm (the world of humanity). He is the “God-Man,” symbol of humanevolution in the New Age; when each of us must be responsible for our ownspiritual destiny. That which is above is united and harmonized in eachindividual with that which is below. “There is no bond that can unite thedivided but love”; in The Lovers card, all of the previous Tarot charactersachieve their synthesis. Ecstasy dissolves the illusion of separateness; throughthe thundering silence comes the Oracle of the Gods.MAJOR ARCANA (THE TRUMPS)PART 2: THE CHARIOT THROUGH ARTRiding as a triumphant king, the Knight of the Holy Graal conveys the precioussecret of life in a starry, canopied Chariot. The blood is the life, cosmicequivalent of evolving DNA, carried by the Charioteer through the sea ofinfinite generations.The process of creation finds the perfect partner in the manifest Goddess ofAdjustment (Justice). With her golden scales she equilibrates all energies,forces, and principles; against the feather of her perfect truth she weighs theheart of humanity.The Hermit stands upon his lonely mountaintop and gives his light to the world.It is also he who descends into the underworld of our subconscious and, if weallow him, will guide us to the celestial heavens of super-consciousness. Fromthis spiritual vantage we see the cyclic nature of creation, an ever changing,ever increasing, ever diminishing Wheel of Fortune. The power, which turns thewheel, is the primal, undirected Lust (Strength) of solar energy, symbolized bya beautiful Goddess astride a great lion. It is she who now bears the HolyGraal.The still, blue waters that suspend the Fool as a babe, serve also to reflect.Is it you, or is it the Hanged Man who is upside down? His self-sacrifice is notan occasion for mourning. Death is life itself. The caterpillar dies to becomethe butterfly; the maiden dies to become the mother. Without the GreatTransformer there can be no new beginnings.A royal marriage, the alchemical union of opposites is celebrated in the Art(Temperance) card. Male and Female, Sun and Moon are conjoined to create theelixir of life. Fire is poured upon water and water upon fire to produce therainbow seal of a Divine covenant.MAJOR ARCANA (THE TRUMPS)PART 3: THE DEVIL THROUGH THE UNIVERSEAll matter is born from the blending of Darkness and Light. The fearsomeappearance of the Devil projects the illusion that we are hopelessly enmeshed inmaterial existence. But the material world is our school; not our prison.Ignorance and superstition are the true “devils” that would bind the humanspirit. So long as our eyes are closed, we remain in darkness. Old fears andattitudes must be destroyed like lightning struck Tower. Once illusion isannihilated, true meditation can begin. Illumination arises within like theevening Star.Like images in our dreams, the Moon is a portrait of our shifting unconscious.She appears to shine, but merely reflects the light; she appears to changeshape, yet that is only her ever changing position to the Sun, the true symbolof Life, Light, Love and Liberty. Our ancestors, in their ignorance, saw the Sunas a dying God, sacrificed daily and yearly only to resurrect each morning andeach spring. So deeply ingrained was this image, that we believed ourselves alsosubject to death . . . a death that required continual elaborate rituals toassure our “life-after-death.” In older Tarot decks this process was portrayedin the card entitled The Last Judgment. With the new Aeon, however, has come thedawn of new consciousness. We know the Sun does not die, nor does it need to beresurrected. Night, winter and death are all illusions . . . a simple shiftingof a shadow. Our spiritual identity has now shifted from the Earth to the Sun.As such, we close the cycle of Trumps by taking our proper place in theUniverse, dancing like the divine Fool in the center of the belt of the Zodiac,ready to withdraw, once again, into Nothingness.MINOR ARCANA (THE FOUR SUITS)The ancient Qabalists divided creation into four descending levels. Every aspectof Deity has its proper place within the fourfold structure, including thecelestial personages such as Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels, Angels, and yes,even human beings. In the Tarot, the four suits represent the four ElementalWorlds: Wands (Fire), Cups (Water), Swords (Air) and Disks (Earth). Within eachsuit is a Knight, a Queen, a Prince and a Princess, who represent respectivelythe fiery, watery, airy and earthly aspects of each suit. In addition to these“Court” cards, each suit has ten numbered cards; the Ace is the archetypalemblem of the suit, and Two through Ten expose the dynamic inner workings of theelement.WANDS (Fire): Representing the highest of the four worlds, the Wands symbolizethe fiery Will of the God, source of all energy and creative passion. Dominion(2); Virtue (3); Completion (4); Strife (5); Victory (6); Valor (7); Swiftness(8); and Strength (9) finally degenerate into Oppression (10) as we descend theladder of the world of Wands.CUPS (Water): As water both mirrors and absorbs light, the suit of Cups receivesthe influence of the Wands and reflects and nurtures their radiance. This is theheart and Soul of God. Love (2); Abundance (3); Luxury (4); Disappointment (5);Pleasure (6); Debauch (7); Indolence (8); and Happiness (9); dissolve uneasilyinto Satiety (10) as the work of Water is completed.SWORDS (Air): A sword slashing through the air can destroy, defend,discriminate, enforce judgment and invoke powers either for good or for evil.What better symbol for the for the perpetually all-creative Mind of God? Eventhe titles of the suit of Swords sing of the triumphs and tragedies of the mind.Peace (2); Sorrow (3); Truce (4); Defeat (5); Science (6); Futility (7);Interference (8); and Cruelty (9); end inevitably in Ruin (10); if reasonignores the influence of the will and the heart.DISKS (Earth): Disks represent the manifested material plane, lowest of the fourworlds and visible fruit of their influence. Money is a perfect example of theDisk; it is a coin, the reward of physical labor (Disks), which is directed byintellectual processes (Swords), which has been inspired by creativevisualization (Cups) and motivated by the will to achieve (Wands). All things onthe material plane are the product of this fourfold development. Change (2);Work (3); Power (4); Worry (5); Success (6); Failure (7); Prudence (8); Gain(9); and finally Wealth (10); rewards the courageous traveler at the end of ourTarot journey.But the journey has not really ended. The Tarot, often spelled Taro, is not aladder, but a wheel . . . a Rota . . . a helix, a snake swallowing its tail;perpetually beginning anew as a Great Zero.From the Divine Nothingness of the Fool to the infinite Wealth of the 10 ofDisks—the sequence repeats itself through eternity—for is it not a Great Truththat a Fool and his Money are soon parted?1 Written for David and Richard Gordon, Music of the Tarot, Sequoia Records,1998."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURTHELEMIC MAGICKImage [images/u001.jpg]the Law is for all.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Love is the law, love under will.Behold! the rituals of the old time are black.

I had traveled all night by bus from CostaMesa. It had not been a restful journey. All I could think about for every bumpymile was the initiation I was scheduled to undergo and the curious circumstancethat brought me to this moment in my life.It had taken nearly two years of handwritten letters back and forth . . .letters demanding the location, date and hour of my birth, my biography, myeducation, my aspirations. Finally, a date was set for my initiation, and myinstructions were clear, simple, and utterly terrifying.As the bus neared Dublin I was to tell the driver I wanted to be let off at aparticular intersection near a certain motel. I was to walk a few blocks to themotel and check in using my own name. If there were no rooms available I was towait in the lobby. If there was a room available I was to go there and wait tobe contacted. I had no other information—no address—no phone number—I didn'teven know the names of my hosts and initiators, only magical names: HymenaeusAlpha, 777, and Soror Meral.As I looked out the bus window at the cold moon rising over the abyss that isthe San Joaquin Valley it occurred to me that should I fall victim of foulplay—should I vanish from off the face of the earth—if my initiators were theinsane remnants of some Satanic Aleister Crowley cannibal cult—should theychoose to rape me, kill me, and eat me (something I was not completely convincedwas not part of the program) my poor wife wouldn't even have a clue to give thepolice.I didn't know it at the time, but Hymenaeus Alpha and Soror Meral were havingtheir own doubts and fears about me, and that the reason for all the cloak anddagger dramatics was the very real concern that I might be a dangerous person.In the months prior to my initial inquiry note some very scary things had takenplace in California. The homes of several prominent people, elderly formerstudents of Aleister Crowley, had been burgled and their priceless collection ofCrowley books and magical articles stolen.The neon sign in front of the motel beamed a welcoming “Vacancy” and shortlyafter I awakened the poor manager and checked in I found myself stretched outcomfortably on top of a not-so-hard bed. I immediately fell asleep and dreamedthe most disturbing dream . . . of saggy-titted old women with poorly-dyed redhair, and priapic old Englishmen in goat leggings carving up my raped andmurdered body and devouring my limbs with mint sauce.“Lon!”I heard a woman's voice distinctly and forcefully calling out my name. I woke upand jumped off the bed. “Coming!” I shouted through the door. I tidied my shirta bit and popped a mint in my mouth and opened the door. There was no one there.I stepped out and looked in both directions . . . no one there.Somewhat shaken, I returned to my room and sat down on the edge of the bed.Things were starting to get uncomfortably magical. I heard that voice as loudlyand as clearly as if someone were standing right outside the door. I washesitant to try to go back to sleep but eventually stretched out again. As soonas my head hit the pillow the phone rang—irritatingly loud.

By now Iwasn't surprised at anything that was happening.“Yes.”“Have you eaten?”She didn't sound like a cannibal.“No.” I admitted. “Have you?”About a half an hour later a knock on my door told me a flesh and blood SororMeral was on the threshold. When I opened the door we both heaved a sigh ofrelief; I, because she was not a saggy-titted old woman with poorly dyed redhair; and she because I did not appear at the door with a butcher knife and “I'mthe Antichrist” tattooed on my forehead.She took me to her home, a place I can only describe as a magical gingerbreadhouse, surrounded by beautiful gardens. The rooms were full of art and books andcomfortable furniture. I was so very relieved. She was wonderful, knowledgeable,and wise. I bombarded her with questions that she answered candidly.Our conversation naturally turned to the subject of Liber AL vel Legis, The Bookof the Law. A year or so earlier I had followed the instructions (or at least Ithought I was doing so) laid out in the Class A Comment on the text. I destroyedmy first copy of the book after the first reading. I asked her, “Why did I haveto destroy my copy of The Book of the Law after first reading it?”Her answer was this. “You've got an obedience streak in you dear. You're goingto have to watch that.”I had found my teacher.Phyllis Seckler would be my formal A∴A∴ contact, and also my dear Sister in theO.T.O. which was led at the time be her then-husband Grady Louis McMurtry(Caliph Hymenaeus Alpha, 777). I would take my first two O.T.O. initiations, myMinerval and First Degree, in their home in Dublin. Shortly after my firstdegree initiation I wrote a little poem called Water Closet—Caliph's Advice,which I wrote to immortalize his answer to my question, “What advice can yougive to a young magician first starting out on the path?”He answered with a cavalier lilt to his voice, “I asked Crowley the same thingthe first time I met him. He simply said, ‘Try to visit the water closetwhenever you can. You never know when you'll get the chance again.’Phyllis was kind enough to publish in an issue of her marvelous magazine, In TheContinuum.

It must ever be so, because ultimately we are each auniverse unto our self. The ‘whatever-it-is-we-are’ was alone when it incarnatedinto this corporeal dimension; and it will be alone at the timeless instant weshuffle off this mortal coil. But as we labor through the measured ticks ofspace-time on this side of the pylons of birth and death our‘whatever-it-is-we-are’ is surrounded and assailed by a vast assortment of other‘whatever-it-is-we-ares’—other monads of consciousness who are also universesunto themselves—and some of these other universes are fellow magicians.Magick is also (first and foremost) a self-transformational art. It may be themagician's intent to effect changes in his or her outer life circumstances,i.e., “I want the girl next door to fall in love with me . . .” but the successof any magical operation designed to bring about that romantic outcome will mostassuredly be in large part the consequences of the magician becoming transformedinto the type of person the girl next door falls in love with.I'm sure there are knowledgeable and skilled magicians who will disagree with mysweeping assertion that the only thing I can change with Magick is myself. It isof course a statement that is impossible for me to prove or disprove, andfrankly I'm not inclined or motivated to try. I'm not trying to establish ordefend magical doctrine. I simply know that for me—at this season of my life—atthis moment in my magical career—the thing that needs to change the most in myworld is me.I have to confess, the prospect of magick being a form of consciously directedself-evolution was not what initially attracted to me to the art so many yearsago. Naturally, I told myself that I was doing all this to gain enlightenment—toachieve spiritual liberation, but in truth it was the allure of wearing ablack-hooded robe and strutting around in darkened temples brandishing my wandand sword against terrible demons cowering in terrified obedience before myradiant adeptship.Man! Would I look cool doing that!No matter how noble and altruistic my conscious pretenses were, Lon MiloDuQuette (the post-adolescent magician) inwardly desired power—power to masterthe cruel and chaotic circumstances of my life—power to right the wrongs I waswitnessing in the world around me—power to set things straight and in harmonywith my own (obviously already enlightened) vision of personal, moral, social,political, and spiritual absolutes.As comically deluded as I might have been, there is of course nothingfundamentally wrong with such youthful and militant idealism—nothing wrong withwanting to change the world for the better and setting to work to do just that.I guess the biggest flaw in my aspirational game-plan was that I was overlookingthe fact that in order for me to use magick to begin making these changes Iwould first have to consciously evolve into a real magician. As luck would haveit, I would early in my career come under the influence and tutelage ofmagicians who would each in their unique way (either by positive example,negative example, or admonition) make sure I never forgot this fundamental factof life.Foremost among my senior mentors were Phyllis Secker (Soror Meral), Grady L.McMurtry (Hymenaeus Alpha, 777), Helen Parsons-Smith (Soror Grimaud), andFrancis (Israel) Regardie. All of these dear people are now deceased.McMurtry and Regardie trained directly under Aleister Crowley, and Seckler hadbeen the student of Jane Wolfe, a student of Crowley's and a one-time residentof Crowley's famous Abbey of Thelema in Sicily. Parsons-Smith was the doublewidow of Jack Parsons (the famed magician and rocket scientist) and Wilfred P.Smith—both were, at different times, Masters of Agape Lodge, O.T.O. in SouthernCalifornia.These colorful people kept me from being entirely alone in the early years of myquest. Because of their efforts (and more often despite their efforts) I was inthe mid 1970s baptized in the magick fire of Thelema. With their encouragement,cynicism, and guidance, I formally took up the disciplines of Crowley's magicalorders, the A∴A∴ and Ordo Templi Orients.My A∴A∴ work began under the guidance of Seckler and was (or should have been)an entirely private affair. My O.T.O. experience, on the other hand, required meto work in a more public manner and with other magicians all over theworld—sometimes many other magicians. In fact, an important aspect of theO.T.O.'s magical curriculum is the development of the individual magician'sability to work in concert (and survive) within the complexities of a uniquelyorganized society populated by cast of militantly independent magicians (some ofwhom are as intractable, imperfect and flawed as myself!). It's a very importantpart of the magical training of an O.T.O. initiate.As you might expect, Crowley didn't make the O.T.O. ordeal an easy one. In fact,I've known more promising magicians to wreck on the shoals of the Order'ssocietal challenges than for any other reason. More often than not, however, Iusually come to see the wisdom and genius of Crowley's magical vetting process.Whether or not they have established a formal A∴A∴ relationship, a great manyO.T.O. initiates and others who consider themselves Thelemic magicians embark onthe study and practice of the various rituals Crowley developed for theedification of A∴A∴ magicians. The systematic practice of these rituals vis avis the magician's personal initiatory climb up the Tree of Life ofconsciousness is generally viewed in Thelemic circles as “doing the work.”The work is certainly there to do. The rituals and a few commentaries arepublished in a plethora of sources. One of the finest collections is found inthe magnificently ponderous Liber ABA, Book IV2, but for many years most of usrelied almost exclusively on those ritual “Libers” that appeared in theAppendices of Magick in Theory and Practice.3Armed with little more than these Libers and the roadmap of the Tree of Life,four generations of magicians have set out alone on the Thelemic path of return;dissecting, cross-referencing, and trying to make sense of the bewilderingsubtleties of Crowley's evolving thought, and then attempting to transfer thatunderstanding to the temple environment in coherent ceremonies that can beperformed by (and for the benefit of) one person. To say it is a challenge tothe lone magician would be a beastly understatement.Yes. Magick is a lonely art. But does it always need to be that lonely? I don'tbelieve so—and neither does my Brother Rodney Orpheus. People—evenmagicians—sometimes need other people. There are moments in my life when I don'tknow what I am, where I am, or who I am unless I can see myself momentarilyreflected in the souls of others around me.The term “Thelemic group ritual” may sound like an oxymoron, but it needn't beone. As Brother Orpheus reveals, many of Crowley's most significant ritualsstarted out as group operations. For me, it is profoundly helpful (at times evennecessary) to see the complex dynamics of my own inner magical mechanismsportrayed as different “officers” in a ritual. I can, and of course musteventually integrate all these officers into myself, but first I have to knowwho they are, what they do, and what they mean to me. That is most easily andelegantly done by seeing them operate in a group drama.I took one look at Rodney's group treatments of the Ritual of the Mark of theBeast and the Invocation of Horus and was thrown back in my chair in stunnedadmiration, “My gods! Why hasn't someone done this before?” This might soundlike a rhetorical question, but in fact it does indeed have an answer. Thereason someone hasn't done this before is because there are presently very fewindividuals living today who are qualified by education and experience to do so,and even fewer with the writing talent and communication skills to bring it allto life on the printed page. Brother Orpheus is the incarnation of both theseaspects of genius. Whether he is expanding upon classic Crowley rituals orcreating and developing his own Thelemic ceremonies, the magician reader can beconfident he or she is in good hands.Magick may be a lonely art, but that doesn't mean we must always be alone on ourjourney—and it doesn't mean we won't always need friends.Love is the law, love under will.1 Written for Rodney Orpheus, Grimoire of Thelema, Stockholm: Abrahadabra Press,2011.2 Aleister Crowley with Mary Desti and Leila Waddell.

After reading my first attempt theauthor (speaking with the voice of candor reserved exclusively for the best offriends and the bitterest of enemies) lamented that it was “a potted bio” ofAleister Crowley that missed the mark entirely. While I remain firm in my beliefthat it was a damned good “potted bio” I must confess I see the wisdom of hiscriticisms.“Abrahadabra is not about Aleister Crowley and should not be colored by hishistory, reputation, or personality. Abrahadabra is about the practice of themagick of Thelema—a system of physical, mental, and spiritual training anddiscipline based on two fundamental principals: Do what thou wilt shall be thewhole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.”By writing this book, the author reveals (whether he cares to admit it or not)his profound understanding of the “Do” in Do what thou wilt . . .” andchallenges and inspires the reader to share his commitment to action rather thanargument, deeds rather than platitudes, experience rather than theories.He succeeds mightily at this. He fails, however, at keeping his own personalityout of the text—and for this the reader should be deeply grateful. His casualand humorous style serves to lower the blood pressure and causes one toimmediately identify on a personal level with his thoughts, attitudes, andconclusions.It takes a particular (some say peculiar) kind of individual to writeunpretentiously and unhypocritically about the practical aspects of Thelemicmagick. Rodney Orpheus, unlike many practicing (and published) occultists, has alife. He is a rock-star, a recording-artist, a business-executive, andhigh-degree initiate-officer of one of the most revered and influential magicalsocieties in the world. His life, however, does not revolve around any of thesehyphenated Rodneys. In true Thelemic style, they each revolve around him. So itshould be for all who tread the way of Thelema, a path where the individual andthe individual's true Will is the focus of the Great Work.But, where does one start the “work” of the Great Work? Without some kind ofbeginner's guide the study and practice of Thelemic Magick is like trying tolearn to swim by jumping into the deep end of the pool and doing whatever youhave to do to keep from drowning. Many have done just that, and (having survivedthe ordeal and human nature being what it is) carry the machismo attitude of, “Idid it the hard way, so should everybody else.” This attitude is, to quote AlFranken's New Age counselor, Stuart Smalley, is just stinkin' thinkin'.There will always be ordeals, (with or without helpful manuals such as this) andno one can presume to judge the circumstances of another's magical life. Mr.Orpheus had the benefit of life in Holy Orders and the mentorship of initiateinstructors. Even with these enviable advantages, I'm sure he will be the firstto admit that his early studies and practices were plagued unnecessarily withtime-consuming confusion as to how best to proceed.Abrahadabra—A Beginner's Guide to Thelemic Magick2, is a precious gift to allwho wish to immediately embark upon the fundamental practices and meditations ofThelemic Magick and assure themselves that their magical careers are being builton a firm and balanced foundation.

So she answered him, bending down, a lambent flame of blue,all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithebody arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thouknowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuityof existence, the omnipresence of my body.LIBER AL VEL LEGIS, I. v. 26.Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Aleister Crowley died in 1947 at the age of seventy-two. The whereabouts of hisashes remain a mystery. For twenty years after his death, his name and hisvoluminous writings remained for the most part undiscovered, unread, andunappreciated by all but a tiny band of former disciples, bohemian artists, anda handful of revolutionary thinkers. Then, on June 1, 1967 Crowley'sunmistakable visage appeared (glaring out at us from between the faces of Indianholy man, Swami Sri Yukteswar, and sex-goddess, Mae West) on the (then) mosteagerly-awaited objet d'art on the planet—the album cover of the Beatles newestLP, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.The cover art was the creation of artist Peter Blake, who wanted to surround theband with what he called “a magical crowd.” The inclusion of Swami Yukteswar,Paramahansa Yogananda, and other Hindu yogis was George Harrison's idea. Amongcharacters John Lennon “liked” was the poet and “wickedest man in the world,”Aleister Crowley.Do not misunderstand me. I'm not suggesting that the Beatles or Peter Blake weredirectly responsible for the spiritual and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, orthe storms that are still echoing (actively or reactively) in today's chaoticworld. Nor am I suggesting John Lennon or Peter Blake should be singled out andcredited for igniting the revival of interest and appreciation of AleisterCrowley, Thelema, magick, or any of the progressive spiritual movements thatcontinue to proliferate today. Like all great artists, at pivotal moments inhistory, these sensitive pioneers were merely among the first to react andrespond to the effects of a dramatic shift in human consciousness.Consciously or subconsciously their works gave voice to the new reality. The artthey and their contemporaries created during those golden years pealed like amighty bell that vibrated with the master “note” of this new universalconsciousness. A note that rang out like a broadcast signal that triggeredsympathetic responses in the hearts and souls of all who were poised and ripefor awakening.The concept of evolving shifts in consciousness is not a new one. Almost everyancient culture had it version of “ages” (i.e., golden age when humanity walkedwith the gods, or dark age when the gods abandon us). The Hindus call thevarious ages “Yugas”2 which predictively rise and fall in cycles of thousands ofmillennia as our entire solar system careens around the galactic center in ahuge elliptical orbit.Astrologers have their own version of the cosmic cycles based on the apparentbackward movement of the signs of the zodiac relative to the position of therising sun on the spring equinox. It takes 2,160 years to traverse one completesign, and most astrologers compute that we have recently passed (or will soonpass) from the astrological Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius.Now, you may think it odd that I should begin these introductory words to Mr.Campbell's marvelous book about Thelema by talking about 1960s pop stars andHindu theories of astrology, but (in my mind at least) it illustrates the mostimportant, thing to first understand when attempting to comprehend the meaningand significance of Thelema; that is, whether any of us are consciously aware ofit or not, within the last hundred years or so there has been a profound anddramatic shift (advance; transformation; mutation; amendment; metamorphosis;transfiguration; leap; refocus) in human consciousness. We are all nowfunctioning in an entirely new and different reality than the one in which ourrecent ancestors functioned. The old ways of doing business on every level ofour lives will never again work exactly like they used to.It's not just the fact that our tastes have changed; or that we hear music orappreciate art differently; it's not just the fact that our understanding ofmathematics has exploded inwardly to irrational quantum levels, or that ourunderstanding of astronomy has exploded outwardly and erased all old time anddimensional limitations; it's not just the fact many of the most fortunate amongus have the collected the store of ten thousand years of human knowledge at ourelectronic fingertips, or that many of us are now routinely accustomed toeducational, social and economic liberties. No. All these things are simplysymptoms and by-products, of a new essential factor in the great formula ofhuman consciousness. The new factor isn't anything complex or particularlyesoteric. It is, however, significant enough to cause a new mutation in the DNAof our consciousness. The new factor is simply:A new level of self-awareness.This might not sound very sexy or dramatic, but, in this new reality, nothingcould be more sexy or dramatic. This new awakening is disarmingly simple andfundamental. But, like the invisible wind, its existence only makes itself knownby the effects it has on other things. It's really hard to make observationsabout self-awareness because the observer is the object being observed.Actually, the whole thing is simpler than it sounds. Allow me to offer anillustration of shifts in self-awareness.Our very ancient ancestors, while being cognizant of day and night, darkness andlight, heat and cold, comfort and discomfort, were primarily focused onday-to-day, moment-to-moment issues of immediate self-preservation. All humanactivities, whether, conscious or instinctual, revolved around the preservationof the body through protection, nourishment, and the biological perpetuation ofthe species. All other observations or speculations about life or the worldaround us were projected against the screen of this reality and interpreted tosatisfy these immediate needs. Everything about our ancestors conscious andsubconscious lives (religious concepts and expressions, gods, spirits, myths,rituals, even art) was interpreted by the self-identity of a creature competingwith other creatures for food and survival.The metaphoric “Gods” that visibly ruled this level of consciousness-reality wasthe Earth itself, and the Earth's human equivalent, Woman, in particular, theMother. Crowley named this phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Isis,after the great Egyptian Mother Goddess.Eventually, as our understanding of the world around us increased a bit, ourself-awareness shifted and received a fine-tuning. We started to see ourselvesas existing in a more complex and wondrous environment that we could partiallymanage and control. No longer did we see ourselves only as just anothercompeting creature, but as a master creature that could exploit other creaturesand our environment. If we were cold, we could build or even travel to warmerlands. If we were hungry, we could cultivate plants rather than forage for them.We could domesticate and breed beasts rather than hunt them. Our eyes turned tothe sky and it became evident that the sun made the plants grow, and luredanimals to come eat the plants. Summer and winter were sun-triggered events thatneeded to be dealt with. Gods and religions evolved to accommodate the newreality—the new self-identity. Existence was now seen as a partnership of sunand earth, father and mother.But, along with this wakening came the new mystery formula—the formula of a Sunwhich dies every day, and almost dies every winter. And this new formula broughtwith it our terrible preoccupation with death. Plants die and the dead seeds areburied and then magically reborn; the Sun dies and needs to be magicallyresurrected; it only follows that I die and I will need to be magically broughtback to life.Crowley named this phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Osiris, afterthe great Egyptian God of Death and Resurrection. It is a formula based on ourself-identity with the Sun that dies and is magically reborn. It is the level ofconsciousness that has fashioned the reality of our most recent ancestors—theirreligion, politics, war, culture, art, literature, and civilizationitself—everything.All that has changed. While the decaying, zombie remnants of the Aeon of Osiriswill likely haunt us for the foreseeable future, a new Age has dawned. Crowleynamed this new phase of evolutionary consciousness the Aeon of Horus, the childof Isis and Osiris. Instead of our conscious reality arising from the need fornourishment (as in the Aeon of Isis), or our obsession with overcoming death (asin the Aeon of Osiris) we now simple grow—as naturally, as innocently, and asjoyously as a child—a child who will accept no limits to its potential growth.As unbelievably simple as it sounds, the factor that characterizes the essenceof our new self-identity . . . the factor that characterizes our new level ofconsciousness, is our universally accepted observation that the sun does notdie. It shines eternally. This simple new reality has permanently upgraded theoperating system of human consciousness. The sun does not die. We do not die.The sun shines eternally—we shine eternally. We now function as a unit ofself-awareness that deep down inside knows it does not die—that knows there isno off-switch—that knows we've always been on and we'll always be on.In the Aeon of Horus eternal life is now simply understood as, “theconsciousness of the continuity of existence.”Like Lao Tzu's mysterious Tao, Thelema defies objective definition.Is it a Philosophy? Although there are philosophic nuances to Thelema, it isbigger than philosophy. But, if we were to attempt to explain Thelema to someonewho needs to approach things from a philosophic angle we could say, Thelema is a“Rational philosophy of spiritual self-sufficiency.”Is it a religion? Although there are infinite ways to incorporate yourunderstanding of Thelema in religious forms of expression, Thelema is biggerthan religion. But, if we were to attempt to explain Thelema to someone thatneeds to approach things from a classic religious angle we could say, “Thelemais a rational religion of Sun worship . . . if you define the word “Sun” as alsomeaning yourself.Is it a Magical system? Although many Magicians consider themselves Thelemites,Thelema is bigger than any particular, system, technique or study. Indeed, onceone has comfortably adjusted to the new level of self-awareness Thelema servesonly to enhance, energize and hybridize whatever philosophical, religious, ormagical systems or schools of thought you hold dear.Is it Crowley's magical societies, O.T.O. and A∴A∴? Although these twoorganizations propagate the “Law of Thelema” and the teachings of Aleister,Thelema is bigger that any organization, order, or school of instruction. As amatter of fact, Thelema is bigger than the Book of the Law, or Aleister Crowley,or anything in heaven or earth . . . but you.Love is the law, love under will.1 Written for Collin D.

Harris.3 Theoccasion was doubly celebratory because we had just inked a new recordingcontract with Epic Records and were preparing material for a second single andan album for that prestigious label—a work we were sure would finally bring usthe fame and fortune we believed we so richly deserved.Charley and I weren't just wannabe rock stars; at least not in our own minds.No. We fancied ourselves troubadours of cosmic consciousness, magical bards,mystic musicians, psychedelic hippy poets surfing the tsunami of culturalconsciousness created by the patron saints of our generation—Bob Dylan, Dr.Timothy Leary, and the Beatles. Even our silly love songs were written asthinly-veiled hymns to transcendent deity. At that sweet, green moment of lifeour youth acknowledged no limits to our magick; and knowing no limits, therewere none.With oddly egoless bravado we resolved to write a new song on the spot. I leanedacross my beloved Gibson B-45 12 string and plucked an “Occult Dictionary” fromthe bookcase, closed my eyes, opened it at random and blindly pinned my fingerto a page. It rested on the words, “Inner Man.” Three bowls of hash later we hadour song:Deep within you,Softly hear me sing;Find me if you will.I've never not been anything,And I always will.All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)See how each night becomes the day,Born with each new dawn.Death cannot claim the Inner Man,That's how life goes on.All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)And when you find the Inner Man,With your journey through,Smiling, you find the one to tell,It was always you.All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)All in the All and the All in All.(I am the Inner Man.)4Our lyrics didn't spring from the depths of any character-building lifeexperiences or profound mystical traumas. Those terrible adventures stillawaited us in the future. But I believe we were nonetheless on to something veryreal—something very important (other than that excellent hashish).Our song was a corny cliché; naïve and pretentious. But to tell the truth,reading these lyrics 42 years later I am still impressed by the message. Infact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a more concise summation of the ineffablespiritual experience (event-phenomenon-illumination) that is the subject of Mr.Katz's remarkable book.Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel (K & C of the HGA) is arather silly sounding expression for a very serious spiritual event. One isalmost embarrassed to say the words when discussing the matter with peopleunfamiliar with the esoteric history of The Book of The Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage as Delivered by Abraham the Jew Unto His Son Lamech—AGrimoire of The Fifteenth Century,5 or the Golden Dawn, or the works of AleisterCrowley. It is not exactly the same “Guardian Angel” to whom little Catholicchildren address their bedtime prayers . . . or is it?The intense and heroic magical operation that Mr. Katz performed and that he soably describes in his book was created by the magician, Abraham of Worms(c.1362—1558), to trigger a tangible and objective mystical experience—aneyes-wide-open moment of ecstatic union even more real, life-altering andmemorable than one's first romantically charged adolescent kiss. It is theultimate consummation devoutly to be wish'd. According to Abraham's theory weare each in a sense an unfinished human being (a slumbering princess) until wehave been kissed by (united with) our questing prince (the HGA). The HGA, on theother hand, remains an unfinished spiritual being (a prince who will never be aking until he has married a princess).Of course, the entire cast of characters in this fairy-tale are simply metaphorsfor levels of consciousness and the mechanics of our evolving identity withthose levels of consciousness. But sleeping princesses and hunky princes andkings and queens and awaking kisses and weddings and babies are pretty damnedgood metaphors for this process; because the key that holds it all together . .. indeed, the key to the nature of consciousness itself, from iron and rocks, tolight, energy and godhead itself, is Love.But is love, as the Beatles sang, really “All you need?” In my book, Ask BabaLon: Answers to Questions of Life and Magick,6 I try to answer the question,“What is the fastest way to unite with the HGA?”Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is a love thing. Work ondeveloping the ability to fall hopelessly, blissfully, passionately in love withGOD (or whatever your object of supreme divinity is). Each of us is alreadytrying to mate with our HGA every time we fall in love with someone orsomething. It's not really the person or object of our devotion we're falling inlove with, we're falling in love with a perfected ideal (something that noperson or thing could in reality ever live up to). That ideal is the Angel. Thatperfected ideal is really us (a fact we'll discover when we and the Angel areunited).Until then, we're already well armed with the only tool we need to lure theAngel to us: intense, insane, romantic naiveté; a devotion so consuming it wouldembarrass us to death if we weren't so blinded by Love . . .7The Abramelin operation is designed to systematically build up the magician'sdevotional muscles in a relatively safe and balanced manner; a process that (forthose of us in the west) is not always easy to give ourselves over to. In fact,the operation seems ingeniously designed to gradually trick the rational mindinto surrendering its sovereignty . . . at least long enough to becomeirrationally open to the influx of divine consciousness. What is especiallyvaluable about the way Mr. Katz has applied the Abramelin operation to his ownlife, is the way he performed this “magical retirement” amid the distractionsand the madding crowd of his everyday/work-a-day world. I believe he succeededin striking this delicate balance that is so necessary if one desires to ascendto heavenly levels of consciousness while not prematurely abandoning one'sincarnational responsibilities, and opportunities.It is fair for the magician to ask, “What incarnational duty could possibly moreimportant than Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel? Why do Ineed to strike a balance in between the world of karmic entanglements and the ofworld of enlightenment? Why shouldn't I simply abandon everything in my life andpursue with one-pointed ardor this spiritual illumination?” In Ask Baba Lon Itry to address this question as well.. . . Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is a level ofconsciousness, and the straightest path to the HGH is devotion. If you can fallcompletely and helplessly in love with God you are there. If this means you findyourself in a loincloth jumping up and down on a street corner blissfullysinging Hare Krishna (or Hare Crowley), then so be it. It won't matter to you,because you and the beloved will be joined in ecstatic union.If, however, you feel in your heart-of-hearts (and that's where the HolyGuardian Angel lives) that you still have some mission to accomplish in thisincarnation before hopping on the train and taking the “straightest path” tobliss land, then you should start shopping around to see what your mission isand customize your devotional quest for the Angel in order to harmonize andmanifest your life's mission (Will).8And what about me? Has Lon Milo DuQuette achieved Knowledge and Conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel?That also is a fair question to ask. If I have, I confess it didn't occur as Ipictured it would the first time I read The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.If I have achieved K & C of the HGA, it came as a realization not of somethingthat happened to me, but a realization of what I now am. Awake . . . or at leastmore awake than the boy who wrote “I am the Inner Man.”Perhaps the name of my Holy Guardian Angel is “Baba Lon” or Rabbi Lamed BenClifford. Perhaps that's the way it always works. Together you and the angelbecome somebody else . . . someone who writes love notes to oneself.1 Written for Marcus Katz, After the Angel, An Account of the AbramelinOperation, New York: Forge Press, 2011.2 DuQuette, Lon Milo, and Hyatt, Christopher S.

Perhaps bothschools of thought are correct. Where angels, demons, and spirits are concerned,I personally believe it's all in your head—you just have no idea how big yourhead is. Or, to quote my pseudepigraphic guru, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, “Yesthe spirits are real. Yes the spirits are imaginary. Most of us, however, cannotimagine how real our imaginations are.”I can, with no small measure of confidence, generally defend this position withjabs of well-worn qabalistic suppositions concerning the nature of consciousnessand the functions of the various parts of the soul, and the left hook of CarlJung. There have been times, however, when my field theory has been mightilychallenged. Mr. Laycock's Complete Enochian Dictionary played a curious role inone such magical bout.In 1978, as part of my perceived duties as an O.T.O.2 lodge-master, I began whatwould become a twenty-three-year weekly magick class at my home in Costa Mesa,California. At the time, I was hard-pressed to stay one jump ahead of theenthusiastic aspirants who crowded my living-room floor each Thursday evening,and within a year or so I realized that if I intended to continue teaching, Iwas eventually going to have learn more myself.My magick library was pitifully small in those days. My newest treasure was afirst edition of Gems from the Equinox3 that contained a selection of books,articles, essays, and rituals from Aleister Crowley's monumental work, TheEquinox.4 I combed through it to see if I could find something novel and exoticto occupy our Thursday nights for a while. I settled on Liber LXXXIV, velChanokh—A Brief Abstract of the Symbolic Representation of the Universe Derivedby Dr. John Dee Through the Skrying of Sir Edward Kelly. It is Crowley'sintroduction to the complex and beautiful magical art form that has come to beknown as Enochian. I didn't know it at the time, but Chanokh (and the book youare now holding in your hands) would dramatically change the course of my life.At first I found Chanokh completely unfathomable. I read it, re-read it andchecked it against the Enochian material in Regardie's Golden Dawn.5 After a dayor two of whimpering, things finally started to make a little sense. Thematerial that treated upon the evocation of angels of the four Elemental Tabletsappeared to be the logical place to start the class.Each Elemental Tablet is made up of 156 lettered squares, each of which isdivided so to represent a truncated pyramid. Each has its own particular mixtureof elements determined by a most impressive application of Hermetic logic. Anangel (whose name is the letter of the square) “lives” in every one of thepyramids. These single-letter-named angels are modular and join with theirneighbors to form bigger angels with longer names and more complex attributesand duties. It is truly an elegant system.My plan was to keep the class occupied for a few weeks drawing and coloringtheir own tablets while I consulted with Dr. Regardie and constructed a set ofthree-dimensional tablets. Regardie was not keen on the idea. He told me that tohis knowledge no one had ever done such a thing before, and that the Enochianangels were dangerous enough when they inhabited flat tablets. He cautioned,“Don't give them dimensional elbow-room.” I joked, and suggested that his angelswere probably in a bad mood because they were all squished up inside his flattablets. I went ahead and prevailed upon a lodge brother to cut 624 woodentruncated pyramids. These I would eventually prepare, paint, and assemble intothe Four Elemental Tablets (one each for Fire, Water, Air, & Earth.)The night of our first evocation arrived. I prepared our living-room temple forthe evocation of Laidrom, the Mars Senior of the Tablet of Earth6. The templeopening and operating procedures are outlined admirably in Chanokh so there wasvery little to do but follow directions. I smugly congratulated myself on beingso well prepared. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the possibility thatthe evocation might actually work.The first student to arrive was D. R., who proudly handed me his newly acquiredfirst edition of Laycock's The Complete Enochian Dictionary7—the first one I hadever seen. As I always do when someone hands me something rare or expensive, Ifeigned profound gratitude and gushed, “Oh! Thank you.” He quickly snatched itback out of my hands.Once the rest of the class arrived I asked for a volunteer to read the Call inthe angelic language and sit in the visionary driver's seat. To my great anxietyour only volunteer was David Wilson, the most cynical member of the class. I wascertain that our class curmudgeon would receive no vision whatsoever and all ofour efforts would be the target of his ridicule for many months to come. Still,he was willing to give it a try so I switched on our little tape recorder and weproceeded.After I banished and opened the temple, David read the Call twice, closed hiseyes and sat quietly for only a few seconds. Then, to all of our surprise, hecasually started to describe in great detail his vision of a desert of whitecrystalline sand that sprouted columns of volcanic rock.We were all thrilled. I asked if he saw any living things, an angel or a spirit.He said “No.” I encouraged him to repeat the Call a third time. As soon as hewas finished he excitedly described an enormous black cone arising from beneaththe sand. David fell silent for a moment. He told us the cone was opening. Then,with a shout that startled us all . . . “It's him! It's him! I see him.”He described a large humanoid figure seemingly constructed from the samematerial as the cone. It had no face, its head was egg-shaped and flat in front.Its fingerless hands had the appearance of mittens. “This is Laidrom!” Davidannounced reverently.We were all in shock. None of us were prepared for this. David reached for a padof paper and a pencil and scribbled down a few notes and a sketch. Before Icould stutter out words of welcome, David let out a nervous giggle and said,“Lon, I feel like . . . I feel . . . I could make strange sounds.”“Go with it!” I don't think I really meant it.“Naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayef . . . this is . . .”“No! Relax, let it happen!” I tried to sound calm.“I mean it, I feel like and idiot. I'm too . . . sil-si anxilxi-to-da-arp nan-ta(inaudible) . . . ef . . . efe thar-zi. I'm sorry . . . that's all. Nothing likethis has ever happened before. I just felt like doing it.”I didn't know what to say. I finally salvaged the presence of mind to thankLaidrom for appearing. I was painfully embarrassed that I couldn't think ofanything to say to this perfectly well-mannered angel standing in myliving-room. I finally stuttered something stupid to the effect that we reallyappreciated him stopping by, and we'd sure like to visit with him again sometimesoon, then I hurriedly closed and banished the temple.For a few seconds, no one said a word. Then everyone started talking at once. Irewound the tape and we listened to the strange words that had tumbled out ofDavid's mouth. Of course, they didn't make any sense, but it was such a thrillto hear them.We rewound the tape repeatedly and eventually transcribed three audible stringsof syllables:naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayeffzil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arp nan-ta (inaudible)ef . . . efee thar-zi.We referred to D. R.'s The Complete Enochian Dictionary and in short orderdiscovered,Nanta, elo Hoath zorge ef.“Spirit of Earth, first worshiper friendly visit.”Zil zien“stretch forth hands”Zilodarp Nanta“stretch forth and conquer Spirit of Earth”Ef etharzi“visit in peace.”David appeared uncharacteristically shaken by what had happened. He insisted,and I didn't doubt his truthfulness, that he had not so much as even read any ofthe Enochian Calls before that evening.For the next three years, we would hold class two nights a week and focusexclusively on Enochian magick. We would depend increasingly on The CompleteEnochian Dictionary to help us navigate the complexities of the angelichierarchies and serve as our pronunciation guide to angelic language. David'svisions would continue to take us on amazing excursions to the Elemental worlds,but as he became more accustomed to hearing the words of the Calls his talentfor breaking spontaneously into the angelic tongue diminished and finally ceasedaltogether. He remains the most talented seer I have ever encountered.D. R., bless his heart, eventually moved away. We haven't heard from him in manyyears. I am forever grateful to him for bringing The Complete EnochianDictionary to class that memorable night so many years ago. As you have probablyguessed, I never returned it to him.1 Written for Donald C.

I can say without hesitation that the reader is in for anexciting, provocative, and enlightening experience; for some of you it may alsobe the beginning of an adventurous journey of self-discovery.It is a work that I believe could only have been written in the morning hours ofthe twenty-first century, when advanced scientific thought is promising us anunprecedented understanding of the cosmos and the nature of matter and energy.As our astro and quantum physicists draw closer to the Holy Grail of a theory toexplain it all, can it be possible that we are approaching a level of inquiry soprofound that we will soon be required to dramatically expand our level ofconsciousness in order to process the multidimensional answers?I believe the answer is “Yes,” and as we penetrate ever deeper into these newfrontiers of thought, we are confronted with the same fundamental issues andchallenges that have faced spiritual scientists since the dawn of humanconsciousness: How was the universe created? How can it be limitless? Whatsustains it? Will it ever end—if so, how? What is the nature of time, space,reality, and consciousness? Who and what am I? Try as it might to do otherwise,when her musings soar to these heights science is forced by the limitations ofword-images to evoke the metaphoric language of mythology, mysticism and magicin her attempt to even discuss these transcendent matters.Why, then, should it be thought unscientific for us to explore these same issuesdirectly by magical means? After all, for tens of thousands of years of humanhistory, right up to the eighteenth century, magic was science. Magic2 is themother of mathematics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, architecture, andmedicine. It does us no good to argue that mythology, mysticism, and magic areirrational and illogical, for indeed, the mysteries of astrophysics and quantummechanics appear to be so as well.For the better part of a thousand years, adepts of the Holy Kabbalah3 (Judaism'sesoteric science of the soul) have by means of a variety of curious techniquesendeavored to use the mind to transcend the mind. For the sake of convenience,they view “God” as the absolute and supreme consciousness of the universe, andindividual humans as miniature reflections of the supreme consciousness—“Manmade in the image of God.” Just as my reflection in the bathroom mirror ‘lives’only because of my living presence, so too do I exist as a reflected unit of thesupreme consciousness. My seeming separation from God is as illusionary aphenomenon as my reflection in the mirror mistakenly believing itself real andsomehow estranged from the physical me on the other side of the looking glass.Because God and humans are two aspects of the same consciousness, the Kabbalistsview us both as being divided (categorized would be a better word) into fourmain levels of consciousness: * The lowest level (as an aspect of the supreme consciousness) is the material plane itself. * Specific example: a rocking chair. * For us (as an aspect of the individual consciousness) this level manifests as our physical bodies. * The next level (as an aspect of the supreme consciousness) is the formative plane where exist the patterns of everything that will manifest on the material plane. * Specific example: the idea or concept of a rocking chair. The Kabbalists call this the world of Angels. * For us (as an aspect of the individual consciousness) this level is our intellect—our mind's eye. * Above this (as an aspect of the supreme consciousness) is the creative plane where the great general principals of the universe are generated. * Specific example: the concept of sitting down. The Kabbalists call this the world of Archangels. * For us (as an aspect of the individual consciousness) this level manifests as mysterious powers of intuition, i.e., when a mother awakes in the night when her child has been in an accident far away—an ability that transcends logic and time and space. * Above this (as an aspect of the supreme consciousness) is the archetypal plane—for all intents and purposes we could consider this the consciousness of godhead itself. * Specific example: the universal concept of rest. * For us (as an aspect of the individual consciousness) is the life force itself—ultimately our true identity.In the metaphoric language of Hebrew mysticism, the mechanics of creation andthe cooperative symphony of all the natural forces of the cosmos are awell-ordered hierarchy of spiritual agencies—archangels, angels, spirits, anddemons. We also have our special place in this hierarchy, and a special duty toperform. As humans, living on the material plane, we are the culmination of theprocess. We resonate with a full collection of the echoes of the entirecreational cycle. Each of us, as a monad of the supreme consciousness, is atuning fork vibrating as the pure lower harmonic of the absolute note.It is the job (indeed, I believe it is the destiny) of each of us to raise ourconsciousness step-by-step, octave by octave, back up to godhead. This is thetrue initiatory adventure each one of us are destined undergo. This is the GreatWork.One branch of Kabbalistic philosophy views the cycle of the descent into matterand return journey home as a ten step process; the roadmap being a schematicdiagram called the Tree of Life. Enochian vision magic of Dr. John Dee, however,divides the trip not into ten levels, but into thirty, and it is thestep-by-step exploration of these thirty Aethyrs or heavens of human/divineconsciousness that is the fascinating subject of Dr. DeSalvo's bold andvisionary experiences.1 Written for John DeSalva, PhD, The Lost Art of Enochian Magic: Angels,Invocations, and Secrets Revealed to Dr. John Dee, Rochester, Vermont: DestinyBooks, 2010.2 Sometimes spelled, “magick” to distinguish it the spiritual art from that ofthe stage magician.3 The word is based upon three Hebrew letters, Qoph, Lamed, Daleth, it is oftenrendered, “Qabalah,” “Qabala,” “Cabala,” “Kabalah” or “Kabbalah”."},{"pageContent":"PART SIXMAGICAL MASONRYImage [images/u001.jpg]My father, Clifford Ernest DuQuette, was perhaps the most honest and noble humanbeing I have ever known.

I creep quietly passed the rooms of my sleeping Brothers and outto the darkened hallway that leads to the staircase to the Atrium. The Atrium isa cavernous space, nearly two hundred feet long and over fifty feet wide, builtin the style of the Roman Empire. The marble floor is adorned with Masonicsymbols inlayed in brass and stone of contrasting colors. The Doric and Ioniccolumns that flank the great hall and support second story walkways and chambersare dwarfed by towering Corinthian columns that buttress the vaulted ceiling,three stories high, whose centerpiece stained glass skylight now bathes the roomin soft iridescent moonlight.There are five statues here whose bronze presences I am moved to honor. Four arethe goddess figures of the Cardinal Virtues, Temperance, Prudence, Fortitude,and Justice. They are positioned at the corners of the room which I slowlycircumambulate as I move from pedestal to pedestal. The fifth goddess stands inthe very center of the hall and bears no inscription or emblem. She simply holdsher forefinger to her lips as if to hush the universe. It is here at the feet ofsilence I sit down on the cool floor and close my eyes. Only a moment, it seems,passes before I hear the warm ring of a temple bowl. The others are awake, andwe are being called to dawn meditation.I slip off my shoes outside the door of the lodge room and tiptoe inside andtake my seat. The room is dark save for a single candle on the central altar.After a few quiet words of introduction and instruction we close our eyes andenter our inner temples. Forty minutes later the sun has risen. We open our eyesand see the room brilliantly illuminated by three large Italian stain glasspanels that we now see forms the entire southern wall of the lodge room. Eachwindow dramatically depicts one of the three ages of man—youth, manhood, and oldage. My eyes linger on each scene in turn as I weigh the well-lived episodes ofmy life against those of time misspent.After breakfast we gather beneath chandeliers of Czechoslovakian crystal in thespacious reception room and for the first time see who has come this year. Iimmediately recognize some of the brightest stars in the firmament of modernMasonry. I also see friends and colleagues from years passed, writers, scholars,teachers and students. As always, there are several Brothers who have beeninvited for the first time to present papers and lecture.We are met for three days of presentations and discussions of issues andsubjects relating to esoteric aspects of the Craft of Freemasonry. We havegathered secretly and informally under no official warrant, charter or auspices,to explore the Craft as a self-transformational art and science—gathered tolabor and strategize how best to proceed to protect, preserve and advance theesoteric soul of Freemasonry.Appropriately, the venue for this gathering is one of the largest and mostarchitecturally magnificent Masonic edifices in the world, unexplainablyabandoned by its usual team of custodial stewards for the duration of ourmeetings. The building itself is intoxicating. We are all humbled by its beautyand perfect proportions. One cannot resist being tangibly elevated as we eachintuitively attempt to adjust our inner imperfections to reflect the outerperfections of the sacred geometry around us. As we walk the sacred labyrinth,or sit quietly studying in the gothic library, or muse about alchemy at the feetof Assyrian sphinxes, we find ourselves pausing and asking each other, “Is thisreally happening?”Yes. It really happens; and this is how I always dreamed Masonry would be.This, however, is not what all Masons think the Craft should be. As a matter offact, there are a great many who now feel that the esoteric roots of our ancientinstitution are an embarrassment—queer and unwholesome links to paganism, theoccult, and perhaps even Satanism. You might be surprised to learn that there isa concerted effort now taking place within Masonry to once and for all divorcethe Craft from its esoteric heritage, and make it an organization open only tomen professing certain specific religious convictions. Even though Masonictradition dictates that a candidate need only profess a belief in a SupremeBeing and a form of afterlife, today there are jurisdictions and lodges aroundthe world that will not consider the application of a man if they believe hisreligion to be not “mainstream” enough, or his interest in the esoteric natureof the craft suspiciously intense.This is why, sadly, I cannot tell you in what country our gathering takes place.Neither can I tell you the names of the participants, or the circumstances thatbring us together, or the details of our activities and goals. By necessityMasonry has for us again become a secret society.What makes this anti-esoteric movement so ill-timed and suicidal is the factthat Masonry's membership numbers are plunging precipitously. Lodges are closingor merging with other lodges for lack of members. Freemasonry, as we've known itfor the last three hundred years will be dead in just a few years if somethingisn't done. Ironically (and much to the terror of the anti-esoterics) the onlydemographic group that is applying for membership in significant numbers iscomposed of young men who are passionately interested in the esoteric mysteriesof the Craft.Fortunately, at least for the time being, exoteric Masonry is still for the mostpart a very big tent. Even in the most conservative quarters leadership stillpays lip service to the concept that Masonry opens her doors to upstanding men3of all races, religions, political persuasions and social and economiccircumstances. Aside from the obligatory duties required to advance through thedegrees, the individual Mason is free to be as interested or as disinterested ashe likes in matters that concern the history, rituals, traditions, and mysteriesof the Craft. As it is (and much to the relief of the anti-esoterics), mostMasons, once they are raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason (and, if theyso choose, go on to complete the degrees in one or more concordant rites) arehappy to put the quaint and curious stuff behind them and simply enjoy beingpart of one of the most active and generous service organizations in the world.This is as it should be, and please don't think that I am denigrating thecontributions and efforts of a Brother who wishes to participate at any level.The world needs a generous service organization to sponsor hospitals and clinicsand scholarships. Some men need a relatively wholesome place to meet sociallyonce or twice a month with other relatively wholesome men. Add to this thepossibility that some men might actually have a psychological need to put onclown make-up and drive tiny cars in parades.Without men like this Masonry would not be (for the time being at least) thelargest and wealthiest fraternal organization in the world. These are good menwho are made better by their involvement in Craft. But there are also thoseamong them who would like to be spiritually transformed by Masonry's deepersecrets; and currently these are the only men applying in any significantnumbers. (Still, I'd wager that even some of the clowns in the tiny cars, ifproperly educated, might be fascinated by the esoteric side of things.)The sad fact is most Masons are never adequately exposed to knowledgeableBrothers or material that might excite their curiosity beyond wondering, “What'sfor Stated Meeting dinner?” It's not that the information is not available.Plenty of fine books have been written over the centuries, some of which mightbe found in the libraries of local lodges all around the world. But many ofthese books were written in the 1800s at a time when interest in esotericMasonry was at its zenith and when even a high school diploma meant afamiliarity with Greek and Latin and a smattering of philosophy, worldreligions, and history. Anyone who has ever started to read Albert Pike's Moralsand Dogma,4 will know exactly what I'm talking about.What has been lacking for the modern Mason, and what Brother Stavish nowmercifully presents us, is a straightforward, and step-by-step, study ofFreemasonry and the myriad movements and ideas that gave birth to Craft in allits manifestations. Moreover, he sets it all vis á vis 21st century science,philosophy, and mysticism and challenges the reader to do the same. The Path ofFreemasonry is a one-volume liberal arts education in Freemasonry, and neverbefore in the history of the Craft has it been more important for individualMasons to be so educated. I wish I could put Brother Stavish's book in the handsof every newly-raised Brother, not simply for his own benefit, but for thebenefit of those individuals throughout his life who will look to him as worthyexample of a knowledgeable and enlightened member of the Fraternity.May the blessing of Heaven rest upon us and all regular Masons! May BrotherlyLove prevail, and every moral and social virtue cement us!

I'm very proud to say I'm a Mason. My father was a Mason. Mybrother is a Mason. Many of the men whose lives and works have inspired,enlightened and encouraged me throughout my life have been Masons.Masonry is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) secular fraternities in theworld. It traces its modern origin to 1717 when a grand lodge was formed fromseveral existing lodges in London. Just how long those lodges had been inexistence prior to 1717 is unclear. There are some one hundred and thirtyversions of Masonic documents known as the Old Charges that date from around1390—but Masonic tradition would have us trace its origins back muchfarther—back to the medieval cathedral builder's trade unions—back to theDionysian Artificers who built the great civic monuments of the RomanEmpire—back to the builders of King Solomon's temple—even to the craftsmen whobuilt the Great Pyramids of Egypt.Of course, there is no real evidence to support the existence of a prehistoricInternational Brotherhood of Pyramid Builders (Local #327).But, even if none of the traditional histories of the Craft can stand thescrutiny of historians, it is clear that Freemasonry, as an initiatory society,is an incarnation of (if not the heir to) the great mystery schools ofantiquity—especially those that flourished in and around the Mediterraneanbasin—the Eleusinians, the rites of Mendes, of Osiris, Isis, Dionysus, Serapis,Mithras, and the Persian Magi, from whence we get the word Magic.The Mystery Schools taught that, ultimately, the true essence of each man andwoman is divine . . . in fact, if ever we could come to the full realization ofour true natures we would discover we are one and the same with the supremeconsciousness and life-force of the universe.Among the various Mystery rites, the name and symbolic character of the deitychosen to represent this supreme consciousness varied considerably—but they allhad one very important thing in common. They all surmised that it is possible toconsciously raise oneself to supreme realization—and they attempted to assistthis evolutionary process by degrees—by means of a step-by-step program ofpurification and instruction. And by literally mutating the candidate'scharacter by putting him or her through a series of dramatic and artfullychoreographed personal ordeals.In the early years of the Christian era, Alexandria Egypt was center of theintellectual, philosophical, and initiatory world. The universal order andstability of the Roman Empire brought the world together as never before. For abrief and brilliant moment in time, knowledge and wisdom gleaned from scores ofcultures from China and India to Egypt, Israel, Europe and Britain, synthesizedwithin three great libraries. Here the holy wisdom of the Hebrew qabalah met thecelestial sciences of the Chaldean Astronomers and the occult wisdom of theEgyptian priests of Isis. Here the subtleties of Taoist and Buddhistphilosophies touched the mathematical sciences and pragmatic politics of theGreeks.A catastrophic fire destroyed much of at least one of Alexandria's greatlibraries, and the growth and often violent zeal of the young Christian movementfor all intents and purposes put an end to the overt activities of the Mysteryschools. Carl Sagan speculated that, had the wealth of information stored inAlexandria not been destroyed—the level of technology that placed a man on themoon in the 20th century would have been reached in the 1500s.Be that as it may, we know there survived throughout the suffocating centuriesof the Dark Ages, a body of men who, because of their unique knowledge andskills, formed a distinct class of world citizen. Men who could move freely fromtown to town, city to city, kingdom to kingdom—unrestricted by the limits offeudal servitude.Masters of geometry and construction, who could make stone rise to heaven.Master artists who could enshrine the symbolic and mathematical secrets ofcreation within the very dimensions and ornaments of buildings that would standfor a thousand years.These were Free-masons. Men who, by virtue of their own talents, wit, andexperience, had freed themselves from the tyranny of kings and the oppression ofthe Church.The Freemason was the archetype for the modern, liberated human being.Freemasons were quite literally . . . the coolest guys in the western world.When the great cathedral projects ended, the fraternity evolved from being onethat applied its mystical principals upon stone, to one that does so upon thehearts of human beings. By 1784, when Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart became a Mason,the progressive Masonic ideals of Love, Tolerance, Enlightenment and UniversalBrotherhood were poised to set Europe and America on fire with revolution.Late in 1790 Mozart learned Masonry would soon be outlawed in Austria. Heconspired with a Brother Mason, librettist and theatre owner, EmanuelSchikaneder, to enshrine the essence of Masonic ideals within a light-hearted(and seemingly innocuous) opera. That opera, of course, is The Magic Flute. Andlike all of Mozart's creations, it is constructed on many levels.The first level is purely musical. By this point in Mozart's career he wasfamous for creating melodies that were not only beautiful to the ear, butmemorable to the mind. Mozart wrote music you could hum and whistle. His musicallogic is so clean and natural that the listener's ear anticipates each upcomingphrase as if the music is gushing spontaneously from our own mind. Mozart'saudiences frequently became so instantly infected by these almost deja-vumelodies that they joined in with the principals on second and subsequentrefrains.The music of The Magic Flute is delightful, and I'm sure there was no doubt inMozart's mind that once it was heard it would be impossible to erase it from themusical consciousness of the world.The next level was that of contemporary comment. Several of the characters inThe Magic Flute were quite recognizable caricatures of some of the mostimportant and powerful people of the day: * The darkly passionate and vengeful Queen of the Night was the perfect image of Empress Maria Theresia whose opposition to the ideals of the Enlightenment and hatred for Masonry was well known. * Our hero, Tamino, was clearly based upon Emperor Joseph II, the son of Maria Theresia, who was not only a driving force of the Enlightenment, but also an early activist for equality between the classes and the sexes. Tamino's efforts, early in the opera, to please the Queen of the Night is a touching comment on the efforts of a royal son, who, in his youth, naturally made efforts to please his imperious mother. * And Sarastro, the Wise and Noble Hierophant of the Temple of Isis un Osiris, could only have been Vienna's most revered Grand Master of Masons, Ignaz von Born. Von Born was the most idealized example of the Enlightened man—humanitarian, scientist, and teacher.The next level is more esoteric and Masonic; and here we ask, does The MagicFlute actually reveal Masonic “Secrets?”Technically. . . . No.Masonic secrets concern themselves primarily with the clap-trap of thefraternity—the signs of recognition . . . the handshakes . . . passwords . . .and, of course, the details of the dramatic ceremonies of initiation. There arevery few aspects of The Magic Flute that would worry any Mason who actuallyknows what is (and what is not) secret in the Craft.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, also a Freemason, said of The Magic Flute;“It is enough that the crowd would find pleasure in seeing the spectacle; at thesame time, its high significance will not escape the initiates.”In the time we have left before we enjoy tonight's performance, I'd like tohighlight just a few of those elements of high significance that do not escapeinitiates.Let's begin by observing Mozart's use of the number three. The number three is,for a number of reasons, a highly significant number to Masons. The overture ofThe Magic Flute exploits quite dramatically three chords sounded in batteries ofthree. These same three chords are sounded in the Temple scenes. As we will soonsee, there are three Temples, three doors, three attendants to the Queen of theNight, three guiding angels, and three rounds of voting. Brother Mozart evenwrote The Magic Flute in E flat—a key that contains three flats in the keysignature.While these are interesting tidbits, they are hardly veil-rending expositions ofMasonic secrets. In the Temple scenes, however, we will see the suggestions ofmany elements of secret Masonic procedure; from the way the brotherhood admitsthe candidate and votes upon his admission, to the various tests of fidelity,silence and secrecy—most especially, the ordeal of initiation itself.Peeling back yet another layer of esoteric secrets, we discover that BrothersMozart and Schikaneder incorporated key elements of the Hebrew Qabalah withinthe characters and plot of their opera. We must remember that mystical sciencessuch as Qabalah, Alchemy, and ceremonial magic were subjects of intensefascination to many Masons of 18th century, and it is not at all surprising thatthese two Masons-with-a-mission would want to load their masterpiece with thebiggest mystical punch they could.A fundamental concept of the Qabalah divides creation and the human soul intofour levels. These four levels correspond to the four letters of the Great Nameof God, which in Hebrew is spelled Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh, (Most of the non-Jewishworld pronounces this Jehovah.) The dynamics that exist between and among allthings represented by these four sacred letters is the focus of Qabalistic studyand meditation. But if we were to simply personify Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh as family,they would have the characteristics of a Father, Mother, Son, & Daughter. If wethought of them as royalty they would be a King, Queen, Prince, & Princess.The Qabalistic scenario goes something like this: If each of us really knew ourtrue spiritual identity we would realize that we were like a King . . . a Kingwho is the most-awake Being of all. But, for some reason, we have chosen to fallasleep. The King has fallen asleep and is dreaming he is the Queen of theUniverse, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming she is the Prince of theUniverse, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming he is a sleeping Princess.Unenlightened humanity is just like Sleeping Beauty. We are dead to the greaterreality and have completely forgotten our divine birthright. We are asleep toour true spiritual nature and are dreaming that we are trapped in a tomb ofmatter, and time and space. (This is just the position Princess Tamina findsherself in during the first Act of the Magic Flute.)There is part of us, however, that is not so deeply asleep, a part of us thatremembers there is something more. This more-awake self is our own PrinceCharming. If only he could kiss our Sleeping Beauty and break the spell ofillusion, then the Princess could marry the Prince and become theeven-more-awake Queen, and by doing so the Prince will automatically be elevatedto become the most-awake King.The great secret to this Qabalistic soap opera is, of course, the Zen-likerevelation that each one of us has been the most-awake King all along.I know this sounds hopelessly mystical and abstract—because it is hopelesslymystical and abstract. It is also is the hidden scaffolding that supports andsustains the Western spiritual tradition—and, as such, it is naturally the plotand a subplot of The Magic Flute.We have King Sarastro, the Queen of the Night, Prince Tamino, and PrincessPamina—and on a lower level we have Papagano and Papagana who in their own moremundane universe play prince and princess to Tamino and Pamina.The most esoteric statement made by The Magic Flute, however, was one thatshocked even the free-thinking Masons of Vienna—and proves Mozart to be arevolutionary even within a revolutionary society, and a visionary mystic amongmystics.Despite several charming and (by modern standards) incredibly incorrect dittiesabout the nature of woman in earlier scenes, the opera climaxes with the duelinitiation of Tamino and Pamina—a surprise ending that was very unsettling tomany in the all-male Masonic fraternity.To initiates this is more than just a social comment upon the equality of thesexes. It is a bold and visionary statement that touches upon the very dynamicsof humanity's evolving consciousness.At the beginning of the opera we meet the awesome and beautiful Queen of theNight enthroned upon the moon. She represents a time in human history when womanwas the supreme mystery. An innocent but primitive age when life appeared tospring directly from woman, and was linked to the cycles of the moon. This wasthe time of the great goddess and matriarchal social and religious institutions.As human consciousness evolved we began to recognize how important the sun wasto life on earth, and the importance of the man's contribution to theprocreative process. The pendulum swung violently in the opposite direction.Patriarchies supplanted matriarchies, and the Great Goddess was overthrown andruthlessly subjugated by male gods. This is the source of the vengeful hatredthat the Lunar Queen of the Night feels for Sarastro and his sun-worshippingorder.Mozart envisioned the next step in human consciousness, when equality andbalance between the sexes is achieved—when the Moon and the Sun are no longer atwar but united to bring a new light to the world.Initiation means “a beginning.” Pamina and Tamino's initiation at the end of TheMagic Flute represents Mozart's sweetest hope that a new and wonderful age wasat hand. An age in which the Masonic ideals of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truthwould manifest in the hearts of all humanity.An age when, as the three Guiding Angels sing;“. . . All doubts will disappear,when only the wise will rule . . .Oh heavenly peace, return to us, and fill the hearts of all.Then the earth will a heaven seem . . .And mortals will have godly esteem”Well . . . It's almost time for the opera to begin. We are very lucky people. Awonderful, delightful, and magical initiation awaits us just inside the greatdoors of the temple of music; an initiation we can experience simply by seeing,hearing, and enjoying. The Ritual team is almost ready. Grand Master PlácidoDomingo has consecrated the Temple; Maestro Foster and Sir Peter Hall will servetonight as Junior and Senior Wardens; and our Worshipful Master in the East willbe none other than the immortal spirit of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Thank you very much.

In this case, I hope to beforgiven for the my lapse into spiritual narcissism for, in truth, I have beentouched and deeply identify with what I perceive to be the spirit of thismarvelous work—a work that (if names and labels did not serve only to confusematters) could be described as “Western Eastern thought.”I'm a westerner. I say this not as a boast or an apology. It's just a fact. Iwas born in California and raised in the Midwest. My parents were of westernEuropean and Native American stock. I was noisily raised in an archetypicallydysfunctional family of good Methodists in the archetypically dysfunctionaluniverse of 1950s-60s small-town Nebraska (advertised as the place “Where theWest Begins!”). Back then there were no minority groups in town; no Jews, noBuddhists, no Hindus or Muslims. Nobody spoke about “Eastern thought” or“Western thought.” As a matter of fact, in small-town Nebraska nobody spokeabout “thought” at all; and, until I moved back (west) to California to go tocollege, I believed that the act of not thinking about thought was the Westernway.The psychedelic revolution of the mid 1960s radically changed my thinking onthis subject and most everything else. Almost overnight, I realized withTechnicolor certainty that human consciousness—my consciousness—was an awesomeand holy thing, perhaps the most important thing in the universe. I wasn't inNebraska anymore—and my newly awakened third eye turned toward the east insearch of more light.I found it almost immediately in the form of a tiny book that I bought at mycollege bookstore for 95 cents. It bore the curious two-part title, Lao Tzu—TaoTe Ching,2 and advertised itself as “. . . the principal classic in the thoughtof Taoism.”3The translator's very lengthy and scholarly introduction was of no interest tome. My craving for instant spiritual gratification was too strong. I thumbedstraight to the opening lines of the text itself and sipped my first ambrosialtaste of Eastern thought.The way that can be toldIs not the constant way;The name that can be namedIs not the constant name.The nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth;The named was the mother of the myriad creatures.4What beauty! It was perfect—so perfectly simple; forty words describing whatcannot be described—the infinitely simple, nameless Way Things Are. Forget aboutDeities or Saviors or Devils or sin or guilt or reward or punishment. Those arethings with names, and names separate everything from the pure, nameless WayThings Are.For a moment I stopped breathing. It was as if I had ingested a spiritual drugand was pausing to see if I would explode, or turn purple, or die, or giggle.Of course, I didn't do any of those things (well, maybe I giggled a little).After a few months of reading and re-reading the text and meditating upon itsinscrutable words, I resolve to discard completely the faith of my fathers andtry my hand at becoming a first rate Eastern mystic. For a few years I didn't dosuch a bad job. I left the world of psychedelics, started seriously practicingyoga and the obligatory meditative practices, and began a systematic study ofthe I Ching.Yes sir, I had great spiritual goals. I was going to be egoless. I was going tobe the most egoless mystic in town. I envisioned my egoless self quietly gainingillumination while poised egolessly by the coy pond, my legs locked in aflawless lotus position, my eyes firmly fixed upon the center of my egolessforehead, my shaved head gleaming in the leaf-filtered sunlight of my cool andtranquil Zen garden.Man! I was going to look so cool without an ego!Obviously, something wasn't right, and it was more than just my battle with theego. It was a battle with how I was hardwired. It was as though I was trying torun eastern software on my western hardware. It was then I began to examine thenature of my western psyche and the differences between the eastern and westernapproaches to enlightenment.No matter what some of the pundits of each school may preach, the goals are thesame; supreme illumination and absorption into godhead. But the ways the easternand western mystic go about achieving that goal are as different as Yin andYang—In and Out.The spiritual sciences of the east encourage the individual to simplify—to turninward to discover the true nature of self and Deity. By stilling the body andmind, and systematically striping away the illusionary veils of sensations,desires and ego, the eastern mystic eventually reaches the moment when somethingsnaps—the mind is transcended, and he or she is absorbed into what is poorlydescribed as wall-to-wall emptiness.Conversely, by nature western mystics are inclined to seek externally for theanswers. Consider how we in the west are so obedient to scripture and complexdoctrines—so attracted to ritual, priest crafts, and prayerful appeals to a Godapparently outside of ourselves and nature. Under the right circumstances,however, these outward things can trigger in the devotee an illumination that“fills the soul” with the presence of deity—something snaps—the mind istranscended, and the consciousness of the western mystic is absorbed into whatcan be poorly described as wall-to-wall fullness.Realizing that that the two supreme goals are one and the same—that subjectivereality lives in objective things and actions left me in a most awkward andfrustrating position—the lonesome, inside-out schizophrenia of the WesternEastern mystic. Fortunately I would eventually bring this malady under controlby heavily self-medicating myself with the concepts and practices of the Zen ofthe West; the Hermetic5 Qabalah, Tarot and ceremonial magick.These highly esoteric western traditions are not for everyone. Indeed, forcenturies they have been branded as heretical by the western spiritual“authorities” who have (for reasons both understandable and despicable) eitherfound themselves unable to appreciate the subtleties of the practices, or elsehave been frustrated in their attempts to successfully exploit the practices forprofit or crowd control. If not for my background in Eastern thought, I toowould have dismissed the mystic arts of the West as dangerous and superstitiousnonsense.All this being said, it remains a mystery why as a meat-and-potatoes midwesternMethodist teenager I was immediately and profoundly zapped by the Tao Te Ching,or why for the most part my zeal to share its wisdom with others of myoccidental ilk met with no success at all.“Don't you get it?” became my mantra of frustration.“No. I don't. It's just fortune cookie double talk. How can I believe in that?”“It's not something you believe in, it's the way things are!”“What's so holy about things they way they are?“No. Not about things the way they are . . . it's about the way. Don't you getit? Focusing on the things is how everything got all screwed up.”“I don't get it. How's that going to get me into heaven!”(Insert sound of my hand slapping my own forehead here.)Obviously, it's almost impossible to be an enthusiastic proselytizer of the Taowithout departing embarrassingly far from the way the moment one opens one'smouth. Handing a curious friend or a relative a translation (even a very goodtranslation) is at best a hit or miss affair. For thirty-five years I'vebemoaned the fact that someone, some Western Eastern mystic with a masterfulgrasp of spirit of the text and the ability to render it into straightforward,down-to-earth English, has not done the job.I lament no longer. I have found the English language jewel I've been seeking myentire adult life—a jewel I can share with everyone I know who insists theydon't get it.Exactly how she did it I cannot say. However, one thing is abundantly clear tome. By writing Finding the Way Susan Montag has demonstrated in the clearest,most comfortable manner imaginable that she has truly found the Way.1 Written for Susan Montag, Finding the Way: A Tao for Down-to-Earth People,Lake Worth, Florida: Nicolas Hays, 2005.2 D.C.

It is the Sacred Quest ofthe mystic, alchemist, yogi, and magician, but it is also the inescapabledestiny of every unit of evolving consciousness in the universe.But how do we go about extricating this pristine essence from the tomb that so“grossly” closes us in? Can we chip it away like a clay cocoon? Can we shed itlike a serpent's skin? Can we wash ourselves clean of it?We can try. Indeed, plotting the escape from this prison of matter is the raisond'être of the world's great religions. As Hindus and Buddhists we deny it asillusion; as Christians we attempt to bribe our way free with a ransomed savior;and together with the other ‘people of the Book—Muslims and Jews—we hate andfear it like a devil; make war upon it like an enemy; flee from it like sin and(discarding God-given common sense) gamble our souls on the historicity of mythsand obedience to scriptural law so that after death we might discover we havewon the prize of immortality.Such efforts in-and-of themselves will remain forever doomed, for while they areeffective instruments for spiritual crowd-control they ignore one veryfundamental and paradoxical cosmic truth. That is, the tomb of matter, the“muddy vesture of decay,” is itself an inextricable part of the essence of ourimmortal soul. For is it not written that the temple of initiation is also atomb?HERMETICS—OLD AND NEWI am particularly pleased and honored Mr. Newcomb has asked me to pen theforeword to this remarkable book—remarkable in that it offers more than musingsand the retelling of ancient material—remarkable in that he demonstrates sopleasantly that one can focus intensely upon the mystery teachings of the pastwithout isolating oneself from the discoveries and revelations of thepresent—that one can unite the modern sciences of the mind with the wonder andwisdom of the ages.It is a labor not too dissimilar to the works of a number of individuals who inthe twilight of the golden ages of Egypt and Greece shared their wisdom in abody of mystical texts supposedly written by the God Thoth, or Hermes, or HermesTrismagistos. Foremost among these is one that bears the name of its mythicalauthor, The Emerald Tablet of Hermes. Tradition maintains it was the firstrevelation of God to mankind—that it was cast in liquid emerald by the magick ofalchemy, its raised letters revealing in thirteen short verses the universaloperations of nature. It is the famous work that gave us the fundamentalHermetic axiom;It is true and no lie, certain, and to bedepended upon, that the superior agrees withthe inferior, and the inferior with superior, toeffect that one truly wonderful work.2Verses five and six go on to provide the diligent aspirant the mystic key bywhich he or she can arise from the tomb of matter even while acknowledging thetomb is an integral part of the self.The power is perfect, after it has been unitedwith a spirituous earth. Separate the spirituousearth from the dense or crude earth by meansof a gentle heat, with much attention.3It is the profoundest of cosmic ironies. The divine power, our true spiritualessence, does not achieve perfection until it hits the “rock bottom” of thecosmos—the dense and crude earth. It remains imperfect until the moment ofentombment for the simple reason that until that dark nadir is reached theexperiential adventure of existence remains incomplete, and Self is not yetendowed with the entire spectrum of the light of consciousness—from spirit tomatter—from the highest high to the lowest low.This is why Hermetic tradition informs us the highest the angelic hosts envy thechildren of the dust because humans have something they will never have—a littlebit of everything from top to bottom. High as they are, the angels are stuck indivine middle management without a complete stash of the raw material necessaryto clone themselves to perfect godhead. Aleister Crowley describes thisprocesses as “. . . the general doctrine that the climax of the Descent intoMatter is the signal for the redintegration4 by Spirit.”5 Once the lowest lowhas been reached, the power is perfect and the process of return is initiated.The Emerald Tablet of Hermes tells us how to begin. We are to, “Separate thespirituous earth from the dense or crude earth by means of a gentle heat, withmuch attention.” This doesn't mean we are to cook ourselves over a low flame(Although in the symbolic language of Alchemy that's pretty much what we do.).It means that through a slow, balanced and gentle process we are to (with greatattention) distill the essence of our being, the song of our soul, from themuddy vesture of decay.This is the initiatory process of the Hermeticist old and new—a balanced andgentle program of study, practice, meditation, mixed with the effects of one'sown inherited destiny (whether you call that luck, good fortune, or karma).Initiation is not a reward for achievement or seal of attainment. Indeed, theinitiate may never attain (at least not in this incarnation). “Initiation” meansto begin, and the first question the candidate is asked at the threshold of theTemple is simply, “Are you ready to begin?”Are you? If so, I can think of no better place to start than the marvelous bookyou hold in your hands right now—a balanced and gentle program of study,practice and meditation. To this you must add the most important ingredient ofall—yourself—the sum total of the highest high and the lowest low—your inheriteddestiny.1 Written for Jason Augustus Newcomb, The New Hermetics: 21st Century Magick forIllumination and Power, Newburyport, Massachusetts: Weiser Books, 2004.2 Manly P.

From the moment he collected me at theairport in Bristol he allowed me to sit silently and be seduced by the charm andsplendor of southwest England's green and pleasant pastures. Radstock, near Bathin Somerset was my destination. It was an area of the UK I never visited beforeso I had no idea how long I would be able to savor my chauffeured religiousexperience.Never had I seen so many shades of green in my life. It felt like I was livinginside the swelling phrases of Blake's great national hymn, Jerusalem. A“countenance divine” did indeed shine forth upon these clouded hills. This washeaven on earth. No. This was heaven of earth. I rolled down the window andinhaled the perfume of grass and soil warmed by the sun of mid July.“I love the earth.” I said again, this time under my breath.I closed my eyes as if to take a snapshot of the moment, and was surprised tofeel a tear burst over the lower lash of my right eye and coolly evaporate inthe wind as it ran down my cheek. I assure you, in my jaded heart such sensitivemoments are a rarity, and usually occur only in the fleeting seconds that followthe first and second sip of a late afternoon martini.3 This day's rapture wasmost likely induced by the stress and debauchery of visiting five countries inseven days, and the realization that after this lecture I'd be returning home tomy own bed. Whatever the cause, I was drunk on earth and wished the driver wouldstop the car so that I might stretch out in a field and soak the verdant groundwith my tears of love.The mental image of such an awkward and unseemly act immediately erased suchdaydreams, but for the first time in my life I realized deep down to the verycore of my soul that the earth is a living, breathing, conscious being—anintelligence—a god(dess)—and that I was her child. My flesh her soil and mantle;my blood her rivers and streams and seas; my bones her stones and mountains; myheartbeat her molten core—my soul one with her soul.What more palpable deity could humanity seek? What god more wonderful, moreworthy of our awe, our gratitude, our prayers? We must certainly honor the sunas the ultimate source of light and life, but without earth to reflect the solarglory, without the earth and her manifold creatures Sol Invictus would remaineternally a god unworshipped.Moreover, is not the earth herself sunlight made manifest? Earth is the climaxof spirit's descent into matter—the magical lowest low that contains not only aspark of the highest high but everything else in between. Earth is thealchemical laboratory that transmutes light into life. Earth is the crowningfinale of creation, and we are conscious creatures of the earth. As such, youand I possess—we embody—the secret of spirit's return to godhead. As it iswritten in the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, “That One Only Thing (after God) is thefather of all things in the universe. Its power is perfect, after it has beenunited to a spirituous earth.”4It is humanity's most ancient and self-evident fact of life—the sun is ourfather, the earth is our mother—and no matter how gender-neutral our culture maystrive to become, it is the mother who first hears our cries. It is the motherwho first responds to our needs. It is the mother who first answers ourquestions.How ironic it is, then, that as we grow into head-strong youngsters we becomeless and less inclined to listen to the voice our mother. As hormone-blindedadolescents we embarrassedly shun her counsel and ridicule her propheticwarnings regarding the dire consequences of our shortsightedness and foolishbehavior. As self-absorbed young adults we shut our minds completely to thepossibility she could in any way understand what our life is like, or what is oris not in our best interest. It is not until we have reached a significant levelmaturity that we realize that we've been blessed since birth with our ownpersonal omniscient oracle, one whose unconditional love for us is beyond allhuman comprehension.For centuries the art of geomancy has been a proper and respectful means bywhich we, as children of the earth, purposefully affirm our recognition of theearth as a living intelligence capable of answering our questions. Thetechniques and apparatus have varied from century to century, culture toculture, but its oracular vocabulary of sixteen geomantic figures (each made upof one or two dots neatly stacked four high) have remained constant.My introduction to the art of geomancy came in 1974 when I purchased a tiny bookby Israel Regardie titled A Practical Guide to Geomantic Divination.5 Its sizewas not intimidating and Regardie's straightforward (and seemingly sane)approach to the subject made it all sound very appealing to a wide-eyed youngproto-magician. An added attraction was the fact that geomancy had been (at theturn of the 20th century) a favorite oracle of the members and adepts of theGolden Dawn—and oh! how I wanted to be like one of those Golden Dawn guys!My expectations were high, perhaps too high, for this oracle of earth. Ienvisioned hairy little pipe smoking gnomes popping up in my bedroom temple togrumpily answer my questions and lead me to buried treasure in the back yard.What I found was what appeared to be an abbreviated (and not very exciting)variety of astrology. What does astrology have to do with an earth oracle? I wasreally hoping for something quick and easy I could do without having to study abunch of other stuff. Geomancy was starting to look like work.I nevertheless gritted my teeth and dug into that tiny book. In doing so Ireceived my first (albeit remedial) lessons on the nature and basic meaning ofthe planets and signs of the zodiac, and of course, the names and meanings ofthe sixteen geomantic figures.I have to confess that my first attempts to divine with geomancy were (from myperspective) abysmal failures. Not only did I not know enough about astrology toget a clear answer out of the chart that my dot juggling had generated, but myinterpretations of what I thought I did understand turned out to be patentlywrong (as future events proved in objective reality).I asked (almost forced) Constance to give it a try. She has Taurus rising in hernatal chart. She's got a green-thumb in the garden. She's the darling of allanimals, insects and flowers. I hoped perhaps her earthiness would be more inharmony with the art. She protested she didn't want to consult the “dirtoracle.” Still, she was a good sport and reluctantly agreed to ask a questionand proceeded to generate her four “mothers” by sixteen throws of tiny pebbleson the kitchen countertop. Her efforts generated the dreaded Rubeus in the firsthouse. Ouch! That's bad! When that happens the book told us we were supposed toabandon the operation and not try again for hours. It's the geomantic equivalentof the gypsy fortuneteller saying, “I see nooootheeeng! Go! Now! LEEEEEVE MYTENT!”That did it for Constance, and pretty much for me too.It would be a dozen years before I again developed any serious interest in theart of geomancy. Again it was a book, The Oracle of Geomancy—Techniques of EarthDivination by Stephen Skinner,6 that triggered my interest. It was a clear andthorough overview of the basics and much longer and more involved thanRegardie's little book. Most importantly for me, it provided many helpfultables, examples, and ways one could arrive at simple answers to simplequestions.On board the geomancy train once again, I set to work to construct a “tray”specifically designed for geomantic divinations. Actually, it is a very shallowwooden box eighteen inches square and two inches deep. I lined the bottom with athick layer of modeling clay. I eventually adorned the top and outer sides ofthe walls) with the sixteen geomantic symbols and the names and sigils of thespirits along with their planetary and astrological symbols. With a pointedstick I marked out sixteen horizontal bands in the clay. During geomanticoperations I use the same stick to poke the random marks within the bands toarrive at the initial four Mother figures. I reserved part of the clay surfaceto accommodate the Mothers and the twelve other figures that they generate. Thedeep permanent lines on the surface of the clay make it possible to execute thefigure-generating part operation entirely in clay without resorting to penciland paper. I have to admit; it looks very magical and works marvelously well.The feeling that I am working directly with earth is powerful and unmistakable.Finally, I had made peace with geomancy, and with the help of Skinner's bookstarted cautiously to consult the clay for insights on personal issues that Idetermined were of an “earthy” nature. I also occasionally made myself availablefor friends and others who come to me for quick and “dirty” geomantic readings.Still, I was not yet a passionate devotee of the art. The works of Regardie andSkinner helped me understand how the forces, energies, intelligences, andspirits of the planets and zodiac signs could speak through the element ofearth. I was comfortable enough with the theory. But neither book had sparkedthe flame of true spiritual romance in my magical soul. I had not yet connectedmy heart-felt love of the earth to the cold manipulations of dots on a slab ofclay.The catalyst that would eventually provide this magical link for me is the bookyou are now reading. When the publisher asked me if I would write this ForewordI was delighted to accept, and immediately asked them to send along themanuscript. I believe the author, John Michael Greer, to be one of the mostknowledgeable and brilliant esoteric scholars alive today. He is also a friendand lodge brother whom I see far too infrequently. I do not exaggerate; I couldlisten to John Michael Greer talk all day and all night. His wit and insightbreathes life into the movements and personalities of the dusty esoteric past.It is though he is the time-traveling custodian of the Library of Alexandria, ora medieval magician, or Renaissance magus, transported through time to sharewith us the brilliance and relevance of our rich spiritual ancestry.Something ‘clicked’ in me when I read his historic vignettes in Chapter One. Thesimple, quiet charm of these little stories were for me the last alchemicalingredient in my long experiment with geomancy; the V.I.T.R.I.O.L. thatdissolved away all that previously prevented me from uniting my heart with mymind. I devoured the rest of John's magnificent book with the passion of ateenager who has just discovered poetry. As I wrote him, “It is the greatestcomment on geomancy ever written.” I hope you will treasure it as much as I do.Glory be to the Earth and to the Sun and to the holy body and soul of Man; andglory be to Love and to the Father of Love, the secret Unity of things!Also thanksgiving in the Highest for the Gift of all these things, and for themaiden in whom all these things are found, for the holy body and soul of man,and for the sun, and for the earth.

These facts few psychologistswill dispute, and their admitted truth must establish for all time thegenuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale as a literary form.H.P. LOVECRAFT—SUPERNATURALHORROR IN LITERATURE“Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do you know of fear?Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deepand the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night,when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are bornand live and die all in darkness while the dire wolves grow gaunt and hungry,and the white walkers move through the woods.”GEORGE R.R. MARTIN—A GAME OF THRONESHorror is the literature of the damned; a demon-child art-form—conceived in thefertile depths of subconscious hell; gestated in the lonely womb of fear anddespair; brought to troubled birth by the midwife of tortured obsessions; andreared to grotesque maturity in the prison asylum of a terrified imagination.Horror, to be truly horror, must be more than a frightening story. It must be acloistered odyssey, a claustrophobic dance with madness. Above all, horror mustbe a traumatic and soul-mutating spiritual experience—sublime, elegant, andterrible.Sounds disturbing, doesn't it? I hope so. Horror should be disturbing. But, atfirst glance, classic horror seldom presents itself as the product of adisturbed mind. On the contrary, some of the best works of the genre areintroduced by narrator who seems as sane and rational as you or I—an ordinarymind which, at the moment, is merely grappling with extraordinary psychologicalissues with which we all can more or less identify. But beware dear reader! Yourgentle empathy with the story's protagonist is a subtle poison that within abreathtakingly few paragraphs disrobes your soul and lulls you into a poppiedsleep. Naked and vulnerable (and now uncertain of your own sanity) horror drawsyou irresistibly into the mind of the main character of a nightmare.For me (or anyone who stubbornly refuses to grow up completely) literaturedoesn't get better than that.I turned nine years old in July of 1957, and was enduring my second melancholysummer of exile in the uncivilized2 wilderness of Nebraska. I realize the word“exile” probably sounds melodramatic, but I was a very melodramatic child in1957. Nebraska was for me an alien planet, cruel and hostile.I hadn't been born in Nebraska. I had been kidnapped3 by my own parents andtaken there against my will. I was a Southern California boy, and I thoroughlyenjoyed my first seven years in that hip and sunny fairyland where movies weremade; where rock ‘n’ roll was evolving and the dreams and industries of theSpace Age made us all feel like citizens of bright and gleaming future. Thefamily's move to Nebraska in 1955 was in my eyes a doleful exodus back to thedark ages—a “trail of tears” from a 20th century beach paradise to a 19thcentury prairie hell. Powerless to change my circumstances I pouted and steepedin a bitter broth of self-absorbed discontentment.I hated Nebraska. I hated Nebraskans. I hated the way they talked. I hated theway they laughed about butchering animals. I hated the way they preached abouttheir wrathful God—a God who hates Negroes and Chinese (even though there wasn'ta Negro or Chinese person within a hundred miles of our provincial town); a Godwho would condemn little boys to the flames of eternal torment just for the sinof not believing in a God who hates Negroes and Chinese. Most of all, I hatedthe way Nebraskans, young and old, actually took smug pride in their own lack ofsophistication. They wore their ingenuousness like a badge of honor, and rudelyridiculed and bullied anyone else who did not also proudly clothe themselveswith the same course robe of premeditated ignorance.I admit this must sound terribly unkind. Hate is a strong and unhealthy passion,especially for a nine year old boy. But hate springs from fear (real orimagined), and in my young mind there was much to fear in Nebraska. Even as ayoungster I sensed a palpable darkness, a prairie madness, a nameless evilbrooding just underneath the surface of the bib overalls and cotton housedresses; a slumbering beast just waiting to be awakened by the kiss of alcoholor jealousy or greed or lust; an evil that is ever mindful the nearest policemanis many miles (and perhaps hours) away; a black and primitive wickedness thattakes poisonous root in the solitary psyche of those who toil alone in the earthfrom dawn to dusk, season-after-season, year-after-year; an evil that smothersin the heart all breath of human compassion or empathy for the pain and terrorthey inflict daily on the helpless beasts they breed for slaughter or thechildren they breed for labor and war; a twisted and perverse evil that feeds onguilt and self- loathing; an evil that incubates in the deafening silence ofsweltering summer nights or the perpetual darkness of winter and hideouslyhatches like a basilisk egg into monstrous acts of rape and incest, and murder,and suicide.The houses themselves are possessed of dark subconscious secrets—indeed, theyare built upon them. Unlike the sunny and uninsulated bungalows of SouthernCalifornia, Nebraska houses hide their own dungeons. Large as the footprint ofthe house itself, these cinder block chambers (the natives call them“basements”) offer a modicum of insolation from the frozen sod of winter, and anarea of damp coolness from the blistering heat of summer. Basements alsoprovided residents a dark hole in the ground in which to cower from the whirlingdeath clouds called tornados—tangible wind devils that regularly strike downfrom pus-green clouds and sweep across the earth bringing grotesque death anddestruction to anything and everyone in their path.Yes. There was much for a young man to fear in Nebraska. I was lonely,depressed, and morose. One sweltering humid summer morning I became sodesperately bored I did something unthinkable for a nine year old boy inNebraska.I found something to read.That morning I lingered in my sweat-soaked bed until I knew I was alone in thehouse. I got up and turned on our old Raytheon television set in the living roombut could only get a scattered signal of a farm report. Like electricity andindoor toilets, television was new to rural Nebraska, and what few broadcaststations in operation were very far away. Reluctantly I switched off thecrackling television and turned my attention to the living room bookcase. Ilooked for something—anything—that might alleviate my ennui or titillate my idlebrain.The family library had a few things that might distract me. My father was apretty interesting guy (a native Californian and very un-Nebraskan). He valuededucation, and wanted his sons to cherish books, so had recently purchased a newset of World Book Encyclopedia to display next to a few old sets of matchedvolumes of of literature. I figured the Encyclopedia would be too much likehomework, so I turned my attention to an old 20 volume set of the World'sGreatest Literature.4At first glance The Last of the Mohicans looked like it might be fun but I soondiscovered it much too grownup and difficult. I finally settled on Volume 8 ofthe series, Tales of Mystery and Imagination, by Edgar Alan Poe. I opened it upand I saw to my delight that it was a collection of short stories that hadtitles that were absolutely irresistible to a miserable nine year old boy: ThePremature Burial, The Masque of the Red Death, The Tell-Tale Heart, etc.Premature burials and red death sounded very promising indeed, but back inCalifornia I had actually seen a terrifying cartoon5 called The Tell-Tale Heartat the old Lakewood Theater. I recalled at the time my mother became very upsetwith my older brother Marc for taking “little Lonnie” to see such an adult anddisturbing film. I poured myself a glass of buttermilk, plopped down in the bigchair by the open window and opened the book.Once I started to read, however, I knew I was way out of my depth. There werelots of big words and incomprehensible foreign language phrases and epigrams,and geographic references. Every other sentence seem to make reference to someancient legend or myth or classic poem. I was forced to actually use thedictionary and encyclopedia just to plod my way through the first story, The Pitand the Pendulum. But I eventually did get through it, and after I closed thebook I realized I had become someone else—someone I liked—someone who could usethe dictionary and encyclopedia; I learned about the horrors of the SpanishInquisition (How delightfully evil was that!); I was exposed for the first timeto the melodically elegant use of the English language;6 most importantly, Idiscovered I was capable of being touched by art—capable of being possessed bypassion. My ennui lifted and was replaced by a pre-adolescent worship of themacabre and the genius and wit of its creators. This passion has yet to subside.I spent the rest of that summer with Poe . . . and the dictionary, and the WorldBook Encyclopedia.Ironically, the same 19th century-esque liabilities I despised about 1950sNebraska life proved to be priceless assets of atmosphere that allowed me toconjure the perfect reading environment to savor the ecstasy of classic horror.Horror takes its time, and to properly appreciate it you must also take yourtime. It has a pace, a slow, incessant rhythm—like your own heartbeat—like yourown breath. After all, the great innovators of the art were writers of theGilded Age who wrote for a 19th and early 20th century audience.7 Nebraska in1957 definitely had both her feet planted firmly in the 19th and early 20thcenturies. That summer morning in 1957 could have just as easily been 1857,accompanied by the same sound-track of bucolic silence; the same light searingthrough the same sun-stained yellow window shades; no hint of modern objectivereality, no diversions of bustling civilization; no diversions of airplanesroaring overhead, no freeways in the distance, no sirens, no television, noradio, no air-conditioner; only the white noise of a million cicadas and thehiss of my own blood running through my brain, the incessant swing of thependulum of an ancient clock, the barking of a distant dog, the cawing of acrow, the almost imperceptible whisper of the delicate film of curtains as theybillow gently toward me like the gossamer negligée of a love-sick ghost.This was the background music of my honeymoon with horror—playing as thehoney-sweet words of Edgar Alan Poe, lugubriously wove elegant phrases from theage of gilded manners into a symphony of tortured rapture. Only had I beenobliged to read the yellowing pages by the light of a whale oil lamp could myanachronistic reading experience been more exquisitely atmospheric.I was so lucky.Today most of us find it almost impossible to recapture the sepia-toned worldthat best conducts horror from the page to the soul. Twenty-first centuryreaders, spoiled by spectacular special effects of the cinema, demand from thewritten word instant gratification, explosive shocks, and gore-splatteredattacks upon the senses. We no longer allow ourselves time to refine the raptureof terror. We wolf down the junk-food snacks of violence and carnage when, withjust a little patience, we could leisurely savor a rich and soul-satisfyingbanquet of elegant horror. We are missing so much.That summer with Poe and my newly awakened love for the written word wouldeventually have profound effects upon my life; the most obvious being myeventual career as a writer. Writing is not only what I do for a living, it ismy art, my joy, my voice, my meditation, my prayer, my confession, mydeclaration of independence, my act of worship, my song of self-awareness. Myprofession, however, has taken many years to evolve and develop. My 1957 boyhoodlove affair with horror had more immediate and dramatic consequences. Simplyput—I woke up.Poe's narrative voice clearly revealed to me that I possessed my own narrativevoice. That hot, summer morning my consciousness instantly expanded. I no longerjust passively saw or heard or smelled or felt the things around me. I woke upand became consciously aware that I was seeing and hearing and smelling andfeeling the things around me. I became at once the observer and the observed ofmy own movie, and like the voice-over narration in a film-noir detective story Ibegan to tell myself the bed-time story of my own existence, and the narrationcontinues to this moment.Thank you Edgar Alan Poe. Thank you horror literature.The genre of classic horror has also changed the world. It can be argued thathorror is the mother of science fiction—and that science fiction has molded thefuture and touched the consciousness of countless millions of fans who now havegiven themselves permission to dream like gods. In its way, horror is thegrandmother of theoretical mathematics, quantum physics, and the mutation ofintelligence in this corner of the galaxy. But it all had to start somewhere,and the editors of this anthology have labored lovingly to pay homage to thefounding fathers of art form. Some of them, like Edgar Alan Poe or H.P.Lovecraft, or Bram Stoker, or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle require little or nointroduction. But others are perhaps less familiar to you. We have provided thebriefest of biographical sketches for all our authors at the beginning of eachselections, but I would like to take this opportunity to write a few extra wordsabout three of the stars of our production who also deserve, in my opinion to berecognized as founding fathers of horror:Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who I believe should be credited with establishingearly in the 19th century the archetypal form and devices of the horror genre;Robert W. Chambers, who late in the 19th century broke the space-time membraneof gothic horror and smashed open the doors of our subconscious—the same doorsfrom which H. P. Lovecraft's primordial “Old Ones” would ooze out forcing us tocower before our shadow souls;and Aleister Crowley, a real-life, unapologetic black magician who early in the20th century rolled up his sleeves and did battle with those shadows to turndemons of darkness into angels of light.SIR EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON (1803-1873)Have you ever heard the phrases?“It was a dark and stormy night . . . .” or,“The pen is mightier than the sword . . . .” or, “Pursuit of the almightydollar.”These familiar clichés first poured forth from the pen of Sir EdwardBulwer-Lytton the prolific English playwright, poet and novelist. As might beexpected of a gentleman of his breeding, the noble Lord Lytton pursued theseliterary diversions as an amateur while he busied himself with the seriousduties of serving his Queen (Victoria) as Secretary of State for the Coloniesand a wide assortment of other stiff-collared diplomatic and politicalresponsibilities. He published his first book of poems in 1820, and in 1828,when his semi-titillating essay on the whimsical subject of nineteenth centurydandyism was released, it was clear to the reading public that here was a fellowwho could be wryly entertaining as well as erudite.While his occult tales and horror stories have become favorites of lovers of themysterious and macabre, Lytton's most publically beloved and familiar worksremain his post-biblical epic, The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) which has overthe years captured the imagination of film makers; and his dramatic historicalfiction, Rienzi (1835) which Richard Wagner turned into an enduring opera. Hispopularity with the general public notwithstanding, Lord Lytton deserves seriousrecognition as one of the primary godfathers of horror. This enduring admirationattests to his skill with words, but even more impressive are his impeccablecredentials among serious occultists.Although empirical evidence is absent, Lytton is said to have been an initiateof one or more of the mysterious continental magical secret societies thatobliquely claimed they were of ancient Rosicrucian origins. He was almostcertainly the friend and confidant of the great French magician, Alphonse LouisConstant (Eliphas Levi, 1810-1875), the father of modern ceremonial magic.As a young member of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, I was instructed by my elderadepts (in no uncertain terms) that I was to read and study the works of LordLytton, especially his occult story “Zanoni.”8 Written in 1842 (a fullgeneration before the founding of Madam Blavatsky's Theosophical Society or theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) the opening words of Zanoni can beinterpreted as a Rosicrucian confession from Lord Lytton himself:It so chanced that some years ago, in my younger days, whether of authorship oflife, I felt the desire to make myself acquainted with the true origins andtenets of the singular sect known by the name of Rosicrucians.9While the plot of Zanoni is a darkly appealing love story that inaugurates allthe genteel devices of classic horror-love that we will (a few years later)recognize in the works of Edgar Alan Poe, Robert W. Chambers, and others. Butthe text of Zanoni also reveals (to the trained eye) the language of a fellowoccultist. In fact, it is clear that Zanoni could not possibly have been writtenby anyone other than a bona fide initiate of the mysteries. The story even makesindirect references to a magic book—a book that is undoubtedly the very realtome known to scholars today as The Book of Abra-Melin.10 This landmark occultgrimoire (c. 1378) would remain untranslated and unknown to the English-speakingworld (or indeed anyone but the most knowledgeable and serious student of theoccult) until 1888 when Golden Dawn adept S. L. MacGreggor Mathers translatedfragments of the text which he found in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal in Paris.The Book of Abra-Melin is considered by many to be the Rosetta stone of WesternMagick, elevating the misunderstood superstations of the mediaeval sorcerers toa spiritual science as sacred and viable as the self-transformational traditionsof eastern mysticism. As it would seem, His Lordship, Sir EdwardBulwer-Lytton—dandy, diplomat, and novelist—was rubbing elbows on a regularbasis with very same mystics and magicians who not only knew of the book'sexistence but were intimately familiar with its contents and significance.It is clear to me that where secret occult mysteries and practices are concernedit was not a case of Lord Lytton gleaning his occult knowledge from 19th centuryEnglish Rosicrucian pretenders, but one of 19th century “Rosicrucians” gettingtheir occult knowledge from him!While we heap praise on Lytton for being a founding father of horror, we mustalso credit him for helping introduce the world to the genre of science fiction.His 1871 novel, The Coming Race would prove to be a breathtaking and disturbinglook into the future. Unfortunately, early in the 20th century the imaginativeideas put forth in The Coming Race would be seized and distorted into amonstrous vision by the madmen of Germany's Third Reich, and employed like somemalevolent conjuration to invoke a great demon upon the earth in the form of thegenocidal terrors of the Second World War. No horror fiction story can possiblycompare to such unimaginable evil—such incalculable pain and death suffered bymillions-upon-millions of our fellow human beings.Of course, I am not suggesting we should blame Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton for thegenocidal horror of the holocaust. However, we would all do well to be mindfulof Lytton's own words, “The pen is mightier than the sword.” and be mindful ofthe awesome power the written word has to effect changes in human consciousnesseither for for good or for ill.ROBERT W. CHAMBERS (1827-1911)If H.P. Lovecraft is the Christ of Horror, then most assuredly Robert W.Chambers was his John the Baptist.Recently it was my privilege to introduce and curate the series of short storiesfirst published in 1895 under the collective tile: The King in Yellow, by RobertW. Chambers.11 To avoid paraphrasing myself I append a portion of myintroduction below. While I refer specifically to The King in Yellow, myobservations of Chambers' style, technique and imagination apply also to ourChambers selection, The Messenger.Perhaps you have heard of The King in Yellow? No? Neither had I until a fewyears ago when a film maker contacted me and informed me he was making a film ofThe King in Yellow, and asked if I would be interested in appearing in a cameorole in his production. Before I gave him my answer (the project was laterabandoned) I did a bit of digging and discovered a most remarkable treasure—aterrifying work of American horror that predates by a quarter century the firstshort story by H. P. Lovecraft. Indeed, The King in Yellow, by Robert W.Chambers, is arguably the archetypal inspiration for what would become an entiregenre of horror-fiction for which the immortal Lovecraft is ultimately credited.Robert W. Chambers (1865–1933) is not exactly a household name; but that has notalways been the case. Late in his career his romantic novels and historicalfictions were wildly popular, his books bestsellers, his magazine installmentseagerly awaited. For a time he was considered the most successful Americanliterary figure of the day. Yet his later and lighter offerings, while bringinghim fame and modest fortune, are forgettable bonbons when compared to the strongmeat and innovative brilliance of his horror fiction. The most notable of allhis work is The King in Yellow, a collection of short stories whose plots areloosely connected to an infamous imaginary book and play of the same titlebanned universally because of its ominous tendency to drive mad those who readit or came in contact with it. Indeed, the terror begins immediately with thereader unsure whether or not madness and suicide will be the price he or shewill pay for turning the page.I was a bit disoriented when I began reading The King in Yellow's openingstory—a dizzying effect that I'm sure Chambers intended to induce in the mindsof his “gay-nineties” readers. The tale, called “The Repairer of Reputations,”takes place in the science fiction “future” of a 1920's New York City, ametropolis of street names, parks and landmarks familiar to us still today whichChambers meticulously paints from his rich palette of images (he was, after all,a classically trained and skilled artist and designer). However, there issomething disturbingly tweaked with the entire milieu of the story. It all takesplace in a utopian and prosperous post-civil war America—a blend of aristocraticrepublic and military dictatorship that could have easily evolved from thestrange bed-fellows of the gilded age's contending movements: nationalisticlaissez faire capitalism and the liberal yet pragmatic ideals of socialprogressivism. From the opening lines, we are instantly plunged into analternate reality where the comfortable and familiar past has been slightlyaltered and we are forced to confront the infinite “what ifs” of history and indoing so calling into question the objective reality of the present.Nestled within this surreal environment we are introduced to a well-spokennarrator who at first seems to be a faithful servant of the truth but who willsoon give us reason to doubt both his sanity and our own. But I won't spoil thatfor you.Like Lovecraft would do decades later, Chambers allows the reader's ownimagination to do the heavy lifting of terror. Cassilda's Song which serves asthe epigram for the entire work is supposedly clipped from Act I, Scene 2 of theplay, The King in Yellow, and without burdening the reader's imagination withconcrete certitudes conjures images of strange locales and vistas not of thisearth, indeed, not of this universe, and only hints of characters of unspeakablepower and horror.Along the shore the cloud waves break,The twin suns sink beneath the lake, The shadows lengthenIn Carcosa.Strange is the night where black stars rise,And strange moons circle through the skiesBut stranger still isLost Carcosa.Songs that the Hyades shall sing,Where flap the tatters of the King,Must die unheard inDim Carcosa.Song of my soul, my voice is dead,Die thou, unsung, as tears unshedShall dry and die inLost Carcosa.Like all great works of horror, the story becomes disturbing, dark andterrifying in direct proportion to the degree to which our own hearts and mindsare disturbed, dark and frightened.ALEISTER CROWLEY (1875-1947)Unlike Lord Lytton and Robert Chambers, Aleister Crowley is not rememberedprimarily for his works of fiction. Admittedly, he was a prolific poet, and inthis capacity, even in his early twenties, he received a measure of criticalpraise and encouragement. His two novels, Moonchild (1917), and Diary of a DrugFiend (1922) also received a modicum of critical recognition and over the yearshave indirectly inspired a handful of film efforts. His short stories,12 plays,and essays (most privately published and now treasures coveted by collectors)were obviously written for an elite audience of highly educated esotericists andclose associates capable of appreciating his elaborate in-jokes, pornographicallusions, and obscure references. As much as he lamented his rejection by thepublic it appears he went to great lengths to openly court his own vilification.For the reader who is completely unfamiliar with the person of Aleister CrowleyI highly recommend his own Confessions13 and the recent biography, Perdurabo—TheLife of Aleister Crowley.14 I has been my pleasure and challenge to write ahandful of books concerning the life and work of this remarkable man. Thefollowing brief excerpt is from my book, Understanding Aleister Crowley's ThothTarot15.Paradoxes seem to define the life and career of Edward Alexander (Aleister)Crowley.16 Yes, in many ways he was a scoundrel. There is no doubt that hewallowed shamelessly in his carefully cultivated persona as England's literaryand spiritual bad-boy. At the same time he took life and himself very seriously.Among other distinctions, he was a world-class mountaineer,17 chess master,painter, poet, sportsman, novelist, critic, and theatrical producer. Heintroduced America to Astrology,18 Isadora Duncan to the I Ching, Aldous Huxleyto mescaline, and the poet Victor Neuberg to hiking and high magick. As an agentprovocateur, writing for an English-language German propaganda newspaper in NewYork, he penned the outrageous and inflammatory editorials that provoked areluctant United States Congress to enter the First World War on England'sside.19During the Second World War, at the request of friend and Naval Intelligenceofficer Ian Fleming,20 Crowley provided Winston Churchill with valuable insightsinto the superstitions and magical mind-set of the leaders of the Third Reich.He also suggested to the Prime Minister, if reports can be believed, that heexploit the enemy's magical paranoia by being photographed as much as possiblegiving the two-fingered “V for Victory” gesture. This sign is the manual versionof the magical sign of Apophis-Typhon, a powerful symbol of destruction andannihilation, that, according to magical tradition is capable of defeating thesolar energies represented by the swastika.Astonishingly, Crowley's adventures and achievements, more than any dozen men ofambition and genius could realistically hope to garner in a lifetime, seemalmost to be distractions when weighed against his monumental exploits ofself-discovery. His visionary writings and his efforts to synthesize andintegrate esoteric spiritual systems of East and West21 make him one of the mostfascinating cultural and religious figures of the 20th Century.Even though Crowley did not, like Edward Bulwer-Lytton, invent the genre thatwould define the format and atmosphere of classic horror; even though he wasn'tresponsible for transforming horror into the morbid-sweet love-song of atormented soul like Edgar Alan Poe; even though he didn't smash the dimensionalboundaries of space-time to plumb new depths of psychological hell like RobertChambers and H. P. Lovecraft; he did something none of them did. He actuallylived the terrifying and ecstatic events of the real life horror-lovestory-adventure of his own amazing life.Crowley is not important to us for the horror stories he wrote—but for themagnificent horror story he was.He didn't just write about demons, and devils, and angels, vampires, he invokedthem, evoked them, conjured them, battled them, conquered them; He didn't justwrite about the wonders and terrors of other dimensions, he willfully penetratedthem, navigated them, transcended them—then he wrote about them in exactingdetail.Nearly seventy years after his death, the man who the tabloids called the “mostdangerous man on earth,” the man they called the “wickedest man in the world,”the man who in all seriousness called himself the “Beast 666” is now receivingthe academic and philosophical attention and recognition that eluded him inlife.Crowley's influence today on the literary art form of horror is incalculable.There isn't a modern writer of horror, science fiction or fantasy who has not insome fundamental way been directly or indirectly influenced by Crowley.Crowley's dead. But his horror reaches from beyond the grave. Robert Chamberswrote of an accursed book and play called The King in Yellow. Supposedly,everyone who read The King in Yellow went hideously insane. I think of that andsmile when I encounter people today who still fearfully hold the person ofAleister Crowley in superstitious awe.“Is it dangerous to study Aleister Crowley?” I am still asked.Aleister Crowley was by no means perfect. He was not good with people, and oftenalienated those who loved him dearest. His bold explorations of human sexualityand drugs (always meticulously recorded and analyzed) are fascinating to study,but were never intended to be casually emulated. I have never encountered anyonewho knew him that did not disapprove of some aspect of his character orbehavior.But he is dead. For us, only his works remain as a measure of the man, and theyare currently more accessible to the general public than at any time during hislife. His influence on the modern world of art, literature, religion, andphilosophy is now widely acknowledged even by his most vehement critics. . . .But, is it dangerous for some people to study Aleister Crowley? I guess I haveto say “Yes.” For those whose belief in a God of goodness hinges upon thereality of Devil who is equally evil—for the superstitious, the ignorant, thelazy, the immature, the unbalanced, the mentally ill, the paranoid, thefaint-hearted; for anyone who for any reason cannot or will not takeresponsibility for their own actions, their own lives, their own souls; forthese people Aleister Crowley is still a very dangerous man.22And now dear reader I will leave you to enjoy the works of these three mastersof horror and the choir of other luminaries of the genre. I sincerely hope youenjoy your time with them and will treasure this beautifully produced book.Perhaps when you have finished reading it you'll want to put it in your familylibrary—near the dictionary and encyclopedia. Who knows, perhaps someday somebored young man or woman will discover it on a hot summer morning.For the time being . . . I bid you goodnight.1 Written for The Weiser Book of Horror and the Occult: Hidden Magic, OccultTruths, and the Stories that Started It All, Newburyport, Massachusetts: WeiserBooks, 2014.2 I sincerely apologize to Nebraskans, past and present, who might be offendedby my words, and ask the reader to please be mindful that my comments here aboutNebraska and Nebraskans are merely giving voice to the private, personal,subjective, and immature observations of the high-strung and unhappy nine yearold Lon Milo DuQuette. They do not necessarily reflect my current objectiveopinions of Great State of Nebraska or her remarkable and resilient citizens. Isincerely apologize to Nebraskans, past and present, who might be offended by mywords.3 Of course I wasn't actually “kidnapped.” Again, my flare for the overlydramatic is getting the best of me. (That happens, especially when writing aboutoverly dramatic subjects like horror stories.) My family moved from SouthernCalifornia to Nebraska so that my father could start a new business.

Theseworks made “Astrology” a household word in America and Europe and catapultedAdams to celebrated status as “Astrologer to Wall Street and Washington.”Recently Crowley's co-authorship has been graciously acknowledged by the Adamsestate and has resulted in the release of The General Principles of Astrology byAleister Crowley and Evangeline Adams, York Beach, Maine: Red Wheel/Weiser,2001.19 It is often forgotten that the United States was very close to entering theFirst World War on Germany's side. Much to the horror of the German ForeignMinistry, Crowley's editorials made it appear that it was Germany's intention(in fact its foreign policy) to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare againstcivilian shipping. Even though this was at the time an outrageous falsehood,Crowley's editorials were used to create an anti-German hysteria that wouldeventually sweep the United States into the conflict on England's side. In avery real way, Aleister Crowley saved his beloved England using only his pen asa magical wand.20 Ian (Lancaster) Fleming (1908-1964)—pseudonym, Atticus—British journalist,secret service agent, writer, whose most famous creation was superhero JamesBond, Agent 007.
