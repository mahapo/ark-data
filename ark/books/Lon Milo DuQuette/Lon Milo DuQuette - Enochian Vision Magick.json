Wilson (S. Jason Black), Clay Holden, Christeos Pir, David R. Jones, Robin Cousins, Josh Norton (Benjamin Rowe), James Wasserman, Judith Hawkins-Tillirson, Rick Potter, I.Z. Gilford, Poke Runyon, Christopher S. Hyatt, and Robert Powell—and to the regular members of the Monday Night Magick Class of Heru-ra-ha Lodge O.T.O., I give my most heartfelt thanks; Constance DuQuettc, who co-hosts this 30-year on-going class (and is my most ruthless heckler); Jonathan Taylor; Mike Strader; Jill Belanger; Olver Althoen; Carlos Casadas; and Sandy, Arto, Cobra, Vanessa, Bret, Michael, Patricia, Coleen, Mary, Evgeniy, Jane, Alan, Danny, and scores of others who throughout the years have brought Life, Love, and Liberty into our home each week. I would also like to thank Glacier Nitz-Mercaeant, of The Enochian's Keep in Indiana, for his beautiful gifts of my gold Enochian Ring and Lamen; and the late Cecil Eugene Burns (a.k.a. Frater White Haired Bull) who built and donated the true and faithful replica of the Holy Table that now adorns our Enochian Temple space. My thanks also go to Brothers Michael Strader, for his rendering of the Ensigns of Creation in the angelic script, and Robert Powell for his beautiful images of the Tablet of Union and the four Elemental Tablets. They are perhaps the clearest black and white renderings of these com- plex figures ever published. Finally I offer my heartfelt gratitude to Clay Holden for his encour- agement and support of this project. I am also deeply indebted to him for allowing me to use his magnificent recreations of the original angelic alphabet and his images of the Forty-nine Good Angels, the I loly Table, the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, and Golden Talisman.

Foreword This is the book I would have given my eyeteeth for twenty-five years ago. It is the first work to systematically lay out the whole corpus of Dee and Kelley's magickal system, and the only one to provide a useful path through the dense and multilayered labyrinth of what has come down to us as \"Enochian Magick,\" based almost entirely on their orig- inal manuscripts. When Lon asked me to consider writing a foreword to his book, 1 think he knew that I had not been deeply involved in Enochian research for a number of years, but asked me to at least consider looking at what he was writing. It took only about fifteen minutes of reading to reignite my enthusiasm for the material which at one time was an all- consuming passion, and to realize that what he was in the process of writing would become a landmark text on the subject. Now that the book is finished, I am even more deeply honored to be able to write a few words of introduction to his remarkable work. What particularly impresses me with Lon's book is not only the sheer volume of material covered or the clarity with which it is pre- sented, but its immense readability and the fact that he has struck an elegant balance between classical scholarship, practical magickal instruction, and anecdotal events. One never loses the sense that there is a real person at work here, questioning, organizing, and reporting his conclusions together with his experiences along the path. The self-important tone of many so-called \"Enochian Magick\" texts is entirely absent, replaced by clear and well- organized content. When I first encountered Enochian magick, the only available pub- lished materials were Regardie's Golden Dawn and Crowley's Gems from the Equinox, fascinating but largely incomprehensible to me. Next was (lie first of several largely incoherent books on Enochian Magick by Gerald Shuclcr, which elaborated on the Golden Dawn material and added much oi ins own invention) moat oi it of dubious value, in hind ilghti they leem more suitable for 1 lungeoni and Dragons than serious magickal worl (though to be fail i David [onei onci i id out to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"me, D&D is probably an excellent introductory discipline for magickal ritual work). Then came (Jeoffrey James's The Enochian Evocation of John Dee, a completely different matter altogether. Still more of a synopsis of a system than a workable guidebook (based largely on Sloane MS. 3191, Dee's precis of the materials received between 1582 and 1587), it gath- ered together the bulk of Dee and Kelley's work, and gave a sense of where it all came from. Still incredibly useful many years later, when coupled with an examination of the original scrying sessions that pro- duced the material, it still does not serve as a proper guidebook through the system. The heart is there, but the how and why are largely absent. When looking at what the Golden Dawn and Crowley and their successors put together as \"Enochian Magick,\" it seems clear that they were missing huge chunks of this \"how and why,\" along with many critical pieces to understanding what they were dealing with, and their attempts to graft basically everything else in their magickal system onto ii |) rod uce a cumbersome thing that Dee and Kelley would not recog- nize as what they pulled through. I have likened their resulting patchwork as similar to what happens when one attempts to open a Word document or a highly formatted database file in a text editor: one can read and even extract a good bit of raw data, but the formatting and links to other programs are entirely unreadable and bear little resemblance to the original document. Without an understanding of Dee and Kelley's early material, mostly presented in Sloane MS. 3188, what comes later on, while workable on its own, will be largely incomprehensible. And while in many ways it can be convincingly argued that the later system, centered on the four Elemental Tablets, and the Tablet of Union are independent of the earlier material, Dee's diaries demonstrate that he went back and added marginal notes to even the earliest diaries to refer to events and communications that transpire several years later, as well as referencing the earlier communications in the later entries. Fortunately for the reader, Lon's book gives full treatment, back- ground, and application of both the early and the later materials, and provides in spades both the how and why that are missing from so many other books that purport to be guides to the system. Forme, not until David Jones's (ienfei foi I'.noi hian Studies, based out of Thelema lodge < >T< > in < )aklaud, began Chi ll BtUlOtltl 'I tTBnii dptionl of the first of Dee's spirit diaries, did I get a real sense for the background story of Enochian magick. All of a sudden, it was like reading a Philip K. Dick novel, with the tables and diagrams coming to life, populated by spirits, angels, and demons of all sorts, each with his or her own per- sonality. And notably, John Dee and Edward Kelley for the first time became real people, questioning and struggling to understand and doc- ument what was being communicated to them. I was finally able to borrow microfilms of the spirit diaries from the always truly generous and helpful Bill Heidrick, and I spent countless days printing them out on microfilm reader printers. When I finally had a set of Sloane MS. 3188 (Quinti Libri Mysteriorum) printed out and bound in front of me, the real magick began to take place for me. It was as if one discovered that Jules Verne's Captain Nemo was a real person, and could read his own words and step back 400-plus years into the past, to share his thoughts and experiences. To this day, it is the closest tiling to real time travel I have ever felt. Dee's handwriting presented some difficulty at first, as did his use of many antiquated terms, abbreviations, and frequent recourse to Latin. To my aid came Elias Ashmole's \"fair-copy\" of the diaries (Sloane MS. 3677), transcribed many decades later, in a beautiful hand which was much easier to read than Dee's. It also has the benefit of being more complete in some cases than Dee's original, as the manu- script was in considerably better shape in the 1600s than it is today, and Ash mole made notes indicating where materials were missing. Given the difficulty in reading the original texts, it occurred to me to begin transcribing the diaries into electronic texts, laid out exactly as I >ee had in the original manuscripts, and this was the birth of the John Dee Publication Project. The idea, which I tested in reading circles at Thelema Lodge, was that once one could get past the difficulties of Dee's sixteenth-century italic and secretarial handwriting, the actual English was not so different from that of Shakespeare, and that the modern nailer would more easily be able to approach the work. I'UHIIH ing small batches of texts, with my transcription facing pages of the actual manuscript, it proved a fairly simple matter for people to il milk read and understand the material. While the world h.is changed immensely over the past two dli id. •.. in.

And while I have never completed the transcriptions of the Quinti Libri Mysteriorum, it both taught me many valuable computer skills that ultimately changed my life and demon- strated that the text could be reproduced as written in an easily read- able form. I am pleased that it still provides many readers with a place to begin in reading the spirit diaries. It was suggested to me early on by David Jones that rather than attempting to comprehend the whole system, I should concentrate on a par- ticular section and work to understand the mechanism of that piece of the system. In my case, that piece of the puzzle was the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. While 1 ,on in this book suggests that, rather than trying to reproduce Dee and Kelley's work, one ought to use the system they transmitted, I found it of inestimable value to read through the text of Mysteriorum Liber Secundus, where the layout and working of the Sigillum is sys- tematically laid out, and fill in each of the squares in a blank Sigillum as I went through it. By so doing, this impressive talisman became a truly living being for me, and it was possible also to rectify certain errors which exist in Dee's diagram of the Sigillum. Case in point: at the bottom of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, both in Dee's original illustration at the end of Mysteriorum Liber Secundus and in virtually every version published since, one finds the character \"y\" with a \"14\" under it. The text however clearly gives this number as \"15.\" Replacing this number, and applying the method of backwards and forwards rotation around the outer circle, one utilizes the remaining unused squares, and two additional names are produced, neither of which is mentioned in the text. This exercise is left to the reader. It further demonstrated that Dr. Dee, in fact, lies in certain places in the record, indicating that there is material hidden even there that he did not want to be visible to an unthinking reader. One of my favorite quotes from the beginning of Mysteriorum Liber Secundus is Dee's interchange with the archangel Michael: Mi. [...] Thow shalt sweare by the Living God, the strength of his Mercy, and his Medicinall vertue, powred into man's soule never to disclose these Mysteries D. Yf no man, by no means, shall perceyve any iliiuj', hereof, by me, I wold think thai I shold \"<>i do well. Mi. Nothing is cut from the churche of God. We in his Saincts are blessed for ever. We separate the, from fyled and wycked persons: We move the to God. D. I vow, as you require: God be my help, and Gwyde, now and ever, amen. MIC. This is a Mystery, skarse worthy for us, ourselves, to know, muche lesse to Reveale. Art thow, then, so Contented? D. I am: God be my strength. Keeping this in mind, one may begin to understand why Dee occa- sionally misdirects the reader in his diaries. As with Aleister Crowley's works several hundred years later, if one is paying attention to what one is reading, the erroneous data should just about jump out from the page, and provide a pointer to the actual information. Investigating such parts of the magickal furniture can provide fur- ther unknown or undocumented information, such as the following: If one adds and subtracts the numbers at the top and bottom of the letters around the outer ring of the Sigillum (having corrected the \"y/15\"), one arrives at a total number of 440. Adding the \"1\" in the con- centric circles that is given at the end of the instructions on the outer ring (accompanied by the statement \"Omnia unum est\"), the total comes to 441, the gematric value of the Hebrew \"Aemeth,\" or Truth. Without the correction of the \"y/15\" square, the total remains 440, the gematric value for \"Meth,\" or Dead. Thus, the Sigillum may be considered as a Golem, and the published version an inactive and unworkable \"dead\" talisman. There is also an additional Table to be generated from the instruc- tions given for the characters around the outer ring, as they are described in the text: D. Note: All the Cumpanies ol these 40, stode, live togither s and live logidier, and s<. in eight < umpanyes; each, of five"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Thus one can lay out the characters in eight rows of five, and in so doing, can produce symmetrical character sigils similar to the ones found on the Elemental Tablets for the angels of the outer ring. In attempting to find a simple way to generate a regular heptagram in a circle for the purposes of reproducing the Sigillum on paper, I fur- ther discovered an interesting connection between the spirit diaries and Dee's earlier Monas Hieroglyphica. While one cannot in fact produce a regular heptagon in a circle using only a compass and ruler (a geometric puzzle going back to ancient Greek mathematical texts), one can approximate it. There are several classical solutions, each of them rather close, but also involving complex methodology. Laying out the Monas Hieroglyphica in its 4 x 9 grid, as given in Dee's book, using a compass from the mid-point to trace a circle, and rotating the Monas so its \"horns\" touch on the circle from the top of the grid, one finishes with a very close approximation of a heptagon, in fact, as close or closer than any known classical solution. Finally, it is perhaps fitting to suggest that one can read and con- sider Dee and Kelley's spirit diaries in a number of different ways, some of them mutually exclusive, but all of them perhaps of interest and value. First, they can be considered as authentic records of spirit commu- nication. Over the years I have worked closely with practicing Enochian magicians, including at least one incredibly talented scryer, who can both see and hear through the crystal ball, a very rare combination. Most scryers can do one or the other, but not both. In Edward Kelley, Dee found a rare man, however difficult he may have been to work with, and clearly knew it. Dee could only rarely see or hear anything himself, but with his amazing mathematical and classically trained mind, was perhaps the only man in the world capable of understanding and organizing the instructions that were presented to him. He was also skeptic enough to question and reject transmitted material that appeared to come from lying spirits, as Kelley periodically pulled through \"illuding divils\" that specialized in disinformation. The inter- nal consistency of the bulk of the spirit diaries, as well as the coherent interrelationship of its many parts, speaks convincingly to its being a genuine record of actual events over a period of years. Second, one can consider the material as an even isc in < ryptographii method, intended as .1 means of communicating secret Information betel from the continent to Dee's colleagues and wpi m rlllzubeth'i court. Clearly, as one reads through Liber Mysteriorum Quartus, and to a certain extent Secundus, one can see similarities to the methodol- ogy of Trithemius's Steganographia, a work with which Dee was quite familiar, and which has now been demonstrated to be entirely a cryp- tographic treatise. The arrays of \"dignified\" and \"undignified\" spirits can be seen as referring to encryption methods involving \"nulls,\" and Dee and Kelley's discussion of \"transposition of letters\" in Quinti Libri Mysteriorum Appendix is at the very least suggestive again of the same. Then there are the tables in Liber Loagaetb, at the end of which (Sloane MS. 3189) Dee has appended eight tables from \"Aldaraia Sive Soyga,\" the mathe- matical methods of which have been demonstrated by Jim Reeds. They appear even on the surface to be cryptographic tables, though no one to date has made a systematic study of their content, nor provided any translation or decryption or methodology. They remain the most her- metically sealed of all Dee \"and Kelley's documents. In a similar way, one may usefully compare this \"cryptography\" l heme with the Kabbalistic method of transposition of letters along with numeric values as a strictly spiritual exercise (e.g., the \"Sepher Vei/.irah\"), and arrive at the conclusion that the Enochian system might he considered \"sacred cryptography\" in the same sense as the classical Kabbalistic method, unrelated to the mundane world of secret trans- mission of political secrets. Lastly, and perhaps most amusingly, I have entertained the idea that Dee was the author of the first science fiction novel over a period ol years, and indeed the first to give thought to the idea of \"cyber- ipace,\" an interdimensional world where communication takes place linemgh a portal, giving thought to the twentieth-century works of 11. I'. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, and William O. Gibson. In this view, while Edward Kelley is still a historic personage (he 'ii\" us in Dee's private diaries as well as being clearly documented l\"'ill in England and in Prague, usually in conjunction purely as an 1I1 In inisi), the \"Edward Talbot\" and \"Edward Kelley\" presented in ih\" Spiril Diaries, his frequent turns from devout scryer to blas- 1 ih'i !', Conjurer and back again, along with all the mischievous ind light hearted spirit! who are trotted on and off lite stage, can he seen 1 n iii «\"ii of Action, Whethet written purely foi I >ee's amusemem"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"or as a secret means of documenting a different sort of spiritual trans- mission remains hidden today. Of course, as anyone who has spent any time actually working with the systein(s) presented in the Spirit Diaries can attest, when you put them to work as if true, stuff happens. Once invoked (or evoked), the spirits do in fact seem to appear and go to work, whether one believes in them or not. Which leads to the one piece of advice I would give to anyone start- ing out in working Enochian Magick: Be very clear of what you ask for, as you are certain to get as much of it as you can handle, and once started, it is much more difficult to get it to stop. In closing, 1 would like to quote a passage from W. Wynn Westcott's translation of the \"Chaldean Oracles\" (quoting Proclus), which I have always found incredibly useful to keep in mind when working Enochian Magick, or indeed, any ritual work: As the Oracle therefore saith: God is never so turned away from man, and never so much sendeth him new paths, as when he maketh ascent to divine speculations or works in a confused or disordered manner, and as it adds, with unhallowed lips, or unwashed feet. For of those who are thus negligent, the progress is imperfect, the impulses are vain, and the paths are dark. Lon's wonderful book provides the reader—for the first time—with a clearly lit and well-ordered guide through the maze of Dee and Kelley's Enochian system. The hallowed lips and well-washed feet are up to the reader. Keep an open mind, a pure heart, and a clean temple, and you will surely hear their angels and spirits speaking to you. Clay Holden The John Dee Publication Project www.john-dee.org A Note Regarding Original Source Material and Footnote References The original Enochian magick material is a labyrinth of manuscripts. In preparing this book, I was fortunate to have at my disposal electronic files containing the photographic images of original material currently housed at the British Library, London. The manuscripts are numbered and designated by the name of past owners. The ones I used for the pre- sent work are designated: Sloane 3188, 3189, 3191; and Cotton Appendix XLVI parts I and II. Within these numbered manuscripts are various \"books,\" or \"Libers\" bearing separate titles. Some of these Libers were copied by Kelley or others and reproduced in subsequent manuscripts (sometimes renamed) and have found their way to London's British Library and the Bodleian and Ashmolean libraries at Oxford University. For my pur- poses the material from the British Library's Sloane 3188, 3189, 3191; and Cotton Appendix XLVI parts I and II proved to be quite sufficient. Digital scans of the Enochian manuscripts can be accessed electroni- cally at: http://www.tbemagickalreview.org/enocbian/mss/. Enochian scholar Geoffrey James prepared a concise summary breakdown of Dee and Kelley manuscripts for the bibliography of his excellent book, Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee. 1 He has graciously allowed me to reproduce his entries for the material that relates directly ni indirectly to Enochian Vision Magick. The reader who wishes to explore the source material in greater detail (or who simply wishes to track the book's footnotes and references) should find this list very helpful. SLOANE MS. 3188.

My tongue is tied. I stare at the blank screen of my monitor. I don't know how to start. For the writer it is the most difficult moment—a million things to say, but where to begin? My eyes search the walls and ceiling of my little office and fall upon the mask of the I lindu god Ganesha. His bright, pleasant face reminds me of the open- ing scene of Jean-Claude Carriere's play, The Mahabharata, 6 where Vyasa, the author of the epic poem is faced with his own writer's block as he strives to begin his monumental story. Unable to read or write him- •< II, Vyasa is blessed by the arrival of Ganesha, the beloved elephant- headed god, who offers to serve as Vyasa's scribe and takedown his story Irom dictation.

I am what they call in the East a householder—that is, I am married and have for my entire adult life endeavored with varying degrees of success to provide a loving and stable environment for my family. I am also an exceedingly lucky man, for in truth, throughout the years it has been my sainted wife and beloved son who have provided me with a loving and stable environment. Fate (coupled with a conspicuous lack of ambition) has conspired to make our lifestyle one of genteel poverty (well, not always so gen- teel). We've never owned a house, a new car, or a credit card. On the other hand, we've always lived in moderately affluent communities and safe neighborhoods. We've always owned old cars that usually get us where we're going. Our bills consist primarily of the rent, the utilities, health insurance, and our groceries. We have no debts. Some people say that's a miracle. I agree. Miracles are part of my job, for I am a magician. I'm not the type of magician who creates illu- sions to entertain audiences, but the type of who seeks to dispel the myr- iad illusions that hinder my own spiritual growth and enlightenment. Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), the great twentieth-century magi- cian, defined magick as the \"science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will.\" 7 This is obviously a very broad definition of the term. In my opinion, however, it is the only one that is entirely accu- rate. You are, of course, free to interpret this definition any way you wish. Personally, I've come to the realization that the only real changes I can effect with magick are changes in myself. By changing myself, I change the world around me, hopefully for the better. Naturally, I haven't always considered myself a magician, but for as long as I can remember I've been a seeker. Please don't project any undue piety upon this statement. I'm as wicked as anyone who seldom breaks any criminal or civil statutes can be. But even as I wallow in my dark and lazy wickedness, I find myself again and again stumbling inadvertently toward the Light. As a magician I have also been extraordinarily lucky. Early in my career I was befriended (and many times guided) by some very won- derful, and in their own ways masterful, magicians to whom I owe an immeasurable debt: Israel Regardie, Phyllis Seckler, Helen Parsons Smith, and Grady L. McMurtry. I have also collaborated with others who have enlarged and enriched my magickal life. Fore n among these is my wife, (lonstani e, who ii thi greati it m al magii ian I have ever known. There are many others as well: Karen James, whose pro- found sense of beauty and passion for the art of dramatic ritual keeps alive the mysteries of Eleusis; Douglas James, William Breeze, James Wasserman, Steven Abbott, LeRoy Lauer, David P. Wilson, Rick Potter, Dewey Warth, Nathan Sanders, Christopher S. Hyatt, Poke Runyon, Michael Strader, Sandra Brautigam, and Jonathan Taylor; and, for the last twenty-eight years, the assembled magi of my weekly magick class. On my fortieth birthday I began to write professionally. In this vocation I have also been exceedingly fortunate. Readers who are familiar with the body of my work know that I am occasionally taken to task by knowledgeable critics who accuse me of writing for begin- ners and who chide me for diluting or oversimplifying complex and esoteric concepts. Against these charges I can say very little in my tlefense except to confess that I am indeed a simple man who, by con- ventional academic standards, is a lazy and undisciplined student. I have to learn anecdotally. I need to put things in a personal context. I need to appreciate and understand the general before I can be thrilled and inspired by the specifics. Yes, I'm proud to write for beginning students of magick. But first and foremost I write to explain things to myself. I write to find out what I know. I write the books that I wish I could have studied during the first five years of my magickal studies—books that might have saved me years of frustration, blind alleys, and wheel-spinning. I also like to think that I write for more advanced students who may find themselves entangled in the elegance of magickal minutiae or else have become so entranced and self-impressed with their encyclopedic mem- 01 ies that they've lost sight of why they are doing magick in the first place. I write about things with which I'm familiar and have had hands- Otl experience. One of those things is Enochian magick.

A year or so later a friend would pre- sent me with a huge stack of photocopied 11 documents from the British Museum. This material represented several significant portions of sur- viving diaries and magickal notebooks of Elizabethan magus Dr. John Dee (1527-1608 or 1609) and his clairvoyant partner Edward Kelley 12 (1555-1595). Only then did I begin to realize how dreadfully deep the waters of Enochiana really are. By then, however, it was too late for me to get out of the pool. What little of the system I had mastered had already yielded breathtaking results. My life was becoming very magickal. Those primitive photocopies eventually yellowed, then browned, then charcoal-blackened into illegibility, but my interest didn't fade. Neither did the interest of others in the magickal community. Today clear copies of the museum manuscripts are readily available to the seri- ous student, and there are no less than thirty books currently in print with the word \"Enochian\" in the title. I confess a few of those are my doing. In 1991 Dr. Christopher S. Hyatt and I wrote a commentary on Aleister Crowley's little Enochian masterpiece, Liber Cbanokh. 13 A year latter Herman Slater of Magickal Childe Publishing asked me to pen the introduction to the new facsimile edition of the 1659 A True & Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers Between John Dee . . . and Some Spirits. In 1995, my wife, Constance, and I created a deck of tarot cards 14 that incorporates a large number of images relating to the Enochian Elemental Tablets. In the book that accompanies the cards, 15 I elucidate on how they can be used for practical Enochian magick operations. But writing (and reading) about Enochian magick is one thing; actually using it in a practical way to advance one's own spiritual evo- lution is another. With few exceptions, the thirty odd books mentioned above are very long on theory and history and very short on straight- forward suggestions on how to actually sit down and perform Enochian magick, or reasons why one would want to do such a thing in the first place. I hope to remedy this, at least in small measure, by writing this book. I feel qualified to do this not because I have any illusions thai I am the world's most knowledgeable scholar on (lie subject (I assure you I am not). I offer simply the credentials \"I nearly thirty y.w. <>l applied experience with several aspects of Enochian magick. I have come to some very fundamental conclusions that I believe might be of significant and practical value to both the speculative student and the operative practitioner of this elegant and complex magickal system. Before I plunge us directly into those waters, however, I need to hriefly address the question of why a relatively sane and rational twenty- first-century adult would wish to seriously embark upon the path of magick. I will do this with a device that will most assuredly irritate my publisher—a second prologue. And once again, to please my Lord (ianesha, 16 I will begin by talking about myself."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Prologue Why Magick? Magick is as mysterious as mathematics, as empirical as poetry, as uncertain as golf, and as dependent on the personal equations as Love. — ALEISTER CROWLEY 1 '' I'm a magician. I practice the art of ceremonial magick. I adore and invoke the essence of highest Deity and hold congress with divine angels. I also evoke and command spirits and demons. 18 Ceremonial magick is the path I have chosen to give expression to the spiritual yearnings I believe are inherent in every human being. It is my Tao, my Way, my religion, my philosophy, my psychology. But ceremonial magick isn't my life. I already have a life, thank you. But I use magick to help make my life magick. I have closets and chests full of bizarre and colorful robes and crowns and wands and daggers and chalices and swords and lances and thuribles and banners and veils and rings and incense and candles and oils and tablets and talismans and mirrors and crystals. I have books—strange books (some very old and rare), books that would scare the daylights out of most of my neighbors. I use these magickal tools; I study these books in order to perform the rites of ceremonial magick. These things are not my life. But I use them to make my life magick. On the surface one might think it reasonable and fair to ask, \"Why are you a magician, Lon? Why do you believe in this stuff? Why do you do these crazy things?\" It might surprise you to know I don't have •> proper answer lo these questions. Il is impossible for me lo adequately expltti (uitlfy why I celebrate my spiritual life through the vehicle of magick, for the same reasons it is impossible for any artist to properly explain why he or she has taken up the brush or the chisel or the violin or ballet slippers. If reasonableness were the sole criterion for the existence of art, there would be no music, no dance, no magick. Make no mistake about it, magick is an art form, and every true magician is an artist. Just like the musician and dancer, the magician must practice, create, and perform. Just like the painter or sculptor, he or she must be armed with proper tools, skills, knowledge, and, most of all, inspiration. But what about people who've never learned to play a musical instrument, never learned to dance or paint or sculpt, yet who find themselves spiritually touched by listening to music, watching bal- let, and visiting galleries? Are they not artists too? In a very important way, I believe they are. As quantum physicists Cell us, both the observer and that which is observed are changed by the act of observation itself. By appreciating the artist's handiwork, we are fundamentally affecting the reality and life of that creation. More importantly, when we expose ourselves to the artist's creation, we enjoy the passive luxury of allowing our consciousness to be altered, elevated, and enriched in unique and personal ways the artist might have never imagined. The art of ceremonial magick, however, is a little different. There is mi painted canvas to display, no audience to applaud. Regardless of how .ill ruistic the magician's motives may be, magick is spiritual performance art that must ultimately be executed and appreciated by the magician alone. He or she is at once the teacher, the student, the medium, the con- ductor, the performer, the venue, the audience, and the critic. The magi- • i.in touches the broader audience of humanity only by affecting i hanges in the magician, and success can be weighed only in the silent I loly of Holies of his or her own soul. So, here and now and for the duration of this book, I shall lay aside ihe question of \"why magick?\" If my magickal efforts seem to propel Mi' i loser lo sell realization, if my work brings me a measure of health <>i happiness or wisdom or a sense of fulfillment, good.

My living room will disappear, and in its place will tower the Temple of the Universe, holy ground demarcated by a consecrated car- pet of red silk, upon which rests the Holy Table, the center of the uni- verse, the Holy of Holies where heaven touches earth. The table is completely veiled by a red silk cloth, with its gold tas- sels that hang from each corner. The cloth conceals an elaborately painted and engraved tabletop, the perimeter of which is carved with eighty-four squares containing letters from a sacred angelic alphabet- letters whose names I chanted in the angelic tongue during my seven rounds of chanting. A large carved hexagram spans the entire inner sur- face of the tabletop. And in the center of the hexagram broods a large rectangle made up of twelve squares, each containing an oversized angelic letter—the same letters whose names I chanted during the sec- ond round of chanting—artfully carved into the surface of the table. Seven talismans, Ensigns of Creation, are arrayed around the central rectangle. They are made of purified tin and are peculiarly lettered in the angelic script. The centerpiece of the Holy Table is the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, a wax disk approximately nine inches in diameter and one and one-half inches thick, bearing the carved image of a complex diagram consisting of an interlocked heptagram, two heptagons, a pentagram, and an array of numbers and letters, which, when decoded, spell the names of seven sets of seven divine beings: Seven who rest in seven, seven who live by seven, the seven who govern the seven, and seven by whom all government is.

He is probably the single most influential aspect of the magician ever to have lived and a worthy successor to the Arthurian mage. —JOHN AND CAITLIN MATTHEWS 2 - 0 The little ceremony I described in chapter one cannot be found in any other book of magick. I composed it in the spring of 2006 for the ben- efit of the members of my weekly magick class. It is designed as a ritual of preparation—a ceremonial \"drug,\" as it were, to safely induce an altered state of consciousness, a trance in which specific techniques of magick may be practiced and visions can occur. The components of the ritual are not, however, a modern invention. The magical implements and furniture were fabricated as faithfully as possible from descriptions found in sixteenth-century manuscripts and items currently housed at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University, the British Library, and the King's Library wing of the British Museum. The prayers and the chants were drawn from those same ancieni texts. In a group magical working) the prayers are re< ited in uniion and the chants intoned Tibetan siylc, in n clei p monotone i hoi 141 oi two 01 four groups of voices. The hypnotic effect on the participants is tangible and powerful. (I have yet to discover what it does to our eavesdropping neighbors.) The ancient manuscripts I refer to are the diaries and magical records of Dr. John Dee 21 and his partner Edward Kelley, and these texts represent the source material for the system of magick known and practiced today as Enochian magick. It is not my intention, nor is it within the scope of the present work, to present a proper biography of Dee. That has been handled nicely in Peter French's brilliant biography 22 and other texts that I've itemized in the bibliography. I cannot, however, escape the necessity of providing a brief outline of his life and work, because it will have a direct bearing on our understanding of Enochian vision magick and why I think my little ritual of preparation is so important for those who wish to pursue this path. Son of a gentleman server to Henry VIII, John Dee was a true Renaissance magus and one of the most extraordinary individuals of his time. Historian John Aubrey called him \"one of the ornaments of his Age.\" 23 That is saying a lot, for his age was peopled with some of the brightest lights in the history of western civilization: Queen Elizabeth I, Charles V, Francis Bacon, Ben Johnson, Edmund Spenser, Giordano Bruno, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare. Dee's unique genius blossomed at Cambridge University, and his fame as a published mathematician propelled him as a young man to academic rock-star status throughout Europe. It also brought him to the attention of the rulers of his world, including the future Queen Flizabeth. He was the master of scores of disciplines. He was a physician, an engineer, a theologian, an astronomer, and cartographer. He invented the nautical instruments and developed the advanced navigational charts that helped make Britannia ruler of the waves. He even coined the term Britannia. A master astrologer, he was allowed to choose the date ol I'lizabcth's coronation, and throughout her reign he remained her friend and counselor.

Dee was secretly known as \"the queen's eyes,\" and he signed his dispatches to her with the stylized image of a hand shading two eyes. 007 Yes, John Dee, on \"her majesty's secret service,\" was the first agent 007. 24 Dee possessed the largest private library in England and was constantly enlarging it. He was perhaps the most educated man of his day. Part of his education included esoteric philosophy, Qabalah, alchemy, and magick—not illogical pursuits for a Renaissance magus. Magick, in particular, was a science to be explored and exploited. Dee wanted to talk to angels (as did the biblical patriarch Enoch) not only to discover the wisdom of the past and the secrets of the universe, but also, more immediately, to discover the secrets of Elizabeth's enemies and brandish the power to magically manipulate the spiritual forces that control them. Dee wanted to be a magical spy. His approach to magick (at least at first) was pretty standard pro- cedure for the day. After bathing and dressing in clean clothes (extra- ordinary measures for the times—unless, of course, it was May, when many people of the day took their annual bath), he would enter a room set aside for the purpose. There he would drop to his knees before a consecrated table/altar and for a half hour or so pray fervently to God and His good angels, alternately reciting a litany of self-abasing con- fessions of his unworthiness to enter into the divine presence and boasting of his God-given right to do that very thing. With his consciousness duly exalted by prayer, he would then gaze into a crystal or a black mirror (a process known as scrying 25 ) and wait to receive a vision. In theory that's how it was supposed to work. However, even though Dee was skilled at composing long and eloquent prayers, he was not very good at scrying. In 1581 he started to advertise for someone who was. He had a small measure of success with a handful o( rented seers until March of 1582, when he made the acquaintance ol one Edward Talbot. Talbot (who would soon confess that his name was actually Kelley) was an unemployed alchemist '•. assistant and convk teil forger. Kelley's questionable character notwithstanding, his skills as a scryer immediately impressed Dee, who hired him on the spot at a salary of fifty pounds a year, a handsome figure for the day. The partnership of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley would last until 1587. Their angelic-magick workings for the most part concluded in 1584. During their time together they engaged in hundreds of scrying sessions of varying lengths, in which Kelley gazed into a crystal ball or a black obsidian mirror and reported everything he saw and heard dur- ing a variety of angelic communications. Dee, sitting at a nearby table with pen and ink, led the questioning and recorded everything in anal-retentive detail. Not all of the sessions yielded profound revelations. Indeed, many appear to be attempts by the communicating intelligences to simply keep the conversation going. There were numerous instances when information received in earlier sessions was amended (sometimes radically) in subsequent sessions. There were even times when the magicians were informed that they had been deceived in earlier com- munications by evil spirits. Nevertheless, the consistency of the bulk of the material is staggeringly impressive, and the double-/triple-blind nature in which it was delivered, especially the angelic language, calls, and magical tablets, boggles the imagination. The Dee and Kelley years can be viewed as having occurred in three major phases, resulting in what appears on the surface to be three sep- arate and unique magical systems. I will discuss these in more detail shortly. Here at the beginning it is enough to simply point out it is the third and last phase of their angelic workings (the three-month period U-iween April 10 and July 13, 1584) that yielded the material for the system of vision magick that can be properly called Enochian. The Enochian period was highly productive and bore much promise. In fewer than a hundred days Dee and Kelley received an angelic language, tablets containing the names of elemental and celes- tial beings, and calls in the angelic tongue that promised to unlock the secrets ol heaven and earth. With sad, almost Faustian irony, however, once the Enochian material was in their hands, Dee and Kelley did not proi <'<•<! io .u lu.illv operate the system in subsequent workings. They would go on to othei magic .il adventures, attempting to impress (with hiilc ..) tin- crown heads ol Europe with (hen supernatural"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"counsel. Finally, after nearly five years of working together, years of exhausting magical sessions, and years of traipsing their families around Europe (not to mention a notorious wife-swapping incident), familiarity finally bred contempt, and the two magicians parted company without ever getting into the driver's seat of Enochian magick and turning the key. Dee's complicated life would draw him back to the English court and the distracting world of political intrigue and survival. In 1588, as the Spanish armada set sail to annihilate England's much smaller fleet (an event Dee predicted years earlier), Elizabeth called again upon her Merlin. Dee shocked her courtiers by urging the queen to not engage the Spanish armada and keep her ships at bay, prophesizing that a mighty storm would scatter and destroy the Spaniards. Elizabeth wisely heeded Dee's words. The storm manifested right on cue, and in the chaos that followed, the Spanish armada went down to defeat. In many circles Dee was credited with magically raising the tempest that saved England. The story of this event became instant legend. William Shakespeare, writing only twenty-three years later, would use Dee as the model for Prospero, the storm-raising magician in his play, The Tempest. Kelley's post-Enochian years would not earn him such renown. His ambitions kept him on the continent, where he peddled the promise of alchemical treasures to the crown heads of Europe. He was knighted by Emperor Rudolph II of Bohemia but was shortly thereafter imprisoned by his royal patron for failing to manufacture alchemical gold. With fairy-tale panache, Sir Edward Kelley plunged to an untimely death in November of 1595 while attempting to escape from the turret of Emperor Rudolph's prison tower. Dee's end was not so colorful. Elizabeth appointed him warden of Christ's College in Manchester, but it was not a happy tenure. His wife (and, it is believed, several of his children) died there during the plague in 1605. Dee returned to his home at Mortlake, where his daughter Katherine cared for him until his death in late 1608 or early 1609. How so many of Dee's manuscripts survived to see the light of the twenty-first century is a magical wonder story in and of itself. Several of the most important documents Dee had hidden in the false bottom of a cedar chest (can we get much more romantic?), where they lay undiscovered for over fifty years after his death. Through a CUrloUl chain of events (that tragically saw a portion of the manuscripts baked as pie wrappings), the surviving material came to the attention of the illustrious antiquary, politician, astrologer, chemist, and Freemason, Alias Ashmole (1617-1692), one of the few people in the world capa- ble of recognizing the importance of the discovery. Thanks to Ashmole, the material was catalogued and finally housed safely in his own museum at Oxford, the British Museum, and the British Library, where, over three hundred years after its reception, it captured the attention of S.

MacGregor Mathers, Wynn Wescott, and the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, then Aleister Crowley—and now you."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE Dee and Kelley vs. the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley Now hath it pleased God to deliver this Doctrine again out of dark- nesse: and to fulfill his promise with thee, for the books of Enoch:To whom he sayetb as he said unto Enoch.

L. MacGregor Mathers and the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later adapted and augmented by Aleister Crowley and others) is a remarkable and tidy self-referential system of visionary magick. It is based upon a small portion of sixteenth-century manuscripts of Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley, and the mystique of its colorful origins make it initially alluring to magical dilettantes and dabblers. However, the complexity of the system, as outlined by Golden Dawn/Crowley texts, continues to effectively guard the mysteries of this marvelous magical art form from all but the most serious, count geous, tenacious, foolish, or naive.\" For most of us who cut our Enochian-magick teeth during the latter half of the twentieth century, the Golden Dawn (GD) and Crowley books were at the time the only source material readily available to us. By fol- lowing the intricate procedures outlined in these texts, we proceeded with our visionary quests along the two avenues of experimentation offered us by the GD/Crowley model: one branch of the system dealing with the elemental (manifest) universe, the other dealing with the aethyric (celestial). I'll discuss these branches in more detail in book IV. Both of these magical environments are populated by spiritual beings whose names are drawn from five grids of lettered squares received by Dee and Kelley during a series of angelic communications during the third (or Enochian) period of their magical operations. Both the elemental and the celestial magical environments (and their spirit inhabitants) are accessed by intoning one or more of nineteen calls, which are chanted in an angelic language that was given to the Eliza- bethan magicians under breathtaking and extraordinary circumstances (luring the last months of their angelic magick workings. Theoretically, these calls induce very specific trances, whereby the magician can pin- point particular spiritual entities or environments he or she wishes to 1 (intact or visit. As you can imagine, this is a very attractive prospect to 1I1. magical explorer. The visionary labor of many post-modern Enochian explorers was well repaid, for we soon discovered that despite our very limited access to the original texts (not to mention our inexperience and ineptitude) 1 Ins kind of magick actually worked. With surprisingly few exceptions, when we followed the GD/Crowley procedures and techniques, even 1 he most insensitive and skeptical among us received visions we deemed ippropriate to the particular regions we were exploring. The technique used to receive visions such as these is called scrying. I he (iolden Dawn and Crowley often referred to the practice as \"trav- eling in the spirit vision.\" Scrying is, quite simply, the ability to put one- II li in touch with one's own psychic senses.

Art lovers and movie fans make particularly good candidates for Enochian vision magick, for they see with the romantic's eye and already possess a vast memory bank of evocative landscapes, archetypal characters, and supernatural beings. They are by nature dreamers skilled at communicating through a vocabulary of images and visual metaphors. But even the least imag- inative of us, in short order, learned to develop our own visionary skills that became increasingly honed by our repeated work with the system. There is no question (in my mind, at least) that the Enochian mag- ick procedures and techniques developed by the Golden Dawn and Crowley embody a highly effective system of magical working that, if properly applied, can become an integral component in the modern magician's program of personal self-development. This is especially true for those of us whose magical careers have led us to the Qabalah-based disciplines referred to today in specialized circles as hermetic or cere- monial magick. To modern ceremonial magicians, Enochian magick appears at first glance to enjoy a comfortable compatibility with our world of penta- gram rituals, hexagram rituals, tarot cards, trees of life, qabalistic path workings, chakra work, invocations, god-forms, and spirit evocations. This compatibility, however, has been, for the most part, contrived and jerry-rigged. For as efficacious as the GD/Crowley applications and techniques are, they bear little resemblance to anything Dee and Kelley practiced or were instructed to engage in by their angelic contacts. With all due respect to Mathers, it is clear that he and his Golden Dawn adepts chose to limit their attention to only those portions of source texts that offered material that they could fit easily into the qabalis- tic/hermetic schema to which they were so passionately committed. Furthermore, it is clear that in many instances, when the original mate- rial didn't fit the schema, they found a way to make it fit. This fact should not diminish in our respect for the wonderfully effective system the Golden Dawn and Crowley have bequeathed to us. But it has prompted many of us (who obviously have an inordinate amount of time on our hands) to examine in greater detail the surviving Dee and Kelley material that has now become more readily available to the serious student. What we discovered is an overwhelmingly large body of work- hooks, notebooks, and diaries the most interesting <>l which span the better part of threi ••• u oflntemi magical opentiom Most of this material appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with Enochian magick as practiced today. As I mentioned earlier, Dee and Kelley's magical workings took place in three distinct phases that yielded three unique magical systems. For convenience, I will refer to these as (1) Heptarchia Mystica (or simply Heptarchia), (2) Loagaeth (which includes an angelic alphabet), and (3) Enochian. One could argue quite convincingly that the revelations Dee and ^ Kelley received during the Enochian period represent the creme de la creme of their magical workings and that it is unnecessary to waste our time on the painfully complex details of the Heptarchia and Loagaeth working periods. After all, the GD/Crowley system and techniques were developed from this plus ultra Enochian material, and everything seems to work just fine, thank you. In fact, for the better part of twenty years I was one of the most vocal apologists for the Enochian school whose motto is, \"Don't try to duplicate the magick Dee and Kelley did to receive the system—just use the system they received!\" Then, start- ing in 1999, a couple of things happened that caused me to rethink the wisdom of this attitude. First, I became enthralled with the work of Clay Hoi den and the John Dee Publication Project, which brought the glories of Quinti Libri Mysteriorum to life on the World Wide Web. Then, in 2003, my O.T.O. 28 Brother and Enochian magick adept Christeos Pir sent me a computer disk of material from a marvelous Enochian seminar he pre- sented in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Along with the seminar material, he sent me a collection of photographic files of surviving Dee manuscripts from the British Library and other materials that were of great interest to me. I assure you, I could not have written this book without these materials and the profound insights of this great modern magician. Around the same time, my publisher sent me a copy of Joseph H. Peterson's book John Dee's Five Books of Mystery: Original Sourcebook Of Enochian Magic. I had years earlier examined much of this material I nlarged from microfilm, but now I had the luxury of comfortably reviewing it in clearer formats (with Latin translations) on my home i omputer and from Peterson's marvelously well-organized book.

Did I need to sacrifice three years of my own life in order to eavesdrop on every detail of three years of theirs? More than ever I saw the wisdom of simply using the magical system Dee and Kelley received and of not wasting precious time trying to recreate the magick they practiced to receive the system. After all, can't I drive a car without first having to build it myself? But we're not talking about driving cars; we're talking about the art of magick. In the final analysis, no matter what system the magician chooses, in order to make it work most effectively he or she must first become attuned to that system's particular way of viewing of the uni- verse. This concept is so important to the understanding of what will follow in this book that I will pause to illustrate with an example. The ceremonial magician who practices qabalistic magick acqui- esces (at least for the duration of the working) to see all things in heaven and earth in terms of a hierarchy of spiritual personages expressed by the various god names, archangels, angels, spirits, intelligences, and demons of the system. In Qabalah-based magic, such spiritual beings are conveniently organized and arranged according to fourfold formulas dictated by the Hebrew letters that make up the great Name of God, Yod Heh Vav Heb, and by the familiar schema of the Tree of Life, with its ten sephiroth and the twenty-two paths that connect them. Before the magi- cian is ready to operate within the laws and peculiarities of this qabalistic worldview, he or she must first become a fit component of that universe— a harmonious and integral part of this great divine machine, a vital step on this hierarchical stairway of consciousness. Like the ballerina whose ninety minutes on stage is the product of years of practice and thousands of hours of rehearsal, the magical artist must also be first transformed into a proper instrument of his or her craft. Magicians achieve this transformation with preliminary medita- tions and rituals, by which we adjust our focus step-by-step until we become comfortable citizens of the specific magical world in which we intend to operate. For the western ceremonial magician, the well-woni curriculum of the Golden Dawn provides perfect examples of this step by-step adjustment process. First the magician becomes master of the pentagram and a full cii izen of the world of the five elements oil he micmcoimic universe. By repeated performances of the pentagram rituals unci meditations, the magil ian'l psyche becomes balanced and accustomed to the world of the four directional winds, the four elements, and the corresponding magical weapons: the wand, cup, sword, and disk. Once the elemental (microcosmic) universe is mastered, the magi- cian then moves on to the next step in the attunement process by mas- tering rituals of the hexagram. Here the magician's point of reference is enlarged as his or her consciousness and identity is obliged to expand from the microcosmic world of the elements to the macrocosmic greater world—the world characterized by the sun orbited by the planets and surrounded by the belt of the zodiac. This is very basic stuff, but it illustrates how rituals enable the cer- emonial magician to externalize internal processes and undergo self- transformation. Would-be magicians who attempt more advanced work without being adjusted by these early attunements are ill prepared to understand or properly absorb what is happening to them within the Context of the progressively higher magical environments in which they presumptuously wish to operate. It is true that some magicians may receive seemingly dramatic and noteworthy effects from such prema- lure efforts, but seeds of promise cannot long take root in soil that is not properly prepared or that is too shallow. Late in 2005, while gathering material for yet another workshop • i ies on Enochian magick for my Monday night magick class, I poured I iver the records of Dee and Kelley's pre-Enochian workings in hopes of finding the key to their preparatory processes. What exactly did the ingels do to Dee and Kelley during the years prior to the final Enochian Wvelations? Dee and Kelley received some pretty interesting things dur- iHi; i hose earlier workings, including instructions for the creation of an HI i\\ of magical implements that the Golden Dawn and Crowley all I gnored: • .1 King; 29 .1 I,aiuen, which was to be worn by the magician as a breastplate im! which connects him or her to the Holy Table; iIn I loly Table itself, inscribed with letters from an angelic liphtbet and upon which would rest the Sigillium Dei Aemeth; thi Sigillium Dei Aemeth, an intricately carved disk made of piiiilii .1 lurswax (an nrtifai i so stunning ami historically"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"intriguing that it is prominently displayed today in the King's Library wing of the British Museum); • seven talismans (five squares and two circles), called Ensigns of Creation, which surround the Sigillium on the Holy Table. All of these items were linked to one another and to the magicians by an overwhelmingly complex process that distilled, shuffled, and organized thousands of letters from numerous and varied alphanumeric grids. These grids had been painstakingly received in vision, one letter at a time, by Kelley and duly transcribed by Dee. The letters spelled the names of great angels, which, in turn, when manipulated, yielded the names of subordinate angels, which produced still more names. Now, before we get too excited about dusting off and playing with all these pre-Enochian magical tools and furniture, I have to make myself clear on one very important point. These items were received during the first phase of Dee and Kelley's workings. This period yielded a unique system of planetary magick they referred to as Heptarchia Mystica (see book II). To all appearances, heptarchic magick has little or no direct relationship to the Enochian magick system they received during their final days of practice. Also, it is demonstrably clear (in my mind at least) that Enochian magick can be performed quite effectively without using the Ring, the Lamen, the Holy Table, and so on. However, it is equally clear to me that, as Dee and Kelley were receiving and working with the items and concepts of heptarchic magick, their minds and psychic bodies were, day by day, undergoing subtle yet profound evolutionary changes. Could the reason the practical Enochian material came so very late in the game be that Dee and Kelley had to first complete their trans- formation into magicians who could appreciate and handle the advanced work? After all, isn't that what magick is really about— changes in the magician? Could these changes have been brought about by the mere act of meticulously following the angels' complex directions, which filtered and distilled these magical concepts into material mani festation? If so, this would be a vital preparatory stop dial modern Enochian magicians are omitting entirely. I grew intrigued with (his idea, Given the facl ili.H the (il)/( Irowlcy methods of Enochian magii i- already woi I- 10 well righi out of the bo how much better might these same techniques work if the magician were first prepared and attuned in a manner similar to the way Dee and Kelley had been prepared and attuned. A magician so equipped would be picking up, as it were, where the two Elizabethans left off in 1584. 30 I was at first uneasy with this theory because it came dangerously near to destroying my comfortable philosophy of \"Don't try to dupli- cate the magick Dee and Kelley did to receive the system—just use the system they received!\" However, my inherent laziness was rewarded, and I eventually took comfort in the realization that in order to cere- monially prepare oneself to perform Enochian magick, one might not need to torturously repeat everything Dee and Kelley did to receive the Ring, the Holy Table, the Lamen, the seven Ensigns of Creation, and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. Instead, one must simply understand and use (in a way that mirrors the preparation process) the Ring, the Holy Table, the Lamen, the seven Ensigns of Creation, and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth that they received! This book was written to show the practicing Enochian magician how to do precisely that, and the little ritual in chapter one (and out- lined in greater detail in appendix I) is the ceremony that embodies this preparation process. Like the rituals of the pentagram that prepare us for elemental magick, like the rituals of the hexagram that prepare us for planetary magick, I believe this little ceremony captures the essence of the step-by-step processes of personal alchemy that prepared and attuned Dee and Kelley. The material is based on two series of classes that Constance and I held in our home in 2005 and 2006—visionary workings that spanned a period of just over seven months. While the class spent a considerable amount of time discussing and analyzing the magical theories that underlie these methods of preparation, most of our time was spent actually applying the techniques in a formal and ceremonial manner prior to group and individual Enochian scrying sessions. My biggest challenge, for both the class series and writing this hook, has been how best to communicate the essence of the breathtak- Ingly intricate procedures that occupied Dee and Kelley during their years ol preparation without enmeshing the reader in a time-devouring web ol details.

It is very important for the reader to understand that this book was not written as a substitute for the source material but simply as a guide to the practical, self-transformational applications of this magi- cal art. I advise those of you who may be committed to in-depth acad- emic research of this subject not to view my book as an authoritative replacement for the original texts. Dee and Kelley's records are liberally peppered with irregularities, conflicting instructions, missing pieces, and typos. I've done my best to wade through these and be as consis- tent and accurate as possible. But when I say I'm going to stay focused on the big picture, that is exactly what I mean.

You just have no idea how big your head is.\" 32 Certainly every -in ,nle impression we receive is ultimately processed inside our own i'HI ids.

For practical purposes, it does not matter whether the magician is making contact with \"spirit\" intelligences from a \"spirit world\" or merely tapping into currently unexplainable levels in his or her own mind. If the magician is properly prepared (and operating under the right circumstance), it is indeed possible for him or her to make contact with intelligences that for all intents and purposes could be character- ized (objectively or metaphorically) as angels, spirits, and demons. No two individuals are alike, and the art of preparing oneself and arranging the right circumstances for spirit contact is unique for every magician. For us to understand the elements of Enochian magick, we will need to get a basic idea of how the spirits went about reaching the minds of Dee and Kelley—especially Dee, who was, after all, the oper- ating magician. In fact, there are instances where the communicating intelligences indicated that they viewed the two magicians as a single entity with Kelley acting as an extension of Dee's mind. On April 28, 1582, Dee asks of the archangel Michael, \"You mean us two (Dee and Kelley) to be joined so, and in mind united, as if we were one man?\" and Michael answered, \"Thou understandest.\" As I mentioned earlier, Dee was not a particularly talented scryer. Although his diaries record several instances when he saw certain spir- its and phenomena, he relied almost entirely on the visionary skills of others. This makes perfect sense to me. Dee's immense intellect was actually a magical handicap. His magnificent brain was too engaged to surrender its analytical control. His mind worked too fast, and his thoughts were too loud to hear the subtle messages from the spirits. This is not good for mystical experiences. In order for the communi- cating intelligences to get past Dee's constantly churning mind, they had to force him to use his mind to overcome his mind. They had to beat his brain at its own game. And what were the favorite games of Dr. John Dee's brain? Ciphers, codes, puzzles, magick squares—these were the arts that touched Dec's sense of wonder. Had he been obsessed with music, the spirits might have communicated to him through melodies 01 harmonies ni rhythm, I lad he been a dancer, they would havi i ommunii Bted through elementi of body movement; had he been a military man, they would have through the metaphors of battle. But he wasn't a musician or a dancer or a soldier. Dee was, at heart, a cryptographer—perhaps the best in the world—and whether he consciously realized it or not, this was how he could make contact with his subconscious mind. This is how he expected the cosmos to unveil her secrets to him. For Dr. John Dee, the secrets of the universe were codes that could be broken. Divine revela- tion was a matter of decipherment, and he was willing to work for it. Indeed, by working for it, he would prepare himself to receive it. Give me the raw data, and I will decode the mind of God. Dee was already looking for that raw data the day Edward Kelley first knocked on his door. He was looking for it in the Book of Soyga."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE The Book of Soyga Dee: Is my book of Soyga of any excellency?

In later diary entries he laments that he has misplaced his Book of Soyga, and still-later entries indicate that he eventually found it. The book is an anonymous, late-medieval grimoire of planetary, angelic, and demonic magick that is in many ways noi COO dissimilar from other magical treatises ol the period. I lowcver, there are several things that distinguish Soyga —things that obviously made it particu- larly attractive to Dee. For one thing, a great deal of the text concerns itself with alphanumeric exercises and puzzles; letters with numerical, astrological, and elemental values, which are combined, recombined and reduced to form magick words (spelled forwards and backwards), all of which contain increasingly complex values and magical virtues. As we will see, this magical letter distillation process is characteristic of Enochian magick. Perhaps most intriguing to Dee were the last eighteen leaves of Soyga. These pages contain thirty-six tables, each comprising a grid of 1,296 squares, arranged in 36 x 36 grids. Each of the tables' 1,296 squares is filled with a Latin letter. Together the tables could form a cube comprising 46,656 squares. Each of the thirty-six tables is identi- fied by an astrological or elemental symbol; the first twenty-four are attributed (in pairs) to signs of the zodiac, the next seven to the planets, the next four to the elements (Fire, Water, Air, and Earth), and one simply to \"Magistri.\" 35 ' 36 For our purposes, I impress upon the reader's mind the profound importance of alphanumerics and how much information can be encoded within a grid of a magick table.

One very big example is all things in the universe that exist in time and have movement, and all things that have a beginning, a middle, and an end. In this example c also represents Saturn and everything Saturnian (from wisdom and restriction to darkness, old age, and lead). Like DNA, alphanumeric squares carry an unimaginably vast amount of information in a deceptively small package. As a resident of our 3x3 table, the c square also carries information drawn from its position relative to the other letters and their correspondences. Can you begin to see how much information is contained in that one little square alone? Imagine, then, the mass of complex data that could be tightly stored in a 36 x 36 x 36 square cube represented by the Book of Soyga. I've discovered no evidence of a direct connection between the Book of Soyga and any of the magical workings that led ultimately to the reception of Enochian magick. Nevertheless, the fact remains that even before Dee met Kelley, the mechanics of the alphanumeric cipher system, as presented in Soyga, captured Dee's analytical imagination and had become part of the way he expected to receive divine infor- mation. Indeed, at every phase of Dee and Kelley's workings, alphanu- meric squares and codes would play a major role. We know Dee held the Book of Soyga in high regard and was par- ticularly preoccupied with learning the secrets of the thirty-six tables. The magical process of the Book of Soyga (shuffling and distilling immense numbers of letters and squares into smaller and smaller bits of concentrated information) would become the modus operandi by which the spirits would ultimately communicate the secrets of Enochian magick to Dee and Kelley. It would be the method by which they received the Holy Table, the Lamen, the Ensigns of Creation, the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, the Table of Nalvage, the Elemental Tablets, and, most dramatically, the angelic language and the forty-eight calls. In a way, this process is a metaphor of the mechanics of creation itself. As Carl Sagan 37 said, \"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.\" In this case, our apple pie is the mani fest universe—the world as ii presently exists I he world Dee and Kelley wished I iderstniul and nuj'.ii ill) iffeCI This world is the end product of a progression of cosmic events that physicists believe began with an immeasurably dense singularity (containing all the potential information that would eventually become the universe) that burst open and set into motion the phases of creation. The immensely packed assembly of thirty-six 36 x 36 alphanumeric squares found in the Book of Soyga is a crude but appropriate model for such a singularity. The intricate process of combining, shuffling, and distilling information-packed squares magically mimics the astro- nomical processes by which atoms and elements to stars and planets were formed in the creation cycle from seemingly chaotic units of a potential universe. The Book of Soyga did not play a direct role in the magical opera- tions of Dee and Kelley, but the patterns and formulae it embodied would remain the methodology of their angelic communications until the end of their association. I believe that the two magicians, by taking part in this incremental process of creation, became personally attuned to the magical universe as it presently exists, and thus prepared them- selves to receive and engage in Enochian magick. In the chapters that follow, I will present only the briefest snapshots of the step-by-step process that I believe was the attunement program that prepared Dee and Kelley to receive the Enochian magick system. Hopefully, by your participation in the process, you also will undergo (however vicari- ously) a similar transformational experience and become fully prepared to actually practice Enochian vision magick.

Even if you think you don't believe in the same God that Dee and Kelley believed in, it's okay to pray.

In my book The Key to Solomon's Key, 39 I illustrate this concept c the legend of King Solomon as my example. In the excerpt below, i dim uss prayer in the context of spirit evocation, but the same thoughts hold true to all forms of magick, including Enochian. The third chapter of the book of Kings 40 tells us that at the beginning of his reign the Lord appeared to Solomon in a \\ ISIOII by night and said, \"Ask that which I should give you.\" Solomon answered: \"(live therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people and to discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?\" And it pleased the Lord because Solomon had asked this thing. And the Lord said in Solomon, \"Because you have asked this thing and have not asked for yourself riches, neither have you asked the lives of your enemies nor have you asked for yourself long life, but Ihirc asked for yourself wisdom to discern judgment; Behold, J have done according to your words; lo, I have given you a wise ,m,l understanding heart, so that there has been none like you btfori von, neither shall any arise after you like you.\" 41 Before undertaking the task of ruling his people and building the J< 1111>Jc-, Solomon doesn't begin by consulting with his infe- I (hr. ministers, his generals, his architects, his building- luppl) 'oiiii.u ior,, 01 i.il>oi K.Kid',).

Instead he turns his atten- tion upward to the highest level of the hierarchical scale of con- sciousness. He makes direct contact with Deity and, instead of behaving like a helpless youngster asking a parent for pocket money, he boldly makes himself available to serve as a conduit through which the Deity's infinite wisdom and understanding can pass. This profoundly mature and uncomplicated request is instantly granted, as if Deity had no choice but to acquiesce. A unique 42 spiritual hierarchy is created, with Solomon enthroned midway between heaven and hell—poised to work in cosmic harmony with the divine consciousness above him, poised to compel the infernal spirits to do the same. This is the primary secret of Solomonic magic. As long as the magician remains plugged in to that which is above, he or she is simultaneously plugged into (and must begin to master) that which is below. 43 Dee's prayers, both in English and Latin, fill page after page of his diaries and magical records. I confess I am neither inclined nor devo- tionally equipped to follow his exhausting example. I do, however, rec- ognize the efficacy of prayer as an indispensable preliminary to magical operations. And, while I do not personally believe that the biblical Solomon ever existed as such in empirical history, as a magical artist I embrace his myth and happily adopt him as a patron saint of magick. How appropriate, then, that the first magical tool Dee and Kelley would receive from their angelic contacts was the Ring of Solomon, and that before putting on that ring, the magician must first pray. BOOK II De Heptarchia Mystica"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN The Ring ho, this it is. This is it, wherewith all Miracles, and divine works and wonders were wrowght by Salomon. —THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL, MARCH 14, 1582 The first system of magick Dee and Kelley received from their angelic contacts was a form of planetary magick referred to as De Heptarchia Mystica. It was delivered mostly in late 1582 and amended somewhat the following year. The details of how it was painstakingly received are recorded in Dee's Quinti Libri Mysteriorum 44 and edited for purposes of practical working in his \"De Heptarchia Mystica.\" 45 Unfortunately, we don't know exactly how, or even if, the magicians actually operated this particular form of magick. What we do know is that besides receiving the names and symbols for forty-nine planetary \"good angels\" Dee and Kelley were instructed to create a number of magical items—items that were almost entirely ignored by the Golden Dawn and Crowley. These items, I believe, can be extremely important tools for the modern Enochian magician; these are the Ring, the Holy Table, the Ensigns of Creation, the Lamen, and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth. First we need to examine the Ring, for wiilioui the Ring the magi cians were told they could \"do nothing.\" Unlike most other things they would receive from their angelic contacts, the Ring was delivered in a relatively straightforward manner. I will not quote long passages from Dee's records, but his descrip- tion of the circumstances surrounding the reception of the magic Ring are so colorfully dramatic that I cannot resist quoting a brief passage. The date is Wednesday, March 14, 1582. Dee and Kelley were engaged in their fourth action 46 and experiencing a close encounter with the archangels Michael and Uriel. (The following excerpt retains the incon- sistent spelling and punctuation of Elizabethan English. The Greek delta, A, is Dee, \"Mi\" the archangel Michael.) A: Now Michael thrust out his right arme, with the sword: and bad the skryer to loke. Then his sword did seame to cleave in two: and a great fyre, flamed out of it, vehemently. Then he toke a ring out of the flame of his sworde: and gave it, to Uriel: and sayd, thus: Mi: The strength of God, is unspeakable. Praysed be god for ever and ever. A: Then Uriel did make cursy unto him. Mi: After this sort, must thy ring be: Note it. A: Then he rose, or disapeared, out of the chayre, and by and by, cam again, and sayde, as followeth. Mi: I will reveale thee this ring: which was never revealed since the death of Salomon: with whom I was present. I was present with him in strength, and mercy. Lo, this it is. This is it, wherewith all Miracles, and divine works and wonders were wrowght by Salomon: This is it, which I have revealed unto thee. This is it, which Philosophic dreameth of. This is it, which the Angels skarse know. This is it, and blessed be his Name: yea, his Name be blessed for ever."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A: Then he layd the Ring down uppon the Table: and sayd, Note. A: It shewed to be a Ring of Gold: with a seale graved in it: and had a rownd thing in the myddle of the seale and a thing like an V, throwgh the top of the circle: and an L, in the bottome: and a barr cleane throwgh it: And had these fowre letters in it, P E L E. After that, he threw the ring on the borde, or Table: and it semed to fall throwgh the Table and then he sayde, thus, Mi: So shall it do, at thy commanndement. Without this, thow shalt do nothing. Blessed be his name, that cumpasseth all things: Wonders are in him, and his Name is WONDERFULL: His Name worketh wonders from generation, to generation. 47 Figure 2: The Ring Solomon was, and remains, the archetypal magician, and his leg- endary exploits as a master of spirits fill the pages of traditional Jewish, Islamic, and Ethiopian religious literature. In many of the stories, his magical ring played an important role as the source of his power to control demons. I can imagine Dee and Kelley were very impressed to be given the Ring of Solomon by none other than the archangel Michael himself. Although the ring's design is unique, the word PELE (wonder worker) is found in two books which Dee already had in his library: / V Verbo Mirifico by German humanist and Hebrew scholar Johann Reuchlin and Cornelius Agrippa's Occult Philosophy, (Agrippa .ipp.ii ently took the term from Reuchlirii) Dee was told the Ring should be made of pure gold. If he indeed had one made, it has not survived the centuries. Realistically, few of us today have the skill to fashion or the resources to have a golden ring custom made. 48 Nevertheless, Michael seemed adamant, \"Without this, thow shalt do nothing.\" And so I've come to the conclusion if I'm to practice this particular art of magick, then before I do anything, I'm going to wear the Ring. Figure 3: Pattern for a paper Ring Here is the pattern for a Ring that can be made out of colored paper or poster board. I realize such material is not as impressive or romantic as pure gold. You might even think that a true magick Ring cannot be made from a scrap of paper. You might tell me you'd feel silly wearing a paper ring. If you feel this way, then I hope you won't be offended when I tell you that if you can't make a real magick Ring out of paper, then you'll not be able to make one out of gold. The same goes for the other magical items I am going to discuss in the next few chapters. Before I practice any aspect of Enochian magick, I recite two short prayers. The first is a prayer John Dee used regularly throughout the years of his magical workings: 49 Teach me (O creator of all things) to have correct knowledge and understanding, for your wisdom is all that I desire. Speak your word in my ear (O creator of all things) and set your wis- dom in my heart. The second is a prayer I fashioned from the words the archangel Michael spoke to Dee and Kelley during their March 14, 1582, action: He-hold (he Ring. I,o, this it is.

Blessed be his name, that encompasses all things: Wonders are in him, and his name is WONDERFUL: PELE. His Name works wonders from generation to generation. Amen. After reciting these prayers and putting on the Ring, I then position myself at the Holy Table and prepare to put on the Lamen. CHAPTER EIGHT The Lamen Beware of wavering. Blot out suspicion of us, for we are God's crea- tures that have reigned, do reign, and shall reign forever. All our Mysteries shall be known unto you. — THE ANGEL BRALGES, ONE OF THE ANGELIC PRINCES NAMED ON THE LAMEN, NOVEMBER L6, 1582, PRINCE BRALGES, NOVEMBER 16, 1582'' 0 The Lamen and the Holy Table are inextricably linked. By wearing the Lamen over the heart, the magician becomes linked to the Holy Table. I cannot say it any plainer than that. But putting on the Lamen and sit- ting at the Holy Table are empty gestures unless the magician has some idea of what these items represent and how they are connected. The designs for both the Lamen and the Holy Table were distilled from tables composed of letters of the names of planetary angels of the I Ieptarchia. Even though the chronology of their reception is a bit tan- gled, it is probably easiest to discuss the Lamen first. Traditionally a Lamen is a breastplate that is hung from the neck by .1 chain or ribbon. The breastplate of the high priest of Israel is the biblical archetype for this mosi importanl piece of magical adornment. Ii was si square pl.Hr, .1 5x4 grid embedded with twelve precious stom s repi'i sailing, mnongothei twelvalih concepts, the tribes oi Israel"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and the signs of the zodiac. The Lamen that the angels delivered to Dee and Kelley contained no precious stones but displayed eighty-four angelic letters arranged in a most curious and exacting manner. Two versions of the Lamen were received by Dee and Kelley. The first, delivered in 1582, was a rather odd assortment of lines, squiggles, and letters reminiscent of Solomonic or Goetic sigils. This Lamen, they were told, was to be made in gold and worn as a protective device. After receiving it, the magicians spent the rest of the year and part of 1583 receiving material relating to the forty-nine planetary good angels of the Heptarchia (see figure 5). The seven-letter names of these angels were received (much to Dee's cryptographic delight, I'm sure) by the complex manipulation and dis- tillation of letters from a cross-shaped table composed of seven 7x7 tables (343 squares in all, each containing a number and a letter). This process was dictated by the archangel Michael during a grueling three- hour session. Just to give you an idea of the shape and size of this table, I've included a rough image without the letters and numbers. Figure 4: Cross of 34) letters and numbers The magicians were then instructed how to organize and arrange these 343 letters to reveal the hierarchy of planetary good angels. Each of the seven planetary spheres was assigned a king, a prince, and five ministers.

Illustrations of flat wooden disks containing the names of the kings and other unexplained characters tantalize us with glimpses of an organized magical system. But the sad fact remains that important source material that could shed light on this has not survived the centuries. However, just as amber encapsulates and preserves the essence of a prehistoric insect (right down to the DNA), so too the Lamen and the Holy Table capture the distilled essence of the heptarchic hierarchy and system. After receiving the names, sigils, and hierarchical structures of the forty-nine good angels, the magicians were informed that the first Lamen they received during their actions the previous year was a false one, delivered to them by an \"illuding spirit.\" They were given instruc- tions how to create a new one, which was to be worn not for protection per se, but in order to \"dignify\" the magicians as worthy practitioners of this form of magick. I'm going to try to illustrate (as painlessly as possible) how both the I nnen and the Holy Table were created and why I believe their use in Enochian magick is important. Now, the reader might be tempted to skim over the following material, invoking my slogan, \"Don't try to duplicate the magick Dee and Kelley did to receive the system—just use ihe system they received.\" But I beg you to resist that temptation. By Inllowing through (even halfheartedly) the methods by which these magical tools were constructed, you will slip, however subtly, into the divine creative stream that produced them. You will become part of the same process that programmed and prepared Dee and Kelley. Hie key to the construction of the Lamen was a 12 x 7 table contain- Itlg die letters of the names (minus the initial b 51 ) of the seven planetary hsptarchic kings and their princes (see figure 6). Mimicking the cooling phases of Big Bang creation, this 12 x 7 lnble was condensed from the 343 lettered squares of the much larger . loss shaped lable (see figure 4)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"B ornogo $ B efafes© B utmomocf fllisdon2|.

The names in this table are read from right to left. You will immediately notice that the kings of one planet are not matched on the same line as the prince of the same planet (e.g., the sun O king, Bobogel, is set on the same line with the Venus 9 prince, Bornogo, instead of on the line of the sun O prince, Befafes). 52 This odd juxtaposition of planetary king and prince puts a certain strain on the sensitivities of those of us who like the order of our universe nice and symmetrical. However, this is the arrangement the angels insisted upon for the 12 x 7 table from which the Lamen was to be formed. As we will soon see in the following chapter, they will rectify the imbalance in the 12 x 7 table in order to create the Holy Table. But first let's continue to see how the Lamen is built. The basic form of the Lamen is a table of twenty-four squares (arranged from top to bottom: 2—4—6—6—4—2) enclosed within diamond square, enclosed by a square, enclosed by a larger square. Figure j: Blank Lamen form The letters of the 12x7 table were applied to the Lamen by means of an exercise that first divided the table into three sections, described as flesh, heart, and skin. The letters were then transferred to the blank Lamen in three steps. Step One: The letters of the flesh were added to the perimeter of the Lamen in their same relative positions to the 12 x 7 table.

CHAPTER NINE The Holy Table Every one of those sides must have 21 Characters: But first, at every corner make a great B. — THE ANGEL II, APRIL Z8, 158354 Magick tables were nothing new to Renaissance magicians. Unlike the protective circle and triangle spirit-trap apparatus used by Solomonic magicians, a properly consecrated magick table in a room transforms the entire chamber into holy ground. The table itself becomes the Holy of Holies, the place whereupon earth and heaven touch. Drawings of the period show the magician on his knees, his arms stretched in sup- plication, before a magick table sheltered by a conical tent. Dee was already using a table of practice before Edward Kelley entered the picture, but afterwards, as the elements of the heptarchic magick developed, it became clear that the communicating spirits wanted Dec to customize his table in a most specific manner. The angels wanted the Holy Table to be an \"instrument of conciliation,\" made of \"sweet wood,\" 55 and built two cubits square and two cubits high. 56 The table was to stand upon a carpet of red silk that was large enough id accommodate the scryer's chair. Once the Sigillum Dei Aemeth and the seven I'.nsigns ol (Irearion wore in position, the I lo!y Table was cov- cicil by 1 nil M11< cloth wiih gold tassels thai hung from the corners."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The scrying stone or black mirror was then placed upon the covered Sigillum. The public's first view of the Holy Table (sometimes referred to as the Table of Covenant or Table of Practice) was published in 1659 by Meric Casaubon in his A True & Faithful Relation . . . , 57 It was Casaubon's image that was reproduced in 1912 in Aleister Crowley's magazine The Equinox 58 and numerous books since then. It may come as a surprise to many (and be highly amusing to others) that Casaubon's impressively printed image of the Holy Table is perhaps the greatest flaw in his liberally flawed and ill-titled A True & Faithful Relation. One look at the description and drawing in Dee's Quinti Libri Mysteriorum: Appendix 59 reveals the eighty-four letters that form the border of the Holy Table and the twelve letters that fill the 3x4 center square of Casaubon's image are printed in backward order.

By wear- ing the Lamen, the magician is linked, or conciliated, to the Holy Table. The object that forms this magical link and serves as the com- mon denominator between the Holy Table and Lamen is the same 12 x 7 table that was used to construct the Lamen—the same table that bore the names of the seven planetary kings and the seven planetary princes of the heptarchic hierarchy. Did I say the same 12 x 7 table? That's not entirely accurate. Recall that when we were discussing the 12 x 7 table in the previ- ous chapter, something appeared out of whack. The names of the plan- etary kings did not share the same lines as their planetary counterpart prince (e.g., the sun O king, Bobogel, is set on the same line with the Venus 9 prince, Bornogo, instead of his sun O prince, Befafes). This planetary mismatch in the 12 x 7 table's construction did not appear to bother the angels, and indeed the \"flaw\" seemed to be a vital character- istic of the Lamen. As you can see in Figure 17, the version of the 12 x 7 table that is I he key to the Holy Table \"corrects\" this imbalance by rearranging the names of the planetary kings to match those of the princes of the same planet. Furthermore, the table is reversed, so that the kings now occupy the left side of the table and princes the right, and the direction in which the names are read is reversed to read from left to right.

As Hermes Trismegistus said, \"As above, so below.\" That's all fine and good, and I go about my magical business as if it were true. But honestly, even though I'm composed of the same mate- rial that makes up the sun and moon and stars and angels and archangels and the supreme Deity, even though I am striving for self- awareness and do my best to be a divinely creative individual, still I don't feel much like the macrocosmic Deity. Compared to the macro- cosm, my microcosm is way out of whack. My life is one of stress and imbalance. From where I stand, there is a very big break between Deity's above and Lon Milo DuQuette's below. I'm like the 12 x 7 table from which the Lamen is created: I've got all the condensed compo- nents of a perfectly tuned universe in me, but they are out of sync just enough to keep me from actually being the perfect reflection of the big \"way things are.\" I can really identify with the way the Lamen is constructed. Like it, my hierarchy of planets is mismatched and unbalanced. (Take one look at my astrological chart if you don't believe it!) Like the curious incon- sistencies that characterize how the individual letters are transferred from the 12 x 7 table to the Lamen, my individual components are a litany of curious inconsistencies. The 12 x 7 table that makes the Holy Table, on the other hand, sets this all straight. It is like the macrocosm showing the microcosm how it's done. As I sit before the Holy Table with the Lamen over my heart, I can almost feel the Holy Table's order and perfection pulling magnet- ically at my heart through the Lamen, connecting me by an almost tan- gible electric current to the Holy of Holies, pulling my heart and my attention toward the sacred spot in my living-room temple where heaven touches earth.

It is a pow- erful magical device, alive with the angelic forces of an ordered universe in which \"Seven, rest in Seven: and the Seven, live by Seven: The Seven, govern the Seven: And by Seven all Government is.\" Unlike the hierarchies of the Lamen and the Holy Table, the Sigillum's hierarchy of angels was not condensed, distilled, or otherwise generated from the seven 12 x 7 tables from which the names of the forty-nine good angels were drawn. Nevertheless, the Sigillum is the centerpiece of heptarchic magick and is the object through which all heptarchic energy (if we dare call it that) is focused. The Sigillum itself was a disk nine inches in diameter and approx- imately an inch and a half thick. It was made of pure beeswax and placed in the center of the Holy Table. The scrying crystal or black mir- ror was placed upon it. Four smaller wax versions were placed beneath small boxes, upon which stood the four legs of the Holy Table. Dee was first told to simply copy the design from a book he already had in his library. But Dee had at least two volumes 62 that contained designs for sigilla. He couldn't make up his mind which one to use, so he asked for further clarification. The angel then gave instructions how to construct an entirely new sigillum based on the format of the others but adding an array of heavenly personages: seven god names enclos- ing seven sets of angelic names. It is clear to me that the construction of the Sigillum was a vital step in Dee and Kelley's preparation program and that construction can serve that same important purpose to the modern magician as well. I'm going to walk you through the steps of how it is constructed, because I hope readers who are serious about actually doing magick, rather than merely studying it, will want to build their own. I've provided you with a blank sigillum (figure 21), and I encour- age you to make multiple photocopies of it. Enlarge it, if you wish, to nine inches in diameter. Then follow the step-by-step instructions. As you do, you will not only be building this magical device on paper, but you also will be installing it inside yourself. Constructing your own Sigillum Dei Aemeth is the fastest and easiest way I know to meet and connect with the angelit fort CI n sident in the design and make them part ol you. h m.iv i.il- • yO\\i IfVtril tries to )',<'i it all right, but I'm confident when you have completed your Sigillum you will think it worth the effort.

In this vision, forty angels stepped forth, one at a time, and parted their garments to reveal one of three things: 1. a number positioned above a letter, 2. a letter positioned above a number, or 3. a single letter. Some of the letters were capitalized, but most were lowercase. As they revealed their letters and numbers, each of the forty angels also uttered a different pious declaration in Latin, such as, \"O God, God, our God, blessed are you, now and forever\" or \"And you are true in your works.\" Then the angel disappeared or was consumed in flashes of fire or other such dramatics. The magicians were then left with a string of numbers and letters, which I've arranged in a table (see figure 22). -> 18 16 10 Figure iz: Outer perimeter bar code (the lowercase letter 1 is italicized so as to not be confused with uppercase I) Figure 23: Outer perimeter letters First make sure your blank Sigillum is oriented so that the penta- gram in the center is pointing toward the top of the page. Then refer to figure 23 and locate the topmost cell of the Sigillum's outer perimeter— the cell that contains the number 4 over the capital letter T. Fill in that cell with a 4 over a T. Then, referring to the table (figure 22) and moving clockwise, fill in the remaining thirty-nine cells of the outer perimeter of your blank Sigillum as you see them in figure 23. From the letters and numbers of the perimeter the seven god names and their sigils are drawn. The starting points for the god names are the cells that contain capital letters. These are also identified in figure 22 with asterisks beneath them. I'Vom those starting points, note the number inside the cell and < uiiiit your way to find the next letter in the god name. You count • lockwise when the number in the cell is positioned above the letter, ind you count counterclockwise when the letters positioned above the number. Keep counting until you reach a cell that contains a letter but no number. That will be the last letter of that particular god name.

When all the counting is done, we have spelled the god name Galaas. The archangel Michael would later advise Dee and Kelley to alter the spelling (an archangel's prerogative) to Galas. Michael assigned Galas a characteristic sigil and a number (see fig- ure 24). He also instructed that the sigil and number of Galas should be placed on the Sigillum, in the area between the perimeter of cells and the outer bar of the heptagon at approximately the eleven o'clock posi- tion (see figure 32).

I wish I could graphically illustrate this using the modern magick of animation, but you can demonstrate this for yourself. Let's turn to the first table in fig- ure 35 and use the name of the planetary archangel of Saturn, Zaphkiel, ,is our example. Start with the capital Z found in the first cell of the name ZllRHia, then move to the first cell of the name aZCaacb (to pick up the a), then mi ive to the first cell of the name paupnhr (to pick up the p), then move to the first cell of hdmhlal (to pick up the h), then move to the first cell ill Kkaaeee to pick up the K, then move to the first cell of eellMG (to pick up the e). Finally, move to the second cell of the ZllRHia bar of (lie heptagon and pick up the final / to spell Zaphkiel. I hope you can visualize what happens every time you move to unother bar of the heptagon to pick up a letter in the archangel's name. As you move, you are literally shifting the dimensional structure of the Sigillum up another level—in the case of Zaphkiel, eight levels in all (see figure 36).

Never since the beginning of the world was this secret delivered, nor this holy mystery set open, before the weaklings of this world. — THE ANGEL II, APRIL 29, 1583 The question I'm sure many of you are asking at this point is, \"Do I need all this stuff?\" During the classes that I conducted in our home in 2005 and 2006 (with experienced magicians) and subsequent day-long workshops I've conducted around the country with people having little or no prior magical experience) it has become abundantly clear to me that the mag- ical objects and \"furniture\" Dee and Kelley received during the Heptarchia periods (the Ring, the Holy Table, the Lamen, the Ensigns of Creation, and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth) can and should be formally employed in order to create the specific environment of consciousness conducive to the practice of angelic vision magick. Furthermore, it has been my observation that regular and repeated activation of this magical \"temple\" by means of the little ritual outlined in chapter one (and laid out more fully in appendix I) can attune the magician to this uniquely ordered universe and serve to progressively strengthen and enhance his or her vision.n y 1 apabilitil • Most exciting for me was the discovi rj thai once the magician is prepared and the temple activated thi m.l,. i.,,,, (especially the good angels resident in the Holy Table, Lamen, Ensigns of Creation, 11HI the planetary angels resident in the Sigillum) can be individually I ailed forth or visited by means of classic evocation techniques or even Informal extemporaneous prayers and conjurations. In other words, I believe that even if he or she never went on to practice Enochian mag- II k per se, a resourceful magician, willing to experiment, and armed with a proper understanding of the tools and formulae of the Heptarchic periods would be already prepared to engage in angelic vision magick of .1 high order. This is new territory for all of us, but it holds much promise, for it emails the possibility of contacting the same angelic forces that engaged I >ee and Kelley throughout most of their day-to-day actions. Obviously, dealing with these angelic forces offers an alluring challenge for today's more intrepid magicians who, when frustrated by gaps and perplexities in ihe original material, will not be afraid to go straight to the commu- 1111 iting angels for guidance and clarification on how all this should • •pirate. Indeed, I expect to see in the years to come exciting and viable magical systems develop as the result of the magical efforts of gifted practitioners who dare to make such angelic contact. But do you need all this stuff? My answer is this: In order to do this particular variety of magick Mm need all this stuff inside you. That's where the real magick takes place. But until such time as you have internalized all this (even in the most cursory and general manner) it is necessary to have some out- ward, visible, material representation of the magical concepts and l\"i res you are dealing with. I suggest, if you're serious about engaging in this magical art form, then you should, at the very least, provide yourself with a Ring, a Holy fable, a Lamen, a Sigillum Dei Aemeth, and the seven Ensigns of 1 1 cation. Make them out of paper if you have to. Copy them straight I >ni of this book if you have to. But have them. Make them real to you. 1 niisecrate them by using them. Use them to create your Enochian magick temple. The sense of art for some magicians is stimulated by replicating as much as humanly possible the tools and procedures as outlined in iin lent lexts. By doing so, they achieve a level of empowerment they believe is necessary to execute the work. Personally, my sense of art is quit! happy wiili papei rings anil photocopied I loly Tables.

Here is as good a place as any for me to pause and describe what I believe the source material suggests would transform a clean unclut- tered room into the holy ground of an Enochian magick temple. The Temple Upon the floor in the center of the room is a square carpet of red silk cloth large enough to accommodate the Holy Table and the chair of the scryer. Upon the silken carpet are placed four miniatures of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, made of wax. They are covered and protected from the table legs by shallow cylindrical boxes. Upon the box-covered sigilli rest the four legs of the Holy Table. The Holy Table is made of sweet wood (laurel). Upon the Holy Table, arranged as we've discussed, are the seven Ensigns of Creation (lettered in the angelic script) and the Sigillum Dei Aemeth, made of purified beeswax, nine inches in diameter and an inch and a half thick. The Holy Table and all the objects upon it are covered by a red silk cloth with gold tassels that dangle from the corners. This cloth should match in material and color that of the red silk carpet. Upon the covered Sigillum the scrying stone (a crystal ball) or black mirror is placed. The scryer's chair is placed on the carpet near the table. His or her feet should touch the carpet. The Ring and Lamen should be near. The magician should cere- monially put them on at the beginning of each session and remove them at the conclusion. Renaissance magicians often wore crowns and white linen robes, and on one occasion in preparation for a specific working, Dee and Kelley were instructed to wear white linen robes, in an operation that look place on July 13, 1584 (at the very end of the Enochian commu- ni. .uions), the archangel Gabriel told the magicians: See that your garments be clean. Herein be not rash: Nor over hasty; For those that are hasty and rash, and are loathsomely appareled, my knock long before they enter. 6f; In practical operations conducted by my Monday night class and my Knochian magick workshops, everyone is shoeless and wears com- fortable street clothes.

Covering most of 1582 and 1583, it is a period characterized by considerable tension between the two magicians, but one that also produced a large body of work in the form of a book referred to at various times as Liber Mysteriorum Sextus et Sanctus, the Book of Enoch, and Liber Loagaeth. , 68 While in recent years Enochian scholars have courageously set out to give us a closer examination of this information, it unfortunately has not been enough to allow modern practitioners to develop anything near a workable system from this material. One of the reasons more attention isn't paid to this period is the nature of the material itself and the nearly complete lack of direction concerning how it is to be applied. Also, the focus of the communica- tions of this period is driven by Dee's very personal fixation on discov- ering lost books of the Bible, the Apocrypha, and in particular the Hook of Enoch, which it mentioned In leveral placet In the Bible, The reiulting • luracter of Liber Loagaeth is rich in apocalyptic imagery and prophetic sounding rhetoric. This has been seized upon in recent years by commentators who would project a patently sectarian interpretation upon the material, even going so far as to suggest sinister (perhaps even Satanic or Lovecraftian) motives behind the \"angelic\" communications. We are all, of course, free to our own religious convictions and spir- 1111.11 worldviews. After all, they are part of the magical artist's pallet of tools. I think it wise, however, to keep in mind that when we study the I »cc and Kelley material, we are not only eavesdropping on questions II .lined in the minds of two sixteenth-century Englishmen and put in the • \"iiiext of biblical literature, but we are also hearing the answers to I In ise questions given in such a manner as these men could understand— thai is, framed within the same cultural and Biblical context. I'm sure II I >ec had been a Chinese alchemist or an African shaman in these 11 lie circumstances, the angels would have communicated the same universal answers unencumbered by the apocalyptic nomenclature liuniliar to the Jewish or Christian mind. Joseph Peterson wrote in the introduction of his marvelous book /\"/»// Dee's Five Books of Mystery: The importance of Liber Loagaeth cannot be overemphasized. From it would \"be restored the holy bokes, which haue per- ished euen from the beginning, and from the first that liued.\" The truths it contains will end religious disputes and restore religious unity. \"Which when it hath spread a while, THEN (X)MMETH THE END.\" 69 In short, it will usher in the new age. Since the book is so central to these angelic communica- tions, it is amazing that it has remained unpublished. 70 Amazing indeed, but as I wrote concerning De Heptarchia Mystica, 11 1 • only a matter of time before someone cracks the code of this l\" iihi.ikingly immense body of work.

Loagaeth literally means \"speech from God,\" and the magicians were informed that the words of the forty-nine calls were the same as those uttered by God at the dawn of creation—in the same language spoken by Adam when he named all things. Unfortunately, these calls were never translated (or else the material has been lost), and attempts by modern linguists have failed to find enough landmarks of a properly constructed language to put the calls of Loagaeth in the same category as the angelic language that would be received in the third and final phase of the magicians' actions. Kelley's visionary skills were severely exploited during this period, and his visions were characterized by the presence of a dazzling light that both magicians could see. The light would fly out of the scrying stone and penetrate Kelley's head, putting him in a trance in which he could read and comprehend the text of Liber Loagaeth. He was, how- ever, forbidden to translate it and told that God would later provide the translation. At the end of the session, the light would leave Kelley's head and return to the stone. When he returned to normal conscious- ness, he claimed to have no memory of the experience. As tempting as it might be, I am, for the time being not incorpo- rating any of the calls from Loagaeth in my Enochian-magick prepara- tion ritual. However, something else of great importance came out of this period: the angelic alphabet. CHAPTER FOURTEEN The Angelic Alphabet He wiped his finger on the top of the Table, and there came out above the Table certain Characters enclosed in no line: but standing by them selves, and points between them. He pointed orderly to them with his finger, and looked toward the skryer at every pointing. — EDWARD KELLEY DESCRIBING HIS VISION OF THE ANGEL'S REVELATION OF THE ANGELIC ALPHABET, MARCH z6, 15837 1 I 1 onfess, even with clear copies and transcriptions of the source mate- rial in front of me, it has been very difficult for me to wrap my mind \">iind the order of the visionary events of Dee and Kelley's years together. Because certain elements of these magical systems were often • 'i 1 ccted or amended by the angels in subsequent visions, often occur- 1 Ing months apart, it is extremely difficult (for me at least) to present a li in chronology of events. The circumstances surrounding the recep- 1 of the angelic alphabet are no exception. The alphabet was received during the Loagaeth period, but because the magicians were told to replace the Latin/English letters of the 1 linen, I loly Table, and the seven Ensigns of Creation with letters from 1 In angelic script, its influence reached back in time to touch the 1 1 I'l.n. hia period as well."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The twenty-one characters of the angelic alphabet appeared fully formed in yellowish letters that rose in Kelley's vision above the table. The images of the individual letters then obligingly hovered over a sheet of paper and stayed visible long enough for him to copy them in ink before fading away. Words in the angelic language are written from right to left, and that is the order the letters first appeared to Kelley. All twenty-one let- ters appeared in a single row and were separated by dots. There was also a dot preceding the first letter.

Pa, b in English, has a special sig- nificance in the magick of the Heptarchia. For example, the names of ell the forty-nine good angels begin with b, the letter b appears over- whelmingly on the Ensigns of Creation, and each of the four corners of the Holy Table displays an oversized Pa. This abundance of bs has caused several knowledgeable modern magical commentators to speculate that b must represent the number l Mil, the number upon which these magical systems seem to be based. While that makes a great deal of sense to me, I have nonetheless found Mmliing in the original material that would specifically suggest numer- Ical equivalents to any of the single letters of the angelic alphabet. What is very clear, however, is the fact that the communicating ingel wanted Dee and Kelley to immediately memorize the letters of the ingelic alphabet and the letters' names. Dee was a busy man and Wanted to be excused from this time-consuming duty. The angel Me Would have none of it. In this March 26, 1583, exchange, Dee tries to in ike the angel understand, \"Look man, I've got a life!\" Me: I instructed thee before-hand and told thee, that both of you must jointly learn those holy letters (For, so, I may boldly call them) in memory: with their names: to the intent, that the finger may point to the head, and the head to the understand- ing of his charge.

Throughout their actions, they simply referred to it as angelic. We cannot, however, be faulted too badly for attaching the bib- lical patriarch's name to the system. The magicians were told that this was the magick given by God to Enoch (the seventh man from Adam) in the form of a book and that Enoch (before he ascended bodily into the presence of God) passed it on to others. Over the generations, the book fell into wicked hands, and God caused it to be lost. But because of Dee's piety and prayers, God was moved to once again deliver it to mankind.

So were the communicating angels, who warned that such behavior attracted evil spirits into the magician's > m IIOIIment—an annoying and time-consuming distraction.

As applied most commonly today, Enochian magick is a two-part magical system: one part focusing on the elemental universe, the other on the aethyric. The former enables the magician to summon or visit in vision the spirits of the myriad levels of the elemental worlds of Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Spirit; the latter enables the magician to system- atically penetrate increasingly higher heavens (or Aethyrs) to access information from those heavenly levels of consciousness. I will soon show how these two systems are operated. But before I do that, and in keeping with our program of systematic attunement, I need to introduce you to another magick table. It was the first revela- tion of the Enochian period, but it is also, in my opinion, the final com- ponent of the preparation protocol. This tablet was delivered to the magicians by the angel Nalvage in April of 1584. It is an item that was acknowledged by the adepts of the Golden Dawn but never incorpo- rated into any practice. It is something, however, I believe should not escape our attention. No name was given to this object. Some modern scholars designate it simply the Tablet of God. I shall refer to it as the Round Tablet of Nalvage. CHAPTER SIXTEEN The Round Tablet of Nalvage The order and knitting together of the parts in their due and perfect pro- portion, God the Holy Ghost.

This, I believe, is especially true concerning the practice of Enochian vision magick. In all my years of magical practice and exploration of this system, I have never encountered a single case of so-called psychic attack, demon possession, headache, hives, or hernia—indeed any ill effects whatsoever—resulting from the practice of this particular kind of magick. That being said, strange and unexpected things do occasionally happen to those who practice magick. And while I believe it is bad for one's mental health to ascribe undue importance to these phenomena, it is important that they be dispassionately observed and recorded. So, before I discuss the Round Tablet of Nalvage and its importance to the system of Enochian magick, I feel I must share with you two little sto- ries that might help you understand the level of respect I hold for this particular magical object. Twenty years ago, I was teaching a class in Enochian vision magick at our home in Costa Mesa. This class was different from the Enochian magick classes I had taught previously, for it was the first time we would study and experiment with using the Round Tablet of Nalvage. In preparation for the first class, I decided to make a copy of the tablet out of wax (as I had done with my Sigillum Dei Aemeth). A friend had given me two massive, black wax candles shaped like giant chessmen (bishops). My plan was to melt these down in a round Christmas cookie tin and carve the squares and the angelic letters of the Tablet of Nalvage on the cooled wax disk. It was a foolish time to be starting an arts project like this, because our landlord had just informed us he was bulldozing our house in two weeks and building apartments on our lot (thanks a lot!), and we were deep in the midst of packing up our things to move. Still, magick is magick, and life goes on. I put the two black wax bishops in the cookie tin and slid them into the oven. I set the heat on the lowest possible warm level and went out to the garage to help (watch) Constance pack. As you might imagine, we had some very interesting things in our garage, many of which we hadn't looked ,il in years. Wc did more rein iniscing than packing. I didn'i forget il\" bind wiix bishops in the oven, however, and checked on them regularly. It seemed they were taking a long time to melt, so I turned up the heat a little higher. Back out in the garage we found a stash of psychedelic artwork « I instance had painted and drawn in the late sixties, when we were hip- pics living in the woods of southern Oregon. We hadn't seen them in hi teen years. What a treat! We lingered over them for probably ten intcs before I remembered the black wax bishops for the Round I ablet of Nalvage in the oven. When I opened the back door, I found the kitchen dark except for .1 warm orange glow that, like a spectacular sunset, brightened the dark louds of smoke that filled the house from the ceiling to about four feet in nil the floor. The oven was completely engulfed in flames. I ran into the living room and found our son, Jean-Paul, lying on the floor watch- 'iii' television completely oblivious to the black smoke pressing its way toward him from above. Once he and the dog were evacuated, I called for Constance | 11 ways a level head in times of emergency), and we proceeded to attack thi lire. When I opened the flaming oven, I discovered that one of the I ilnhops had slid to the side of the cookie tin and parts of it had melted down the outside rim. The wax had run to the bottom of the oven and dripped down upon the pilot light, which then become the eternal flame \"I (losta Mesa. There was nothing we could do to turn off the oven. stance eventually had to turn off the gas outside, and with the help \"l baking soda and wet towels, we got the fire out. I rescued the cookie \"'I iml let it cool in the sink. A couple hours later, in the charred ruins of i iur kitchen, I carved a beautiful black wax Round Tablet of Nalvage. Now, I'm the first to confess that this story has less to do with magick ind superstition and more with my own carelessness and stupidity. (I \"ii now forbidden to use the oven for magical crafts.) The accident did, lii'wcver, serve to give me a healthy respect for the Round Tablet of ilvage—a respect that in the last year has increased immeasurably. \\inl iliat brings me to my second magical tale of Nalvage. As we'll soon see, there is much we know about the Round Tablet nl Nalvage. What we don't know is how it was intended to be used. As i i. preparing for the class series that inspired this book, I debated nil myself how (or even if) 1 was going to introduce it into our studies. Mi' i all, there is nothing in the source material thai hints at what is to"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"be done with it. Late in the afternoon, I prepared our living room tem- ple for the evening's class. The Sigillum and ensigns were set neatly on the Holy Table; the table was covered with its red silk cloth, and the obsidian mirror was set in place. I went to the closet cupboard in my office and took down my black wax Round Tablet of Nalvage from the topmost shelf. I unzipped its plastic bubble-wrapped envelope and carefully removed it. I had to admit, after all those years, it still looked magnificently magical. I took it into the living room and set it down upon the covered table. I sat down in my comfy chair, and in the warm glow of sunset (which brought to my mind the glow of our blazing kitchen so many years ear- lier), I meditated about how the Round Tablet of Nalvage fits into the system. I didn't get much meditating done, because the moment I closed my eyes I fell asleep. I awoke just a few minutes before people would start arriving for class. I still didn't know how or if I was going to the use the tablet for the night's gathering. I hastily decided that if I didn't have sound reasons for using the tablet, I was going to skip it altogether—at least for that night. I took the tablet off the Holy Table, wrapped it back up, and carefully put it back on the top shelf of the closet cup- board. I went to my desk to turn off the computer and gather things for class, when I was startled by the sound of something smashing against my guitar, which was mounted upright in its stand near the open closet door. With the guitar strings still ringing, I turned to see that the Tablet of Nalvage had flown from its shelf, ricocheted off my guitar, and was resting inches from my feet. As a reasonably rational man, I am of the opinion that there is nothing supernatural in the world, just natural things that have yet to be explained. I'm sure there is nothing I can say to convince the cynic that the tablet hadn't fallen naturally from the shelf because I hadn't put it there properly. I remain, however, extremely impressed at the dis- tance this object had to travel across physical space in order to strike the guitar and find its way to my feet at the very moment I had decided not to discuss it at that evening's class. Needless to say, T changed my mind about (lie importance of the tablet, and in the few moments rem.unmj', belorc < lass members started 11 > arrive, I composed the two-part chorus that incorporates the dynam- ll 1created by the letters of the Round Tablet of Nalvage—a chant that has become the last (and perhaps the most important) component of i In Ceremony of Preparation. 75 Now, let's take a brief look at those dynamics and how a chant I used on the Round Tablet of Nalvage can be constructed. The Tablet of Nalvage is not really round. It is a square divided Into four squares (or continents) and surrounded by four outer bars (see figure 59). The continents and bars are subdivided into lettered squares (nine squares per continent and four squares per bar). But before we (.in filling in the letters, let's see what the angel Nalvage had to say rtbout the continents. 1 2 3 4 Figure 59: The four continents of the Round Tablet of Nalvage Nalvage told Dee and Kelley that continents 1 and 2 are \"dignified,\" I ule 3 \"is not yet dignified, but to be dignified,\" and 4 is \"without glory 11 dignity.\" Nalvage described them in Latin as follows: I. Vita suprema (highest life), the continent of \"joy\"; 1. Vita (life), the continent of \"potentiality\"; t. Vita non dignificata, sed dignificanda (life not dignified, but which shall be dignified), the continent of \"creation\"; and 4. Vita est etiam haec, sed quae perperit mors (\"Even this is life, I.in life win. h will be paid with death\"), the continent of \"discord.\" Each continent contains nine letters that, when read in various yield words in the angelk Ian/mane. In order to more easily see IIti 1 words, I have separated (he tablet into its component parts (see '.iM , .. 1"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"h i d a o m z b n d a i a 1 c i. i r a 7. b a r s g u f s r n Tj a i o d r r o s e a d i g -> |c| 111 Figure 6o: Separated Round Tablet of Nalvage When read counterclockwise, the outer bars of the tablet spell the names of four classes of angels: luab (praising angels), lang (minister- ing angels), sack (confirming angels), and urcb (confounding angels). These angels circumscribe and contain the angelic forces at work within the continents. Nalvage gave the following Latin meanings to the words inside the continents when the words are read horizontally from left to right (see figure 61). idz - Gaudium - Joy aoi - Praesentia - Presence mzr - Laudantes - Praising bna - Potestas - Power daz - Motus - Motion iab - Ministrantes - Ministering sai - Actio - Action god- Factum - Events urr - Confirmantes - Establishing fos - Luctos - Lamentation sea - Discordia - Discord rcli - Confundantes - Confusing Figure 6i: Words and meanings of the words of the four continents ll a n>fe Figure 6z: Key to the Round Tablet of Nalvage Figure 62 shows how the letters of the continents are read to reveal the nature of the divine powers resident in the tablet. First notice how the three letters of outer corners of each of the four continents (upper left corner of upper left continent, lower left cor- nei of lower left continent, and so on) all spell the Enochian word •Waning God— iad. Notice next that the three diagonal letters of continents spell the •i.ls moz (joy), bob (power), sor (action), and ser (lamentation). finally, the three letters of the inner corners of the continents spell {hi words zir (I am), zna (motion), gru (deed), and osf (discord). The arrows in figure 62 show the beautiful symmetry the words Pi He within the tablet. If we put the words of each continent together, irrive at phrases such as: (lontinent 1. iad moz zir (I am the Joy of God.) 1 !(intinent 2. iad bab zna (God's Power in Motion) 1 ' '-\"t 3. iad sor gru (Result of God's Action) \"\" ( '»t 4. iad ser osf (God's Discord and Lamentation) I In. ii, h tapestry of joy, movement, creation, and sorrow is con- ' \"\" l \"\" iiclccl by a counterclockwise whirl of the angels: luab, I' \"a'. •'• b, iii,l an Ii."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Concerning the tablet as a whole, Nalvage said,\"The Substance is attributed to God the Father.\" 76 In reference to the letters on the outer bars, Nalvage said, \"The first circular mover, the circumference, God the Son, The finger of the Father, and mover of all things.\" 77 Referring to the continents and the manner in which their letters are read, he said, \"The order and knitting together of the parts in their due and perfect proportion, God the Holy Ghost. Lo the beginning and end of all things.\" 78 Like the Holy Table, the Round Tablet of Nalvage, once decoded, displays divine and angelic words and names in perpetual motion in such a way that one can almost sense what is meant by the term choir of angels. In group workings, I break the participants up into two voices as we ceremonially chant the words from the tablet. Voice One: luah lang sach urch Voice Two: iad moz zir — iad bab zna — iad sor gru — iad ser osf The effect is powerful even when I'm alone in the middle of the night and chant one voice at a time. Once Nalvage described the dynamics of the tablet, he didn't go on to provide instructions on how, or even if, the tablet was to be used. Is it a talisman? Is it to be worn as the Lamen? Is it to be held or placed on the Holy Table? We don't know. However, we do know that after the two magicians had become attuned to the structure of the Round Tablet of Nalvage, the entire remaining system of Enochian magick was revealed in less than ninety days. This has led more than a few magicians to speculate that the Round Tablet of Nalvage might be the key to a mysterious and unex- pressed \"first call\" of the Enochian system, or perhaps even represent the call itself. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Forty-eight Calls Move, therefore, and show yourselves: open the Mysteries of your Creation: Be friendly unto me: for I am the servant of the same your God, the true worshipper of the Highest. — FROM THE FIRST CALL 79 I lie centerpiece of the Enochian system is a collection of calls 80 in an lllgelic tongue that is significantly different from the language delivered in / iher Loagaeth. The reception of the calls followed that of the Tablet MI Nalvage. They were first dictated to the magicians in the angelic |nii|{ue, then afterwards translated into English. Careful examination of 11\" i alls and their translations reveal that Enochian is a real language HI.I not simply strings of barbarous names and words. The calls read .1 i .vocative hymns or invocations. They are constructed of real, \"i. limes breathtakingly beautiful sentences that can be translated icly transliterated). The language exhibits a remarkable consistency • •i word meaning from call to call. It has a form of grammar and syntax. II,, phenomenon, coupled with the multiple double-blind/letter-by-letter ...

Beginning on April 10, 1584, the first four calls were painstakingly delivered, letter-by-letter (in backward order, because the angels at first voiced fears that the calls were so powerful it might be too dangerous to deliver them in a straightforward manner). As usual, the letters were drawn from an assortment of lettered grids. The angels also provided translations to the first four calls immediately after their delivery. Then things changed. It appears that even the angels became impa- tient with this tedious method. They proceeded to deliver calls five through eighteen in a straightforward manner, but they would wait six weeks before delivering the English translations. The fact that the translated words from the first four calls (deliv- ered backwards) matched (or were otherwise linguistically compatible with) the translated words of calls five through eighteen (delivered for- ward and translated six weeks later) all but rules out the possibility that either Dee or Kelley invented the angelic language or the calls. The nineteenth call (the Call of the Ayres or Aethyrs) and the names of the thirty Aethyrs (or heavens) were received on July 13, 1584, Dee's fifty-seventh birthday, effectively ending Dee and Kelley's angelic magick relationship. However, before that final communica- tion, the angels would deliver an incredible amount of material to the two magicians between April 10 and July 13—material that three hun- dred years later would inspire the adepts of the Golden Dawn to develop the hybrid system we now call Enochian magick. I call it hybrid because the \"Enochian\" magick developed by the Golden Dawn and Crowley is based on a number of assumptions that connect the forty- eight calls with other \"Enochian\" material Dee and Kelley received after the reception of the calls. I refer to what are now commonly called the Elemental Tablets, which I will discuss in detail in chapter twenty- three and beyond. While eminently logical and based on the most anal- retentive hermetic principles, many of the assumptions made by the Golden Dawn and Crowley were nonetheless not clearly made in the original Dee material. First, however, we need to look at the circumstances that triggered the final and most astounding chapter in the story of the reception of l nochian magick. It all started with Dee wanting to spy on the king of Poland and ended with the reception of what appears to be nothing less ili.m the printed circuit board of the mind of God."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN The Ninety-one Parts of the Earth Dee: Hey Nalvage, I'd sure like to magically eavesdrop on secret meet- ings between King Stephen of Poland and bis ministers.

You need to understand how everything in heaven and earth is connected to everything in heaven and earth. 81 —IMAGINARY CONVERSATION, JOHN DEE AND THE ANGEL NALVAGB The fantasy dialogue above is more than just another one of my lame attempts to be witty.

To the thirty Aires he assigned ninety-one parts of the earth (see column II), which he first referred to by the geographical name rec- ognizable to the sixteenth-century magicians, such as Syria (see second name in column III), then by the name by which it is known in the divine realms, such as Pascomb (see second name in column IV). He then assigned each of these pairs of names to one of the twelve mythical tribes of Israel, along with their directional coordinates, an angelic king, and a respectable number of good ministers. All this information and more can be found in figure 63. Columns I through V contain the information Dee and Kelley received at this stage of the reception. The symmetrical characters found in column VI and the names of the good princes of the Air in column VII were deliv- • red to Dee and Kelley at a later date than the information in columns I t h rough V.

The following is from Dee's diary: 85 There appeared to him [Kelley] four very fair Castles, standing in the four parts of the world: out of which he heard the sound of a Trumpet. Then it seemed out of every Castle a cloath to be thrown on the ground, of more than the breadth of a Table- cloath . . . 86 . . . Out of every Gate then issued one Trumpeter, whose Trumpets were of strange form, wreathed, and growing bigger and bigger toward the end. After the Trumpeter followed three Ensign Bearers. After them six ancient men, with white beards and staves in their hands. Then followed a comely man, with very much Apparel on his back, his Robe having a long train. After him came five men, carrying up of his train. Then followed one great Crosse, and about that four lesser Crosses. These Crosses had on them, each of them ten, like men, their faces distinctly appearing on the four parts of the Crosse, all over. After them, an infinite number seemed to issue, and to spread themselves orderly in a compasse, almost before the four fore- said Castles. The highlights of Kelley's vision would eventually be memorialized upon a round talisman etched in gold, which is today on display at the British Museum. Much as I'd like to believe this object was fashioned by Dee himself, it is almost certainly a forgery patterned upon the I hi wed image printed in Casaubon's A True & Faithful Relation. For reference, however, I will continue to refer to both the vision and the image as the Golden Talisman. The four castles, or Watchtowers, formed a cross, the center of which was a circle supported by twenty-four columns.

Eventually he would go into far greater detail by projecting and organizing all of it upon what he called the Great Table or the Great Table of the Watchtowers. The Great Table is the Rosetta stone of Enochian magick. How it was received and how it is connected to the information Dee and Kelley had already received concerning the ninety-one parts of the earth present us with perhaps the most convincing proof that the two magicians were indeed in contact with noncorporeal intelligences of a superior order. CHAPTER. TWENTY The Unlettered Great Table and the Four Great Seals The seals and authorities of these Houses are confirmed in the begin- ning of the World. Unto everyone of them be 4 characters, (tokens of the presence of the son of God: by whom all things were made in Creation.) — THE ANGEL AVE, JUNE 20, 1584*7 In 1 working that took place on Wednesday, June 25, 1584, the angel ^> • showed the magicians the image of a table that was divided into lint 1 sections by a central cross. Each of the four sections was identified I one of the castles of the Golden Talisman vision. Also called lift liiowers, Watchmen, princes, and mighty angels of the Lord, they Wrre each represented by a seal. Three of these seals, by their imagery, l>pnr 11 direct and unambiguous connection to the Sigillum Dei Aemeth HI l lie* Ensigns of Creation.

We first saw this cross on the (lower right) corner of the first sevenfold table (see figure 33), which generated the letters of the large outer heptagon of the Sigillum, where the cross appears at the top left (see figure 34). The third seal was assigned to the lower right section of the Great Table. Its origin was a little harder to track down. Ave said, \"It is in that table, which consisteth of 4 and 8.\" One of the seven Ensigns of Creation that ring the Sigillum on the Holy Table (the one many mod- ern magicians associate with Mercury) is a 4 x 8 table (see figure 54). The square occupying the position of the second column, second row, contains the cross, numbers, and letters exactly as appears on the vision of the third seal. The forth seal was assigned to the lower left section of the table and was the image of \"a little round smoke, as big as a pin's head.\" It is illustrated in one of the drawings of the Great Table in Sloane 3191 as a tiny circle with twelve rays issuing from it. It is perhaps the stylized representation of the figure that appears on the back of the Sigillum Dei Aemeth: a small circle from which projects the four capital Ts of a cross potent formed from twelve right angles (see figure 51). Perhaps it is con- nected to the Round Table of Nalvage and the twelve words that occupy its four continents. Frankly I've been unable to find any reference in the original material that would suggest either of these connections. tm T 41b 6 Figure 6y.

On April 18, 1587 (nearly three years after the magicians had, for all intents and purposes, discontinued their angelic workings), Kelley would receive a vision that would alter (or reform) several aspects of the Great liible, including the relative positions of the seals and all they represent. As one might expect, this reformation remains the source of intense frustration to Enochian students and practitioners. To add to all the • <\"illusion, Dee at different times assigned different directional attrib- utes to the quarters of the table. Later, the Golden Dawn, in order to develop a workable system from this material, would attribute the inniers of the Great Table to the elements of Air, Water, Earth, and l Ire, Eventually, I will do that as well, but for the moment, let's be sat- I lied with identifying the four quarters of the Great Table by their seals incl original numbers as shown in figure 65, while we move on to the • ndcrs of what next took place."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE The Great Table There was a terrible storm of thunder and rain, toward the end of our yesterdays action: which I said, was somewhat more than natural. —JOHN DEE, JUNE 2.6, 1584 8 8 I feel I must here briefly outline (if only for my own benefit) the sequen- tial landmarks of the Enochian magick period up to this point: • The reception of the Round Tablet of Nalvage, • The beginning of the reception of the forty-eight calls in the angelic language, • The reception of the order and earthly name of each of the ninety-one parts of the earth, together with: - its divinely given name, - the tribe of Israel to which it is assigned, 89 - the direction assigned to that tribe, - the name of its ruling angelic king, - the number of good ministers. (All of the above information is itemized in columns I through IV of the figure 63 in chapter eighteen.) Then came: • The vision of the Golden M 1 ith hit lour sets of castles: - one trumpeter, - three ensign bearers, - six seniors (\"six ancient men\"), - the king and his five princes (the \"comely man, with very much Apparel\" and the \"five men, carrying up of his train\"), - five crosses in the air (\"one great Crosse\" and \"four lesser Crosses\"), - sixteen dispositors (\"16 white Creatures\"). • The vision of the unlettered Great Table and the four Great Seals. What happened next was so remarkable that I hope I can recount what happened clearly enough for you to appreciate how remarkable it was. During the working of Monday, June 25,1584, Kelley was given in vision four blank grids, each of which was twelve squares wide by thir- teen squares high. These grids were said to represent the four quarters nl 1 he unlettered Great Table of the vision of a few days earlier. As the Vision proceeded, \"little pricks,\" or dots, began to appear in the squares, v el Icy was then instructed to connect the dots in groups of seven, vhich created sigils, each forming a curious pattern. 1 A * 7 T^7 figure 66: Example of a symmetrical character on a grid When he was through connecting the dots, all but eight of the 624 |ii,ires (hat make up the four grids were covered by eighty-eight char- >' is, end que m form, each covering seven squares, but none of In. h intruded upon another < hara< ler's squares.

They are called symmetrical characters because each one is formed from the same number of pricks—in this case, seven. Once the blank grids were filled with the lines of the symmetrical characters, Kelley was instructed to fill in the squares with letters. Starting at the top left of each grid and moving to the right, letters began to appear to Kelley, one by one, as Dee copied them down. Some of the letters were capitalized, but most were not. A few of the capital- ized letters appeared to be written backwards. When all four grids were filled in with letters and characters, it became clear that the characters spelled out names. Not only that, but each of these eighty-eight names also began with a capital letter and contained no other capital letter among the remaining six. This phenomenon is in itself impressive, but it is nothing compared to what Dee and Kelley would learn next. Within a few hours (and with a few helpful hints from the angels), the two magicians discovered, to their utter amazement, that the symmetrical characters spelled all but three of the divine names of the ninety-one parts of the earth—names they had been given days earlier and in list format. Figure 67 shows an example of how the divine name of the second part of the earth, Pascomb, is spelled out by its symmetric character.

Enochian scholar and magician David R. Jones, M.I, Mn gtudent of Enochian can compare the lists of names with 1 In- sigils, which formulate their existence on the Watchtowers, HI,I easily see the correlation. But realize (hat the names were delivered first and then the Watchtowers horizontally line by line m,l ih, 1 having both figures at hand. The Angels demonstrated"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"that, by discrete (7 letters, the number of letters in each Governor's name) linear connections, all of the letters given in the Watchtowers could be accounted for from the letters that formulate names of the Governors previously given. This would require either a monumental and complex second and third order memorization (2 dimensions to 1 dimension then back to 2 dimensions and with directional correlation from a 3 dimensional origin to a 3 dimensional conclusion) on Kelly's part or an elaborate and extremely obtuse deception on Dee's part. This constitutes one of the chief proofs of the system. 90 The magicians would eventually be informed that the ninety-one divine names of the parts of the earth are also the names of ninety-one governors who inhabit the thirty Aethyrs, or Aires, or heavens that sur- round the Watchtowers like a heavenly glass onion. We've yet to dis- cuss the Aethyrs because their names (see figure 63, column VII) were among the last bits of information Dee and Kelley received in their Enochian magick workings. The lowest of these Aethyrs, Tex, is inhabited by four governors. The remaining Aethyrs including the highest, Lil, each have three governors. I will talk more about the Aethyrs in chapter twenty-five. Here it is important for us to simply understand that linking the ninety-one parts of the earth to the thirty Aethyrs was the Enochian way of identifying and linking all levels of divine consciousness from bottom to top. Thus, the dynamics of the Great Table really are a demonstration of how everything in heaven and earth is indeed connected to everything else in heaven and earth.

How all this is con- nected to the vision of the Golden Talisman and the practice of modern in, ichian magick will be the subjects of the next chapters. Before moving OH, liowever, and in order to more easily illustrate the structure of the 1 nn, I need to temporarily tighten up some of the loose ends that the Irn gularities in the original material often leave dangling in the eyes of •I\" .indent. The most serious of these concerns the lettering of the (tiral Table and the various names of angels drawn therefrom. Here's thi 1'ioblem: Alter they initially received the Great Table, the magicians were 1 I'r.cd to change or add certain letters in some of the squares.

This difference has proven very frustrating to modern Enochian magicians, who naturally would like to be confident in their ability to accurately identify and spell the name of the angel with whom ; they wish to communicate. There are other loose-end inconsistencies that plagued Dee and Kelley, one of which was the uncertainty over which compass directions were to be assigned to the four quarters of the Great Table—a problem that Dee appears never to have resolved to his satisfaction, and one that I have chosen to sidestep completely by not using the directional refer- ences to identify the four quarters of the Great Table at all. These incon- sistencies, however, pale before what happened in April of 1587, nearly three years after Dee and Kelley had ended their Enochian workings. For some reason Kelley felt compelled to revisit the mysteries of the Great Table and once and for all settle the questions of unresolved inconsistencies. During a conversation with the archangel Raphael that lasted approximately one hour, he claimed to receive the Tabula Recensa, or \"Reformed Table.\" This table, while correcting a few of the letters, was characterized by one very dramatic change: three of the quadrants housing the four Watchtowers were shifted to different posi- tions within the full table. This alteration did not change any symmet- rical characters, nor did it tinker all that much with the names of thfl governors or other angels within the table. What it did do was changM the basic construction of the Great Table. Figure 69 shows the new positioning of the reformed table, (The letters with an asterisk indicate backwards letters.) For the duration of this book I will, for the sake of consistency, 11 \\ to use the Tabula Recensa as my main model for both the lettering and arrangement of the Watchtowers of the Great Table. I say \"try to use because for nearly the entire Enochian period the angels referenced thi original Great Table (figure 68) when explaining the angelic hierarchi«| and spelling the names of individual angels. It will be necessary froffl time to time to refer to the original, unreformed Great Table, espet iallj when we start discussing the Kerubs (see chapters twenty-three n„l twenty-four), whose names might be dramatically affected by thl reformed table's new arrangement. * r c T s / i 0 t o A N 0 S m I l« a 0 r i M A o d r a ^ r z 0 i m f N I 6. a c 6 0 o N < r s z O c r P o X X 71 d 0 i 8 0^ 0 a i a 0 a i t a n 8 p o (' r [71 6 a ( P X [ ? n T a n i b i m c n a i Z, a r m n n d n i n 0 a i a a s t s d ./ / a z 0 a b A f ( 0 o m ( 6 a x\\ a n i r i c z\\ a P 0 r v T 0 T a r R 0 n i £ C a f> m ( i c V A / r 0 m T 6 i p 0 t $ a 0 P 0 n i z ( i i a n s a y \\p 0 p r d a X \" a n 0 P a P s 0 3 r i h a !>' m i i s t a Y a i i 0 $ I C P t m T 6 0 m i ( a C s t S a z t 71 L a c z A z a 0 u r r z n [7 B a e e M P a V 0 n r P s a c n 0 0 a R d 8 a m 6 a m\\ b C b i < d i a T i X n a n S ( V ( f G: a. 0 P m n i r_ m J t i a 6 X i z p a P m e X a r P f> c 0 m a a m 0 C 6 P r a X e i a T n P S m M \\o P n i X n d 0 o a s V 7 P s d d o a a 0 6 a a P a t a d i r a 0 I P P c a i s i a i 0 r\\8 0 i 8 0 t a A c c d A 1 (, a m a L a d i n n 0 a ( m r P u 0 !

Up to this point in the chronology of the adventures of Dee and Kelley, each of the four Watchtowers of the Great Table (both the original and reformed) have been identified by the one of the four Great Seals (see figure 65) or by certain landmark letters. At different times in the original material they have been identi- fied by the order they were received or by the directions: east, south, west, or north. Nowhere in the surviving documents have I been able to find the four quadrants of the Great Table overtly identified as the Elemental Tablets of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. That being said, certain clear references in the continuing commu- nications revealed elemental hierarchies and rulerships both of and within the individual Watchtowers. Building on this information, the adepts of the Golden Dawn projected an eminently logical elemental structure to the Great Table, its central Black Cross, and its individual subdivisions. These elemental attributions are the heart and soul of the system of Enochian magick taught and practiced by the Golden Dawn, Aleister Crowley, and most modern practitioners. I personally believe that when these more modern adepts treated the Watchtowers as expressions of the elements they were picking up where Dee and Kelley had stopped and were taking the next logical step in the development of the system. To more easily discuss how all this is going to relate to the practical application of the system, I will now and for the remainder of this book, refer to the four Watchtowers by their modern elemental designations. Please refer to figure 69. This is how they are identified in most modern Enochian literature. There is a fifth Elemental Tablet—the Tablet of Union—that is attrib- uted to the quintessential element, Spirit. It is much smaller, containing only twenty squares, and its letters are drawn from those on the central Black Cross of the Great Table, which serves to unite the four Watchtowers in precisely the same way Spirit is said to unite and sepa- ii i e the four elements.

The king was followed by five men (who held up his train) and five crosses (one great cross sin rounded by four lesser crosses) that floated in the air above them. Each of the four lesser crosses \"had on them, each of them ten, like men, their faces distinctly appearing on the four parts of the Crosse, all over.\" 9 ' 1 After the crosses came sixteen white creatures, identified as dispol itors on the Golden Talisman, and then \"an infinite number seemed to issue, almost before the four foresaid Castles.\" 95 These images and characters provide, at least partially, the key i<> the divine hierarchy of the Great Table.

Just as the sun is the central \"king\" of our solar system, so too is the sun senior identified as king and found in the center of each Elemental Tablet. The King Like the sun, which attracts and holds the planets in orbit, the king of each Elemental Tablet is said to summon and direct the seniors for heavenly duties. When those duties are of a merciful nature, the king spells his name a bit differently than when the duties are those of severity and judgment. Like those of the six seniors, the seven letters of the king's name are drawn entirely from the Great Central Cross (the lines of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) of the Elemental Tablet. Beginning with the fifth letter from the left in the horizontal line of the Holy Ghost, the name is spelled out in a clockwise whirl that ends in one of the two squares that occupies the center of the cross: either at the sixth letter from the left for operations of mercy (figure 75) or the seventh letter from the left for operations of judgment (figure 76). In the case of the Elemental Tablet of Fire, the letters that hold those positions are both as, so both names are Edlprna. d 0 0 a V 0 P 8 d d 0 i f 0 l P 0 0 a i s • a !

This theory does, however, leave out in the cold the four letters tbove the arm of each Calvary cross. To address this issue we must l>i Ing up the several schools of thought concerning Kerubs. Kcrubic Angels In < Ihristian iconography, every well-appointed crucifix bears a rectan- gular piece of wood nailed above the head of Christ and displaying the foil I letters INRI. 97 So too above the arms of the Calvary cross of every ubangle we find four letters that spell the name of the Kerub of the sub- angle, .1 unique spiritual personage. The Golden Dawn dubbed these ingi Is Kerubs. 98 Now, il you are paying attention, you might want to point out that there an only loin subangles and only font < nlvnry crosses (one in 1"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"each Elemental Tablet), and therefore there should only be four Kerub/dispositors, not sixteen, per tablet. Of course, your observation would be accurate—if we restrict ourselves to spelling their names in a straightforward and orderly manner. But according to this theory, there are actually four Kerubs hidden in the four letters above the arms of every Calvary cross, and these sixteen Kerubs are actually the sixteen dispositors. Let's use the Fire (lower right) subangle of the Fire Elemental Tablet and the Kerub ZiZa as our example. 21 n !

In our example, the first Z in the Kerub's name rules the column directly beneath it and the arm of the cross: asp A. The Z also rules the bottom row of the subangle: ACar. Figure 81 shows how the other letters in the Kerub's name rule die servient angels of the subangle. v la s h • r d i : C / j II •\" r ;• • I a H )' r X i: B ;-\\ p A 1 ; d ! s c r •£. • '•: :, : i r ffi; 1 .; a : •\": ,:;. :] E •;•,, n :; s :• M : :\"' : : i •\"'. z. : 0 n r 1. i r s i £ J ;:i f,; IS : :'> : j 1\" d, : : ''...•:• i ' <•• \" 1 •y ' 7 ! c V ,-: e r i i Figure 8i: How the letters of the Kerub rule the servient angels of the Fire subangle: The first Z rules column name aspA and row name ACar.

According to this theory, in order to open a subangle to summon MI contact a servient angel, the magician must first invoke the two god names of the Calvary cross of the subangle in question, then invoke the Kerub, then invoke the servient angel of choice. This is a logical and workable system, but one that doesn't appear to have been on Dee and Kelley's menu. In fact, original material suggests that the Kerub is a Unique citizen of the subangle, one who is not under the rulership of the 1 11 vary cross, but under a \"god\" whose name begins with a sacred letter drawn from the Black Cross (the Great Central Cross) of the Great Table. A Super Kerub? Neither Dee or Kelley nor the modern magicians of the Golden Dawn ivn use the term Super Kerub. There is, however, a variety of kerubic angel who seems to embody thai lirle. Like the variety of kerubs we've just discussed, the names of ill' Super Kerubs are drawn from the letters above the arms of the ' ilvary crosses of the subangles of the Great Tablet. But, instead of in vvering to the two Calvary cross god names of their subangle, the \"i\" i Kerubs answer to a higher authority—a supercharged angel who i linked directly to the Black Cross of the unreformed Great Tablet.

Transmutatio formalis, sed non effentialis. 101 If we look at the four quarters of the Great Table as being the Elemental Tablets of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, the Black Cross that separates and joins the tablets would then obviously represent Spirit— that quintessential force that binds the four elements together in infinite quantities and ratios to create and sustain the universe, while at the same time keeping the elements separated just enough to retain their identities. This push/pull, active/passive nature is a defining character- istic of Spirit. As I mentioned earlier, this characteristic is illustrated (as every good ceremonial magician knows) by the dynamics of the penta- gram, which allow for two types of Spirit pentagram, one active and one passive. The Black Cross contains forty letters that radiate from the central blank square. When we read from the top of the column toward the center, we find the curiously spaced and inconsistently capitalized let- ters e xarp and b Coma. When we start at the center square of the Black Cross and read to the right, we find the letters nanTa and bitom. We can find identical sets of letters if we read from the bottom i>l the column toward the center and from the center of the row to the left. In other words, the Black Cross contains mirror images of the lei in groups e xarp, h Coma, nanTa, and bitom —a phenomenon curiously reflective of the dual nature of Spirit. During the same June 25 session, Ave would (in remarkably lew words) explain the letters on the Black (!r0SS, answer questions concerninf the three missing symmetrical charftCtCM \"I the tenth Aire (Lcxarph, Comanan, and Tabitom the twenty eighth, twenty ninth, .uul thirtieth parts of the earth; see chapter eighteen, figure 63), and demonstrate how those three names construct a master table, the Tablet of Union, which appears to rule the whole Great Table. But before discussing all that, we have a small bit of unfinished business to clean up from the last chapter. I am, of course, talking about i he Super Kerubs and the wicked angels. Super Kerubs, or Gods of the Kerubs? 11 is my opinion, and I'm sure many will disagree, that there are two hierarchies of angels existing simultaneously in each subangle. The first hierarchy simply begins with the two god names of the Calvary cross, who are invoked before calling upon the four servient angels whose names appear beneath the arm of the cross. In this schema, all the names of the angels in the hierarchy are drawn neatly and exclusively liom within the subangle itself. The Kerub plays no role at all. The second hierarchy, I believe, does not use the two god names of i In- Calvary cross at all, nor does it necessarily concern itself with the II i vient angels. Instead, it places a new character, a Super Kerub, or I i mbic god, above a group of angels whose names are drawn exclu- llvcly from the four letters above the arms of the cross. figure 82 is a version of the original, unreformed Great Table that I've highlighted to, hopefully, make this all clear. I realize it may sound II nzy for us to bounce back to using the unreformed table when locat- iu|', these angels, but it is the unreformed table the angels used in 1584 hi ii this information was received. For the moment, please ignore the Mi< led backwards letters on the diagram. I he letters of the Black Cross are the key to creating the kerubic lids Note how four of the letters in the column are isolated from oth- i that appear neatly in groups of four. Reading from the top toward 'l\" i enter, the e of e xarp and the h of h Coma are isolated. Reading (fl)lll the bottom toward the center, the p oiexarp and the a oihCom a |fi ilso isolated. Note that these four isolated letters appear in the dime rows as the Kerubs who live above the arms of the Calvary i•! .ill sixteen subangles.

For example, the Kerub of the Fire subangle of the Fire tablet, ZiZa, would be trans formed into the Super Kerub, pZiZa (see figure 80). Instead of ruling the servient angels, this Super Kerub pZiZa directly rules four angell whose names are created by the permutation of the Kerub's own namei ZiZa, iZaZ, ZaZi, and aZiZ. A table containing all the kerubic godl and their Kerubs can be found in appendix IV. The important thing to remember is that in this system there arl two hierarchies of angels in each of the sixteen subangles: one hierai chy that simply uses the god name of the Calvary cross to summon oi contact the serviant angels living under the arms of the cross, and on( hierarchy that selects a letter from the Black Cross (outside t iit- Elemental Tablet) and adds it to the Kerub's name to create a kembii god who rules four Kerubs whose names are created by the |ienmilii tion of the regular Kerub's own n.imr. When to use one hierarchy and not the other in a magical opera- tion remains a subject of debate among modern magicians. One thing is certain, the more the magician understands about the nature and dynamics of the Great Table, the more he or she will be able to devise .1 logical and workable mode. So let's discover more wonders of the Black Cross. Let's start with something we haven't encountered before 111 Hnochian magick—wicked angels. Wicked Angels I he letters of the Black Cross are also the key to creating the names of the four wicked, or evil or malevolent, angels of each subangle. Up to now we've been dealing with angels whose names are representative of 1 uniplete and balanced segments of the Great Table and its Elemental [\"ablets. But during the June 25 session, as the angel Ave was expound- ni)', on the virtues of the Black Cross, he also introduced Dee and Kelley 1 n ,1 set of angels that are not complete and balanced—angels he referred i\" as being \"wicked.\" These malevolent angels manifest aversely the I 'i iwers of their good-angel subangle neighbors. For example, if the good dngels are useful for healing, the wicked angels bring sickness and ilIlu tion (see appendix IV). But some of the wicked angel duties seem rather tempting and are ml to be useful in obtaining money and for gambling. Kelley initially •01 pretty excited about such prospects and was very disappointed • 113 n Ave in no uncertain terms told him hands off the evil angels. Why Ave would give details of these critters and turn around and tell the II Igicians not to use them remains a mystery. Or does it? The name of an evil angel is a portrait of incompleteness and il>.il.nice supercharged with an injection of the immense power of the It k Cross—a dangerous recipe if there ever was one. Creating it is jPirj simple. Here's how to do it. Remember how we created the name of a kerubic god by prefacing tin name of a regular Kerub with the letter from the Black Cross occu- lt in)', the same row? Well, that's almost exactly what we do to create the Hit I il wicked angel. I lowevcr, instead of prefacing the four letters nl 1 I- (-mil's 11. -, we preface only the first two letters of the servient III i, I'I"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"angel's name with its neighboring letter from the Black Cross.

Who are their hierarchical rulers? As one might expect, the adverse god names that call forth the evil angels are the names on the Calvary crosj spelled backwards. In the case of our example they are iOpgna and xanNu. You can easily work out the names of the other evil angels and their rulers by referring to figure 82 or consulting the table in appendix IV. I Paraoan Ave was particularly concerned that Dee and Kelley locate the nam' Paraoan on the Great Table. The significance of this great angel has nol (at least to my satisfaction) been adequately explored or explained. The name Paraoan first appeared among the ninety-one parts of the earth as one of the three divine names (number 65) in the twenty-second Aire. Paraoan is the divine name of the part of the earth designated aj Marmarica. According to Enochian scholar Robin Cousins, in Dee and Kelley's day, Marmarica was a North African coastal region straddling the Egyptian and Libyan coasts, bounded on the east by the River Nile (see appendix III). Oddly enough, a perfectly good sixty-fifth symmetrical character already existed. It is found in the lower right section of the Elemental Tablet of Water, and spells the name Laxdizi. Nevertheless, Paraoan seems to also hold the title of the sixty-fifth part of the earth known as Marmarica. The obvious and inescapable ••miilarity between the names Marmarica and America inserts (into my mind at least) an added dimension of mystery to this curious anomaly. Add to this the enigmatic and direful comments Ave made concerning i lu- final n in Paraoan: As far as that N. stretcheth in the Character, so far shall that Countrey be consumed with fire, and swallowed into Hell, as Sodom was for wickednesse. The end of all things is even at hand: and the earth must be purified, and delivered to another. 102 A bit later, Dee presses Ave on this: Dee: I beseech you say somewhat of the N in Paraoan, of which you said, so far as that stretched, should sink to hell. Ave: Every letter in Paraoan, is a living fire: but all of one qual- ity and of one Creation. But unto N is delivered a viol of Destruction, according to that part that he is of Paraoan the Governour. 103 The letters of the name Paraoan are created from seven of the eight I' I. kward letters that appear scattered among the four Elemental Tablets \"I the Great Table. See the circled letters in figure 82. The eighth back- M nds letter, the backward L found in the lowermost square on the right \"I figure 82, has another very important job to do. I lie Three Missing Symmetrical Characters \"t live Tenth Aire i ill from (he table in chapter eighteen (figure 63) that there were no \\ iiiineiiie.il characters for the three pans of the earth assigned to the I> Am- (those whose divine names were l.cxarph, Comanan, and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Tabitom). Neither can these three names be found within the available letters in any of the four Elemental Tablets. They are, however, to be found on the Black Cross, and the angel Ave, in his highly productive lecture of June 25, 1584, shows how it is done. Ave instructed Dee and Kelley to pluck the backward capital L from the lower right corner of the lower right Watchtower (I've circled it in figure 82) and preface the lowercase letters e, x, a, r, p, and b from the column of the Black Cross to form dual versions of the divine name Lexarph. Then starting with the capital letter C in the column, moving down from the top C (or up from the bottom C), then continuing to read either right or left into the horizontal row, dual versions of the divine name Comanan are formed. Then, starting with the capital letter T in the left and right arms of the Black Cross and reading toward the extremities, we discover dual versions of the divine name Tabitom. Lexarph, Comanan, and Tabitom are respectively the divine names of the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth parts of the earth in the tenth Aire, whose symmetrical characters were missing from the original material concerning the ninety-one parts of the earth. Their characters are simply the straight lines and rotating Ls that spell on I their names on the Black Cross. Obviously, angelic beings whose names are drawn from the Black Cross are of a nature that sets them apart from their neighbors in tin- Elemental Tablets. Their presence in the tenth Aire also distinguishes that portion of the ninety-one parts of the earth for special attention— something that will be important to us later. The Four Names of the Tablet of Union Lexarph, Comanan, and Tabitom also contain within themselves thl four names that appear in pairs on the Black Cross, names that arc vei v familiar to practicing Enochian magicians: EXARP, HCOM.\\, NANTA, and BITOM. These are the four divine names of the elementi that (in the practice of modern Enochian magick at least) rule the foul Elemental Tablets. N M These four names are arranged into a table five squares wide by four squares high. This Tablet of Union, in its profound simplicity, BXtracts the essence and hierarchical dynamics of the entire Great Me. The Tablet of Union is quite literally the Great Table distilled.

And so enter into the knowledge and perfect understanding of the 49 Gates and Tables if you will. — THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL, MONDAY, JULY 9, i5 84 I0 4 In early July of 1584, the two magicians were busy trying to tie up loost ends before a mysterious August deadline. On July 7, the angel Ave waxed eloquent about how Enoch made tablets such as those Dec and Kelley now possessed, and had labored fifty days in prayer and confes- sion before receiving a supreme revelation. It appears from the com- munication 105 that the two magicians were to do likewise. In a breathtakingly short amount of time, Dee and Kelley received the translations of the remaining angelic calls (five through eighteen 1. which they had six weeks earlier received in the angelic tongue, together with tantalizing hints that the eighteen calls might be con nected to the Tablet of Union and the four Elemental Tablets. On Thursday, July 12, the angel Ilemese 106 began to deliver a nun teenthcall, together with its translation. This call was said to be actuall) thirty calls, bringing the total number of calls to forty eight. Add rhi unexpressed \"first\" call (see chapter sixteen), and we have .1 grand total of forty-nine (7x7) calls. The next day, Friday the thirteenth, 1584, John Dee's fifty-seventh birthday, Ilemese delivered the remaining por- tion of the nineteenth call and revealed that it was the key to accessing the thirty Aires (the heavens connected to the ninety-one parts of the earth). Lastly, he revealed the names of the thirty Aires, which until then had only been identified by numbers (see chapter nineteen, figure 63, columns I and VI). The nineteenth call was a master call to be used to access each of the thirty Aires or Aethyrs.

Enochian vision magick as practiced today can be divided into two broad categories: elemental and aethyric. Both require the ability to scry and to keep a faithful written record of one's workings. Scrying the Aethyrs has, in my later years, become the focus of most of my Enoc- hian operations, because that process deals most directly with the current state of my personal initiatory career—by that I mean my pel sonal transformational process, my spiritual journey, the lifting of my consciousness. However, it has not always been so. Indeed, I would never encoui age any magician, especially in the early stages of his or her Enochian career, to neglect either branch of Enochian exploration. I spent many years honing my visionary skills by exploring the elemental worlds thai not only make up my physical, mental, and emotional environment but also actually represent everything that my limited senses tell me is me It is the elemental branch of Enochian vision magick that I will I HI discuss. To help me do this, I'm going to talk briefly about the structure of another great magical tool, the tarot. Rulership of the Tablet of Union The classic tarot image of the Magician shows the magician stand behind a table, upon which are four magical tools; a wand, a cup sword, and a disk. These are the four elemental weapons of the nif cian. They represent respectively the four suits of the tarot and the < ments Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. The master card of each suit is the ace. The ace is the \"Spirit\" the suit—the \"Spirit\" of the element. The other cards in the suit given life by the spirit of the ace. They are essentially subdivision., (| ponents, and aspects of the ace—they all \"live\" inside the ace. If we put an ace under a magick microscope, we would lirst sec t it is composed of four major components. 10 '' These are the I < i cards (commonly titled king, quern, pi mcc, and princess) thai reprei respectively the element!

In the Enochian model, we can actually see Spirit's influence inter- penetrating the heart and every quadrant of the Elemental Tablet in the foi m of the Great Central Cross and the Calvary crosses of the suban- I The Black Cross of the Great Table reveals Spirit's influence on an • vii larger scale. It literally holds together and separates the four I Icmental Tablets. The Black Cross is like the ace of aces. All this is repressed most simply and elegantly in the Tablet of Union.

The left- most column is made from the four first letters of the names, giving us the name EHNB. At the top of this column is a little circle with spokes inside. This is the symbol of Spirit. It tells us that EHNB is the column of Spirit and the essence of the entire tablet. Obviously, the angelic entity described by the letters EHNB is pro- foundly powerful. It is a name that represents and contains within itsell the entire Great Table and all the angelic forces within it. E represents the entire the Elemental Tablet of Air, H the Elemental Tablet of Water, N the Elemental Tablet of Earth, and B the Elemental Tablet of Fire. In a real sense, the remaining sixteen letters all live inside EHNB in just the same way the sixteen court cards of the tarot live inside their aces. Put E under a microscope and see the letters XARP. Put H under a microscope and see COMA. Put N under a microscope and see ANTA, Put B under a microscope and see ITOM. As we move right, the next column is XCAI, whose letters repre- sent the four Air subangles of the four Elemental Tablets and all the res ident angels inside the Air subangles. (XCAI would be the four prim i of the tarot.) AONT does the same for the Water subangles (queens of the tarot)) RMTO for the Earth subangles (princesses of the tarot), and PAAM for the Fire subangles (kings of the tarot).

How can I know myself when the mysteries of the elements of my own heart and soul remain undiscovered? Enochian elemental magick is not a matter of calling up a spirit to command it to do a job for you, to cause the girl next door to fall in love with you, to bewitch your neighbor's cow, or to kill an enemy at a distance. Instead, when you visit an Enochian elemental angel in vision, you are exploring a specific aspect of creation, a highly specialized area of which the angel is the visual and metaphoric embodiment. You see things the way they are in that narrow quadrant of the universe. Once .imied with the insights these spiritual specialists can provide, you are better prepared to know how to go about causing the girl next door to l.i 11 in love with you or bewitching your neighbor's cow. (I understand that killing at a distance is less satisfying than one might imagine.) Does this really help the magician? First and most obviously, it l>ii mdens his or her understanding of how the spirit world is the subjec- nM' and underlying reality of the objective world. Just as the educated intl seasoned traveler is better equipped than the novice to understand Pi wards and pitfalls of world travel, a magician experienced with ele- MHiiial work is endowed with a greater understanding of existence. 111.11 in and of itself is a spiritual reward. liut more than that, each willed encounter with the angels of the elements activates, readjusts, and rebalances the magician's own inter- n,iI elemental components.

Other questions could concern things more specific to one's own personal magical issues, but I think you get the picture. Now that we know a little more about why to practice Enochian elemental magick, let's look at how to do it. It is likely that my opinion on this subject will be slightly at odds with a number of practicing Enochian magicians. It is even more certain to receive condemnation by legions of others who don't actually perform Enochian magick but instead enjoy speculating how Enochian magicians should operate.

For , years they were an indispensable part of my operating procedure ai well. I discontinued, however, about ten years ago. As we myopically focus on the fascinating intricacies of differ cm magical systems, we often forget the big picture and the fact thai wi have only one universe to play with. There is no such thing as a sepa- rate qabalistic magick universe, or a separate Solomonic magick uni- verse, or a separate Enochian magick universe. These various system* simply oblige us to view the same universe from different angleii Granted, when we look from differing points of view, we see certain similarities. After all, it's the same universe. There are certain to be reel ognizable landmarks. But we can't expect the structure of one system point of view to neatly match or define the Other. It is my opinion that the spiritual forces inherent in Enochian mag- ick are expressed units of living consciousness that reflect a uniquely Structured and organized point of view of the universe—one that the I ommunicating angels obliged Dee and Kelley to build from scratch. It II a perfect, self-referential system of looking at things that cannot be expected to be consistently compatible with other self-referential systems. With all due respect to the knowledgeable and eloquent magicians who created the above temple opening, I believe that (unless your sen- litivities as a magical artist demands it) most of it is completely unnec- I isary in order for you to properly activate an Elemental Tablet and effectively address the hierarchy of angels who rule the angel you may Wish to contact. The use of the various pentagrams and the hexagram, i IK assumption of a Samo-Thracian elemental god-form, the invocation Dl I he various names of the Hebrew deity and traditional angels, and till recitation of Bible verses are all tried-and-true magical methods to li > ess the elemental world of Earth, but they are tools used in another I I lid of magical system—a system that views the magical universe from i slightly different angle, music played using a different scale of notes. Please don't misunderstand me. Qabalistic temple openings such as tin one above work effectively enough for Enochian elemental opera- s. But what makes them work, in my opinion, is not the penta- i mis, Hebrew god names, or Bible verses. They work because, nestled ii Inn the ramblings and tossing about of salt and water, the magician |l ri quired to recognize and address by name the spiritual forces of the I' mm is as they are uniquely organized and expressed in the Enochian in ' it k system. In our example above, those names are Nanta (the great I of Earth from the Tablet of Union), Mor, Dial, Hctga (the Three (in 11 Secret Names of God from the Elemental Tablet of Earth), and i hi ha (the king of the Elemental Tablet of Earth). The hierarchy of lil|i,h elemental forces that the other magical system calls Adonai ha .

I will outline my address to the hierarchies at the end of this chapter. But first, let's dis- cuss what the proper procedure for an elemental working might be. DuQuette's Protocol for Enochian Elemental Vision Magick The lower the angel you wish to contact is in the hierarchy of the Elemental Tablet, the more superior angels there are above it who must be named and addressed. Therefore, for our example I will use Adre, a lowly servient angel found under the arms of the Calvary cross of the Fire Subangle of the Elemental Tablet of Fire. (See chapter twenty-three, figures 71 through 79.) I. Preliminaries Before embarking on any formal magical operation it is helpful, indeed necessary, to feel good about oneself. Therefore, I always recommend that the magician first bathe, dress in clean clothing, and operate in 9 clean and uncluttered space. It is also wise to formally purify and ban- ish the area before operating. These preliminary ceremonies can be CIH simple or as elaborate as you feel necessary. I always begin with a sun pie Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram that Eve customized to reflect my own taste and spiritual proclivity. A classic version if the pen tagram ritual can be found at the beginning of appendix I. I next perform the Ceremony of Preparation that is outlined Ifl chapter one and appendix I of this book. I consider this ritual nil Enochian magick temple opening par excellence. I believe it serve. !•• purify, banish, and consecrate both the temple and the magician in & manner that is in harmony with the universe as perceived by till Enochian angels. It also establishes and sanctifies the magical env ment for the black mirror or scrying stone. II. The Call(s) A complete list of the angels of all four Elemental Tablets, together with llicir traditional duties, can be found in appendix IV. In order to contact any angel from an Elemental Tablet, one need first activate the tablet by intoning the proper call or calls in the Enochian tongue. The calls and the key to their use can be found in .ippcndix II. Only one call is necessary if your target angel resides in the Great < entral Cross (one of the Three Great Secret Names of God, a senior, \"i .i king). Also, only one call is necessary if your target angel resides in die native subangle of the Elemental Tablet (e.g., the Fire Subangle \"I i he Fire Tablet, the Water Subangle of the Water Tablet, etc.). But if your target angel resides in a non-native subangle (e.g., the Earth Subangle nl die Water Tablet, the Air Subangle of the Fire Tablet, etc.), you must 11\" recite an additional call assigned specifically to the subangle. Our target angel, Adre, resides in the native subangle (Fire nl'.ingle of the Fire Tablet), so we need only recite the sixth call (see ippendix II). Reciting the sixth call switches on the power of the Elemental i i Wet of Fire, as it were, and puts it in standby mode to await more i fie actions from the magician. Ill Addressing the Hierarchy • I\" ther you feel it or not, 112 your recitation of the sixth call has put \"ii in an altered state of consciousness.

In the case of a servient angel like Adre, the hierarchy is essentially the whole cast of characters. Starting from the top we have: 1. The Supreme Name of Fire from the Tablet of Union: Bitotn. 2. The Three Great Secret Names of God of the Elemental Tablet of Fire: Oip, Teaa, Pdoce. 3. The name of the king of the Elemental Tablet of Fire: Edlprna. 4. The names of the six planetary seniors of the Elemental Tablet of Fire: Aaetpio, Adoeoet, Alndvod, Aapdoce, Arinna, and Anodoin. 5. The first god name of the Fire subangle: Rzionr. 6. The second god name of the Fire subangle: Nrzfm. 7. And finally, the name of our target servient angel: Adre. If the target angel is higher on the hierarchical ladder, there are fewer names to include in your little speech. For example, to call t senior, you only need to use the names in steps 1, 2, and 3 before call- ing on the name of the target senior. If your target angel is the king oi the Elemental Tablet, you only have to use the names in steps 1 and 2.''' And what about the kerubic angels who, as we learned earlier, haVI a separate hierarchy that skips the god names of the subangle? In the case of the Fire subangle of the Elemental Tablet of Fire, si in ply replace the name in step 5 with the name of the god Kerub (Pzizd) and replace the name in step 6 with the name of the Kerub (ZiZa, i7,a\\ ZaZi, or aZiZ). IV. Calling Your Target Angel Repeat out loud the name of the target angel, Adre, several times. Stall why you have called it; ask your questions and/or make your requi si then sit quietly and scry. If necessary, repeat the call to induce a dcvpi i state of mind. If you wish, have a tape recorder running and des< ribl your vision as it unfolds. Don't tire yourself.

As we saw in chapter twenty-five, this concept appeared to confuse and irritate Dee, who seemed com- fortable with merely identifying the Aires by their sequence number. Even though there is very little in the surviving material to suggest the thirty Aires are anything other than containers for the parts of the Earth, many modern magicians believe they carry a more profound significance. Indeed, it appears to me that this is an excellent example of modern magicians picking up the football where Dee and Kelley dropped it and running with it for a very big touchdown. The basic idea is this. In keeping with the most fundamental hermetic and qabalistic axiom, \"As above, so below,\" the microcosmic world (the physical ui verse and humanity) is the reflection of a heavenly macrocosmic world of divine consciousness. So too, the thirty Aires containing the ninety- one parts of the earth are the microcosmic reflection of thirty Aethyrs, or heavens, that surround and enclose the four Watchtowers of th Great Table in thirty heavenly spheres, like layers of a glass onion. Like the ten sephiroth and the twenty-two paths on the Tree <>l Life, the thirty Aethyrs can be viewed as emanations of divine c< sciousness. The thirtieth or lowest Aethyr would represent a level n divine consciousness that is so low that it has almost descended into matter. The first or highest Aethyr would represent the pure and undil ferentiated mind of Deity. Using this model, the ninety-one parts of the earth (column IV (> figure 63) have their counterparts in the Aethyrs, and the divine naini of the parts of the earth (e.g., Pascomb for Syria) also serve as thl names of angelic governors, who, in groups of three, inhabit the thirl| Aethyrs. The only exception to this is the thirtieth Aethyr, Tex, whii I has four governors. There is a great temptation among modern practitioners to pi i iji this thirty-Aethyr model upon classic schema of the qabalistic Trfll Life with its ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths that also represent els of consciousness. Some magicians go so far as to suggest the ill Aethyrs can simply be divided by three into ten units and superimpi upon the ten sephiroth of the Tree. I wish I could believe things as simple as that, hut, as I wrote in the previous chapter, the I I qabalistic and Enochian models oblige us to view the same universe from different angles. Aleister Crowley gave perhaps the most comprehensible way of viewing the relationship of the thirty Aethyrs and the Tree of Life: It is to be remarked that the last three sethyrs have ten angels attributed to them, and they therefore represent the ten Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, a Malkuth-pendant to the next three, and so on, each set being, as it were, absorbed in the higher. The last set consists, therefore, of the first three asthyrs with the remaining twenty-seven as their Malkuth. 117 The angels Crowley is referring to are the governors of the Aethyrs. Because Tex contains four governors instead of three, Crowley consid- ered the last three Aethyrs (Tex, Rii, and Bag) as a set containing ten governors who could be projected on a Tree of Life (see figure 86). 28™ Aethyr - BAG 29™ Aethyr \" RII 30™Aethyr \" TEX I igure H6i The first (lowest) set <>/ governors (of the thirtieth, twenty- ninth, ami twenty eighth \\,-thyrs) /no/n t,;l on ,i .//;,;/,• I'm- of I iff I I I V II II .-iii ,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"He then posited that this entire Tree of Life becomes the Malkuth (the tenth and lowest sephirah) of a higher Tree of Life made up of the nine governors of the next three Aethyrs (Zaa, Des, and Vti), which, in turn, become the Malkuth of the next three Aethyrs, and so on all the way to the top. 1\" Aethyr - LIL 2™ Aethyr \" AKN 3™ Aethyr \" ZOM Remaining 27 Aethyrs and their governors Figure 8y: The last (highest) set of governors (of the first, second, and third Aethyrs) with the remaining twenty-seven Aethyrs and their governors encapsulated in a master Malkuth You may or may not resonate with Crowley's view on this subject. Still, it is not unreasonable to compare the thirty Aethyrs to the sephi roth of the Tree of Life, especially when we understand both of them 111 be levels of personal initiation. This is precisely how Aleister Crowley viewed them. His systematic scrying of the Aethyrs as he walked across tin North African Sahara in 1909 are chronicled in his visionary masterworki The Vision & the Voice, a text I believe should be studied by anyone interested in Enochian aethyric vision work. While I certainly am not yet ready to compare my aethyric adven- tures with those of Crowley's, I have on multiple occasions engaged in a systematic exploration of the Aethyrs. I have, on a number of occa- sions, scryed each Aethyr, starting with number thirty, Tex, and worked my way to number one, Lil. Even my Monday night magick class is obliged to now and again undergo thirty weeks of scrying the Aethyrs. Am I suggesting that we all actually achieve the sublime levels of consciousness represented by the higher Aethyrs? Of course I am not. Kut most of us receive provocative and highly personal visions, espe- cially in the lower Aethyrs. That is because the lower Aethyrs represent levels of consciousness that we visit all the time in the natural course of daily life—in dreams, reveries, ecstasies, even deliriums. Even as I write these words, I am probably dipping into the lower Aethyrs as my mem- ory and imagination conjure images that help me crystallize ideas I can I >i11 into words on the page. (I probably spent my entire senior year of high school staring into space and cruising in the lower Aethyrs!) As the magician moves upwards through the Aethyrs, he or she progressively breaks into higher and higher levels of consciousness. If We .ire prepared for this new territory, our visions are characterized by i i ertain spontaneity and lucidity. However, when we begin to get out \"I our depth—when we haven't yet achieved the level of consciousness ssary to take the next step—our visions become murky and forced, II 11 we were watching it through a glass darkly. When this happens, I hi vision is usually characterized by a clear message announcing in no mi. ertain terms that we have not completely penetrated the Aethyr. Kut that is not a bad thing. In fact, it is exactly what we want to II ippen, because we then know where we are on the initiatory ladder. Moreover, we have a chance of knowing what it is we need to do (or, more accurately, we will know who we need to become) to take the next li p HI our initiatory career. Allow me to illustrate with a hypothetical imple. Lei's say you've resolved to systematically scry all thirty Aethyrs, pel night, from thirty to one, over a one-month period.

Enochian magick as developed by the Golden Dawn and widely prfl ticed today uses the first eighteen calls to activate the Elemental Tablet and contact the resident angels. However, in the hectic last days oi ih Enochian period, Dee was instructed in several places to write his owl invocations. It remains unclear to me whether or not the angels wri suggesting that additional \"homemade\" invocations were to be creati as appendages to the calls. What is clear to me, after more than .1 qua ter century of practical application, is the fact that the calls by thtfl selves (with only the briefest of additional verbiage to awaken tarl angels and their hierarchy) serve admirably as the only invocationi magician needs. Naturally, if it appeals to your magical sense of art to compol additional invocations to utter before and/or after the call, I cn< oui I you to do so. Pronunciation You will probably be very surprised at how little time I spend on this subject. In fact, I am very tempted to simply paraphrase Rabbi Ben Clifford's heretical comment about the Hebrew language and tell you bluntly, \"There is no such thing as correct Enochian pronunciation!\" On a few occasions, the communicating angels gave Dee and Kelley suggestions as to how certain words are pronounced. But, by and large, we modern magicians are left to our own devices as to how to push these awkwardly constructed words out of our mouths. Dee notated the words of the calls in columns. The left column con- tained the Enochian word in all uppercase letters— PIRIPSOL, for example. The right column contained the word in upper- and lowercase letters, which split the word into syllables and characterized certain let- ters as if to suggest pronunciation: Pe rip sol. Sometimes the translation of the word appeared in a center column: \"of the heavens.\" The Golden Dawn and Crowley use a pronunciation method that (hey felt rolled more fluidly off the tongue. This method obliged the magician to insert a natural Hebrew vowel sound after every Enochian I < 1 nsonant. For example, the word butmon (meaning \"mouth\") would be pronounced, \"but-a-mon-u.\" This is wonderful for words such as l liis one, giving it an almost Italian lilt. But things get a little crazy when in comes to the letter z, which the English currently pronounce as \"zed\" and in Dee and Kelley's day was pronounced \"zod.\" The angels did on occasion instruct Dee when and when not to use \"/<KI,\" but its universal application to a language that uses the letter % very often becomes, in my opinion, laughably cumbersome. Using the < lolden Dawn pronunciation method, the simple, one-syllable Enochain (VOrd zims (\"clothing\") becomes the unwieldy, four-syllable \"zod-I-me- od.\" You tell me which rolls off the tongue better. The most obvious alternative to the GD pronunciation is simply lOUnding out the words as they are written (which appears to be what 11\" .ingi'ls generally wanted Dee and Kelley to do). For the last fifteen in, this is what I have done, and it is what I recommend to students lin ire learning Enochian magick. Before that, however, I used the 1,1 >/( rowley pronum iation method and was perfectly happy with it. In I'M III 11"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"fact, I still use the Italian sounding method when I recite the first and second calls because I have them memorized and they hold a special place in my heart. Both methods work just fine. In fact, any sincere effort on the part of the magician to sound out the words as they appear in the call works. Some of the best group scrying sessions I have experienced have followed the most horribly butchered recitations of the calls. It's as though the Enochian angels (like the French) appreciate any attempt on your part to speak their language. I often use the example of a mouse. If a mouse hopped up on your shoe and squeaked, you'd just shoo it away. But if it hopped up on your shoe and started to talk to you in your native tongue, you'd be impressed. You wouldn't even care if it spoke with a thick accent! I have tried to present the calls below as close as possible to the original spelling, breaks, letter characterization, and punctuation. The English translation that follows each call is generally punctuated in the same way as the Enochian. The Calls, the Tablet of Union, and the Elemental Tablets According to the Golden Dawn, Crowley, and many modern Enochian magick practitioners, the first eighteen calls activate the Tabid \"I Union, the Elemental Tablets, and the hierarchy of angels resideni in the tablets in a very specific (and demonstrably logical) mannci Although the Dee and Kelley source material does not support tllll arrangement, it has become the foundation of a remarkably work a Mi system.

The Call of the Thirty Aethyrs The nineteenth call is used to open each of the thirty Aethyrs. Only the name of the Aethyr itself (the third word in the first sentence) is changed. Each Aethyr (with the exception of the thirtieth) is inhabited by three governors, who could be considered personifications of the nature of the Aethyr. I believe that after you recite the call and before you set- tle down to scry, it is important to pronounce, vibrate, or otherwise incorporate the names of the governors in a brief invocation. The names of the Aethyrs and their governors are listed in figure 90. If you wish to incorporate the sigils of the governors (the symmet- rical characters) for visualizations or to create talismans, the sigils can be found in chapter eighteen, in column VI of figure 63.

O you heavens which dwell in the First Ayre are mighty in the parts of the Earth, and execute the Judgment of the Highest, to you it is said, Behold the face of your God, the beginning of comfort, whose eyes are the brightness of the heavens, which provided you for the government of the Earth and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding to dispose all things according to the providence of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and rose up in the beginning say- ing: the Earth let her be governed by her parts and let there be division in her, that the glory of her may be always drunken and vexed in it self. Her course, let it run with the heavens, and as a handmaid let her serve them. One season let it confound an other, and let there be no creature upon or within her the same, All her members let them differ in their qualities, and let there be no one creature equal with an other: the rea- sonable Creatures of the Earth let them vex and weed out one an other, and the dwelling places let them forget their names: the work of man, and his pomp, let them be defaced: his buildings let them become caves for the beasts of the field. Confound her understanding with darkness. For why? It repenteth me I made Man. One while let her be known and an other while a stranger: because she is the bed of a Harlot, and the dwelling place of Him that is Fallen. O you heavens arise: the lower heavens underneath you, let them serve you! Govern those that govern: cast down such as fall! Bring forth with those that increase, and destroy the rotten! No place let it remain in one number: add and diminish until the stars be numbered! Arise, Move, and Appear before the Covenant oj his mouth, which he hath sworn unto us in his Justice.

Cousins Liber Scientiae Auxilii et Victoriae Terrestris, which forms part of Sloane Manuscript 3191, provides the details necessary to operate a system of magic, by which the magician can discover 'how to compare . . . [the] divisions of provinces according to the Divisions of the Stars, with the Ministry of the Ruling Intelligences, and Blessings of the Tribes of Israel, the Lots of the Apostles, and Typical Seals of the Sacred Scripture, [so that he] shall be able to obtain great and prophetical oracles, con- cerning every region, of things to come.' 120 On Wednesday 23 May 1584, while in Krakow, John Dee and Edward Kelley received from the Spirit Nalvage the names of ninety\"! one regions and provinces of the physical world, as defined by man ^| this time America was no longer considered to be a group of islaiuli but Australia had yet to be discovered and the search for the North\" West Passage had just commenced. The names of the ninety-one purl relate to the Ptolemaic ancient world of about Al) 150 with some .uldl tions. The Spirit Nalvage explains: 'Notwithstanding the Angel <>i the I \"\"I appeared unto Ptolemie, and opened unto him the parti oi the Earthi but some he was commanded to secret: and those are Northward under your Pole. But unto yon, the very true names of the World in her Creation are delivered.' 121 The list is not altogether satisfactory. Dee, who was well-versed in geography, had not heard of some of the places and even Nalvage said, 'Here are 15, which were never known in these times . . . The rest are'. Many of the strange locations are indeed in the Polar Regions, which were uncharted at the time. In fact, a considerable Arctic land mass was believed to exist and was featured on sixteenth century maps. Nevertheless, locations for this region are desirable and there are many areas in the extreme north, whether land or sea, which can be covered by the descriptions. The belief of a south polar continent (Tolpam, Part 58) was not inaccurate, a location which can usefully extend to Australasia which was undiscovered at the time. Two points emerge at the end of the communication relating to known lands not included in the list. Firstly, when Dee asks of 'Polonia, Moschovia, Dania, Hibernia (Ireland), Islandia, and so of many others', Nalvage replies: 'Polonia and Moscovia, are of Sarmatia (Russia); I >enmark, Ireland, Frizeland, Iseland, are of Britain: And so it is of the icst.' 122 Does this imply that Brytania (Part 61) can be used to gain access to lands not included within the ninety-one parts? Secondly, When Dee presses Nalvage as to which part governs 'Atlantis and the innexed places, under the King of Spain called the West Indies', N.ilvage replies: 'When these 30 appear, they can each tell you what they own. Prepare for tomorrows Action'. The communication is, therefore, incomplete. Unfortunately, 'tomorrows Action' never Occurred, because Kelley believed Nalvage to have taken the descrip- from books, including Agrippa's Occult Philosophy, and refused • nimunicate further. 'E. K. remained of his wilful intent', noted a 11 usi rated Dee. However, Onigap (Part 34) may refer to these lands and (hi rr is the possibly implied use of Brytania, as described above. Note ill ii I >i-c held that the term 'West Indies' was very misleading and pre- I ijvd It) use 'Atlantis' instead of 'America', as a name for the new IMIHIS Nevertheless, the additional thirty parts wait to be realised, in h would bring the total of the pans of the Earth to 121.

He does not record his success. Ultimately, the advice of Nalvage in relation to Chaldei (Part 42) and Chaldea (Part 72) is the only way to establish the locations of the obscure and ambiguously described parts of the world: 'You shall finde the difference of it, in practice'. The Ninety-One Parts of the World Many of the locations are well-known. However, for the obscurer areas Dee's Spiritual Diaries {Cotton Appendix XLVI, Parts 1 & 2, published as A True and Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers Between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits, edited by Meric Casaubon, 1659) are often the only guide. In these instances, supportive quota- tions are given. Other parts, especially those located by Kelley or Nalvage in the Far Orient or in the Arctic regions, are difficult to place on the world map today, as in Dee's time these regions were largely unexplored and uncharted. 1 AEGYPTUS: Egypt. 2 SYRIA: Southern Syria. 3 MESOPOTAMIA: Land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Northern Iraq and North-East Syria. 4 CAPPADOCIA: Extensive province of Central Turkey, stretching from the Black Sea in the north to Cilicia (Part 14) in the south. The original territory, Cappadocia Proper, occupied the southern areas. 5 TUSCIA: Tuscany or Etruria, a province in Central Italy including Florence. 6 PARVA ASIA: Asia Minor, Anatolia or Asiatic Turkey. 7 HYRCANIA: Area south-east of the Caspian Sea in Iran. 8 THRACIA: Thrace includes Eastern Greece, Turkey in Europe, and Southern Bulgaria. 9 GOSMAM: According to Kelley, 'Here appear great I lills, and veins of the Gold Mines appear: the men seem to have baskets ol leather.

Most probably Pasargardae or Parsagarda ('the habitation of the Persians'), the ancient capital of Parsa/Persis/Persia Proper or the modern Iranian province of Fars (Part 74). Parsagarda is located about 60 miles northeast of Shiraz. 12 FNDIA: Includes Indian provinces along the Indus River, roughly present- day Pakistan and India West of the Ganges (India Intra Ganges). 13 BACTRIANE: Bactriana covers Northern Afghanistan and the south- east of the Turkmenistan, the River Amu Darya (Oxus) forming the northern boundary. For lands to the north of the river, see Sogdiana (Part 26). 14 CILICIA: Coastal country bordering the Mediterranean in South-East Turkey. 15 OXIANA: Alexandreia Oxiana, a town and its surrounding area on the Oxus River (Amu Darya) on the borders of Northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. 16 NUMIDIA: Eastern Algerian coastal district between Africa (Part 86) and Mauretania (Part 91). 17 CYPRUS: Cyprus.

It is also known as Chinese Turkistan. Kelley: 'People here appear of reddish colour.' 24 GALLIA: A 'greater' France with the Rhine forming the northern and eastern boundaries, thereby including Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Southern Netherlands. 25 ILLYRIA: At its greatest extent, Illyria included Central and Eastern Austria, Western Hungary or Transdanubia, the former Yugoslavia excluding Macedonia, Northern Bulgaria and Romania. 26 SOGDIANA: District between the rivers Amu Darya (Oxus) and Syr Darya (Jaxartes) including Uzbekistan, with the cities of Bokhara and Samarkand, and Western Tajikistan. Afghanistan is to the south, for which see Bactriana (Part 13). 27 LYDIA: Coastal region in Western Turkey. 28 CASPIS: Area to the south-west of the Caspian Sea in Iran. 29 GERMANIA: Includes modern Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and extends to the Italian border in the south, incorporating Switzerland and the Tyrol in Western Austria. In the north, Germania can include Denmark, Norway and Sweden, although Dee was told that Brytania (Part 61) could be used for Denmark, which at that time gov- erned Norway as well. 30 TRENAM: Kelley: 'Here appear Monkies, great flocks. The people have leather Coats, and no beards, thick leather, and Garthers . . . ' Nalvage: 'These people are not known to you?' Dee: 'Are they not in Africa?' Nalvage: 'They be.' Probably Teniam, a region on Jodocus Hondius's World Map (1608) straddling the Ivory Coast/Upper Volta/Ghana borderlands. 31 BITHYNIA: Black Sea coastal region in the north ol Turkey, west i>l Paphlagonia (Part 40), including Istanbul (Asian side). 32 GRAECIA: Nalvage-: 'A great Clitic, nnil flu- Sen hard by it.' i >eei 'Ii ii\"i ill.ii great < litie < loniti lopli p Nalvage: 'It is . . .'

Nalvage: 'These be beyond Hispaniola.' Kelley: 'It is a low Countrey. Here appear great piles of Stones like St Andrews Crosses . . . There are on this side of it (a great way) a great number of dead Carkases . . .' Nalvage: 'It is beyond Giapan.' (That is, beyond Japan across the Pacific to the Americas. Note that Onigap is an anagram of Giapon.) Dee: 'Then it is that land, which I use to call Atlantis.' Nalvage: 'They stretch more near the west.' This can only be Mexico, particularly the Yucatan. Beyond Hispaniola (Haiti and Domenica) and west of 'Atlantis' or America is Central Mexico and the Yucatan, which is a low-lying peninsula. The people wore bright colours; the temples could resemble St Andrew's crosses; and, many people were slaughtered by the Spanish Conquistadores. 35 INDIA MAJOR: India Extra Gangem or India east of the Ganges, which includes all of South-East Asia. 36 ORCHENY: Nalvage: 'A great many little Isles.' Dee: 'Do you mean the Isles of Orkney?' Nalvage: 'No.' Dee: 'They seem to be the Isles of Malacha.' I )t'c is mistakenly thinking of the islands around Malaya (Malacha or Malacca) or even the Moluccas.

This is Cilicia where the Children of Nemrod dwell. It is up in the Mountains beyond Cathay.' Probably Calatia, a region in this location featured on Emery Molyneux's terrestrial globe of 1592. It equates with the extreme north-eastern province of Russia by the Bering Straits, the Magandan Oblast. Cilicia in Turkey is Part 14. 40 PAPHLAGONIA: Black Sea coastal country in the north of Turkey. 41 PHASIANA: Mainly Kurdish region in Eastern Turkey, north of Lake Van, not to be confused with Phazania/Fezzan in Libya, for which see Garamantica (Part 45). 42 CHALDEI: The people of Chaldea (Part 72). 43 ITERGI: Nalvage: '. . . the people are yellow, tawney . . . They are to the south of the last Cilicians.' This is possibly Mongolia, Manchuria (North-East China), and Korea. The name appears in this region on a terrestrial globe, dated 1492, of German geographer Martin Behaim (c.1459-1507). 44 MACEDONIA: Northern Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 45 GARAMANTICA: Garamantes, a large area in Inner Africa, covering the Eastern Sahara, including the south of Libya (Fezzan), extreme South- Eastern Algeria, Niger and Chad. 46 SAUROMATICA: Sarmatia or European Russia. 47 AETHIOPIA: Includes Ethiopia south of Egypt and also the entire unknown African continent south of the Equator, which was known as Ethiopia Interior in Dee's time. Unexplored parts of Africa north of the Equator were known as Libya Interior. 48 FIACIM: Kelley: 'Now he sheweth by the North Pole and the great Mountain.' This is the North Pole. A great mountain was believed to exist at the Pole. 49 COLCHICA: Colchis roughly i'i|imtcN with the modern Republic of (ieorgia, lot atcd to the eiisl ol I hi 111 n I Si i 50 CIRENIACA: Cyrenaica, a Mediterranean coastal region of Eastern Libya. 51 NASAMONIA: Ill-defined north-eastern Libyan coastal district by the (i'ulf of Sirte in the west of Cireniaca (Part 50). 52 CARTHAGO: Carthage, Tunisia. 53 COXLANT: Nalvage: 'It appeareth very Eastward.' Kelley: 'It is on high ground. There come four Rivers out of it, one East, .mother West, another North, and another South ... Is this the Paradise that Adam was banished out of?' Nalvage: 'The very same.' A discussion follows which does not help to locate Coxlant. The search for the Earthly Paradise, like the Eldorado, was the dream of early I Kplorers. The four rivers are the Pison (The Persian Gulf?), Gihon (The Nile?), Hiddekel (Tigris), and Euphrates. The favourite location of I'u .idise was considered to be a little north of the confluence of the Tigris ,nnl Kuphrates. However, other locations favoured sites further north in [i opotamia and Armenia. Tibet could be another location. It is very rnsrcrly; on high ground; and the four rivers are the Mekong (east), the Indus (west), the Yangtze (north), and the Brahmaputra (south), i ilnniately, however, the location of Coxlant or the Earthly Paradise must \" i with the spirituality of the individual.

This is Gongala, an area to the south of Libya Interior by the Equator. In the sixteenth century Kelley's description is apt, but today the region equates with South Sudan. 76 GORSIM: Kelley: 'Beares and Lions here.' Most probably Chorazin/Korazim/Gorazim, an ancient site to the north of Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilee), Israel, with the ruins of a black basalt synagogue. The place was condemned by Jesus and legend claims the Antichrist will be born there. Note also Chorasmia/Khorezm/Khiva, south-east of the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan. 77 HISPANIA: Spain and Portugal. 78 PAMPHILIA: Southern Turkish coastal land, between Lycia (Part 33) and Cilicia (Part 14), forming a narrow strip of land around the Bay of Antalya. 79 OACIDI: This is Oasitae ('. . . of the Oasis'), the oasis area west of the Nile, which includes the great oasis of the Oracle of Amon. 80 BABYLON or BABYLONIA: Region in Southern Iraq, extending north from the Persian Gulf between the Lower Tigris and the northeast- ern Arabian desert.

The Maspii, a noble Persian tribe, are too far south to be considered. 83 FELIX ARABIA: Arabian Red Sea coastlands, particularly the south- western areas, including the Yemen. 84 METAGONITIDIM: The Metagonitae were a people living in Tangiers and the surrounding area.

The region also includes the eastern Algerian coastlands and the Algerian/Tunisian border. This is not the continent of Africa. 87 BACTRIANI: The people of Bactriana (Part 13). 88 AFNAN or AFRAN: Kelley: 'Here appear people with one eye in their head, seeming to be in their breast, towards the Equinoctial.' Dee: 'I remember of people called Arimaspi.' Dee is confused here, as the Arimaspi ('the one-eyed') were a people on the left bank of the Middle Volga, north of the Caspian Sea. The Afran are the people Ptolemy called the Aphricerones, located just north of Equatorial Africa in North Zaire. The ancient scholars considered that all the southern parts of Africa were uninhabitable (as with many unexplored lands) and populated with strange beasts. Herodotus included in his con- jectures on unknown Africa descriptions of peoples with 'one eye in the breast instead of the usual head', which must be the people referred to. 89 PHRYGIA: Large province in Central Turkey. Greater Phrygia was bounded on the east by Cappadocia (Part 4). 90 CRETA: Crete. 91 MAURITANIA or MAURETANIA: Morocco and the north Algerian coastlands, not to be confused with the modern state of Mauritania, which is located further south and for which see Getulia (Part 19).

Scryer: David P. Wilson. For our first evocation session I decided we would work as Dee and Kelley did. One person would act as seer, and one as operator. The seer would recite the appropriate call, receive the vision, and communicate it during or after the session. The operator would banish, open and close the temple, and question the seer. I would be the operator, but I did not know who in our little class would be the first to sit in the visionary driver's seat. On class night there was only one rather reluc- tant volunteer. David P. Wilson was not new to the world of magick. In the years leading up to his affiliation with our lodge he sat in with a host of magi cal groups and workshops in the Los Angeles area upon whom he later heaped scorn and ridicule because of their inability to show liiin \"real magick.\" He was flu- boldest member of the class, also the mosl impatient and sarcastic. I could sec the Knot Man < lass going down in flames on opening night because David the curmudgeon once again \"saw noth- ing! \" He had done none of the preliminary Enochian work with the rest of the class. He hadn't painted a set of tablets or studied any of the calls. Still, he was our only volunteer. I can't recall why but I decided we would to try to contact LAIDROM, the Mars Senior of the Elemental Tablet of Earth. In the spirit of better safe than sorry, we placed the Earth tablet in the South (Capricorn/Cardinal Earth) and enclosed the entire class in a circle cast with a clothesline cord. I banished with the rituals of the lesser and greater pentagrams and hexagrams, then opened the temple and invoked the hierarchical names as indicated in Liber Chanokb. David was seated on the floor at the southern edge of the circle, just inches away from the Earth tablet. Leaning against the wall behind the tablet was a huge cardboard version of the [Elemental] Tablet of Earth that I placed there for the other members of the class to focus upon. I turned on the tape recorder and gave David a copy of the Call to read. I sat down behind him while he read it aloud. He did rather well considering he had never read it before. When he was finished, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Nothing happened. I asked him to read the Call again. He did so and after only a few seconds he said, \"I have a landscape. I see a landscape.\" I was relieved beyond words. \"What does it look like?\" David proceeded to describe in surprising detail a desert vista of flat, trackless white crystalline powder stretching to the horizon. Great gray columns of volcanic rock towering over the plain broke the monotony of the scene. Between the columns the ground was pock- marked with countless gaping pits. That was it. Nothing else was occurring. I asked him to read the (!all a third time. This time there was movement. From out of a pit in the center of his field of vision arose a black cone. He said it sparkled from the inside and upon its surface with thousands of little sparks that jumped from one star to another. I asked, \"Is this LAIDROM?\" David grabbed his pencil and notepad and quickly scribbled some- thing. I looked at what he had drawn. It looked like four very poorly drawn Enochian letters, At (he time it meant nothing to me. I asked for .11 learer amwi i ' thl I AIUKOM?\" \"It's him! I I'm limit I ||< him"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"He described a humanoid figure draped in the same material from which the cone was constructed. He had an egg-shaped head but no face. His hands were like mittens—there were no fingers. He reached his arm toward the ground and \"drew\" a diagram in the sand in front of him. David quickly copied the figure on the notepad. It was a square divided diagonally by two lines with a small circle in the lower left- hand corner. We took this to be LAIDROM's signature. We were all very excited. It was as if the entire class saw David's vision in our mind's eye. Then it occurred to me. Now that we've got this guy, what the hell are we to do with him? Before I could think of what to do next, David said, \"Lon, I feel like ... I feel... I could make strange sounds.\" This was a twist. \"Let yourself.\" I told him. \"Go with it.\" I tried to sound calm. \"Naw-n tahelo hob athayzo raygayeff. . . this is bullshit!\" \"No! Relax, let it happen!\" \"I mean it, I feel like an idiot. I'm too . . . zil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arp nan-ta . . . (inaudible) . . . ef. . . efee thar-zi. I am sorry. That's all. Nothing like this has ever happened before. I just felt like doing it.\" David's apology was comical. We all broke into nervous giggles. It had been quite an evening. As we had planned nothing particu- lar to do with LAIDROM, I thought it wise to quit while we were ahead. I asked David to thank our spirit guest for his visit and pro- ceeded to banish and close the temple. One of the class members had brought along his Enochian Dictionary 124 and suggested we try to use it to see if David's strange babbling actually meant something. I rewound the tape and played it back from the beginning. Everything was crystal clear right up to the time of LAIDROM's appearance, when the tape developed an irritating distortion. We joked that it was the fault of malicious spirits and expected it to soon clear up. It did not. In fact, by the time the tape reached David's babbling we could hardly pick his voice out from behind the bank of white noise. As soon as the good stuff was over, the distortion suddenly stopped. Noise notwithstanding, after replaying the section of tape a dozen times or more, we picked up enough ol wh.u was being said to write down three audible strings oi syllablci! naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayeff. zil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arp nan-ta . . . (inaudible) and ef. . . efee thar-zi. Starting at the beginning, we painstakingly played with the pho- netics of each word (and the word/words following) and attempted to match them with words in the Enochian Dictionary. Obviously we weren't being very scientific, nor, I confess, very objective. This was all very exciting and romantic, and I am sure that night we would have squeezed some profundity out of any string of sounds. Be that as it may, it took less than an hour to break the sounds up as follows: Nanta, elo Hoath zorge ef. —Which translated neatly to: \"Spirit of Earth, first worshiper friendly visit.\" Zil zien —\"stretch forth hands\" Zilodarp Nanta —\"stretch forth and conquer Spirit of Earth\" Ef etharzi —\"visit in peace.\" Needless to say we were all very impressed. At the end of the evening it was agreed that from now on class would meet two times a week to pursue Enochian magick. Sadly, David's ability to break spon- taneously into the Enochian language would diminish rapidly as his familiarity with the language of the Calls increased. After the fourth or fifth session, he lost the ability completely. His visions, on the other hand, became clearer, more informative, and more provocative. -xam pie 2 Monday Night Magick Class (July 17, 2006) Twenty-ninth Aethyr Rii.

And then I thought, No, I've got to figure out what this message is about. So I tried to push him away. (Laughter from class.) And I said (very drunkenly), \"Gumziam [sic], where are you? And I kept flying around in the water vortex. I then saw two triangles together but three dimensional, in sort of like (garbled) with three or four sides instead <>l eight sides, and then the two triangles . . . one split off from the othei one. One on top, one on bottom, and the widest parts were togetlui, and I was standing in the middle . . . and it was like the floor and ceil ing were separating and apart.

Then it was stuck back together again, and I was swirling with the vortex again.

Set-yen name withheld The following is a letter I received a few days after I returned home from a workshop series on Enochian vision magick. The vision the young woman describes occurred during a scrying session that concluded A half-day public workshop. She, like most of the attendees at this event, had never performed Enochian magick before.

Over their two-part chorus of the Table of Nalvage words, I recited the nineteenth call to penetrate the thirtieth Aethyr, Tex. Here is her experience. Hi, Lon! Thanks again for making the trek here . . . last weekend. I learned a lot more than I had expected to, which is why I'm writing you this. I didn't get a chance to talk to you about the things I saw/did when you led the class foray into the Enochian aethyrs, and initially I was hesi- tant to because of the rather personal nature of some of it. But after talking to [my brother] about it, I realized I should tell you; in fact, he insisted I do so. So here goes. We had just finished chanting the Holy Table, and you indicated we should close our eyes while you continued chanting and just follow the images that came to us. Initially I got not images per se, but random geometric shapes in dark shades of purple and green, mostly pyramids, and pyramids of one color in front of squares of a slightly darker shade. I realized that I was falling forward, swiftly, down a triangular corridor filled with a dark purplish haze, with occasional lighter purple Hashes—like falling through layers and layers and layers, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, with something spinning all around me at the same time. Then I realized I wasn't going down anymore, but rising, still through this triangular purple infused corridor, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, still the spinning, and I began to feel my heart pounding like it would burst inside me, I felt dizzy and slightly nauseous, and just when I thought I couldn't stand it for another moment longer, I stopped speeding forward, and the purple mist cleared, and I was standing on a grassy plain, almost a hilltop, that rose slightly upward in front of me. I realized that the thing that had been spinning seemed to be the petals Oi an enormous flower, a lotus, perhaps, and that the hillside on which I siood was contained within its perimeter, like a low wall going around n. It occurs to me now that I was facing north. Beyond the border of the wall were two more hills in the distance, one CO the left and one to the right, covered in vibrant dark green veg- etation, and I knew vaguely that there were Things in those hills, in those trees, bul I didn'l hive rime to think about them. There were four l>ill.ii •. 111,11 ii. i.

It wasn't large, maybe only one or one and a half stories high; it was four sided and made of a smooth golden brick or stone. A blinding light issued from the center of it, and, as I watched, the form of a person appeared in the center of this light and was walking towards me. My impression was that he came from inside the pyramid, and lie seemed to be coming from some distance, though the pyramid was jusi in front of me. He was tall and blond and blue eyed and wore a gai ment of brilliant white and a golden circlet about his temples. And hi was smiling, he was so glad to see me. As he came close to me, In- opened up the robe to reveal a column of blinding white light runniii)', down the centerline of his body. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I real ized that the light was coming from his chakras, which were blazing yellow-white light and shaped sort of like flowers. I realized that m) chakras were also blazing, and the light from his heart chakra leapt for- ward in a thin white-yellow tongue of flaming light and entered mj heart chakra. Then his throat chakra flamed and leapt into mine, and then all of them at once seemed to, and that blazing sharing of chak 1I light continued for a few blissful, amazing moments. He held his hands out in front of him, palms facing toward me, and I placed my palms against them, and the chakras in our hands blazed with light and fire for a moment. Then he took my hands and pulled them straight into his chest so that I held his heart chakra in my hand I, and then he indicated that I should put his heart chakra inside my chest. I was amazed that he would suggest that, and slightly hesitant, bin hi was insistent, and together we thrust it into my chest. I was stunned at the force of the heat of the union of our two heart chakras. Then hi gestured to his throat chakra, and again, I took his chakra in my hand,. and lifted it out of him and into myself, with another flash of heat Then I lifted out his third-eye chakra, then his solar plexus chakra, then his hara chakra. I reached next for his root chakra, and realized that in my hands it had become a huge golden phallus, and as in the curioul logic of dreams, there was only one obvious way to integrate thai into myself—I mounted it, and at the same time, I rem lied up ami removed the crown from his head, symbolic of his crown chakra, and placed ll on my own head at the same monienl as the phallus slid into me, -md i lie universe exploded. 11 wasn't ll i it VI lin't COpulition, it W*« I ] I was perfectly with and within him, and he was perfectly with and within me. It was Bliss, it was Light, it was Perfection. I heard his voice in my ear, saying, \"You are She, in Whom all things are received; She in Whom all things are created; She in Whom all things are possible. All Life is Yes; all Love is Know. Know that You are She.\" At about that moment, I heard your voice saying something about looking around for landmarks that would help me remember this place, and I laughed to myself that I wasn't likely to forget this. You said something else about bringing back a sign, or a key or talisman from this place, something to know and remember it by that would help me return, and I pulled back slightly from this Being with a wordless ques- tion, and his answer was to withdraw from me, and he ejaculated into my outstretched hands, a liquid golden light that turned into two glow- ing, golden diamond crystals that sank into my palms and disappeared as I watched. Then your voice said it was time to return, and without another word or glance between us I was whisked up and away, coming back into awareness of my body with a nauseating thud, my head spinning, my heart pounding painfully. You started asking us questions about what we'd seen, where we'd been, and I was too nauseated and out of breath to answer, but was amazed to hear my classmates describing •.miilar imagery, lotuses, columns, towers, pyramids, though no one else seemed to have experienced anything close to what had passed between me and that other Being—or at least, no one was admitting to it. I sat there in a haze, listening to them, thinking about my own experience, and waiting for my heart to quit pounding, my stomach to stop churn- ing. I must have looked pretty stunned, because [my husband] asked me II I was OK, and all I could initially articulate to him as he looked over .11 me was, \"What the f just happened to me?\" We broke for dinner at about that moment, and I realized my opportunity to share it with the class had passed. But I still wanted to tell you about it, and, of course, [my husband]. We had driven separate cars that day, so we met at the house before going to the restaurant, and l he re at home I told him. He stared at me while I told him about it, say- Ing ii was pretty amazing, but I'd better not say anything about it in front <»l the class as a whole, that it was way too personal to just lay OUt there thai way.

I can tell you that all this week, whenever I've \"turned on\" the Reiki or use one of the symbols, the chakras in my palms blaze with heat, my patients have actually commented on it! (In fact, they're heat- ing up right now, just thinking about it.) [My brother] didn't exactly discount my idea about it, but he said there was a lot more mystical sig- nificance there than I realized, or than he should even talk to me about until I talked to you. Obviously, it's loaded with archetypal images, but I would love to know what you get from them, what level you sent me to, and if you recognize anything from my descriptions.

Theoretically, once the magician has successfully invoked the divine presence within himself or herself, he or she then has the divine authority to evoke the spirits. 1 9 John Dee, Mysteriorum, and John Dee's Five Books of Mystery, p. 54: Sloane 3188. 20 Caitlin and John Matthews, The Western Way: A Practical Guide to the Western Mystery Tradition (London: Arkana/Penguin Books.

He turned his attention to magick, and in 15-8% he and his clairvoyant partner Edward Kelley made contact with a number of spiritual entities who identified themselves as angels—the same angels that communicated with Adam, Enoch, and the patriarchs of the Old Testament. Over the next three years three distinct magical systems were revealed to Dee and Kelley. The third, thanks largely to efforts from the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the xoth-century practices of Aleister Crowley, is now widely known as Enochian Magick. Enochian Vision Magick includes extensive background and historical notes, explores the foundation for the creation of the Enochian Magick system, and provides readers with a step-by-step process for using it. \"Lon DuQuette is a miracle worker, and Enochian Vision Magick is his greatest miracle. His uncanny gift for clear and simple explanations has produced the most accessible, interesting, personal and—most importantly— practical guide to Enochian magick available.\" —Richard Kaczinski, Ph.D., author of Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley \"DuQuette has created a truly original and highly interesting vision of the practical applica- tion of the Enochian System. He treats the material as Dee intended it to be treated—as a gateway into another world.\" —-Geoffrey James, editor and translator of The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee \"It has fallen to Lon Milo DuQuette to provide an easy entrance to the Watchtowers of Dee's magic. In doing so he has done modern magic a great service.\" —Stephen Skinner, co-author of The Practical Angel Magic of Dr. John Dees's Enochian Tables \"We are lucky to finally have a useful introduction to this difficult subject that provides the aspiring Enochian conjurer with both the proper foundation and the tools to successfully begin what can become a lifelong adventure and labor ill love.\" —David K.
