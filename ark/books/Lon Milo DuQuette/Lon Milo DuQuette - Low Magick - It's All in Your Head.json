WASHINGTON IRVING Next to silence, stories are the most divine form of communica­ tion. Stories are alive. Stories are holy. Stories are gods that cre­ ate universes and the creatures and characters that populate them. Stories bring to life all the triumphs and tragedies imagination and experience can summon to the mind. Stories speak directly to our souls. Stories are magick. As I begin the seventh decade of my life, I find myself more inclined to listen to a story than to study a text or reflect on an argument-more inclined to tell a story than to presume to teach a lesson or offer advice. Perhaps it is because as we grow older we have more stories to tell, and experience and wisdom conspire to add dimension, texture, and perspective to the lengthening regis­ ter of our memories."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"l 2 Prologue For whatever reason, I find myself at this season of my life unable to approach the subject of this book from any direction other than relating my personal experiences. This is not to say that I haven't in­ tegrated a great deal of theory and technical information within my nonchronological narratives. Indeed, I believe there is more than enough magical \"how-to-ness\" nestled within these pages to keep a motivated magician busy for some time. But it is the story that informs-the story that teaches-the story that reveals the magical \"how-why-ness\" (and in some instances, the \"how-why not-ness\") of the magician's life. However, storytelling has certain disadvantages-foremost be­ ing the fact that memory is a fragile and subjective thing. Pain, regret, embarrassment, shame, wishful thinking, fanta sy, and old­ fashioned self-delusion constantly threaten the accuracy of our recollections of the past. Absolute objectivity is impossible. But unlike other mortals who lead less examined lives, the magician is obliged to keep a diary , and may refer to specific events recorded in his or her magical journals. I've relied heavily on my scribblings in the preparation of this book-a painfully embarrassing ordeal, I assure you. Also, in the course of telling a magical story , one must consider the sensitivities and the privacy of other individuals, living or dead, who may be part of the action. Over the years I have been blessed to meet and work with some very wonderful and colorful charac­ ters, most of whom would not be recognizable personalities in our magical subculture, but a few of them I dare say might. So, I con­ fess here and now that in certain places in this book I've changed names or made other literary adjustments to allow certain individu­ als to remain blissfully incognito. I, of course, hope that you will enjoy this small collection of my memories, but I know that I can't possibly satisfY the taste and expectation of every reader.

If you're short on time, please feel free to close the book and fearlessly get on with your life. Do not get me wrong. It's good to be cautious. It's good to be wise. It's good to be measured and thoughtful in all your actions and behavior, but fear is poison to your magical practice and poi­ son to your life. Please know that I am not preaching this gospel of fearlessness from the marble pulpit of righteousness and courage. On the contrary , I'm shouting it from the pasteboard megaphone of my own ignoble and cowardly character. When I began my life as a practicing magician, it seemed like I was afraid of everything. When I rehearsed my first Pentagram and Hexagram rituals, I superstitiously monitored everything from my heartbeat to my horniness. I fantasized seeing things out of the corner of my eye, and recorded the most outlandish speculations in my diary . I realize now that most of my fears of things that go bump in the night arose from the deepest stratum of my childhood religious pro­ gramming. In less evasive words, I was still consciously and uncon­ sciously brainwashed by my Christian upbringing-still trapped in a hostile universe that reverberated with the thundering curses of a wrathful God who frightens little children into acceptable behav­ ior (so that they grow into obedient God-fearing adult little chil­ dren). I was programmed by films and literature based upon that unwholesome doctrine of fear and self-loathing.

Remember Laura Dern's character in the film jurassic Park, rolling up her sleeves and plung­ ing her arm into a huge pile of dinosaur poop for a clue to the poor animal's tummy ache? Well, sometimes a magician is faced with even more disturbing psychological and spirit-world chal­ lenges, and the key to meeting those challenges is that same de­ tached attitude of fearlessness, determination, and an unshakeable passion for enlightenment. I recently received a letter from a magician who believed that her mood swings and other health issues were the result of her magical workings. Here's a portion of my letter back to her. I hope you find it encouraging. Dear (name withheld), Concerning mood swings and health issues vis-a-vis your magical practices, it's usually best to ascribe them to the normal demons of body chemistry and the stress of twenty­ first century urban life. More often than not, a head cold or the flu isn't caused by backlash for a magical operation. Even if it were a negative reaction to your magical work- ings, your doubts and fears over the matter only serve to give the entities you fear permission and encouragement to keep feeding on your insecurities (and perhaps much more).

In­ deed, they are as different as day and night-or should I say hi g h and low? (See how easily I have given myself a segue.) I feel the necessity to establish here at the outset what I mean by the words \"high magick\" and \"low magick.\" To be perfectly frank I've become very uncomfortable with both terms. They are each, in my opinion, universally misunderstood, misused, misapplied, misrepresented, and misinterpreted. Some ceremonial magicians label their craft hi g h ma g ick to haughtily distinguish their art from the low ma g ick of witchcraft. Conversely, some witches and Neopagans use the term sarcastically to brand ceremonial magicians and their ilk as snobs. Practical Qa­ balists, who presume their studies to be the only true high magick, use the terms to distance themselves from both ceremonial magi­ cians and witches. There are others who simply define low magick as being all things nature-based (outdoor magick), as opposed to ceremonial magick, a Ia the formal rituals of the Golden Dawn3 or Aleister Crowley4 (indoor magick). Here the terms low and hi g h are diplo­ matically construed by both schools as being morally neutral; the two merely differing in character and application, and appealing to different spiritual personalities and tastes. Here, both the high and the low magician are relatively happy in their own worlds per­ forming their own brand of magick. There are many others, though, who define the highness and lowness of magick in ways that go way beyond discussing the dif­ ferences between working in a lodge room temple or outside in a 3 Founded in 1888, the Order of the Golden Dawn was arguably the most influential magical society of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

For these people, \"high magick'' refers to a formal process of effecting change in one's environment by enlisting the aid of God and a heavenly hierarchy of good archangels, angels, intelligences, and spirits; and \"low magick'' refers to a formal process of effecting change by enlisting the aid of the devil (or devils), fallen angels, and infernal evil spirits and demons. Obviously, in order to seriously consider the virtues of this per­ spective, a person must first be committed to a very particular (some might say \"draconian\") view of spiritual reality-one that is supported (or so the argument goes) by the scriptures and doc­ trines of the Christian, Moslem, or Jewish religions. For conve­ nience sake, I will henceforth collectively (and respectfully ) refer to these Bible-based religions by a term I coined just for conversa­ tions such as this. The word is: \"Chrislemew .\"5 One popular interpretation of these doctrines posits that hu­ mans are caught in the middle of a perpetual war between the armies of an absolutely good God in heaven above, and the min­ ions of an absolutely evil devil in hell below. For reasons known only to God, the devil and his team have been placed in charge of human life on earth.

This parochial and highly polarized way of looking at things makes everything pretty simple. God is good. The devil is bad. Angels are good. Demons are bad. Heavenly stuff is high. Infernal stuff is low. For those who subscribe to the Chrislemew worldview , the choice of whether to pursue the path of high or low magick is a no-brainer. After all, who in their right mind would prefer to dabble with dangerous and deceitful evil demons from hell when instead one can safely seek the heavenly aid of the wholesome and well-behaved good angels of God Almighty? From his high horse of spiritual piety, the high magician looks down upon low magicians who, in order to accomplish their ne­ farious ends, stand ready and willing to proffer their reprobate souls to the evil spirits in exchange for the fleeting power to be naughty-to harm an enemy, bewitch a neighbor's cow, or bed an otherwise unwilling partner. There are many people in the world today (magicians and non­ magicians alike) who believe quite literally that the above arrange­ ment is the only spiritual game plan in town. It is certainly their right to do so; after all, for many of us this God/devil, heaven/hell, angel/demon morality play is the familiar foundation upon which the perversely comfortable \"faith of our fathers\" was built. While I certainly do not wish to offend anyone's sincere spiritual beliefs (and I hold my hand up and swear, \"Some of my best friends are Chrislemews!\"), I must, however, be honest. I do not believe in such an ali-good anthropomorphic god. Neither do I believe in an all-evil anthropomorphic devil. I don't believe in a heaven where I'll be rewarded for believing correctly or a hell where I'll be pun­ ished for my unbelief.

Does my rejection of a too-literal interpretation of the scriptural worldview of the Chrislemews make me an atheist? For those who adhere too tightly to their doctrines, I guess it does-but it certainly does not from my point of view. 7 I most ardently believe in (indeed, I worship) a supreme consciousness that is the ultimate source of all manifest and unmanifest existence. I believe that you and I and every other monad of existence are components of the supreme consciousness. My morality (if you insist on calling it that) is based on my conviction that the ultimate nature of this super-existence is transcendently Good-a Good we can never adequately define with our words or understand with our meat brains-a Good so all-comprehensively infinite that there can be nothing outside of itsel f- - not even nothing. There can be no opposite of this great Good. The Goodness of supreme existence is spelled with the largest capital \"G\" imagin­ able. I call it the: \"Great G.\" (There I go again, making up words. Well ... get used to it, be­ cause I'm going to use this one a lot!) This Great G swallows up the concept of duality. It neutralizes all concepts that remain so small that it is possible for them to have opposites-ideas such as a god who is so small and incom­ plete that there is an outside-ofhimself where a pesky devil can go 7 After all, I can't be an atheist.

Perhaps the brains of our ancestors were not developed enough to grasp the idea of the Great Goodness of supreme existence. M­ ter all, in the ages when the Chrislemew and proto-Chrislemew doctrines were invented, our minds were yet unexpanded and un­ burdened by thoughts of gravity, or the speed of light, or the ro­ tation of the Earth or its orbit of the sun, or black holes, or the nature of space-time. Perhaps back then it was impossible for us to wrap our minds around a reality that didn't spring solely from the primitive fear-based motivations of reward and punishment, pain and pleasure. Perhaps then-but not any longer! After nearly forty years of magical study and practice, I've come to the conclusion that magick is magick. It is a spiritual art form by which we collect and direct a natural and neutral force whose source is the supreme intelligence-the supreme consciousness. In the right hands and under the right circumstances, the application of magick can be creative or destructive, helpful or harmful. It is not the magick is that is good or evil, or high or low-it is the magician. No matter how pious and virtuous one may believe oneself to be-no matter how seemingly altruistic one's motives-no matter how precise and eloquently one executes the invocations to enlist the favor of God and the services of his angels, a magician who has not yet grasped this big picture and achieved a significant mea­ sure of spiritual maturity, mental stability, and purity of heart is not yet equipped to recognize relative good from relative evil. Like a marksman firing a powerful weapon in the dark, the naive or superstitious magician is incapable of accurately hitting the mark or determining what magical actions will or will not be in his or her best interests.

It is with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek that I use the term \"Low Magick\" to describe the magical operations that follow. However, please don't think that by using the term I am being silly for silli­ ness sake. Many years ago, as a naYve and desperate young magician, I evoked Oro bas, a demon from the Goetia, 8 for the purpose of turn­ ing around my impoverished and chaotic life circumstances-to save my family, to provide materially for my wife and child, and to give me the emotional stability to pursue the Great Work. In my naYve and inexperienced mind, it was an act of black magick-an encounter with the devil himself that I was prepared to perform against my teacher's wishes. In fact, when I told her I had become so desperate that I intended to go through with it, she flatly forbade it. When I asked her if she had ever performed such an operation, she said, \"Certainly not! That's low magick.\" In an act of magical disobedience, I did it anyway. I knew I had to. I had to succeed because the consequences of failure at that point in my life were unthinkable. I was fearful and clumsy. The operation almost immediately turned into a terrifYing and trau­ matic comedy of errors that more resembled an industrial accident and a nervous breakdown than a magical ceremony. The climax of the ceremony was a life-and-death confrontation and struggle with the real demon responsible for my miserable situation-me. 8 The Book of the Goetia ofSolomon the King.

When it finally dawned on me that I had successfully evoked the demon, and I had the worst of me trapped in that magick Triangle, I had no alternative but to harness and redirect its monstrous power and give it new marching orders. From then on, that particular demon would be working for me rather than against me. I'll spare you the details,9 but suffice to say within minutes of concluding my bumbling act of low magick, a dramatic event oc­ curred that set into motion a chain of events that, with breathtak­ ing speed, accomplished everything I asked Orobas to deliver. But the real miracle was not the magical quid pro quo of a demon bent to obedience by the will of a magician, but the miracle of a magi­ cian who had redeemed a better demon of his nature. When the fiasco was over, I was a different person-a person who would save his family, provide materially for his wife and his child, and in the days and months and years ahead, dutch onto just enough emo­ tional stability to pursue the Great Work. In the first sentence of this chapter, I referred to Eliphas Levi as \"the great nineteenth-century esotericist.\" I did not call him a magi­ cian. Even though Monsieur Levi is universally lauded as the father of modern high magick, he was not a practicing magician. He was a brilliant scholar, a holy man, a teacher, and a magical philosopher, but, with the exception of one curious necromantic experiment that he confessed was not at all successful, he did not practice magick. 9 I describe this incident in greater detail in several other places in my previously pub­ lished works, especially My Life with the Spirits: The Adventures of a Modern Magician (York Beach, ME: Red Wh eel/Weiser, 1999).

FIRST KINGS, CHAPTER 3, VERSE 91 It may seem odd to you that I, as a man who more or less rejects the historicity of the Bible and most, if not all, of the Chrislemew view of spiritual reality , should spend my time praying to God, conjuring spirits, summoning demons, and communing with an­ gels. Make no mistake, I do indeed believe in the magical reality of gods, archangels, angels, spirits, and demons, and for the purpose of some particular magical operations, I even embrace (albeit tem­ porarily) the concept of a heaven filled with angels of high intel­ ligence, and a hell filled with legions of dangerous demons. In fact, because I actually work with these characters in practical ways, The Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts. Translated from Aramaic b y George M. Lamsa (Philadel p hia, PA: A.J.

As you will soon see, several of the stories in this book deal with my experiences with Solomonic magick or Goetia. Goetia is often vilified as the most striking example of low magick. Please under­ stand right now that I do not intend to burden you with another rehash or a tiresome reprint of the text Goetia2 with its seventy-two spirits and the traditional procedures used to conjure them. (There is a glut of books already on the market if that is what you need.) Rather, I hope by means of simple anecdotes and illustrations to gently acquaint you with the dynamics of this kind of magick­ why it sometimes works, and why it sometimes doesn't. Moreover, it is my hope that when you have finished reading this little book, you will have a greater understanding of the sublime spiritual formula that underlies this kind of magical practice-a formula, when properly applied, that promises to the tenacious and coura­ geous magician a greater measure of personal health, happiness, and enlightenment. The formula of Solomonic magick is very simple and uses the character of King Solomon as the mythological archetype of the ideal magician. There are many stories and traditions about Solo­ mon that come from sources other than the Bible. An important part of the mythology of Freemasonry revolves around a pecu­ liar story of King Solomon and the building of his magnificent 2 The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King-Translated into the English Tongue by a Dead Hand and Adorned with Divers Other Matter Germane DelightfUl to the \"Wtse, the Whole Edited, Verified, Introduced and Commented by Aleister Crowley (Inverness, Scotland: Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth, Boleskine, Foyers, 1904).

The Formula of Solomon 21 temple-a story that is not found in the Bible. The Koran, the Talmud, and Ethiopian scriptures also abound with colorful tales of the great magician king who, because of his special relationship with God and his mastery of magick, could talk with animals, fly through the air on a magick carpet, and effect all manner of works and wonders, including his ability to enlist a labor force of demons and evil spirits to build the great Temple of God. The likelihood that the biblical King Solomon probably never existed in empirical history should be of no concern to modern magicians, because the \"formula'' for doing this kind of magick isn't an aspect or product of history or religion but of the mythol­ ogy and traditions that are attached to Solomon's name. The magi­ cal myth goes something like this: When Solomon became king, his first job was to build a temple worthy to house the presence of the True and Living God Most High, something his father, David, hadn't been able to do. Before beginning the project, Solomon paused and thought things over and wisely came to the conclusion that he couldn't undertake such an important task without the blessing and guiding intelligence of God. In prayer, Solomon didn't ask for money or building materi­ als or contractors; he simply asked for an \"understanding heart.\" How cool was that! It impressed God so much that Solomon was granted his request and given everything else to boot, includ­ ing the divine secrets of how to magically summon the evil spirits of the world and (diverting them from their natural preoccupation with mischief) compel them to work for the good guys and help build the great temple. On the surface, this spiritual worldview appears to be at odds with the Chrislemew doctrines we discussed in the preceding chap­ ter. We've got God up above, and we've got demons down below, but it appears that's where the similarity ends. In fact, the whole format of Solomonic magick appears to be an incongruous mixture"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"22 Chapter Two of high and low magick. The key to understanding this paradox lies with the person of Solomon himsel£ Solomon represents a new kind of human being-a person who has broken free of the old ways of looking at God and our place in creation-a person whose consciousness has expanded beyond the prison universe of good gods and evil devils-a person who grasps the concept of a supreme consciousness so absolute that all forces and powers of creation (even those that to others appear evil and destructive) are pressed into service of the Great G Goodness. A true \"Solomon\" confidently knows his or her place in this new understanding of the divine scheme of things. A true Solomon is a proactive full citizen of both heaven and hell. A true Solomon is, in fact, encouraged by the Great G God Almighty to conjure the devils and put them to work doing good things! Are you confused? Don't be. You've just learned a fundamental secret of magick, and if you can free yourself from the old Chrisle­ mew way of looking at things, you are well on the way to becom­ ing a true Solomon yourself. Let me put it in less romantic terms. The nature of existence is consciousness. We are conscious be­ ings, each of us an integral part of the whole consciousness enchi­ lada. There are levels of consciousness (and realities) above the one in which we normally function, and there are levels of consciousness below. As yogis, mystics, and adept magicians can attest, we can ac­ cess the higher levels of consciousness in meditation or under other extraordinary circumstances. In those altered states we not only real­ ize the oneness of the supreme consciousness, we become the oneness of the supreme consciousness. Ultimately , this transcendent state is our true and natural state of being, our true self; it is who we really are. It is the \"heaven'' where we dwell when we have fulfilled our adventures pretending we are somehow disconnected from the su­ preme consciousness. Our ascent into higher consciousness is Solo­ mon's prayer to God-Solomon going up to be in the presence of Deity.

It is a place where the blind forces of nature (if left uncontrolled and undirected) happily dis­ charge their wild energy in explosive flashes that surge through the streets and sewers of our souls along the paths of least resistance. From our narrow, middle-world perspective, these blind forces ap­ pear to be destructive and evil. However, when they are harnessed and directed by an intelligence that is in tune with the highest levels of consciousness, they are transformed into organized units of the constructive power-loyal servants dutifully grunting and straining to perform all the heavy lifting in the universe. These are the demons who build the Temple of God-demons Solomon draws up from hell so he might bind them to work under his en­ lightened and organized direction. For the magician, archangels, angels, spirits, intelligences, and demons are merely colorful metaphors for the cascading hierarchy of all the natural forces and energies of the universe. This is the secret of Solomon. Once we've really pounded it into our heads, we recognize that we, too, have our unique place in the universe. Proactively operating halfway between the above and the below, we are poised to connect with and become charged by forces of the stratum of consciousness above us so that we may connect with, master, and direct the forces in the stratum beneath us. For the magician, the energy flow of the Solomonic formula moves perpetually upward. The magician's consciousness rises to connect with the divine consciousness (earth up to heaven) to be­ come attuned with the divine perfection; and the demon is made to rise up (hell up to earth) to become controlled and directed by the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"24 Chapter Two magician. From the demon's point of view, the magician is God, and as long as the magician's link with the \"above\" is true and sure, so too is the demon's link with the magician. The reason this kind of low magick has earned such an evil rep­ utation is because we so often hear of the terrible consequences to the life and sanity of the magician who violates this simple upward-flowing formula. I speak specifically of cases where in the course of the operation the spirit convinces the magician to strike some sort of bargain-a quid pro quo, perhaps a gift or sacrifice in exchange for service. 'Tll bring you a nice shiny penny ... but you've got to kill the vicar!\" Ask any Solomonic magician; he or she will most likely tell you the first thing a spirit will attempt to extract from you is a bargain of some kind, or an amendment to your original request. It is also the last thing you should consider doing. In all fairness to the poor infernal spirit, such haggling is a per­ fectly understandable characteristic of its unredeemed nature to try to negotiate itself free from your control. After all, it's been doing that in one way or another your entire life-otherwise you wouldn't be lacking the specific thing the spirit can provide you! But what if the formula is breached? What happens if, instead of raising the spirit up to the magician's level, the magician de­ scends to the demon's level? Shouldn't a competent magician be able to handle that? My answer is yes. A competent magician, a true Solomon, can handle that, but one must question his or her motives for setting out to do so. Is the object of the operation to cause some change to occur in hell? Or is the object of the operation to cause some change to occur in the magician's life here on earth? If the an­ swer is the latter (and I can't imagine it being otherwise), then it is probably wisest to bring the demon up to where its work is to be done, rather than casting oneself down to the hell of status quo where the spirit lounges comfortably in your screwed-up life-as- usual.

The worker's daily labor is done on the factory floor, not at the union hall. A year or two ago, a young man wrote me a letter asking if there was some way for him to use a black mirror or other magical method so that he might actually visit the realm where the Goetic entities dwell. I was in an odd mood, so I wrote him the following response, which I hope he took in the spirit it was intended: Dear (name withheld), A partial answer to your question would be another ques­ tion; that is ... \"What makes you think you are not already visiting the realm where the Goetic spirits dwell?\" I'm not kidding. If you wish to explore the realm where some of these fragments of consciousness dwell, I suggest that tonight, as an experiment, you go visit the sleaziest saloon in the roughest part of town about an hour before closing. Every untamed manifestation of the denizens of your Nephesh3 (the real spirits of your Goetia) will be poised to appear before your eyes. Buy them a round of drinks. They will toast you. Join them in their libations. Keep drinking and talking with them until you start to think their crude and bigoted jokes are really funny and you begin to actually agree with their views of politics and religion. Breathe in the infernal in­ cense of the cigarette smoke. Inhale the sacred perfume of body odor, spilled beer, and urinal cakes. Become one with the consciousness of the room. There! You are visiting hell on earth. 3 According to Qabalists, the Nephesh (animal soul) is the lowest of the four parts of the human soul. Above the Nephesh is the Ruach (the intellect), above that, the Neshamah (soul intuition), then, at the top, the Chiah (life force)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"26 Chapter Two Granted, you might have the magician's presence of mind (Ruach)4 to jot down some names and phone numbers and thus arrange to have one of these beasties meet you tomor­ row in the sober light of day so that you might hire him or her to mow your lawn, paint your house, or clean your septic tank. On the other hand, you could surrender your Ruach completely and stumble home with one of your new Goetic friends for the prospect of a vomit-covered stab at intimacy (and then wake up in the morning to find your­ self robbed, infected, or worse, looking every bit the demon yourself ). And so my friend, to answer your question specifically and on a practical level, yes, it is possible to visit the realm where the Goetic spirits dwell, and you won't need an ex­ pensive black obsidian mirror to do it.

Once I am confident that my motives are in harmony with the divine order and that I am the living representative of the Great G, I use that authority to summon a demon from the \"infernal regions\" into the magick Triangle. Once the demon appears (either tangibly or in my mind's eye), I give it its marching orders: \"Cause Mary to fall in love with me.\" Then I set it loose to do my bidding. Sounds corny and melodramatic, doesn't it? It is corny and melo­ dramatic! It's supposed to be corny and melodramatic. That's the romance and charm of the Solomonic magick art form. But it is easy to perform, and if all the factors of the formula are in place, it will work. However, it is likely to work in ways you might not expect. In the case of our example, let's not forget that Mary has a di­ vine-and potentially omnipotent-Will of her own. Unless she somehow recognizes the cosmic correctness of falling in love with me-unless she cooperates in this operation, I'm going to remain eternally snubbed. It is likely that Mary is not in love with me because I'm currently not the kind of person Mary is ready to fall in love with. It's not Mary who will have to change, it's me. If it is truly my Will to be Mary's lover, I will have to be transformed into the kind of person with whom Mary falls in love. Chances are, in the days and weeks following my evocation-in the ordinary course of my life-under circumstances that might appear to have nothing to do with my magical operation-! will be called upon to seriously play the part of a magician, and to play that part well. As a matter of fact, it is likely that (as the result of my Goetic evocation) I will find myself involved in some kind of adventurous struggle.

But if you're not, they make terrible bosses. They are easy to call up. They run amok in our lives as the fren­ zied menagerie of our own uncontrolled and undirected energies. When we willfully put one to work for us, we are in essence saying to the cosmos of consciousness, \"I will conquer and redeem this demon from hell, and the battle will take the form of a character­ building adventure. The adventure will transform the demon into a loyal and worthy employee, and transform me into a new and different person-a masterful person-the kind of person the object of my magical operation happens to-the kind of person Mary falls in love with.\" So bring it on, the magician shouts.

Magical intent has much in common with what we normally associate with the concept of willpower. It is, however, something much greater than the teeth-gritting power of concentration to force something to happen that was otherwise not going to hap­ pen. Magical intent is more a matter \"seeing\" what you truly want so dearly that your vision (indeed, your love of the vision) creates a living entity. Faced with the birth of this new cosmic citizen on the creative plane, the universe has no alternative but to rearrange conditions on the material plane to accommodate the complete manifestation of this now-inevitable object or event. You may find this hard to believe, but I learned the secret power of magical intent when I was six years old. The inspiration for my operation was my kindergarten classmate, Linda Kaufman. She was the most beautiful girl at George Washington Carver El­ ementary School in Lakewood, California. I always arranged to sit near her for rhythm band and finger painting. She seemed to en­ joy my antics, especially my sophisticated ability to bark like sea lion. I also had the pity factor working for me because the first few months of my kindergarten year I was forced by a serious hip con­ dition to walk with the aid of crutches. 2 I was insanely in love with her and each night as I lay in bed I fan­ tasized how I would take her to the movies on a real grown-up date. I correct myself: It was not a fantasy . It was a vision of a perfect mo­ ment of love-a perfect vision of love given-and of love received. 2 When I was three years old, I was diagnosed with Perthes' disease in my right hip. Perthes' is a serious bone malady that crumbles the topmost part of the thigh. In order to prevent complete disintegration of my hip socket, my doctor ordered me off my feet. When I started school, I was required to use crutches for the first few months. By the age of fourteen I was pronounced free of the disease."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"34 Chapter Three For months I rehearsed the scene in my imagination. I would be dressed in a suit and tie. I would somehow drive to her house and pick her up. I'd meet her parents. Her father would invite me into his den and offer me a cocktail (like they drank on the television show , Topper). Then Linda would appear in a pretty new dress and we'd drive off to the movie theatre. I'd buy us some popcorn. We'd find seats near the front and share our popcorn and giggle. Then, when the lights went down and the film began, she would take my arm (because I'd be too shy and polite to do it myself ) and put it around her shoulders, and she and I would snuggle dose for the whole movie. It was a lovely dream, and I was determined to make it happen. During Christmas vacation in 1954, I approached my mother in the kitchen and told her I wanted to take Linda Kaufman to the movies. I ordered her to call Linda's parents \"right now\" and ar­ range everything. It was a bold move. I was conjuring a danger­ ous demon. My mother could be unpredictably violent and cruelly abusive. It was such an odd little demand, however, that I think it took her completely off balance. I didn't have the slightest doubt that she would obey my command. She stared at me for a mo­ ment, then picked up the phone and called Linda's mother. They laughed and gossiped for what seemed like hours. When she hung up, it was a done deal. New Year's Day 1955 was a Sunday-the perfect day for Linda and me to see the new biblical epic, The Silver Chalice.3 Mom and my older brother Marc (he and his date would be our chaperones) waited in the car while I, dressed smartly in my Sunday school sports jacket and clip-on tie, knocked on the door of the Kaufman residence. Her dad answered and invited me into his den and told me to sit down. 3 Warner Brother s, released Christmas Da y , 1954; starring Paul Newman, Virginia Mayo, and Jack Palance.

Linda soon appeared with her mother and spun around to show off her new dress. I was sure the ginger ale was taking effect. Everything, almost to the last detail, was happen­ ing exactly as I envisioned-and it didn't stop there. At the theater, with my brother and his date following discreetly behind us, I bought popcorn and Linda and I found our seats near the front. We giggled and munched, and when the lights dimmed and the big Warner Brothers shield beamed at us from the silver screen, Linda Kaufman, my goddess, the love of my life, grabbed my arm and put it around her shoulders, where it remained locked in sweaty, painful ecstasy for the next two hours and twenty-two minutes. At that moment, I knew that my mind, my dreams had the power to make things happen. I knew there was some kind of liv­ ing intelligence that hears the yearnings of my heart-a being-a god with the power to bring into reality anything I imagine-any­ thing I intend. However, it would take me the better part of the next fifty years to understand that the nature of that power is Love, and that without that vital ingredient in the recipe, my magick would always fall short of perfection."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"FOUR 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 FAMILY SECRETS In parts of Melanesia, where matrilif!Y is the rule, magic is inherited from father to son; in Wales it seems that mothers handed it down to sons, while fathers bequeathed it to the daughters.

MARCEL MAUSS, A General Theory of Magic Some people in the magical community place a great deal of im­ portance on their magical ancestry. This is not surprising because the romance and mythos of our spiritual art is certainly enhanced by the thought that we might in fact be a special breed set apart from ordinary people1 by the very blood in our veins. I believe that in and of itself, this attitude can be harmless enough. After all, who of us wouldn't like to think that we are (even by tradition) \"Muggles,\" as J. K. Rowling, creator of the wildly popular Harry Potter books, might call them. 37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 Chapter Four descended from a Merlin or a Morgan La Fey, a Cagliostro or an Aleister Crowley? Taken too serious ly, however, such preoccupation with magical bloodlines can easily seduce us into blindly abandon­ ing our common sense and embracing a form of magical elitism as foolish and dangerous as any other name- y our-own suprema cy . Please don't misunderstand me. I fully recognize the fact that a few of us actually have parents who studied and practiced magick or witchcraft, and that they too may have had parents who did the same. For most of us, however, the \"magick\" we've inherited from our parents or grandparents is something less overtly magical than that determined by our family's participation in generational covens, satanic cults, or secret initiatory societies. In fact, I believe that we can discover more about the magical \"blood\" of our ances­ tors by simply examining their lives and characters than we can by analyzing their professed spiritual interests. I'd wager that if each of us gave it a little thought, we could find the magician in our parents and grandparents and be able to trace that magick (whether for good or ill) to our own lives and personal­ ities. I certainly can . .A5 a matter of fact, if you wish to truly become a wise and well-rounded magician, you will sooner or later have come to terms with both the good and evil locked in the DNA of your own family secrets.

If not, you might at least learn a bit more about me.

In her mind, curi­ osity and education would only open the door to the devil's wiles and tempt her to doubt the one true way of blind faith that was pounded into her as a child growing up on the unforgiving prai­ rie of western Nebraska. This devotional focus could have been a powerful spiritual tool in her life if it were not for the fact that there was not an object for her devotion. She did not seem particu­ larly devoted to Jesus or interested in the spiritual significance of the passion of his life. She was thoroughly content with the con­ cept that if she unquestioningly believed that he, as an historical character, died on the cross, came back to life three days later, and then he flew up into the sky forty days after that, then she would go to heaven-and everyone who didn't believe those things would be justly punished in a blazing hell for eternity. Even as a child, I believe she delighted more in the thought of the damnation of un­ believers than in the promise of sweet salvation for believers. Belief in such doctrines isn't necessarily cause for criticism or condemnation. Indeed, I've known many people that hold very similar religious beliefs-people with loving hearts who possess deep compassion for their families, friends, neighbors, and com­ munities. But with all respect due to the woman who brought me into this dimension, I am sad to report that my mother was not one of these people. For her, this small exercise in intolerant reli­ gious absolutism only freed her to focus her entire energies upon the one and only object of her true spiritual devotion-herself. She was supernaturally psychic and possessed a power of person­ ality so magnetic that it captured and dominated everyone around her. This made her initially attractive to others, and in social envi­ ronments, very popular. Time after time during her ninety-four-year incarnation, casual acquaintances became her unsuspecting vic­ tims, falling voluntarily under her spell only to later find themselves stung, paralyzed and hopelessly entangled in her web of emotional"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 Chapter Four servitude. She was a charismatic dictator who ironically had no mas­ ter plan other than to create explosions of emotional turmoil in the lives of those around her and then to draw energy from all that tur­ moil. After thirty-three years of suffering her soul-draining dramas, my father died at the age of sixty-two. Twenty-three years later, the same fate awaited a second husband. Her magick touch would also prove fatal to the health, careers, marriages, and relationships of scores of relatives, friends, and well-meaning strangers. Ironically , she had (at times) a great sense of humor-and hu­ mor is the inheritance from her I most treasure. Humor continues to help me cope with and (hopefully) transmute the darker magick she bequeathed me. Here are a few passages from the eulogy I de­ livered at her funeral. I may sound a bit disrespectful in the short clip below, but the pastor and congregation of her church certainly didn't think so. They knew my mother too well. The laughter in the sanctuary was a healthy discharge of emotion for all of us.

I sucked her milk for less than a year; then she sucked my blood for the next fifty-nine. Up to a point, I think it's part of the natural order of things. We all live off each other in one way or another.

Mom loved people ... but she hated all other living things. You'd never catch her petting a dog or stroking a cat. She strove to kill all insects both inside and outside of the house. She didn't even care too much for flowers because of the chance they might harbor an insect. You never wanted to take her to a restaurant to which you ever intended to return. She ran waiters and waitresses ragged ... and if she didn't like the food, she would often call them to the table, take the food out of her mouth and say, \"Honey ... look at this ... would you eat that?\" She would then try to get them to eat some of it before send­ ing it back. Toward the end of the meal, she always loudly announced (within earshot of the haggard waitress) that she didn't believe in tipping. She always stole the napkins. To say she was strong-willed and self-centered would be a colossal understatement. If I were to use the title of a popular song to describe the character of this amazing per­ son, it would have to be Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\"! As a matter of fact, when she was in her late seventies, she demonstrated how true this was by causing herself and her entire party to be kicked out of a Frank Sinatra concert in Long Beach because she refused to stop loudly chatting with her friends during his performance. Sadly, I must give her mixed reviews as far as her parenting skills were concerned. She subscribed to the old-school phi­ losophy that states a mother should never whip a child un­ less she is red-in-the-face in the throes of a violent blind rage and completely out of control.

He was a quiet and moody Scorpio given to bouts of depression. He liked to drink during the years before I was born, but Mom's willingness to drive to his favorite after-work watering hole and physically pull him off his barstool and out to the car put an end to that. Dad didn't talk much about his parents and family, other than to say he had one sister and three half-sisters, all older than he. To my knowledge, he never met any of his grandparents. His father came from France; his mother came from England. She'd been mar­ ried once before and had three girls from that union. Her father was an inspector for Scotland Yard who died during the events of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The only thing we know about Grandma DuQuette's mother was a story that I find somewhat unnerving-something that m y mother didn't tell me until a week or so before she died in 2007. I was almost sixty years old when I heard the tale. I now know why she waited. My father was born and raised in Los Angeles, but had trav­ eled to western Nebraska in the late 1930s to drill exploratory oil wells. He met my mother-to-be (a waitress at a diner) and they married in the little town of Chapel, Nebraska, in 1940. When the newlyweds returned home to California, my father was stunned to discover that while he been away, his father was dead and buried,3 and his mother lay dying in a hospital. When they visited the poor woman, she asked to talk alone with her new daughter-in- law. She asked my mother-to-be if she planned to have children. When Mom answered in the affirmative, the old woman pleaded with her to reconsider. \"Don't have his children. We are cursed! There is evil in our blood.\" She then tearfully confessed that her own mother was a \"witch.\" 3 Dad's sisters refused to reveal his father's burial site."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 Chapter Four Now, I think here I must pause and point out for this woman born in the late 1800s, the word \"witch\" did not refer to a per­ son who wholesomely embraced the life-affirming, earth-centered worship of today's Neopagan movement. Instead, it referred to someone who delighted in doing evil things for evil's sake. She then went on to relate how her mother fed on the hate and fear and misery of others-how she would sit on the steps of her London flat and curse passer sby, especially pregnant women, then later delight in reports of their miscarriages and deaths dur­ ing childbirth. She poisoned dogs and cats. She spread vile rumors about neighbors and relatives for no other purpose than that of ruining lives. So hated and feared was she in the neighborhood that no child was allowed to play with her children, and if not for the fact that her husband was a policeman, the family would have been run out of the neighborhood. None of my father's four sisters had any children, perhaps warded off by tales of evil blood. My mother, on the other hand, was a different creature altogether. When I asked her if Grandma DuQuette's warning hadn't scared her, she coldly answered, \"No. Where would you and Marc be if I had listened? I wasn't going to let that old witch tell me what to do.\" I think in this case Mom's magick served a very good purpose. It dug its heels in and triumphed over fear and superstition (albeit with a heavy dose of fear and superstition of its own). Even though my father wouldn't live the luckiest of lives, even though my brother and I have had our share of ups and downs, I don't believe that any of the DuQuettes who sprang from this strange woman's loins are cursed with anything more sinister than our own human shortcomings. However, this unsettling story now makes me re­ call that for my entire childhood, whenever I did something my mother disapproved of, she would shake her finger at me and tell me, in deadly earnest, that I was \"possessed with the devil.\" I must also confess that turbing, dark, and hateful wronged-when someone of or observe the mistrea � country or my planet-! monstrous bloodcurdling ple if they were at my mercy I have to use every weapon · back to calm sanity.

In fact, my father was blessed with a most kind and noble charact er. It was ob­ vious he stayed married to Mom for the welfare and safety of Marc and me. His spirituality was centered upon a simple belief in a ge­ neric \"Supreme Being\" (after all-he was a Freemason4) and in the fundamental goodness of human beings.5 He took the time to in­ still in his sons a confidence that we could do anything we put our minds to. He taught us the magick of dreams and imagination, and that it was possible to work to make our dreams come true. Like a good Scorpio Freemason, he taught us by means of magi­ cal secrets. So now, after you have patiently endured my ponder­ ous Freudian excursions into my mother's sorcery, I finally come to the true family secrets the title of this chapter initially promised you. Dad's library contained a number of Masonic books, many illus­ trated with exotic, mystic symbols. When my brother and I asked 4 In most countries, Freemasons must profess belief in a Supreme Being . 5 Freemasons are also taught rhat \" ... a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for the best, most salutary and most beneficent purposes.\" This doctrine is in striking opposition to rhe Christian doctrines of Original Sin and the Total Depravity of Man."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 Chapter Four what they meant, he would only tease us by saying, \"It's a secret. If you want, when you grow up you can try to join the Masons and find out.\" He gently instilled in us both an awe and respect for se­ cret knowledge. So when I was faced with the normal problems of growing up, I could go to Dad and he would give me a magick \"se­ cret\" to dealing with them. These were secrets not to be shared with anyone else-not Mom; not my brother; no one! My brother and I were unaware at the time that the other was also getting his own secrets from Dad. Years after his death we compared notes and dis­ covered that, while similar, each of our \"secrets\" had been uniquely composed.6 It's been many years since Dad passed away . I don't think he would mind if I'd share just a couple of the magical secrets that have helped me throughout the years. • The first secret was not a secret per se; it was a command­ ment, a prime directive: \"Your name is a magick name. Never change your name or the spelling of your name.\" I don't know why he named me Lon Milo, but one of my earliest memories of Dad was his insistence that he chose my name very carefully , that it was a magick name, and that I was never to change it, never to change the spelling or the capitaliza­ tion. I continue to obey the prime directive.7 • The Secret to foiling asleep at night was the first bona fide se­ cret Dad taught me. It was a two-part secret, very simple (but I could tell no one how I do it). First, I was to say my prayers. Now , Dad was practically an agnostic, and God to him was a generic cosmic abstraction.

Nevertheless, it was important that before I go to sleep I should acknowledge Deity and thank it for the blessings of my life and ask for its continued protection, guidance, and blessing upon every­ thing I do. He said the best prayer was one that just came out of my own heart, but ifl couldn't make up a prayer of my own, the Lord's Prayer would work until I got the hang of it. After saying my prayer, I was to relax and make up an imaginary adventure (with me as the main character) about anything that pleased me-the more fanciful the better. There was only one rule to this part of the secret: each night's adventure must include me doing at least one thing that is impossible to do in real life. I had to think of a new impossible act every night. I didn't know why, but I instinctively knew that this was one of the coolest things in the world you could encourage a kid to do. • The Secret to stopping nightmares was perhaps the most overtly magical of Dad's secrets. Like most kids, I had my share of childhood nightmares. One night when I was about seven years old I woke up screaming and crying. It seems a monster had just eaten my brother Marc and that it had hold of my foot. Without turning on the light, Dad came into my room and sat on the bed. He told me everything was okay and that everybody had bad dreams now and again. He encouraged me to lie back down, but I refused to put my head on the same spot on the pillow where the bad dream came from. He then said the most curious thing. \"No. You want to go back into the dream and make the monster go away.\" He then told me that whenever I am uncomfortable in a dream, I only have to pronounce my own name backwards, \"NOL,\" and the monster or the problem would disappear. I trusted Dad,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 Chapter Four so I put my head back on the nightmare pillow and tried to re-create the dreaded moment. Sure enough-! was back in the dream with my foot in the monster's mouth. I spoke the magick word, NOL! The monster opened its mouth in fear and it dissolved into thin air. I was very impressed with my new secret. I would use it countless times. Furthermore, once I learned I could take control of my dreams, I learned I could \"go\" places in dreams and even live out some of those \"im­ possible\" feats of wonder. This is a skill that is very important to a magician. It is also very important to be able to resolve a problem in its own dimension rather than trying to run away from it by escaping into another. • The Secret of learning was a simple affirmation that I was to say under my breath as I walked to school each morning: \"The Secret of learning is to do the best I can at all times; and always do a little better than I think I can. \"I wish I could say this made me a model student, but I cannot.

I do not. What I do possess, after all this time, is a great deal of magical ex­ perience; and experience is (or at least can be) the breeding ground of wisdom. Naturally, that potentiality disintegrates if I can't ac­ curately recall and evaluate these experiences so that I might apply their lessons to the present state of my magical development. For this reason, I believe it is vitally important for magicians to keep a written record of their exploits. As I mentioned earlier, in order to write this book, I have dug deep into dusty boxes and storage bins to extract and organize the buried chronicles of my magical adven­ tures and misadventures. For me, reviewing old magical diaries is never a pleasant expe­ rience. Every time I open and read one of my ancient journals, I am paralyzed by a combination of nauseating embarrassment and amazement. I grit my teeth and squirm as I relive the events, the thoughts, delusions, and presumptions that occupied that shallow, self-centered, naive, ego-blinded young fool who gawked back at me from the mirrors of yesterday. My singular consolation is the fact that I've survived to rejoice, \"Thank God I'm not like that any longer!\" Painful as the experience is, reviewing my magical records affords me the opportunity to chart the general trajectory of my spiritual evolution. I have even been able, in several instances, to pinpoint the exact minute my magical efforts (high or low) have actually caused change to occur in conformity with my Will-times that have dramatically altered the course of my life, and the lives of oth­ ers.

DOn I set in motion thirty-five My Planetary Talismans 51 About a year before my traumatic evocation of the demon Oro bas, 2 I was enmeshed in what I will politely describe as a crisis in my life. I was twenty-six years old, married, with a two-year-old son. I was desperately trying to wean myself from a very unhealthy career as a musician/recording artist, and struggling to bring some semblance of stability and direction to my life. Several years prior to this, to address an intense spiritual hunger, I entered the initia­ tory world of the Western mysteries-specifically the degree work of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, The Traditional Martinist Order (TMO), and the Builders of the Adytum (B.O. T.A.). As fascinating as my studies were, they were just that-studies. My life needed changing. I didn't want to merely study magick; I wanted to perform magick. But what kind of magick? I had heard some pretty scary things about the evils of magick, so I was desper­ ate to find a safe place to start. Early in January 1975, in an old and stuffy little occult book­ store in North Long Beach, I purchased How to Make and Use Tal­ ismanS' by Israel Regardie. 4 I trusted Regardie, having read several of his classic magical texts. This little book, however, was different. It was actually a how-to book of practical magick. Regardie's sane and straightforward explanation of the fundamentals of talismanic magick instantly dispelled my superstitious doubts. His generous of­ fering of charts, diagrams, and illustrations (which I promptly cop­ ied and pasted into my magical diary) made it a treasure-trove of easy-to-use information. I couldn't wait to graduate from student to 2 See chapter 1. 3 Originally published by Sangreal.

We eventually met in the late 1970s and became friends."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 Chapter Five practitioner. After reading it through several times, I knew exactly where I needed to begin. Regardie suggests that planetary talismans5 can be helpful in over­ coming unfavorable aspects that might be affiicting one's astrological chart. That really drew my attention. I knew I had difficult aspects in my natal chart, so I contacted my brother, Marc6 (the astrologer), to see which planet could use a little extra help. ''All of them,\" he coldly informed me. But, because it rules my chart, he suggested I first try to make better friends with the Moon. With Regardie's little book as my guide, I started gathering sym­ bols for a Lunar talisman on January 23. At midnight on January 27, after anointing it with drops of dew that had formed in the moon­ light falling on my 1952 Chrysler, I consecrated it with as much cer­ emony as I was capable of devising. My Moon talisman was the most beautiful thing I had ever made with my own two hands. It was a double-circle model made of card stock. I extracted the sigils of the Lunar spirit and intelligence from the moon kamea7 in the book and carefully drew them in silver paint against a field of deep violet8 drawing ink on the front and back of one of the circles. On the other circle, I painted a silver 5 Sometimes called amulets, talismans are small objects often bearing magical symbols and/or words created with magical intent and charged with a specific spiritual force.

The answer came (as so many impor­ tant answers do) while I was taking a shower. I should make all seven of the planetary talismans! For the next four months, with the help ofRegardie's little book, and using my ever-improving artistic and magical skills, I created and consecrated a full set of seven planetary talismans. Each one was more beautiful and worshipful than its predecessor. The order in which I created them was dictated by the severity of the plan­ etary afflictions in my natal chart. I consecrated the Mars talisman on February 6. By then I had taught myself the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram and Hexagram, which from then on be­ came an integral part of my talisman consecration rituals. Jupiter was next on February 27 (Constance's birthday), followed by Venus exactly one month later. The Venus talisman evoked the most remarkable reactions. My dreams were filled with vividly erotic encounters, the likes of which I had not experienced since adoles­ cence.

The next day, I started to collect the symbols for my seventh and last planetary talisman. Sol took ten days to complete. I consecrated it during a lunar eclipse10 that took place on May 24. My arsenal of planetary talismans was finally complete. Throughout this entire talisman-making period and the months that followed, life at the DuQuette house continued to be a litany of chaos, frustration, and despair. In an attempt to make money doing something other than singing in saloons, I accepted a house­ painting job and we moved to the San Gabriel Valley. As it turned out, I would never be paid for my (admittedly inept) labor and we found ourselves stranded in La Verne, the smoggiest town in Southern California, with no job and no money. July 11 dawned with the prospect of the worst birthday of my life. About 11: 15 in the morning, I shut myself in my bedroom temple. I lit a candle and put it on my altar top. I halfheartedly performed the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram and sat down and tried to meditate. I couldn't. To cheer myself, I removed my cherished talismans from their bags and lingered on every detail of their splendor. As I turned them in my fingers, I whispered the words of power and the names of the gods, angels, and spirits inscribed on each one of them. Finally, as if to bring order to my otherwise unordered universe, I placed the Sun talis­ man in the center of the altar top and surrounded it with the six remaining planets in their proper hexagram positions.11 They were so beautiful-so perfect. 10 I thought it would be \"heavy\" and magical to do a magical operation during a lunar eclipse.

It was almost noon and time to rejoin Constance and little Jean-Paul for birthday cake. They were both giggling in the kitchen. Their laughter made me giggle too. And then, in a cliched moment-an epiphany worthy of a Frank Capra film-I realized that there were lots of perfect things in my life. In fact, at that moment I was the luckiest man on earth. My melancholy lifted. I credited the talismans for my change of mood. As I gazed at them there on the altar top, I realized that they would never be more beautiful or meaningful to me than they were at that moment. In just a few weeks, their colors would start to fade, the inks would crack, the edges wear. In a few years, I would probably lose some of them, and those that remained would shrivel into crumbling bits of brittle card stock. I wished I could preserve them forever just like this-at the zenith of their strength-in an eternal environment where their beauty would never be effaced-a place where their power could never diminish. These talismans were no good to me sitting on my altar top or tucked away in their sterile little bags. I needed them to literally become part of me. No! More than that-I must use their magick to make me someone else-someone new. I must reabsorb my pre­ cious planetary children and plant them in the womb of my own soul.

RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD The creation and ritual \"consummation'' of my seven planetary talismans launched me on a wondrous magical adventure that I am only now {at the dawn of my reflective years) beginning to put in perspective. In the years that immediately followed that birth­ day immolation, I would unexpectedly undergo magical initia­ tion at the hands of some of the last surviving personal students of Aleister Crowley, find myself leading a magical lodge, and become friends with many of the brightest magical minds in the world, including Robert Anton Wilson, Christopher S.

Among the subjects that captured my imagination (and spare time) in the first two decades of my journey was tarot and its re­ lationship (at least in the minds of hermetic magicians) to the Qabalah. I realize that probably not everyone reading this book is familiar with tarot, but it is highly likely that many of you are. Those of you who read the cards for yourself or for others prob­ ably have a favorite deck that you've used for a long time-a deck you trust; a deck you've charged with your own personal essence and vibrations; a deck you've empowered through years of re­ peated use. If you do, it's probably scuffed and dog-eared. Its edges are most likely filthy gray from years of skin-oil and dirt. It just might be a biohazard! I know many tarot readers whose cards are so flaccid they hardly make any noise when they are shuffled. But, unattractive as your well-worn cards may be, you probably view them as old friends. You have a history together. You trust them. They are alive-perhaps more alive than you can imagine. My first deck of tarot cards was one I painted myself as part of the marvelous Builders of the Adytum (B.O .T.A.)2 Tarot/Qabalah correspondence course back in the early 1970s. It was sort of a paint-by-numbers project (only without the numbers), and I had worked on only the twenty-two trumps. I didn't attempt to read or divine with those cards because the lessons cautioned that one could cripple oneself spiritually by using the cards to tell fortunes. I took the warning seriously-for a while. The deck I first used to read the cards was an early edition of the Thoth Tarot3 deck that I bought in 1972 at Pickwick Book­ store in Costa Mesa.

I would eventually come to realize that the creation of The Tarot of Ceremonial Magick was really a con­ tinuation and elaborate expansion of the magical operation that I started years earlier by creating my seven planetary talismans-for indeed, the tarot is one magnificent and complex talisman con­ taining within its matrix all the usual suspects of the Western her­ metic and magical traditions. Please don't think that I am suggest­ ing that, in order to successfully use the cards as a divinatory tool, a person has to be aware of all the astrological and magical virtues of the seventy-eight cards. In fact, I'd wager that the majority of tarot readers in the world couldn't care less about the underlying magical principles, forces, and spirits inherent in the cards. Yes. I said spirits-but I'll get to that in a moment. Because it is built upon fundamental Qabalistic principles, tarot is in a very real way the graphic DNA of the hermetic arts that are also Qabalah-based, including astrology, alchemy, and several varieties of ceremonial magick. As such, tarot is (or should be) of special interest to magicians and would-be magicians. If we could magically peek just below the slick surface and col­ ored inks of tarot cards, we would see that every pack is a tidy little block of flats that houses a teeming world of angels, spirits, and de­ mons. For centuries an odd assortment of obsessed holy guys (who obviously had a lot of time on their hands) identified, fingerprinted, and booked these spirit creatures, and with zealous and anal-reten­ tive attention to detail, categorized them by their elemental, plan­ etary, zodiacal, astrological, and other traditional correspondences. 4 Lon and Constance DuQuette, Tarot of Ceremonial Magick: A Pictorial Syntheses of Three Great Pillars of Magick (Astrology, Enochian Magick, Goetia).

This infor­ mation has always been implied by the structure of the tarot but, until I designed my deck, this information (or at least the major landmarks of this information) was never overtly displayed on a deck of tarot cards themselves. I wanted to make flash cards of per­ tinent data relating to Astrology and the two most widely practiced varieties of magick (Enochian5 and Goetia6), and that's just what I did-first in crude, hand-drawn notecards for the edification of my Monday night magick class, then later in the more heroic published deck A couple of weeks before the first edition of my deck went on sale worldwide, I did the very best I could to magically charge the cards by invoking, evoking, or otherwise magically activating their spirit tenants. If you have a moment, I'd like to tell you how it was done. The afternoon I opened the UPS package and took out the first box of my tarot cards was one of the most magical moments of my life. The project had taken the better part of five years from design to manifestation. Oh, how I savored the moment! I sat down in my big papa-chair and turned the box over and over in my hands. I closed my eyes and held it up to my nose and inhaled the ex­ otic incense of plastics and inks and resins. I tried to picture in my mind the factory in faraway Belgium where they were printed, cut, and packaged. I tried to imagine how all ten thousand boxes 5 Enochian magick is a magical system developed in the late sixteenth century by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley.

A deck of tarot cards is a wondrous thing. According to tradi­ tion, tarot was designed, organized, and arranged to be a perfect re­ flection of the cosmic principles that create and sustain all things in heaven and earth.8 Tarot is a telescope through which we can gaze at the great macrocosmic world of deity; and it's a microscope by which we can dissect the tiniest secrets of nature and our own souls. But, unless we are somehow cognizant of this Qabalistic perfection, either intellectually or intuitively , tarot is just seventy-eight pieces of printed card stock. Sitting there in my big chair, I was paralyzed with the realization that this was a rare and magical moment. It would be weeks be­ fore the cards would be on the market-weeks before other hands would touch them and other eyes behold the images. For this golden moment, the deck I held in my hand was the virgin mother d eck -the virgin father d eck - the immaculate archetype of all the decks of my Tarot of Ceremonial Ma g ick that would ever be printed and sold in the future. For a magician, this was an once-in-a-lifetime opport unity. I had the chance to charge and attune this mother deck with all the powers and properties that lay hidden in all tarot decks. I had the chance to literally invoke upon (and evoke into) this deck all the spiritual forces, aspects of deity, archangels, angels, intelligences, 7 A phenomenon that often characterizes spirit communication.

I grabbed my magical diary and a pen and quickly composed an oath that encapsulated my magical intent for this operation. I fired up some charcoal in the censer and covered it with pure frank­ incense. As the sweet-smelling smoke rose to the heavens, so did my ninety-three-word oath: I, Adeo Sat Bene, 12 Zealator and Ninth Degree, swear to the Supreme What-It-Is of the Universe that I will charge this deck of tarot cards and every other deck of this de­ sign that currently exists, or will exist in the future, with the force of every spiritual entity in the universe that I am capable of conjuring and binding into it.

With the banishing, purification, and oath out of the way, I got down to business. I would start by charging the fifty-six cards of the tarot's Lesser Arcana: The four Aces (Ace of Wands, Ace of Cups, Ace of Swords, Ace of Disks) the sixteen Court Cards (four per suit-a Knight, a Queen, a Prince, a Princess), and thirty-six Small Cards or pips (2 through 10 of each suit). In the middle of the floor, I assembled several items of the elab­ orate magical equipment associated with the Enochian magick of Dr. John Dee.

But, in order for this part of the story to make any sense at all to anyone who is completely unfamiliar with Enochian magick, I must at least point out a few landmarks of the system-particularly those that modern Eno­ chian magicians refer to as \"Elemental Tablets.\" There are four of them; one each for fire, water, air, and earth. Each Elemental Tab­ let is made up of 156 squares or truncated pyramids arranged in a large tablet twelve squares wide by thirteen squares high. Each pyramid is lettered with the one-letter-name of an elemental angel. Combined with one, two, or many other letters within the tablet, an almost infinite number of larger and more complex angels are generated, forming an elaborate (and painfully logical) hierarchy of elemental angels. It is a breathtakingly elegant system, and can be the subject of a lifetime of study . This system parallels the hermetic structure of the tarot. The four Elemental Tablets are the equivalent of the four Aces of the tarot. For example; put the Ace of Wands under a magick micro­ scope and you will see the entire Enochian Elemental Tablet of Fire teeming with the living hierarchy of angels that inhabit it. Do the same with the Ace of Cups and see the Elemental Tablet of Water; the Ace of Swords for the tablet of Air, and the Ace of Disks for the tablet of Earth. 13 But I have written a very nice introduction to the subject that I am not shy about urging you to read.

Each of the Enochian Elemental Tablets is subdivided into four equal-sized quarters by a cross made up of two vertical columns and one row. This cross is made up of thirty-six lettered squares (more on that in a moment). Each of the four quarters created by this cross is assigned to one of the four elements. For example: the fire tablet has a quarter for fire (fire of fire), one for water (water of fire), one for air (air of fire) and one for earth (earth of fire). The Elemental tablets of water, air, and earth are divided in exactly the same way. These subquarters (often called subangles) of the four Elemental Tablets are the equivalent to the sixteen Court Cards of the tarot. The Knights are fiery, the Queens watery, the Princes airy, and the Princesses are earthy aspects of their respective suits. 14 For example: put the Knight of Wands (fire of fire) under a magick microscope and behold the fire quarter of the Elemental Tablet of fire and all the Enochian angels living inside it. Look at the Queen of Disks (water of earth) with the magick microscope and see the water quarter of the Elemental tablet (Ace) of earth, etc. I'm sure you are getting the picture. 14 Or in many standard decks, the fire, water, air, and earth Court Cards are King, Queen, Knight, and Page. which are equivalent to The remaining cards of the Cards (or pips), the 2s utru ugn Small Cards also are populated spirits, angels, and demons, hierarchical families dictated zodiacal year.

I separated the twenty-two trumps (greater arcana15) from the fifty­ six cards of the lesser arcana. 16 I would start by charging the lesser arcana. I placed each Ace in the center of its natural tablet (the Ace of Wands on the Fire tablet, the Ace of Cups on the Water tablet, the Ace of Swords on the Air tablet, the Ace of Disks on the Earth tablet). These lettered tablets, which contain the names of liter­ ally thousands of Enochian elemental angels and spirits, are repro­ duced on the Aces of my deck. I then placed the sixteen Court Cards upon the appropriate sub­ angles of the four Elemental Ta blets. These lettered subangles with their specific hierarchy of spirits are also reproduced in colorful de­ tail on the Court Cards of the deck. Finally , I arranged the thirty-six Small Cards (nine per tablet) on their appropriate squares of the Grand Cross area of each tablet. 15 The twenty-two cards of the greater arcana are associated with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and are often referred to as the \"Trumps.\" They are the cards most people think of when they hear the term \"tarot cards.\" In the Tarot of Ceremonial Magick they are numbered 0-21 in the following order: Fool, Magus, High Priestess, Empress, Emperor, Hierophant, Lovers, Chariot, Adjustment, Her­ mit, Fortune, Lust, Hanged Man, Death, Art, Devil, Tower, Star, Moon, Sun, Aeon, Universe. 16 The fifty-six cards of the lesser arcana are divided into the four elemental suits: Wands/Fire; Cups/Water; Swords/ Air; Disks/Earth.

Then I intoned, in turn, the first eighteen Calls in the Enochian an­ gelic language. Over the years I had intoned the Calls many times, but never all at once. It felt very strange, and put me in an altered state of consciousness that intensified as the two-day-and-night rit­ ual would proceed.

I went to bed without banishing in order to let the fifty-six cards of the lesser arcana \"fry'' all night upon the fully activated Eno­ chian Tablets. In the morning (Saturday), before getting back to magick, I outlined the rest of the marathon ceremony in my jour­ nal. There was still a lot of Enochian work ahead of me. For each of the sixteen Court Cards, I had to call upon the three major an­ gels (two God Names and Kerub of the Calvary Crosses) and four minor angels (the four servitors of each subangle). As the tablets were already activated from the night before, this took less than ninety minutes. After that, the ceremonies turned classically Qabalistic. I called into the thirty-six Small Cards (the 2s-10s of each suit) the seventy­ two Angels of the Shemhamphorash, whose names appear on the cards. This took more time than I imagined. I had to first lay out the cards, then intone, in order, each angel name and recite the Psalm that tradition holds is expressive of the duties assigned to each par­ ticular angel.

It's not that they're evil per se-just blind, unbalanced forces that do the heavy lifting in the universe. Like heavy machinery , they can be dangerous to the untrained operator , and very helpful to the experienced (or lucky). These critters are divided into thirty-six day spirits and thirty-six night spirits, so naturally , I would have to evoke thirty-six in the daytime and thirty-six at night. It was nearly noon on Saturday when I started the evocation of the day spirits. I first cast the circle and triangle that would be necessary for that kind of operation. As each of the thirty-six Small Cards plays host to one day spirit and one night spirit, I spread all thirty-six cards in the Triangle together (a tight fit) and evoked, charged, and dismissed the thirty-six day spirits in turn without having to leave the circle. My charge was the same for each spirit: \"You will be helpful, obedient, and protective to me and everyone who uses this card and its replicas.\" Even with this highly abbreviated procedure, it took nearly four hours. I broke twice for coffee and bathroom breaks and finished with the evocation of the day spirits just before sunset. I found ripe avocados, corn chips, and cheese in the house, so I made a demonically huge mess in the kitchen then gorged on nachos and guacamole (the fast-food favorite of California magi­ cians whose wives are out of town). Sated, and a little sick to my stomach, I turned on a tape ofRespighi's Pines of Rome and took a long early-evening nap. I got up and showered about 11 :00 p.m. and repeated the pro­ cedure for the thirty-six night spirits. I finished about four o'clock Sunday morning. By then I was in such a state of wild-eyed exalta­ tion and exhaustion that those last thirty-six spirits were the most polite and cooperative beasties I have ever conjured. Still, I barely had enough energy to put the cards back in their box and banish the temple before I crashed."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"7 4 Chapter Six After a crazy night of the most bizarre and amusing dreams, I lounged around late Sunday morning, then drove to the deli and treated myself to a fresh onion bagel before forcing myself back to work. I was getting really tired of doing magick. The twenty-two Trumps would be the last cards to get the full treatment. I sat on the living room floor with Aleister Crowley's 77717 and a chart listing the traditional archangels, angels, and qli­ photic demons of the signs of the zodiac, and surrounded myself in a magical circle made entirely of tarot cards. I placed the three elemental Trumps (Fool Hanged Man, and Aeon) nearest me in the center. Around these, I placed the seven planetary Trumps (Ma­ gus, Priestess, Empress, Fortune, Tower, Sun, and Universe). Circling the planets I spread out the twelve zodiacal trumps (Emperor, Hi­ erophant, Lovers, Lust, Hermit, justice, Death, Art, Devil Star, and Moon) all in a great circle surrounding me and the other Trumps. Around that circle I laid out the thirty-six Small Cards in a huge circle that required me to move some more furniture just to fit it on the floor. Each of the Small Cards represents 10 degrees of the zodiacal year, so I placed them in order starting with the 2 of Wands (O to 10 degrees Aries) in the nine o'clock position and moving counterclockwise, finally ending with the 10 of Cups (20 to 30 degrees Pisces). Finally , I positioned the Aces and Court Cards outside the great outer circle according to the quarters they rule. Then I carefully tiptoed into the very center of my tarot mandala and began my final magical chore. Using the tables from 777, I lumbered through my butchered Hebrew pronunciation of the appropriate divine names, archan­ gels, angels, spirits, and intelligences for each element, planet, and zodiac sign. It was really ... really boring!-so boring that it actu- 1 7 Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley, revised edi­ tion (York Beach, ME: Red Wheel/Weiser Books., 1986). ally induced a state of co � a dull rhythmic electric �· tually be the key to Qabalistic thinks so!)

(Could fatigue and boredom ac­ tually be the key to Qabalistic illumination? Constance certainly thinks so!) When I was done, I just sat there and buzzed like I've never buzzed before. And so did the cards. I was physically drained, emotionally gratified, psychically raw, and more than a bit insane. Even though I was completely sick of performing magick, I had an epiphany concerning the nature of magick-the realization that the only thing a magician can effect change upon is the ma g ician. Yes, the cards got charged-but not because I charged them but because I charged myselfwith that crazy two-day ritual. By five o'clock Sunday afternoon, nearly forty-eight hours after I began, it was over. With tingling fingers I reordered the cards, gave them a big kiss (at the time, I still wasn't sure where my lips ended and the rest of the universe began), and returned the charged cards to their box. I mustered the energy to banish the temple with the Greater Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram, and then moved the furniture back into place. I took a long shower and dressed. I rewarded myself with a trip to my favorite Mexican restaurant where I ordered nearly everything on the menu and got good and drunk. So there it is. You'd be right to point out that it seems like a damned silly thing for a grown man to do with his weekend alone, and perhaps you would be right. Am I happy with the way it worked? Well ... yes. Of course I am. The cards have gotten great reviews and magicians and tarotists all around the world have told me wonderful and magical things they've done with the cards (and wonderful and magical things the cards have done to them).

If somebody has cursed you and you learn about it, and you feel uncomfortable about it, then the curse is at least al­ ready partially working. How would you handle something like that? How would you go about neutralizing a curse without being dragged deeper into the mad, toxic world of the curser? This is a story of a misunderstanding, a curse, and an impro­ vised magical operation designed to neutralize the curse. The mis­ understanding was between two very dear friends of our family, both of whom are/were practicing magicians. One is a prominent foreign filmmaker (I'll call him F.F.); the other, at the time, a strug­ gling artist and writer (whom I'll call S.A.). One is still living; the other is now sadly deceased. To respect the privacy and memories of both living and dead, I will not reveal their identities other than to say it is likely that both their names would be recognizable to at least a few of you who are reading these words. S.A. was a huge fan of the work of F.F., and in the autumn of 1981 he convinced me and several other adventurous lodge broth­ ers to travel to upstate New York to attend a film festival where F. F. was to speak and exhibit several of his films. After the event, S.A. and I had an opportunity to have drinks with F.F. and talk at some length. All three of us were students of magick in general, and the magick of Aleister Crowley in particular, so we hit it off like kin­ dred souls. Before we parted, I gave F.F. my phone number and encouraged him to call me the next time he was in the Los Angeles area, adding that he was more than welcome to stay with the Du­ Quettes while he was in the neighborhood. I never dreamed he would take me up on the offer. About a week later, I received a call from F.F., who said he was still in the country and staying with a friend in San Diego. He told me that in two days he was scheduled to visit Catalina Island, but, if my offer of hospitality was still open, he would be happy to come stay with us until then. his newest film and screen it at It was an outrageously kind ately accepted.

Naturally, S.A. was beside himself with excitement and was one of the first to arrive for movie night. Another of our lodge mem­ bers went to the mall and purchased every copy of one of F.F.'s books that the store had in stock. After an exciting night viewing the film, everybody went home with an autographed copy. It was truly a very memorable event. S.A. stayed late chatting with F.F. and, before heading home, offered to chauffeur him to the Cata­ lina ferry the next afternoon. F.F. accepted. We were all in bliss over this brief but pleasant brush with ce­ lebrity, and I'm happy to say that F.F. continues to this day to be a dear friend to the DuQuette family. Sadly, his friendship with S.A. would not so long endure. I feel the need to pause and remind the reader that artists of great genius often possess highly mercurial temperaments. They can be high-strung, unpredictable, and moody. Also, at times the creative energy bubbling inside them cannot be contained within the nar­ row confines of their artistic medium. Occasionally it just bursts out upon the world-sometimes visiting chaotic and devastating effects upon unsuspecting people around them. A couple of days after dropping F.F. off at the ferry, S.A. re­ ceived in the mail an elegantly adorned letter from F.F. He excit­ edly opened it, expecting to find a thank you note or some other such pleasantry F.F. is known for. Instead, he was stunned to find an eloquently composed poem (penned in fine calligraphy) casting a hideous curse upon him. The reason? It seems that when F.F. arrived at the hotel in Catalina and un­ packed his bags, he discovered that a medicine bottle that should have contained doctor-prescribed tablets important to his health"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"So Chapter Seven and peace of mind had been emptied of its contents and refilled with ordinary aspirin. Understandably upset, yet completely ig­ noring the possibility of any other explanation, F.F. became con­ vinced that our dear S.A. was the culprit, and that such larceny must be answered with a magical curse. Natura lly, we were all very shocked and confused by the news. As his host, I felt particularly responsible for anything that might have taken place in my home under my watch. I immediately sent F.F. a check to cover what I estimated would cover the cost of re­ filling his prescription, along with a note affirming my conviction that S.A. would be the last person on earth who would tamper with his luggage or have any interest in that particular medication, and that I was sure there must be some other explanation. F.F. ac­ cepted the check and graciously assured me that he did not in any way blame me. However, he held firm in his belief that S.A. was the culprit and that was that. S.A., of course, was heartbroken. Later, his sadness turned to anger at being accused of such a thing, especially by someone he idolized and only wished would think well of him. In the days that followed, he fell into a dark depression. Even though he'd done nothing wrong, his resentment and frustration had the effect of the curse actually working on him. He performed the standard banishing rituals and took the usual steps recommended for psy­ chic self-defense, but nothing lifted his spirits. I eventually sug­ gested we try something altogether different to neutralize the curse and help our brother snap out of it. It was my firm belief that this whole matter could be blamed upon a \"demon''-not a demon from the Goetia or the Book of Abra­ melin-but a spirit of misunderstanding. F. F. was simply not seeing dearly-as if his eyes (in a metaphorical sense) had been bewitched. The magical solution became obvious when I took another look at the stationery upon which the curse had been written.

A Midsummer Night's Curse 8r But before I go into that, and so the details of our little curse­ breaking ceremony might make more sense to you, I need to share a little more information about the extraordinary life and magical world of F.F., whose connection to the film industry goes back to the early days of sound pictures. In fact, as a young man he ap­ peared in the cast of Max Reinhardt's 1935 masterpiece, A Mid­ summer Night's Dream, 2 the first sound movie of a Shakespeare play ever produced. His participation in this classic production ig­ nited his brilliant imagination and engendered in his young heart a passionate love and fascination for both the art of cinema and themes of magick. The world of A Midsummer Night's Dream be­ came an abiding magical reality for him, and he would throughout his life personally identifY with its magick. Even the curse he cast upon poor S.A. was written on personalized stationery that was festooned with beautiful and whimsical images of the fairies from A Midsummer Night's Dream. The largest image on the parchment sheet was that of Puck, the mischievous aide to Oberon, the king of fairies. I saw certain haunting parallels between the plot of the play and the events surrounding the misunderstanding that led to the curse. In the play, Oberon wishes to play a trick on Titania, his fairy queen. While she sleeps, he squeezes the juice of a certain plant in her eyes, bewitching her to fall in love with the first crea­ ture she gazes on when she awakens. When she does wake up, she casts her eyes upon Bottom, one of the clowns of the play whose head (because of other magical shenanigans) has been magically replaced by that of a donk ey. She immediately falls helplessly in love with this monster, which leads to all manner of fun. Confus­ ing matters even further, Puck applies the magick flower juice to the eyes of other characters in the play while they sleep, and they 2 A Midsummer Night's Dream, Warner Brothers, 1935.

Things become hi­ lariously chaotic as misunderstanding piles upon misunderstand­ ing until finally Oberon and Puck apply an antidote (the juice of another kind of plant) to the eyes of the bewitched characters, and everything is set right in the end. Everyone in our family's circle of friends during those years was very familiar with this delightful play. Each summer for many years running, the DuQuettes hosted a backyard A Midsumm er's Night's Dream party. We would meet early in the evening, divvy up roles, hand out scripts and flashlights, and then, in the company of dear friends and underneath a bright moon and summer stars, we'd sip wine and read through the entire play.3 In an ironically adverse way, the similarities between the play and S.A.'s curse were unmistakable. Something-some force or cir­ cumstance or delusion or bias-had bewitched F.F.'s eyes so that when he discovered his property missing, he blamed the first per­ son who came to his mind-the last person he saw before stepping on to the Catalina ferry-S.A. If only we could apply Oberon's antidote to F.F.'s eyes! We certainly couldn't do it physicall y, but perhaps there was a way we could do it magical ly, and so the play itself became the blueprint of a ritual to lift the curse. Shakespeare was well aware of the mythological and magical properties of plants and herbs. He mentions by name at least eighty varieties in his plays and poems, twenty-six in A Midsummer Night's Dream alone! I wanted first to confirm exactly what flower was used by Oberon to bewitch the eyes ofTitania and the others, and then, what other flower was used to lift the curse and allow everyone to see things clearly again. 3 When he was very young, our son Jean-Paul played the parts of all the minor fairies.

Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower, Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound, And maidens call it love-in-idleness. 4 Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once: The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid Will make man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees.

His descrip­ tion of the mythical genesis of the flower (that of being created when Cupid's arrow missed the heart of \"a fair vestal throned by the west') is a not-so-subtle reference to Queen Elizabeth I, whose virgin heart was officially never pierced by Cupid's arrow. The pur­ ple of \"love's wound\" of the once-pure-white flower was a poignant reference to the fact that Elizabeth had shunned the personal plea­ sures of marriage, and the garment that would have been her white bridal dress was transformed by greater duty to the royal purple of the monarchy. She quite literally became the bride of England. When you think about it, there was big magick in that flower.

This was starting to sound like serious pharmacology. The basic format of our ritual was to be very simple. After due preparation, we would have S.A. smear certain parts of the curse parchment with the juice of a love-in-idleness plant. These parts would include F.F.'s signature, the image of the mischievous Puck, and particular words and phrases that most demonstrated F.F.'s temporary inability to see things accurately. Then, once the curse itself was anointed and fully \"alive\" with the delusional \"spirit\" of misunderstanding, S.A. would neutralize the spirit by liberally smearing the juice of Dian's bud upon those same areas of the parchment. All of this, of course, would be ac­ companied by appropriate incantations gleaned from the works of Shakespeare. The whole operation promised to be not only magi­ cally viable, but also a lot of fun. We chose for our magical temple one of the most beautiful places on earth-the Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. Nestled within its 140 acres is a charm­ ing Shakespeare Garden containing many of the herbs and plants mentioned in Shakespeare's works-all with little plaques display ­ ing the names of the plays in which they made their appearance. It would be no trouble at all to find our Love-in-idleness and Dian's bud, but how would we pluck them up without drawing the at­ tention of the groundskeepers? �� there's the rub.\" It was a cool Sunday afternoon when Constance and I, S.A., and a handful of interested lodge members carpooled up to the Hun­ tington. As expected, the place was crowded. The Shakespeare Gar­ den, however, was nearly deserted and it took us no time at all to locate and feloniously pluck up a pocketful of each of our flowers. Before leaving the Shakespeare Garden for more private environs on the grounds, we placed a small offering of some of our ill-gotten herbs at the stone bust of Shakespeare to invoke the presence and"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 Chapter Seven blessing of the immortal Bard. After all, he would play the deity role in this magical drama. The spirit Ariel's greeting to the magician, Prospero, from The Tempest served as our invocation: All hail, grave master! I come To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds . .. 5 We then strolled down to the lily ponds and found ourselves a quiet spot in the shade of a giant magnolia tree and set to work. We all sat on the ground and surrounded S.A. to shield his magi­ cal operation from prying eyes. The ceremony was short and very simple. S.A. crushed the love-in-idleness between his hands and rolled them back and forth until the plant was pulpy and wet. He then smeared the areas of the curse I described above. He then held the anointed paper in his hand while he read Oberon's origi­ nal \"curse.\" The words didn't exactly match our situation, but we thought they'd do.

We would later discover that over the years F.F. made something of a habit of cursing people whom he thought had somehow wronged him, and that most of them took it in good humor; some were even amused and flattered at the distinction. Did our Midsummer Night's Dream ritual work? I guess it's a matter of opinion. S.A. certainly stopped worrying about the curse, and in the years to follow went on to become a successful illustrator and author . His untimely death twenty-six years later was not likely the result of any curses other than those his life choices sadly loosed upon himself And F.F.? We would learn from a third party (nearly ten years later) that his friend in San Diego (the one with whom he had stayed in the days just prior to his visit with us) had eventually con­ fessed to the pill substitution, stating it was a foolish act of mis­ guided concern for F.F.'s health and well-being. And so ends the story of A Midsummer Night's Curse. I hope it has served as an illustration of how magick ceremonies can be drawn from virtually any source that inspires the magician, and that it isn't always necessary to lift a magical ritual directly from the works of John Dee, or the Golden Dawn, or Aleister Crow­ ley, or Gerald Gardner in order to assure that .. . jack shall have jill,· Nought shall go ill,· The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well9 9 A Midsummer Night's Dream, Act III, Scene II. 1111111111111111111111 TRAVELING IN (or, Real All my life I've experienced and exciting dreams that are cally feel intense exhilaration ach as I soar through dream just like an airplane.

It's wonderful. I feel so free, so alive-! want it never to stop. It's likely that you have the same or similar experiences, or else have had vivid dreams of jumping down from high places (and not getting hurt), or of swimming and breathing under water. Perhaps you wander your house at night, unclear in your mind whether you are dreaming or awake. If all this sounds familiar, I don't need to tell you that these mo­ ments belong to a unique category of dream experience. I believe they are, in fact, not dreams but a natural phenomenon of human consciousness that is often referred to as (for lack of a more accu­ rate term) \"astral projection\" or \"out-of-body experience\" (OBE). The term \"astral projection\" really is a terribly vague and mislead­ ing expression for this variety of experience. Astral? What's that? Is astral a what or is it a where? Is my \"astral body\" my soul? Is it a body at all? Do I project it into space when I \"travel\" around in it? We hear the terms \"astral body,\" \"astral plane,\" and \"astral world\" thrown around in esoteric conversations as if we were talking about conscious ectoplasmic apparitions floating around geographical lo­ cations rather than vibratory frequencies of human consciousness (which is precisely what they are). The fact remains, however, that our adventures in these vibratory frequencies of consciousness of­ ten feel disturbingly like we are conscious ectoplasmic apparitions floating around geographical locations. Learning to navigate around this strange universe (which other cultures and other spiritual systems might call \"the spirit world\") is particularly helpful to the magician who understands the impor­ tance of being able to think and function in this subtler world­ a world that lies just behind and beyond waking consciousness.

In fact, any magical operation that obliges the magician to see with the mind's eye a symbol, a penta­ gram, a hexagram, a spirit, or an angel, or a demon, or any spiri­ tual life that inhabits and animates thin g s deals directly with this so-called astral dimension. Ancient magicians called the ability to view the spirit nature of things \"scrying.\" The adepts of the Golden Dawn called it \"traveling in the spirit vision.\" Lucid dreaming is another dimension (pardon the play on words) to this mysterious phenomenon of consciousness. The ancient Egyp­ tians took the skill of lucid dreaming pretty seriously. In fact, the ability to consciously gain control of our dream self and the circum­ stances of our dream environment may very well have been the cor­ nerstone of the science of dying whose master textbook is the Egyp­ tian Book of the Dead. Below is a short excerpt from an article I wrote for the October 2004 issue of Fate Ma g azine2 that attempts to ex­ plain the DuQuette field theory on the subject. Please note that the principle for my theory is based upon the now-almost-universally­ accepted premise that the function and powers of the mind transcend that of the physical brain. The Egyptian Book of the Dead is a magical text supposedly written by the god Thoth himsel£ It is designed to give the newly deceased man or woman a fighting chance of hang­ ing on to his or her individual consciousness center by projecting it step-by-step through each phase of the death experience to arrive intact at a higher level of existence. The basic idea is this: If a dying person can keep the mind focused and occupied on series of particular ideas and images while the physical body dies, the \"self\" of the individual can separate from the physical body and take up 2 Lon Milo DuQuette, \"Terrors of the Th reshold: Astral Projection & The Egyptian Book of the Dead,\" FATE Magazine Vol. 57, No. 10, Issue 654."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 Chapter Eight residence in the \"mind.\" The preoccupied mind literally becomes an escape pod that will rescue the self from its at­ tachment to the dying body and brain. At each step along the way, the deceased is required to identify with higher and higher aspects of the mind-a process that continues to create new and subtler escape pods that will keep rescu­ ing the self until it is finally delivered safely (and intact) to realm of the gods. The Egyptian Book of the Dead ingeniously organizes this journey of ideas and images to match the landscape and nature of each of the progressively higher levels of con­ sciousness and requires the deceased to perfectly memorize and rehearse each leg of the trip prior to dying. Every level is guarded by a gatekeeper who must be iden­ tified by name and forced to allow the deceased to pass. Even the furniture has names that must be carefully memo­ rized and identified with constant chatter-everything that can be done to bolster the deceased's confidence and keep their mind minutely focused on anything but the tempta­ tion of allowing oneself to dissolve like the untrained into the sweet oblivion of death. At this point you might be asking yourself, ''All this may have been fine and good for the initiated royalty of ancient Egypt, but what does it mean to me? I'm not going to school to learn how to die.\" My staid answer to that question would be, ''Aren't you?\" The idea that consciousness separates from the body at the time of death is as old as human introspection itself, and it should be clear to anyone who has ever had dream experiences like I've de­ scribed above that consciousness can and does separate from the body in times of sleep, distress, or during other extraordinary cir­ cumstances. Furthermore, during such periods of separation, our Astral Projection: Traveling in the Spiril astral senses are attuned to 'itUU¥1 level of reality .

I wish I could say that I am a skilled astral projector. I'm not. Oh, I get out of my body quite often, and when I'm out I'm pretty skilled at controlling my movements and the circumstance of the vision. But only rarely do I consciously initiate the experience. When I do, it is always at that golden �oment (at bedtime or nap­ time) as my thoughts are just beginning to take on visual dream­ forms, but while I am still conscious of the fact that I also have a physical body slumbering on a real bed. This moment is char­ acterized by a strange noise that I seem to hear not with my ears but in the very center of my brain, then an intense feeling of an electrical current passing through my entire body. That \"current\" is actually the body we might call the astral body, and the fact that I'm feeling it is the signal that my conscious self is about to take residence in it. At that fragile moment of transition, I am nestled uncomfortably within the general vicinity of my physical body. It is at this moment that I can transfer my consciousness from I'm in my bed body to I'm in this buzzing electrical body. At this point I can get up, wander around the house (which always looks just a little different than my material house), or take a diving leap into the air and fly straight through the ceiling into the glorious sky. On most occasions, my out-of-body experiences begin without a conscious effort on my part and within the context of a dream­ in-progress. I become conscious within the dream state that I am dreaming and already out. I then become consciously aware of my situation and take control from there. I partially achieve this state when I experience magically induced altered states of conscious­ ness, such as when I purposefully induce a trance in order to scry into tarot cards or Enochian magick tablets and squares. Most of my projections, however , are those in which I find my­ self accidentally out, wandering only a few yards away from my"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 Chapter Eight snoring body, and this is the story of one such adventure. I wish I could tell you there is some kind of great magical lesson to be learned from this tale. Perhaps there is. But mostly I would like simply to illustrate some of the strange and interesting character­ istics of these experiences and, in doing so, encourage you to fear­ lessly start your own program of exploration. Before I begin, however, I need to share a strange and often ter­ rifying occurrence that often accompanies out-of-body experiences and which (I believe) has since time immemorial been the cause of all manner of religiously motivated nonsense concerning de­ mons, devils, ghosts, vampires, and the torments of hell. We might call this phenomenon the \"terror of the threshold.\" The dynam­ ics of consciousness that explain this phenomenon are, however, anything but terrifYing. In fact, I believe when the facts are prop­ erly understood, they are very interesting and at times downright funny . A few moments ago, I described the ancient Egyptian concept of the \"self\" of the deceased progressively passing from lower to higher levels of consciousness during the death experience, and how at each new level the mind creates an escape pod for the es­ sential \"self\" of the individual. These temporary shuttlecrafts are also bodies formed from progressively finer and more subtle en­ ergy \"material.\" Yogic literature identifies these various bodies as \"astral body'' or \"etheric body\" or \"causal body'' or \"mental body\" or \"emotional body.\" These subtle bodies do not necessarily need to be created and cast off only by a person who is dying. Indeed, our thoughts, desires, and emotions are constantly in the process of creating and discarding them the over course of the agonies and ecstasies of this roller-coaster ride we call everyday life. If you have this concept clearly in mind, I now put to you the idea that all these discarded bodies live on for a time in the same way a decaying corpse and its hair and fingernails, bacteria, DNA, etc., Astral Projection: Traveling in the Spiril live on in physical bodies hnriPdlll The only difference being, animated for a period of time sidually resident in their shell shells or husks, these astral zoJ4 tum-the slowest and lowest very lowest levels of the sea of close to the material plane. and waking consciousness.

The only difference being, these astral corpses remain somewhat animated for a period of time while the remaining energy still re­ sidually resident in their shell completely decays. And like discarded shells or husks, these astral zombies are made of the heaviest stra­ tum-the slowest and lowest frequencies of energy . They sink to the very lowest levels of the sea of consciousness-the area that is very close to the material plane. This is the borderland between dream and waking consciousness. It is quite literally an astral graveyard. When we are tired and relaxed, we fall fast asleep and ride an express elevator directly to some pretty high levels of conscious­ ness, those whose environs are revealed in the metaphoric imagery as the dream sky into which we blissfully soar. But if something is burdening our minds and forcing us to slowly drag our sorry as­ tral consciousness kicking and screaming out of our physical body and step-by-step up the back stairs of consciousness, then the first place we slog through on our way \"up\" is the lowest place in up­ land-the graveyard. The dramatic terrors and ordeals that candidates of ancient mys­ tery schools were required to undergo during their initiation cer­ emonies illustrated this frightening, yet ultimately harmless, fact of spiritual life. Because this area is so close to the material plane and the solid coordinates of waking space-time consciousness, the \"bodies\" that populate the cemetery of your threshold are literally those that are hanging around your neighborhood. That is why so many of these bad \"dream\" experiences seem to include situations dealing with neighborhood \"bad people\" who, to all dream appear­ ances, are attempting to violate your home or your body or your loved ones. In nine out of ten of my terror of the threshold projec­ tions, I find myself trying to chase away neighborhood vandals or (get this ... and please forgive my politically incorrect subconscious mind) deranged homeless people who are attempting to get in my"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 Chapter Eight house. But in the metaphoric reality of this plane of conscious­ ness, that is exactly what they are-homeless bodies who are no longer animated by a living self, drifting in obedience to the laws of cosmic osmoses toward a realm (my house) that is inhabited by an abundance of living. These astral zombies mean no harm. They mean nothing because there is no \"self\" inside to provide them with intent. But boy! They scare the living daylights out of you when you stumble into their world. A moment ago I mentioned that I am not very good at con­ sciously entering into an out-of-body experience. I think I should probably rephrase that to say, \"I am not very good at consciously leaving my body unless I've first gorged myself to near uncon­ sciousness on my wife's spinach or broccoli quiche. It is with no small measure of embarrassment that I confess that, even though I came of mystical age in the psychedelic Sixties­ even though I have at one time or another in my sixty-two years on this planet experimented with a cornucopia of mind-altering substances-even though I have labored to control my breathing with pranayama, fasted for days on end-even though I've chanted myself to socially acceptable insanity and engaged in magical ritu­ als that I would never dream of describing to your mother-the strongest and most powerful drug I have ever consciously ingested for the purpose of driving myself out of my physical body is Con­ stance's homemade broccoli or spinach quiche.

In fact, on one occasion a dear friend of ours actually suffered a massive heart attack within a few hours of his feast of Constance's spinach quiche, an event that required immediate triple bypass surgery and months of recuperation. I'm happy to say he recovered completely and has reassured us on nu­ merous occasions that the experience was worth the memory of the quiche. Is it any wonder that a weak-willed and insecure glutton such as myself succumbs to the demons of intemperance whenever I'm confronted with an entire spinach or broccoli quiche during a quiet dinner for two in the privacy of my own home? The particular out-of-body experience I am about to relate took place five years ago following one such quiet dinner. I must has­ ten to point out that at that time of my life I had been abusing my body with a litany of bad eating and drinking habits (\"crimes against wisdom,\" as the ayurvedic folks would call it) and I had al­ lowed myself to grow to nearly three hundred pounds. It was not good. I am happy to say that I have since I have lost more than one hundred pounds and am feeling better than I have my entire life. At the time, however, my weight made sleeping quite challenging. It was great for lucid dreaming and astral projection because I was often tossing and turning in that twilight world between waking and sleeping. But it was terribly frightening when I realized that many of my colorful nocturnal adventures were kicked off by the suffocating effects of sleep apnea and that my astral projections could probably be more accurately described as near-death experi­ ences! Still, this season of my life was characterized by a rich assort­ ment of out-of-body experiences, and led to my ability to control and direct the circumstances of my dreams and projections."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 Chapter Eight I wish I could say that Constance was as excited about my astral adventures as I was. But I can't. In fact, they were often rude and terrifying interruptions to her sleep. She usually knows that I am outside of my body before I do, because I almost always roll over on my back and stick my left arm straight up into the air. I have no idea why I do this, but whenever I do it she wakes her up and grumbles to herself, \"Oh no! He's out of his body again. I wonder when he's going to make that noise?\" The noise that she dreads is a phenomenon that occurs when my astral body tries to speak, or rather, when my physical vocal cords try to vibrate to the speech impulses coming from my astral body. When I open my astral mouth to say something, my physi­ cal mouth back in bed makes the most grotesque and hideously frightening noise ... wooooahhhhhhHHH AAAAeeeeeeeaaaaa AAAAHHHH!

The quiche itself is made in an over­ sized pastry dish (not a pie plate) that can easily serve a huge slice to six hungry people. It's not a thin little breakfast quiche either. The rich whipped filling fluffs up to nearly four inches. Two of these pieces was entirely too much for one sane person to eat at one sitting. Bur it was so good that I begged for another. Constance re­ luctantly agreed and succumbed to the temptation of another slice herself. When we were finished, we had eaten two-thirds of the massive pie. We were gorged and painfully uncomfortable. Con­ stance began to serve her penance by cleaning up the kitchen and attacking the dishes. I moved to the computer and tried unsuc­ cessfully to write. The remaining one-third of the quiche cooled on the kitchen counter. An hour later we were both still groaning and holding our bloated bellies (of course I had a much bigger burden). The quiche had cooled enough to be wrapped in plastic and put in the refrig­ erator, which is exactly what Constance was preparing to do when a spirit of gluttony most foul whispered in my ear and counseled me that tomorrow the quiche would not taste nearly as good as is does right now.

I don't have a gun or a knife or a club ... what can I do?\" Then the thought hit me, ''I'm huge. I weigh three hundred pounds.

You Know You're Out of .Your Bod y ... • When you feel a thrilling tingling sensation in the pit of your stomach, heart, throat, or back of the neck. When you notice this thrill in a dream, it means you have made the identity shift necessary for an OBE. Perhaps this has something to do with our chakras or psychic centers that serve as exits from the body. If you are lucid at this moment, you can fly or do most anything you can imagine. Ironically, the most difficult thing you can do when you find yourself in this wonderful state is to actually think of something fun and productive to do. Plan ahead. • When forward or upward movement in a dream becomes difficult or impossible to continue. For example: you are walking down a dream sidewalk, walking up stairs, or driving or bicycling down a road and you suddenly find your legs are too heavy to move or the car or bike breaks down. This indi­ cates that you are moving from a lower/slower vibratory level into a higher/more subtle vibratory level, one that your big fat dream vehicles can't enter.

For example: you are preparing to cross the street or move from one side of a room to the opposite side, but change your mind and move 90 degrees either to the left or right.

Or you are driving a dream car or riding a bicycle very fast and suddenly a curve appears that you are certain you will not be able to make. Or you dream that you are spinning or dancing. The corkscrew effect is also a very common prelude to leaving your body. • When you hear strange noises-bells, rapping, horns, hissing, thunder. Nearly every OBE is accompanied by strange noises that seem to announce the movement from one plane to the next. No matter what kind of noise it is, it always seems to be \"heard\" with something other than your ears. • When you encounter Terrors of the Threshold. Encounters with hideous beings occurs most often when, for one reason or another, you skip the dream transition and are roughly thrust from waking consciousness to an OBE. These are sel­ dom pleasant experiences. I encounter these things when I've had too much to eat and try to sleep it off. I roll in and out of uncomfortable consciousness. I actually think I'm getting out up out of bed, but instead I walk right into the lowest region of the astral plane, which, as we have learned, can be a pretty rough neighborhood. Warning: Don't eat or drink in dreams, especially with dead people!

Excitedly, I turned to Constance and told her that I was going to invoke Mer­ cury by telling nothing but lies for the whole evening. \"No you're not!\" was her wise response. I couldn't believe she did not see the magical genius of the idea. I argued that it would be the perfect invocation. \"Every chance I get, I will lie! Mercury will love it. I'll be the only person there actually doing something purely mercurial.\" I told her. \"Besides, it will be lots of fun!\" But Constance saw nothing perfect or fun about it. \"I want nothing to do with it!\" was her answer. \"You're not going to do it!\" I finally gave in and said, \"Okay. I won't do it.\" (The invocation of Mercury had begun.) We arrived a few minutes late. I apologized for our tardiness, saying that we had just returned from the cemetery where we had watched the exhumation of my father's body. Constance looked at me with silent disgust and found an excuse to get as far away from me as she could for the rest of the evening. She's still mad at me! Of course, everyone wanted to know why my father's body had been exhumed, and I was only too glad to tell them. It seemed that the family of my mother's second husband had been told by an ac­ quaintance that my mother had bragged to a mutual friend about how she had poisoned my father. They took their suspicions to the police and finally got a warrant to exhume Dad's body for testing. 3 Traditions based on the mythological escapades of Mercury (the Greek Hermes) do indeed award to the wing-footed messenger of the gods the dubious distinction of being the god of liars, thieves, and lawyers.

Next, I told a few of the cast members how hot they looked in their Egyptian wigs and costumes, but I didn't get a chance to tell many more lies before the ceremony started. At the party that fol­ lowed, however, I again became fully possessed by my lord Mer­ cury. The lies dripped like quicksilver from my lips. I started by announcing that our landlord had discovered that our house was contaminated with radon and that we had been forced to move to Garden Grove, where we now rented a large house owned by General Ky, the former prime minister of South Vietnam. I said it had a big backyard where we would be able to do initiations and produce the Rites of Ele us i s -and that there was a rifle range in the basement. Everyone believed me! You know , it's hard to keep up a constant stream of lies, even for me. In fact, I was starting to realize that it's impossible not to drag some element of truth into a lie. Actually I was starting to realize the inconstant and relative nature of reality itself--how there is no absolute truth, no absolute lies. Was this the Mercurial revelation-the Mercurial trance of sor­ row? Tr y as I might to remain in character, the strain of all the lies eventually began to show . As the evening wore on (and it couldn't end fast enough for Constance) people began to suspect some­ thing was wrong with Lon's behavior. Our closest circle of friends became genuinely concerned. They cornered me in the kitchen just as I was reaching into the freezer for the bottle of gin. \"Lon, is there anything wrong?

These people loved me. These people cared. I had toyed shamelessly with their feelings. I was ashamed, and so overwhelmed that I didn't know whether I'd be able to answer without choking up. I put down the bottle of gin, and looked each of them in the eye and confessed ... \"My doctor told me I have a brain tumor.\" Everyone gawked at me in stunned silence. People near the kitchen overheard and soon everyone at the party \"knew\" why I had been saying such outrageous things all night. When Constance heard this last whopper, she could stay silent no longer. \"He does NOT have a brain tumor! He's been telling lies all night because Mercury is the god of liars. Nothing he's said is true. I told him it was a stupid idea.\" When the shock wore off, everyone else thought it was a stupid idea, too. Nobody, it seems, recognized the pure magical genius of my invocation of Mercury-nobody but me, of course. For a while I chalked it up to that Curse of the Magus4 thing. Then I just realized pranks such as this are not what invocation is all about. 4 I, of course, am being facetious. \"Magus\" is the title of the initiatory level correspond­ ing to Chokmah, the second Sephirah of the Tree of Life, and representative of the second-highest level of human consciousness attainable.

In chapter 1, I mentioned the impor­ tance of invocation and the magician's personal relationship with the supreme intelligence (or the Great G). In this chapter and the one to follow , I'm going to share with you not only my thoughts on the matter, but also a ritual that has now become an integral part of all my formal magical operations. For many years, however, I missed the point of invocation entire ly. For me, invocation was a cold and intellectual exercise-a necessary formality like doffing one's hat when entering a house of worship.

Eventua lly, I discovered that's exactly what I needed to do. In the introduction to this book, I revealed that I \"worship\" a supreme consciousness that is the ultimate source of all manifest and unmanifest existence; and that I believe the ultimate nature of this super-existence is transcendently Good-a Good so all­ comprehensively (and incomprehensively) infinite that there can be no-thing outside of itself-no \"opposite\" of this great Good. It swallows up all concepts of duality. If we could wave a magick wand and strip away all the superstitious absurdities and bigoted nonsense that infect most of the world's spiritual institutions, we would discover that this supreme consciousness, this Great G, is the true \"God\" of every religion. The Great G is not the limited or parochial totem of any partic­ ular race or family or tribe or nation or culture or cult. The Great G is too big to be the purview of any cult or philosop hy.

Like audio feedback created by a microphone that has been placed too close to the speaker of an amplifier, this simultaneous giving and receiving of love creates an ever-increasing feedback of bliss that is nothing less than the alternating electrical current of Great G consciousness-the current that joyously creates , sustains, and destroys the cosmos. And that's what invocation is all about. It took me a long time (over thirty-five years) to finally come to this realization.

It is one thing to have an intellectual grasp and appreciation of the Great G, but it is quite another to allow oneself to gushingly melt in giddy adoration to it. I'll admit, as I was growing up I had a real problem loving God. No. That's not quite correct. I had a problem loving what seemed to be the monster everyone around me was calling God. Nevertheless, as I grew older I knew that if I was ever going to evolve into a sane and competent magician-if! ever hoped to perform a proper invocation, and become duly and truly connected with the divine \"above,\" I would have to come to grips with my deep-seated negative attitudes. I would need to dis­ cover how to open my heart and fall in love with the Great G and set off the divine love feedback I spoke of a moment ago. My first challenge was to settle on a tangible image, a form, a name for this formless and most abstract of abstract spiritual con­ cepts. It would seem logical that I would try to personify the Great G in the likeness of one of the deities of my religion. After all, as a practicing Thelemite and archbishop' of my church,2 my life is not bereft of gods and goddesses, foremost of which is a trinity of infini­ ties that define the fundamental principals ofThelemic cosmology: • Nuit-the Egyptian goddess of the night sky often depicted in Egyptian art as azure in color, tall and slender, arching over the earth. She is the infinity of an ultimately expanded uni­ verse (the circumference of the circle). 1 See chapter 13 and appendix 2. 2 Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (EGC), the ecclesiastical arm of Ordo Templi Orientis. • Hadit-Nuit's lover.

And so, I set to work combing the pantheons of the world's religions, great and small, in search of a deity whose image and character resonates with my peculiar menu of spiritual programming. About ten years ago, I settled ever so comfortably on a deity that fills the bill per­ fectly, the potbellied remover of obstacles, Ganesha. 3 Ganesha 3 Alternately spelled Ganesa (and known in the East as Ganapati, Vinayaka, and Pillai­ yar).

Pop Goes Ganesha! II9 Now, before you read anything unduly sectarian into my special relationship with Ganesha, I want you to know that I do not claim to be a devotee of Ganesha in the orthodox sense of the word. I do not belong to any Ganesha cults or sects. I don't travel to Ganesha pujas or festivals, nor have I memorized the 108 Names of Lord Ganesha (although they are wonderful beyond words). Also, please be dear on this-I am not advocating that you or anyone else necessarily need to select the image, character, or con­ cept of Ganesha as your tangible icon of the intangible, the supreme consciousness of the cosmos. It's your life, your spiritual cosmos, your magick. You are your own magician. Get your own God! If Ganesha floats your Great G devotional boat, fine! It's no business of mine or anyone else. Everything I am about to describe in the following little ban­ ishing and invoking ritual can just as easily be applied using the character and image of any deity or object of your devotion-or any character or any thin g of your choosing. I chose Ganesha be­ cause when I travel in vision to the throne-room of the supreme consciousness of the Great G, I can instantly and effortlessly imag­ ine that I am beholding the all-loving and beautiful sweet face of Ganesha. My heart swells and overflows with a current of love for the divine, and I can joyously plunge my soul into the massive and cozy heart of that deity . But just as easily, I find myself totally receptive to that same flood of divine love and bliss coming from Ganesha, and therein lies the key. Once I became comfortable with my new relationship with the Great G in the image and personality of Ganesha, I automati­ cally began to acknowledge his presence and enlist his blessing and guidance prior to embarking on any serious undertaking. His huge ears were perpetually attuned to my prayers; his unjudgmen­ tal eyes lovingly bore witness to my noblest thoughts and deeds,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"I 120 Chapter Eleven and my vilest vices and vanities. At day's end, I comfortably rested in the folds of his great curled trunk as he rocked me to sleep. Okay, I confess. I was dangerously close to becoming a Ganesha nut! (No offense to real Ganesha nuts). I even seriously thought about memorizing his 108 attributes, i.e., Lord of the Whole World, Remover of Obstacles, Beloved and Lovable Child, Moon-Crested Lord, Master of Poets, Lord of Music, Huge-Bellied Lord (Boy! Could I iden­ tify with a huge-bellied god!), One Who Is Easy to Appease, Destroyer of All Obstacles and Impediments, etc. But I'm a lazy man, and as my Lord Ganesha is easy to appease, I resolved that I would sim­ ply chant his name 108 times as a mantra prior to meditation or magick, or in the quiet moments before my lectures or musical per­ formances, or indeed, before I did anything important. A friend gave me a rosary of 1 08 beads4 and for a while I used that to help me count off the \"Ganeshas.\" Sadly, I ended up leav­ ing it behind in an airplane seat somewhere between Copenha­ gen and London. I felt kind of funny using the rosary in public anyway, especially when I flew (and I fly a lot). Other passengers looked at me like I was some kind of white-haired terrorist saying my last suicidal prayers. No. I needed a quick and easy way to silently and secretly chant the name of Ganesha 108 times while counting on my fingers. M­ ter much experimentation I discovered the perfect technique.

In order for you to appreciate the simplicity of this little ritual, you need to understand the magical dynamics of how the magi­ cian moves about the temple in ritual in order to initiate and di­ rect the flow of energy that either invokes or banishes a specific magical force. INVOKING (with the Sun) In order to invoke (bring in the desired magical force), the general magical rule of thumb suggests that the magician move about the temple in a clockwise direction (i.e., around the perimeter or circle of the temple space, moving from east to south to west to north, returning to the east). This movement with the Sun's apparent daily path is called \"deosil.\" Standing in one place and spinning (rotating) clockwise is also considered an invoking movement."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"122 Chapter Eleven Rotating clockwise (deosi/) on ones axis also invokes.

Start Movement in a clockwise (deosi/) direction and spiraling inward invokes. Naturally the power of this invoking movement is further am­ plified if the inward-turning spiral was performed in a clockwise (deosil) direction, and amplified even more if the magician was also performing deosil rotations while moving along the path of the inward-turning spiral. to the east).

This movement against the Sun's apparent daily path is called \"widdershins.\" Standing in one place and spinning (rotating) counterclockwise is also considered a banishing movement. Rotating counterclockwise (widdershins) also banishes. By now you've probably surmised that you can also banish by moving in a spiral pattern starting from the center and moving widdershins outwardly until coming to rest at the far circumfer­ ence of the circle-as if you were pushing ever ything out and away from the center of the temple. Natura lly, the power of this banish­ ing movement is further amplified if the outward-turning spiral is also performed in a counterclockwise (widdershins) direction, and strengthened even more if the magician is also performing widder­ shins rotations while moving along the path of the outward turn­ ing spiral.5 5 There are, of course, variations on this theme that magicians use to mix or match the dynamics of deosil and widdershins movements for specific magical effects.

It is with the most pro­ found conviction that I embrace the words that form the subtitle of this book, \"It's all in your head, you j ust have no idea how big your head is.\" This is not to say, however, that I believe magick is purely psychological. What I am saying is there is more we don't understand about the human mind than we do understand. With each new discovery we draw nearer to the realization that the mind is not limited by the brain. In fact, our brains, our bodies, our world, and even time and space are manifestations and aspects of mind. If we truly understood the limitless wonders of the mind and its relationship with the universal consciousness, we would 133"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"134 Chapter Twelve know that in actuality there can be no outside of the mind-no outside of ourselves. Does the mind explain everything? Theoretic ally, I'd say yes. But I would be the biggest liar in the universe if I were to even suggest that I am firmly in touch with that level of consciousness where everything is explained to me! And that's one of the reasons I find magick is so fascinating, and at times, so unexplainable. One does not need to understand every detail of the inner workings of a com­ puter in order to install and operate a complex program. So too, the magician does not need to objectively understand every detail of the inner workings of the infinite mind in order to operate the system. I do feel, however, that in this day and age it is wise to give credit where credit is due, and woe to the sanity of the modern practitioner who would have others believe that he or she has guile­ fully cornered the market on understanding magical powers. I reiterate all this because I am about to share two stories about magical operations I have done for the benefit of others. Such ef­ forts when not considered carefully threaten to challenge my \"it's all in my head ... \" field theory .

But ultimately, my outside world is one and the same as my inside world. If my magick does in­ deed bring about some desired change, it merely proves to me that somehow , someway, I have succeeded in transforming myself into the kind of person to whom such things happen. In the spring of 2002, I received an e-mail from Ezriel, 1 a rabbi living on the East Coast, who wrote that he was familiar with my work and felt confident I could magically help him resolve a se­ rious problem. In his first note, he did not describe his problem or what he wanted me to do. He said he wanted to simply in­ troduce himself and provide me with personal information which he begged I would verify and keep confidential; this included his full name, address, professional titles, educational degrees, and de­ tails of his standing within an influential community of Orthodox Jews. He dosed by restating his sincerity, and that he was willing to fly me to the East Coast, pay my expenses, and award me what­ ever my fee may be for \"this kind of black magick work.\" A.5 you might imagine, I regularly receive letters and e-mails from some pretty colorful (sometimes very disturbed) individuals. I also occasionally receive requests from people asking me to curse an enemy, repel a psychic attack, expel a demon, extract an em­ bedded extraterrestrial, or kindly endorse their claims that they are Jesus Christ, Aleister Crowley, or Cagliostro. I nearly always leave these requests unanswered, but Rabbi Ezriel's note struck me as being something more. I took a few minutes and investigated on the Internet. I easily found a mountain of information about Ezriel's very ethnic home town. When I added his name to the search criteria, I found it prominently positioned among the religious and educational lead­ ers of the community. I found it very odd that this pillar of piety 1 I am not using real names in this particular story."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"136 Chapter Twelve would ask me to do anything of a black magick nature. Because he said he was familiar with my work, I assumed he was also famil­ iar with the doctrines of esoteric Judaism. After all, nearly all the most popular systems of Western magick have as their foundation the Hebrew Qabalah. The term black magick wouldn't necessarily strike the same irrational terror in the heart of an esoteric Jew as it would in that of a mainstream Chrislemew . I was intrigued, so I cautiously e-mailed him back and inquired about the details of his problem. His response was immediate and poignantly candid. His only son, David (who himself was a rabbi), had been married for nearly two years and had not yet become a father. David and his wife, Sarah, 2 had been examined by physi­ cians who found them both to be in good health and capable of conceiving a child. After giving me a short and breathtakingly po­ litically incorrect lecture on the religious and cultural importance of his son having a child (especially a boy), he repeated his offer to immediately bring me to the East Coast and pay me to do what­ ever was necessary to make his daughter-in-law pregnant. Mter I banished from my vulgar comedian's brain a thousand crude and sophomoric possible responses to this statement, I took a day to gather my thoughts and ponder how I should respond to this offer.

I frankly stated, how­ ever, that I thought it would be unwise for me to attempt to magi­ cally intrude in the lives of his family in this manner. He responded within minutes insisting that, on the contrary, he most certainly did want me to magically intrude-specifically, he wanted me to call up a demon of the Goetia and command it to make Sarah pregnant. I replied to the effect that even if I were willing and able to raise a fertility demon, and Sarah did become pregnant and give birth to a baby boy, there would be serious and unavoidable psychologi­ cal consequences for both the child and his family. I asked him to realize how, like in a fairy tale, the blessing would soon turn into a curse-how the happiness that would first accompany the child's birth would soon be overshadowed by the nagging fear that every illness, every accident, injury, or misfortune visited upon the child throughout his lifetime was somehow the evil result of the demonic black magick operation that had engendered his nativity. The rabbi coldly responded, \"I am willing to take such a curse upon myself.\" I had to admire the depth of this man's resolve. Such fearless­ ness and focus may characterize a fool, but are also the mark of a natural magician. I was beginning to realize Ezriel had already set into motion the magical forces that would make Sarah pregnant, and that my participation had already become in his mind a factor in the equation. I resigned myself to try to help him in any way I could. I was sure, however, that raising a Goetic spirit was not go­ ing to be the way to do it. I wrote him back and told him so, add­ ing that I was prepared to consult with other spirits to determine the facts of the matter and how best to proceed.

I placed it on a small table near the south window of my bedroom temple. I lit a stick of incense and placed it in a holder and tray on the floor just north of the table. I knelt before the table and bowed three times, each time lighdy touching my forehead to the floor. I would remain kneeling through­ out the entire process, a gesture which at the time was for me not ac­ complished without some measure of pain. I hoped the rabbi would appreciate this! I unwrapped a bundle of fifty dried yarrow5 stalks and, holding them in my right hand, rotated them clockwise three times in the incense smoke while I asked the question out loud: \"What is pre­ venting David and Sarah from conceiving a child?\" I removed one stalk from the bundle and laid it horizontally in front of me as a reminder of the supreme consciousness. Then, for the next fifteen minutes (in obedience to the rather complex tradi­ tional procedure) I carefully manipulated the remaining forty-nine stalks to randomly generate the number groupings that would cre­ ate a stack of six lines (called a hexagram). Each of the six lines of the basic hexagram is either an unbroken line (male-yang) or a broken line (female-yin). There are thus sixty-four ways possible ways to combine six lines that are either broken or unbroken. To the ancient Chinese sages who developed the system, these sixty-eight different hexagrams presented to their minds archetypal images that in turn suggested ideas, situations, even moral commentaries on historical, social, political, and per­ sonal matters. 5 Yarrow is also known as woundwort or nosebleed. Its medicinal properties have been known for millennia in both the East and West. Traditionally, yarrow has been associated with I Ching divination since the earliest years when sacred tortoises were released in a temple courtyard \"planted\" with a grid of dried yarrow stalks. The pat­ tern of the stalks the tortoises knocked down was then interpreted for the answer to the question."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"140 Chapter Twelve These ideas are not static. Indeed, like everything in our objec­ tive reality , the hexagrams are in a constant state of change (hence the name, \"Book of Changes\"). Consequen tly, depending upon the nature of the answer, any one of the six lines of any given hexa­ gram may be in the process of changing (or \"moving\") into its op­ posite. In other words, each line of the hexagram can be one of four varieties: • An unbroken line (male-yang) • A broken line (female-yin) • An old unbroken line (a male so old it will soon change/move to female) • An old broken line (a female so old it will soon change/move to male) The text of the I Ching provides specific commentaries for each hexagram and for each of the \"moving lines\" of the hexagrams. For the reader who may feel hopelessly confused at this point, let me just briefly summarize: While it is possible, using the traditional yarrow stalk method, to arrive at a hexagram containing no moving lines at all, in most cases, the person asking the question receives the answer in three stages: • The prima ry hexagram (and its commentary) that usually paints a picture of conditions surrounding the present situation. • The commentary (or commentaries) on the moving line (or lines), which usually points to the aspect of the situation that is currently changing, or is about to change. • The new hexagram (and its commentary) that is formed when the moving line (or lines) have changed/moved into their opposites.

Almost with­ out exception, the I Ching speaks to us in metaphoric language (like a fortune cookie on steroids) that rings true only if we are attuned to hear the answer from out of its flowery prose. To my great relief, the I Ching answered my question - W hat is preventing David and Sarah from conceiving a child?--in a remark­ ably clear manner. It came as a classic three-part answer made up of: 1) The primary hexagram (No. 9), which is called The Taming Power of the Small; 9 -.-- 2) with moving line 4 (from the bottom), which transforms the primary hexagram into ... 3) Hexagram 1, which is called, The Creative.

SAINT TERESA OF AVILA Perhaps the most dramatic example of Low Magick (at least as we are defining the term in this book) is the art of exorcism. Exor­ cism reaches back into prehistory, and, together with rites of fer­ tility and the hunt, vies for the title of humanity's oldest spiritual practice. Writing about exorcism is in its own way as dangerous as exorcism itself--perhaps more so, as there is so much opportunity for serious misunderstanding, not to mention all the evils igno­ rance and fear can visit upon superstitious humanity. 1 4 5"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"146 Chapter Thirteen For young magicians, dabblers, and dilettantes the fantasy of waging magical war with a hideous demon who has taken up resi­ dence in some tormented soul reeks with the prospect of heroism, spiritual romance, and adventure. In truth, more often than not, where the subject of exorcism is concerned, the whole sad business merely reeks. As I feel I must keep reminding you, I am not a mental health expert nor do I have a degree in psycholo gy, so please understand that my opinions on this subject are drawn purely from a magical perspective and from my experiences with individuals who have solicited my advice and/or assistance (some of whom I felt actually needed an exorcism, though most of whom I believe did not). Let's bear in mind that the science of mental health is still in its infancy , and that in centuries past, maladies such as epilep sy, schizophrenia, depression, dissociative identity disorder (a.k.a. multiple personality disorder), and countless other conditions both mental and physical were believed to be the result of supernatu­ ral causes. The ancient physicians who attributed certain physical and mental abnormalities to demon or spirit possession might not have been so off the mark, especially when we remember that their patients' spiritual reality included a solid belief in spirit illness and demon possession. Even today , rather than viewing a disease as our body's natural reaction to an unhealthy lifestyle, chemical or bio­ logical poisoning, or an inherited abnormality , we apply a personal face to the malady as a malicious enemy that needs to be resisted and battled and defeated. The wise witch doctor, shaman, or physician of old knew that if one can first heal the mind, the body would likely follow . If in the patient's mind the illness could be simply personified as a com­ mon garden-variety demon-a bothersome pest that could driven off by a skilled exorcist-then the immense negative energy of the patient's own fear and superstition could be turned back upon it- self and used as a positive force healings chronicled in the New still effectively apply variations members of their flocks whose perstitious, simple, and absolute.

I will tell you that it is an Archdiocesan high school for girls that has been administered for more than one hundred years by a par­ ticular group of Dominican Sisters; and that I was retained by the principal of the school (who I will refer to as Sister Martha) under circumstances that I am now about to relate. Before I go any further, however, I must pause and remind the reader that the Roman Catholic Church has a formal Rite of Exor­ cism3 that (in rare occasions and under the direction and authority of a bishop) is performed to cast out demons and evil spirits a la the popular film The Exorcist.4 There are several reasons the rite is so infrequently employed today; one of them likely being the modern 1 Matthew 9:22, 15:28; Mark 5:33-35; Luke 8:42-49; Acts 14: 8-10.

The criteria for such proof are very specific and involved. If, however, the evidentiary hurdles are cleared, it can take additional time to find a bishop willing to authorize the procedure, and (if the bishop is unable or unwilling to do the job himself) to find an exorcist capable and willing to perform it. It often takes years to get a first-rate Roman Catholic exorcism on the road. More often than not, by then the possessee has gotten better (or has died most colorfully) before the exorcist walks out of the theatrical fog and comes knocking at the door. The reason a bishop is required to perform (or order) an exor­ cism springs from the Christian tradition that bishops are suppos­ edly possessed of a kind of magical electricity that evil spirits hate, fear, and cannot resist. The Church, of course, doesn't refer to this power as being \"magical,\" but when they describe the nature of this force, one can conclude it can be nothing else but magical. They maintain that this current is passed from individual to indi­ vidual by the laying on of hands with full intent to transmit it. In other words, one bishop makes another bishop by laying his hands on another man5 and saying something to effect of, 'John Doe, it is my intention to make you a bishop, and so Im going to lay my hands on you and pass some of my magical electricity on to you.

How stupid was he? He was so stupid that during a rare outburst of exasperation, Jesus called him a \"rock.\" Contrary to the absurd interpretation concocted in the Dark Ages by an un­ derstandably confused and embarrassed church, calling someone a rock in first century Palestine was not a compliment. In Aramaic, \"rock'' is a most insulting epithet. It doesn't mean, \"I think you're heavy, man,\" it means, \"I think you are an idiot-as dense and stu­ pid as a stone!\" Jesus goes on to say something to the effect that it would be on such immovable rock that the whole future church would be built.6 (Obviou sly, in this instance, Jesus is proven to be a great prophet!) This chain of magical electricity from Saint Peter to the modern bishop is called apostolic (as in apostle) succession. Like electricity , the power (real or imagined) is in itself neutral. Once you have it, you have it. It cannot be taken away. If the Church dared to admit such power could be taken away then they would have to also con­ cede that it wasn't all that powerful in the first place. Ultimately (and technically) one's membership in the Church (indeed, in any church) has nothing to do with it. Faith or morality or personal piety or virtues have nothing to do with it. If you were touched by a person that has it-and if they touched you with full intent to pass it on-then you have it, too. Just like cooties!

He told his sister-the-Sister that he did indeed know someone whom he believed radiated an extraordinary amount of good energy and recommend she contact Marc.9 Sister Martha called Marc and he agreed to come and give the school a good once-over. Several nights later, he was left alone in the building for the entire night. He systematically walked through and \"cleansed\" each room on every floor. It was nearly dawn be­ fore he finished. Sister Martha contacted him several days later and thanked him, adding that the building \"felt\" much better. That seemed to be that, and Marc didn't hear from Sister Martha until she called him again, a little over a year and a half later, to tell him something terrible was happening at the school. She went on to describe a string of misfortunes and tragedies that had befallen the staff, faculty members, and their families in the last thirty days. It started with a car crash in which a young administrative assistant and her baby were burned to death. A few days later, a teacher, a man in his late forties, announced he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He died within a week. The maintenance man severed a finger. The accountant fell and broke her hip. The staff was soon talking of a curse, and the more they talked, the worse things got. Every day brought a new and terrifying event: a broken bone, breast amputation, unexpected illness, murder or suicide in the famil y. To add to the litany of personal tragedies, the school building itself was starting to \"act\" strange ly.

A fluorescent light tube in a classroom ceiling burst, scattering shards of glass upon the heads of students. The entire administration had become paralyzed with fear. In whispered con­ versations in the teacher's lounge, they crystallized their collective terror and superstitiously personified the horrible chain of events as an attack by the devil himsel£ For the students, the most horrifying and traumatic event oc­ curred just hours before Sister Martha phoned my brother. Sister Catherine, the school's most beloved and popular teacher, a vibrant young woman in her mid-twenties with no known health issues, collapsed in her classroom and died in the throes of a grotesque and violent seizure before the eyes of her terrified pupils. Sister Martha was truly frightened and admitted frankly that she believed there was an evil presence in the school that needed to be exorcized. Marc confessed that exorcisms were a bit out of his line but said that his brother was a ceremonial magician and a con­ secrated Gnostic bishop who had participated in several exorcisms in the past. Sister Martha asked Marc to please contact me and see if we might be able to come to the school that night. Marc called me and repeated as much as he could. As you might imagine, this was something that interested me very much. I asked him to call Sister Martha and tell her we would both come and meet with her, and, if agreeable, stay the night in the building. I hung up the phone and I sat for a moment wondering what I had gotten myself into. How would I go about exorcising a school building? What was it exactly that I'd be exorcising?

It is with good reason that, when investigat­ ing hauntings and paranormal phenomena, the first question the professional investigator asks is, \"Is there a menstruating girl or woman in the house?\" The premise of Stephen King's novel and film Carrie is not that much of an exaggeration. And so, I was not at all surprised that the school building itself was capable of snagging and enraging a malignant force. What I didn't as yet know was exactly what that force was. Furthermore, I needed to figure out what magick formula would be appropriate for an operation such as this. My mind was spinning too fast. I needed to pull myself together.

You might think this somewhat presumptuous of me. After all, where does DuQuette get off creating demons? Aren't there already enough evil spirits running around the cosmos? I confess these questions didn't even occur to me, because for all intents and pur­ poses the staff, faculty, and students of Our Lady of Sorrows had already created the devilish spirit. They just didn't know its name. And, for the moment, neither did I. What's in a name? It is a universal axiom, promulgated by the magical traditions of nearly every age and culture, that discovering the name of a spiritual entity gives the magician power over it. Re­ call the story of Rumpelstiltskin. In traditional Solomonic magick or Goetia, the names of the seventy-two spirits are provided in the text.12 The book also contains the images of each spirit's \"sigil\" or seal. The seal is a very important ingredient in the recipe of evoca­ tion. Indeed, it is upon the seal in the Triangle that the spirit ap­ pears before the magician. Two copies of the sigil are used in the classic ceremony: one is drawn on a medallion that is worn around the magician's neck; the other is drawn on parchment and placed within the Triangle where the spirit will appear. The magician and the spirit are thus linked by the two sigils. The spirit is drawn to its own sigil, and then becomes trapped in the Triangle while the magician stands in the relative safety of the Circle.

Other magicians I'm sure will have their own ideas about how this is best done. On this occasion, I chose to use the pendulum. Over the years I've gained some pro­ ficiency applying this marvelous tool in magical and divinatory operations. My pendulum is a small brass plumb that was given to me many years ago by my dear friend Donald Weiser. It is at­ tached to a string about eighteen inches in length. I use it in a vari­ ety of ways, but for this task I would use it to determine a series of \"yes\" or \"no\" questions-a clockwise rotation indicating \"yes\" and a counterclockwise rotation indicating \"no.\" I went to the garage and got down the family's Scrabble13 game, opened it up, and emptied the lettered tiles on the living room cof­ fee table. I turned the tiles face down on the table and swirled them around for a moment. I then tied the string of my pendulum to the tip of my magick wand and began the process of selecting the let­ ters that spelled the name of the demon. It must have been quite a scene-a large man in a black robe sitting on the couch and dangling his wand and pendulum like a tiny fishing pole over each Scrabble tile while asking out loud to (seemingly) no one in particul ar, \"Is this a letter in name of the demon of Our Lady of Sorrows?\" About ten minutes later, the pendulum had chosen only three tiles, which I set aside (still face down) while I put the rest of the tiles back in the box. Then, one by one, the pendulum determined the order of the three letters in the spirit's name. I then turned the tiles over and, voila! The name was revealed. It was a funny looking name with no vowels: S L G. Would that be pronounced Slug? Slog? Slig? Sloog? Slyge? Sludge?

If these were Hebrew letters, they would probably be 0 (Samekh), '? (Lamed), and) (Gimel). Each Hebrew letter also represents a number. In this case Samekh = 60; Lamed = 30; and Gimel = 3. Together they total 93. Now, 93 is a pretty important number for many modern her­ metic Qabalists who, like me, subscribe to the magical doctrines ofThelema, 14 and the watchwords \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" and \"Love is the law, love under will.\" If you've ever corresponded with a Thelemite, you've perhaps noted that we begin our letters and e-mails with the former phrase and close with the latter. The words \"will\" and \"love\" in Greek are \"thelema'' and \"agape\" and each enumerate to 93. In informal communications and in social settings, Thelemite magicians often abbreviate these phrases to their numerical essence and simply greet each other with a friendly, \"93.\" This amused me at first, as if the demon were being playful. My amusement soon cooled as it occurred to me that the \"S\" in the spirit's name could also be treated as the Hebrew letter iV (Shin), whose number is 300, and in that case the name Sh L G would add to 333. I realize that not everyone reading this book is a magician or a hermetic Qabalist, and therefore should not be expected to appre­ ciate what all the fuss is concerning these numbers. But, for many modern magicians, no number carries more terrifYing implica­ tions than does 333. It is the number of the archdevil Choronzon, the dweller in that horrible pathless anti-region of the Tree of Life known as the Abyss. 14 From Wikipedia: \"Thelema is a philosophy or religion based on the dictum, 'Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law ... Love is the law, love under will,' as presented in Aleister Crowley's Book of the Law-- LiberAL vel Legis.

It is the final barrier preventing the true essence of the magician's consciousness from identifying com­ pletely with that of the Divine. The ego cannot make it through the Abyss; indeed nothing that the magician has heretofore con­ sidered \"self\" can pass through that awful non-place. If the \"cross­ ing\" is successful, what emerges on the other side is the equivalent of a Buddha-a Master of the Temple-a level of consciousness represented by the third Sephirah, Binah, on the Tree of Life. If unsuccessful, the magician (still clutching to and identifying with the false self of ego) falls into the Abyss and is lost in the perpet­ ual madness of a \"false\" Sephirah, Daath, closed off and separated from both the divine influence from above 1 5 and the merciful dis­ tractions of mundane consciousness from below. 1 6 Now, before any of us gets too carried away here, I want to make it perfectly clear that I presently dwell conspicuously low on the Tree of Life's initiatory ladder of consciousness. I do not believe that I was on that day, nor am I now, poised upon the precipice of that great initiatory crisis. But at the time I did interpret the num­ bers 93 and 333 to be an unmistakably personal two-part message to me from the demon, which I will vulgarly and succinctly boil down to something like this: • \"93\"-Hi Lon. I've got YOUR number, Mr. Hot-shot Thelemic Magician! and • \"333\"-Don't mess with me. Im one bad-ass demon! 15 The Sup erna l Tria d of the Tree of Life, Sephiroth 1, 2, and 3 (Kether, Chokmah, and Binah). 16 The seven Sephiroth below the Sup ernal Tria d of the Tree of Life, Sephiroth 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 (Chesed, Geburah, Tipha reth, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, and Maluth)."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"r6o Chapter Thirteen I'm not going to attempt to further explain the magical nuances implied by the manifestation of these numbers as they relate to the demon's name and my own magical career; neither do I wish to overstate or overdramatize the significance of either number 93 or 333 in this particular context.

I tied together the ends of the silk cord and arranged it on the floor to form a crude Circle. My Temple was ready. I sat down in the Circle, wand in hand. I took a moment to gaze into the Triangle at the yellow Post-it Note sigil of Slug-Shlug. Ev­ erything looked comically serene-the demon's sigil resting there next to the stick of burning incense, its tiny red coal politely spit­ ting up an undulating serpent of smoke. I closed my eyes and pro­ ceeded to mentally chant my Ganesha mantra and visualize the cosmic banishing/invocation dance I described in chapter 11. As always, the exercise did its magick. In just a few moments I was infinitely centered. I opened my eyes with the realization that con­ trary to all appearances there was no \"outside of myself\"-that I was one and the same with the Great G. Once thus firmly connected with the above, I proceeded to con­ nect with the below. I aimed my wand directly at the spirit's sigil and conjured Slug-Shlug into the Triangle. Most modern Solomonic magicians use the Lesser Key of Solo­ mon20 as their guidebook and script for evoking spirits. It is filled with page after page of addresses, conjurations, cures, and greater curses designed to cajole, threaten, or otherwise terrorize an unwill­ ing spirit into the Triangle. I believe, however, that these hypnotic and rambling speeches do not really serve to bamboozle the spirit into the Triangle, but rather, are designed to bamboozle the ma­ gician into confidently believing he or she has the full authori ty, power, and ability to do it!

It must have been pretty loud, because a bird that had been minding its own business outside my office window was startled into flight. The sound of its fluttering wings instantly summoned into the Triangle of my mind's eye the image of a huge Norwegian magpie. Again, I was surprised to the point of distraction. I have seen these marvelous birds many times on my visits to Norway and Eng­ land. They are more audacious and mischievous than crows or ra­ vens, and because of their thieving habits and reputation for eating the eggs and babies of other birds, they are held in superstitious awe by many European cultures. In England, the appearance of a single magpie is an omen of great evil that can only be warded off by re­ spectfully saluting the solitary bird. \"I' h \" . k d m ere, 1t squaw e . \"I salute you,\" I answered. Such conversational exchanges with demons are difficult to de­ scribe because the answers from the spirit enter the mind of the ma­ gician on the same brainwaves that carry the questions.

Sister Martha stood outside the door on the side of the main building and indicated where we should park. She was a rather small woman in her mid-forties wearing a black skirt and simple gray suit jacket over a white blouse. I was disappointed she was not decked out in full medieval drag. Still, if I were asked to pick out the nun in room full of women, she'd have been my choice. After introductions, Sister Martha gave us a brief tour of the building, pointing out the locations of various \"supernatural\" man­ ifestations as we went along. We spent several minutes in the class­ room that witnessed the death of young Sister Catherine, and the tour ended at the faculty lounge and the administrative staff area. The lounge seemed innocuous enough, but I was immediately disturbed by the layout of the staff area, which was reminiscent of the nightmarish set designs of early German expressionist films. It was an asymmetrical and chaotic maze of misshapen cubicles completely devoid of clean right angles or unobstructed lines of sight. The office of the vice principal was the only enclosed office; its large windows provided a perfect overview of the panorama of chaos. I am by no means an expert on feng shui, but I couldn't help but think this entire area was surely a serious impediment to any kind of energy flow-a severe case of chi constipation if I ever saw one! The whole scene would have been comical had it not been so overpoweringly claustrophobic and suffocating. The area was acces­ sible by only one door that opened onto the hallway. Just standing there made me gasp for air and want to run away , but it was here that Sister Martha lingered as she related details of the specific trag­ edies and misfortunes that had recently befallen the poor souls who labored for their daily bread in that warped little trapezoidal hell."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"172 C h apter T h irteen She had, in fact, prepared a one -sheet dossier (complete with name, age, picture, job tide, and the sad details of each victim's particular afRiction, accident, or tragedy), which she clipped to the hanging in-box attached outside each victim's door or cubical en­ trance. For example: jane Doe-34-accountant-(picture) Fractured arm while recovering from breast surgery. Office formerly occupied by janet Doe who perished with baby in car fire. Marc and I were impressed. Before she left us to our work, we sat down for a few minutes in her office to chat. She told us that she had been busy all afternoon arranging the school's memorial service for Sister Catherine. She was visibly upset and very tired. She told us we would have access to the entire building up until 6:00 a.m. when people would start arriving for the next school day. There would be only one other person in the building during the night, Larry the IT man, who did his computer duties at night. She rang Larry in his office and asked him to please come to her office. When he appeared, Sister Martha introduced him to Marc and me and told him we would be in the building for several hours during the night doing \"some work\" for her, adding that we had her permission to go anywhere in the building and that he was not to disturb us. Larry was a gaunt man, perhaps forty years old, in jeans and a dark gray T-shirt. He seemed a bit high-strung, and I got the clear impression that he viewed us with suspicion. \"What kind of work?\" Larry asked nervo usly . \"Nothing at all to do wi� be disturbing you,\" Sister Marc or I could respond.

She then thanked us again for coming, presented us with a check (a very generous figure, we thought, for such an intangible service), and said she'd leave us to our work. She opened her handbag and was fishing for her car keys when her cell phone rang. She plucked it from her purse, flipped it open, and answered. \"Yes dear. How are you doing?\" She obviously knew the caller. Then after a long moment of silence, Sister Martha sat down and sighed, \"Oh dear, when?

REGAN, FROM The Exorcist Marc and I were in a pretty somber mood after Sister Martha left. Marc said he would like to systematically go through the building as he had done previously and when he was finished would wait for me in the faculty lounge. I told him I would more or less fol­ low in his wake. We conferred for a few minutes in the hallway as we confirmed our respective routes through the school. As the faculty lounge would be our base camp and final meeting place, we agreed we would both start there. I waited in the hallway while Marc did his thing. When he was done, he went on his way and I reentered the lounge and prepared myself for the magical marathon to come. I sat down in the most comfortable chair in the room and put my briefcase on my lap. I dosed my eyes, took a couple of deep breaths and repeated my Ganesha banishing/invocation mantra and visualization. Then I reluctantly got up out of my comfY chair, loosened my tie, unbuttoned the collar of my shirt, and fished out the medallion bearing the image of the Pentagram and the sigil of Slug-Shlug. I arranged it so it neatly hung over my tie. I then re­ buttoned my collar and slid the knot of my tie trimly against my throat. For some reason, I felt it was vitally important for me to ap­ pear as \"professional\" as possible. I opened my briefcase and again anointed my head with a tiny dab of Oil of Abramelin, popped on my yarmulke, clipped my juror's badge hexagram to my shirt pocket, and put on my bishop's stole.

I looked into the helpless eyes of God and uttered this thirty-three-word oath. L Tau LameJ21 swear by everything I hold sacred, that I will not leave this building until I have exorcised the spirit that torments this school and those who labor and study here. I lit the small votive candle and turned off all the other lights in the room. I then removed my wand from its bag and proceeded ban­ ish, purify, consecrate, and seal the room in the following manner: • With the wand, I performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. • With the wand, I performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. • I purified the room by sprinkling the four quarters with holy water, and announced, \"This room is purified with water.\" • I consecrated the room by approaching the four quarters with the votive candle in hand. With it, I \"drew\" an equal-armed cross in the air at each quarter, and announced, \"This room is consecrated with fire.\" • I suffumigated the room by approaching the four quarters with burning rosemary , which I kept igniting from the flame of the votive candle that I carried from quarter to quarter on the lid of the saucepan (which also served as my ashtray). 21 Tau Lamed (or T.

I then forcefully expelled my breath as I swept my hand down in front of me and to the side and back of my body as I shouted, \"Apo pantos kakodaimonos!\" (Greek for \"away [and/ or behind me] evil spirits!\") • Upon leaving the newly banished, purified, and consecrated area, I sealed the room by dabbing Oil of Abramelin on my fingertip and \"painting\" a pentagram upon the inside of the door, and three Tau Crosses (T) on the outside of the door (one each on the left, right, and upper door posts).22 As I drew the Tau Crosses, I whispered the words, \"In nomine Babalon Amen. Restriction unto Choronzon!\"23 For the next two and a half hours, I systematically repeated these seven steps in every room and hallway of the building I could ac­ cess. The second to the last area I cleared in this manner was Sister Martha's office and its adjoining bathroom. I remember thinking she must be a truly good person. Her office was a sane and calm oasis in an otherwise troubled and disturbed universe. I wanted to linger there, but it was getting late and I knew the most difficult part of the evening was still before me. I sealed Sister Martha's office with three sweet cinnamon-scented crosses and crossed the hallway to descend into the feng shui hell of the administrative staff area.

I came at last to the semi-private office of the vice principal. Here I would resume the evocation that I had put \"on ice\" so many hours ago back home. Like old Mr. Jacobs, the janitor in my vision, I had swept the filth of the entire building into one neat pile. I chose this area for the final showdown for several reasons. First, it had the most room for me to work. Second, all of its walls (including the one with the door and windows that opened to the common area) reached from floor to ceiling. It seemed like the nerve center of the problem and the perfect venue to trap a de­ mon. Lastly, I have to confess, I took perverse pleasure in remem­ bering how in my rambunctious school days I had confronted several other rather obnoxious demons in a high school vice prin­ cipal's office. Those of my readers who are experienced magicians can imagine my state of mind after spending so many hours of banishing, etc. Even simple ceremonies such as these raise a remarkable amount of energy and require an intense level of concentration just to hold the visualizations in place. I was physically exhausted yet at the same time psychically energized. Very few times in my magical ca­ reer had I reached this exalted level of spiritual intoxication. By the time I reached the VP's office, the borderline between the material and the magical worlds had essentially vanished. To say I was hal­ lucinating would be an understatement. For hours now, my penta­ grams and hexagrams had hung visibly in the air around me, and each time I spat out the words, \"Apo pantos kakodaimonos!\" every spirit entity, good or evil, went scurrying off to anywhere in the building that had not been cleared and sealed off by the wild-eyed"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"q8 Chapter Thirteen exorcist. The only place left for all that concentrated smutch to take refuge was here-and the air in the room hung thick with the stinking demonic chum of the entire building. I slapped Slug-Shlug's little Post-it-Note sigil and Triangle on the desk pad of the VP's desk and stepped back a few feet. I checked to make sure I was still wearing my yarmulke, magical juror's badge, and the medallion bearing the pentagram and the demon's sigil. Lastly, I patted the outside of my shirt to assure myself that I was safely wrapped in my magical circle. Everything being in order, I aimed my wand at the Triangle and commanded as before, \"Slug­ Shlug! Come! Slug-Shlug appeared immediately- quietly, peacefully, as if only a moment had passed since our last encounter-a large, handsome Norwegian magpie perched pleasantly upon his yellow Post-it Note. I marveled at how normal it all seemed. I was almost happy to see him, grateful for his exotic and dangerous companionship amid this cowed and colorless hell of a Catholic school. His presence made the evening come suddenly alive and interesting. Like a fool, I initiated a conversation. \"Why do you torment these people?\" \"Is it evil for the crow to feast upon the eyes of a dangling knight?\" Right now, as I'm writing these words, they appear on the page to be melodramatic and corny, like something pulled from a de­ monic fortune cookie. At the time, however, they sounded any­ thing but corny. In fact, Slug-Shlug's response took my breath away. In my fevered brain, the allusion was unmistakable. The de­ mon was describing the doom of the luckless Knights of the Round Table who failed in their quest for the Holy Grail; they were hung from trees like obscene fruit, and their eyes were plucked out and eaten by crows.

But then, I realized that he wasn't being silent, and that the accusatory voice I was hearing was that of the demon and not my own inner so­ liloquy. It was the damned magpie that tormented me with these thoughts, these ideas, these images. I had to hand it to Slug-Shlug; this was classic demonic behavior and I had fallen for it hard. My concentration had been severely bro­ ken and as soon as I realized what was going on, Slug-Shlug started to flap his wings and lift himself into the air.

You son of a bitch!\" Every ounce of will flowed through my extended arm and out the barrel of my wand. It took everything I had to bring the great bird down upon the Tr iangle. The moment his talons touched down, I heard a noise outside in the hallw ay. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw the door to the staff area suddenly swing open. \"Oh! Sorry!\" was all Larry the IT man could say after barging into a smoky , candle-lit room to find a red-faced wizard in a yar­ mulke and a bishop's stole aiming a stick at a tiny yellow Post-it Note. I did not move; neither did I take my eyes off the Tr iangle. With the same strange voice that called forth Slug-Shlug, I snarled at poor Larry through gritted teeth, \"You're going to have to leave, Larry!\" Larry left. That did it! No more talking to Slug-Shlug. I didn't care any more why I was doing this. I didn't care whether or not I was here because of my ego or my insecurities or my karma or my duty or my goddamned spiritual quest. Screw my motives! Screw good and evil! I was here, doing what I was doing because the universe had conspired to put me in this place. That was enough! The momen­ tum of my life put me here and I wasn't going to leave until the job was finished. There would be no attempts to redeem this spirit. I would not fart around trying to cajole, torture, banish, exile, or otherwise attempt to reprogram this monster into an \"angel of light.\" I was insanely angry-filled with a rage that exploded from my heart and arm, and through the death-ray gun of my wand.

Neither of us shared many details of our labors. I did mention that Larry had burst in on me at the climax of my conjuration. We giggled uncomfor tably for a mo­ ment, then fell silent as we both realized that Larry's office was the only place in the building neither of us had worked on. At that moment the door opened and Larry poked his head in. \"Sorry if we bothered you, Larry .\" I said with more than a hint of sarcasm. \"I just wanted to make sure you guys were all right. What was it that you were doing?\" Larry was visibly agitated. Marc shot back an answer. \"Just helping out Sister Martha. You'll have to ask her for details.\" \"Well, if it has anything to do with the computers, I'm doing a backup tonight and it will take a while.\" \"Nothing to do with your computers.\" I told him. ''And we're done for the night.\" Larry said nothing in response. He just lin­ gered in the door way for a moment as if unsure what to do or say next. Marc and I were indeed done for the night.

I woke up early of day replayed the events of exorcism and harbored little everything I was capable of do- The Exorcism of Our Lady of Sorrows 183 ing. However, I was convinced that Sister Martha would need to address a couple of very serious issues if the school was ever to become psychically healthy-the most obvious (and the easiest to correct) being the layout of the administrative staff area. I would be completely remiss in my exorcist's duty if I neglected to advise Sister Martha in the strongest terms to immediately hire a com­ mercial feng shui consultant to rearrange the area. My second concern would be more difficult to address head-on, because it dealt exclusively with my own very personal and sub­ jective impressions. I had to be very careful as to how I would go about advising Sister Martha on this issue; I'm referring, of course, to the issue of Larry. Please don't misunderstand me. Not in my wildest magical fan­ tasies did I suspect Larry was consciously some kind of Satanic minion-a \"Renfield\" to Slug-Shlug's Dracula. I had no reason to believe that he was anything more or less than a harmless IT nerd doing his best every night to make a living. But his insecurit y, par­ anoid behavior, and willingness to defy Sister Martha's instructions led me to question, at the very least, his personal integrity and emotional stabili ty. I am not a mental health expert, and my im­ pressions are totally subjective, but Larry's conduct and demeanor left me with the distinct impression that he was a very disturbed man; and very disturbed men make effective conduits, capacitors (condensers), storage batteries, and amplifiers of magical and psy­ chic energy . You may beg the question, \"Did the evil school building make Larry crazy, or did crazy Larry make the school building evil?\" It does not matter. Larry was likely every bit a victim as Sister Cath­ erine, or the maintenance man who cut off his finger. As a magi­ cian, however, I cannot ignore the obvious.

I strongly believed that for the good of the school, and for Larry's own good, he should be removed from that environment. I called Marc, and we discussed our conclusions. Marc then called Sister Martha and told her that the staff area needed a feng shui professional to rearrange things. Being inclined to embrace New Age concepts, she enthusiastically agreed and said she would do that immediately. Marc then mentioned that we both had our serious concerns about Larry-that he twice interrupted us and made us feel un­ comfortable. She then confided that she too was uncomfortable with Larry working there at night and that there were other issues she didn't want to share regarding his character and \"habits.\" She said she was probably going to soon let him go. I wish I had a more colorful and dramatic way to end this story, but I don't. I think that's probably a good thing. Several months later Marc asked his Reiki instructor how his sister was and how things were going at Our Lady of Sorrows. He told Marc as far as he knew things were going fine.

And so, I'm always extra restless on Christmas morning-rest­ less, like a child who doesn't know which new toy to play with first. Restless to create something with my energy. One Christmas morning about thirty years ago, I got up early and melted a bag­ ful of candle stubs into a round Christmas cookie tin. I munched cookies while I waited for the wax to cool in the refrigerator. Then I popped the thick wax disk out of the tin and set to work carv­ ing the intricate design of Dr. John Dee's famous Sigillium Dei Aemeth. Constance made me do this messy, waxy work out on the cold back porch, but I didn't care. It was my Christmas present to my child-self, and a very good present it has turned out to be. I immediately put it to work contacting angels and it has remained the centerpiece of my Enochian magical work these thirty-odd (very odd) years. Like a magick carpet, it has carried me around the world; it has been the inspiration for two books and countless classes, lectures, and workshops. Most importa ntly, it has helped me travel to other worlds, other dimensions-heavens. Can I truthfully say (like the title of this chapter suggests) that all this magick, all these experiences have merely taken place \"in my head\"? Yes.

It is also true that not everyone who buys it and takes it home will read it from cover to cover. So, just in case these opening remarks are the only words you will ever read from this book, I'm going to immediately exploit this fleeting moment we have together and impart to you in large uppercase letters the most important secret of magick- and of life: DO NOT BE AFRAID! Now! If you're short on time, please feel free to set the book down and fearlessly get on with your life. -LON MILO DUQUETTE A NOTORIOUS MAGICIAN'S MEMOIR: OUTRAGEOUS TRUE STORIES AND AUTHENTIC MAGICAL THEORY Take a fascinating journey into the life of one of the most respected, sought­ after, and renowned magicians alive today: Lon Milo DuQuette. In this follow-up to his popular autobiography, My Life with the Spirits, DuQuette tells how a friend was cursed by a well-known foreign filmmaker and how they removed that curse with a little help from Shakespeare. He explains how, as a six-yea r-old, he used the Law of Attraction to get a date with Linda Kaufman, the most beautiful girl in first grade. DuQuette also re­ veals the ins and outs of working with demons and provides a compelling acc ount of performing an exorcism at a private Catholic high scho ol. As entertaining as they are informative, the true stories in this memoir contain authentic magical theory and invaluable technical information. Lon Milo DuQuette is a preeminent scholar, magician, and speaker.
