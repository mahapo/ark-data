I, perhaps morethan anyone else on Earth, understand the author's reasons for choosing to inferthat the text represents a pseudepigraphic effort of his own. To men and womenof integrity, a spiritual oath of secrecy is a serious and burdensomecommitment, and Mr. DuQuette, by means of this elaborate literary charade, hasobviously fulfilled his obligations admirably. I, on the other hand, am bound byno such covenants, and because I, too, am compiling a record of the events of mylife with the Master, I am grateful to Mr. DuQuette for allowing me to sharesome of my memories.It was a wet and stormy night when first I met the Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. Iwas a young chela of an occult Order then attending initiations in A….., abeautiful old German town. I remember the moment distinctly. I was standing on astack of chairs wielding a huge Japanese katana, swinging it round with ease toimpress the assembled neophytes with my skill in the oriental arts, when I wasapproached by a rotund figure, his beard wafting in the breeze from my blade.“Little Brother!” he commanded me in a loud voice, “You have been meddling withthe Qabalah!”The throng around me seemed to shrink away at his imperious, if somewhatsqueaky, voice. I stood transfixed by his gaze, the sword held high above myhead. For a long second, there was no sound.“No I haven't,” I stated calmly, “But I don't mind having it meddle with me.”He looked at me quizzically, seeming to examine my face intently, then turned onhis heel and walked away. In my mind I had a sudden flash of insight. I leaptdown from my post and ran after him, throwing myself at his feet.“Master!” I exclaimed, for 1 now knew I was in the presence of a member of thatmystical, mythical Great White Brotherhood I had sought for so long, “Take me asyour pupil—please!”“I can't do that,” he said, “The Qabalah is not for charismatic rock stars suchas yourself. It can only be mastered by one who has already lived a full life.You must be married and have accumulated more wealth before you can study as atrue Rabbi of the Lord.”“But Master, there must be a way—I'll be your secretary, clean your house, shineyour shoes, anything! But I must learn the true knowledge behind themeaninglessness of Number and Symbol that is my only learning up until thismoment.”“Well, pop by the house the next time you are in the States, we'll see what wehave for you!” His eyes twinkled. I knew I'd been given a challenge. Did I havethe dedication to throw away my life for this man, and become his servant in theHoly Wisdom of the Qabalah? Sure I did!So it was, and months later I stepped off a plane in New York City, all mybelongings packed in a small bag over my shoulder, in search of enlightenment. Ihad heard that the Rabbi ran a small community in Montauk, composed of onlythose true initiates that he had personally selected. However, try as I might, Iknew of no one who knew the identity of even one of those initiates, sosecretive was the Order to which they belonged. Over the next years I was tofind out why.The Order (I won't give its true name here) was descended from an ancient sectof Essenes who had begun the study of Qabalah after the fall of the biblicalTower of Babel. Their belief was, and is, that any who study the Holy Wisdomshare the danger of those unwise Master Builders of old, whose pride led Jehovahto punish them for daring to come before His Countenance. Thus the Order membersvow themselves to complete anonymity on their initiation, so that the Lordcannot find and punish them for their spiritual hubris. Now I understood why theRabbi, although versed in the wisdom of the Holy Qabalah like no man in thiscentury, had published nothing; indeed his name was unknown even in the occultcircles in which I had previously moved.I was to become one of the lucky few intimates of the Rabbi during my stay. Ashis secretary, I had access to many of his communications—both material andspiritual. For the former, I was amazed at his contacts around the world. Onewould never know who he'd be talking to from one day to the next—from a bum inthe street in Seattle (“one of the greatest magi currently alive,” according tothe Rabbi) to a leading politician in Europe (“well, he tries hard,” spoken witha deep sigh).His spiritual communications were no less intriguing—he spoke frequently toGoetic spirits and Enochian angels, often over afternoon tea (Earl Grey seemedespecially efficacious for this purpose). I rapidly became proficient inshorthand, and always kept a pencil and pad handy—and an eraser, for, as theRabbi put it: “Those guys can often benefit from a bit of judicious editing.”There were many sunny afternoons when we sat together in the garden over a hugepot of steaming tea while the Rabbi pontificated and argued with his InvisibleSuperiors over the future direction of the Order's work. The notes I took filledseveral boxes, and I was amazingly grateful for the invention of the AppleMacintosh computer which allowed me to finally dump the Rabbi's ancientBurroughs typing machine.Always, always, I asked the Rabbi when I could become a full initiate of theMysteries; and always received the same answer: that I must be more successful,more wealthy, married, and fruitful before I could even think of beingconsidered as a potential Rabbi myself.“But,” I protested, “You need someone to carry on your work, Master!”And in those moments his eyes would fall on the picture of Mr. DuQuette1[part0020.html#front_ft1] that he kept on his desk, along with those of theother initiates.“Perhaps…,” and he would say no more.Be that as it may, I zealously continued my studies and practices, andeventually it became obvious to all at the Montauk center that I was becomingthe Master's favorite. Naturally this gave rise to jealousy and the pettyintrigues that are the bane of monastic societies.My chief adversary was a quiet, passive-aggressive student who presumptuouslyrenamed himself Gizmo Ben Lamed. He could type faster than I, and continuallyjockeyed for my position as Master's secretary. One day, in front of Master andthe other pupils, he challenged me to a typing duel. Like a fool I accepted, forto decline would have meant instant victory for Ben Lamed.My defeat was the beginning of the end for my career at Montauk. Gizmo continuedto poison the minds of the members of the Order against me, and the Masteradvanced other neophtyes while I was kept at a low degree. Still, I knew hesecretly liked me more than the others, for as he was wont to quote on the manyoccasions when he cuffed me round the side of the head, “Whom I love, I chastisewith many rods.”One day I could stand it no longer. I burst into the Master's sanctum. “I DEMANDto be finally made an initiate of the Qabalah!” I shouted, “Teach me the secretsthat lie within the Numbers and the Cards!” Too late, the Rabbi was sittinghunched over his desk accompanied by Gizmo Ben Lamed, both intently examiningwhat appeared to be an ancient Indian illustrated treatise on advanced magicaltechniques. They looked up at me.“Impossible!” boomed the Master. “You are far too young and inexperienced. Why,you're not even married!” My face fell. He was right. He, on the other hand, hadsomehow tricked a beautiful young girl named Constance into his clutches yearsbefore. The rumor was that he had used certain forbidden magical methods to doso, but of that I have no proof—yet. But to continue my history…Before I could answer, the Rabbi raised a restraining hand and turned to Gizmo.“He must be given a chance. He must do as our forefathers did, and go to thedesert for 40 days and 40 nights to be tried in the pure sight of the Lord. Ifhe survives, it will be clear proof that he has achieved the insignificance thatbefits a true member of our Order, and can be initiated in due course. Cuddles”(he always called Gizmo that name for reasons that are still unclear to me),“You will take him in the morning to be tried. He must find the limits of theCity of God.”Gizmo glared at me, but even he could not go against the mighty Will of theRabbi.That night I could hardly sleep, no matter how comfortably I arranged my bed ofgorse. In the morning I would finally get my chance to prove myself. I knew Icould do it. Promptly about four hours after sunrise I heard the telltale soundof a Volkswagen camper pull up in the front yard. I ran out and jumped into theseat. Without a word I was blindfolded with a bright canary yellow cloth and wetook off. We drove in silence for four days. I knew Ben Lamed and others in thevan were burning with jealousy. How I would show them!At high noon of the fourth day we stopped, and I was ceremoniously dumped out ofthe van, which roared off in an unknown direction. I took off my blindfold, tookout my trusty Boy Scout knife, and began my walkabout through the desert,putting my faith in the Lord's ability to overlook me until I had found the signI was looking for. For many days I walked, without real food and water (though Idid find a McDonalds by the side of the road that helped a lot). I saw visionsof angels with spreading dark wings and demons in the form of beautiful Thaiwomen who tempted me with their slim seductive bodies. But still I prevailed,looking only for that sign that would show me the true Way that I desired.Finally that day came. I had almost given up hope. My vision was blurred, mymind blank. I tottered on the brink of despair. Then I saw it. The sign. THEsign. The sign that I had looked for day and night since leaving New York:images [../images/00004.jpeg]Here in a blinding flash was the answer I sought. For was it not man's True Willthat raised us to the state between mere animal existence and divinity? And didnot the Number 93 epitomize that True Will?2 [part0020.html#front_ft2] I hadsought the limits of the City of God, and here they were, within my own Will,stated plainly within the Holy Qabalah. I marveled once again at the wisdom ofRabbi Lamed Ben Clifford who had brought me to this place, and at thematerialization of the Qabalah upon Earth. Eagerly I strode forward to LasVegas.Once there I began my studies in earnest. I spent innumerable hours in thecasinos, enmeshed in understanding the subtle patterns within the Numbers, thearchetypal forces embodied in the Cards, and the Dionysian pleasures brought tome by the Lord's own cocktail waitresses. I knew that I could not return to theRabbi without fulfilling the duties he had expounded to me, so for 40 days andnights I threw myself into my work with a passion.My practical studies had led to great things. I was now a wealthy and successfulman, with a lovely Asian wife I had found on the Internet. It was time to returnto the bosom of the Rabbi. I packed my bags and set off for the Hermetichomeland of Montauk.I turned up at the Rabbi's home. The days had not been kind to him. He lookedold and worn, his arms held up by Gizmo Ben Lamed, who was unfortunately stillaround. I wasted no time in demanding to be finally initiated into the secretsof the Order. How could they refuse me now? I threw my bag down on my oldfamiliar gorse and fell into a deep and satisfied sleep.The morning dawned bright and clear, and I was brought before the Rabbi, nowdressed as I had never before seen him, as a Priest of the Ancient Mysteries.For an old man, he still looked pretty good in a leopard skin. I cannot tell youdetails of the next seventeen hours, but at the end, he laid his hands upon me.His hands jerked convulsively upon my now-shaven head, pouring his magicalessence into me, “I am now about to consecrate, ordain, raise, and confirm you,an initiate of the Mysteries of….., now and forever. But first you will repeatafter me the Terrible Oath of Secrecy.”He fell forward, his arms around me with joy. After a few minutes the positionbegan to get a little uncomfortable, but I endured his weight nonetheless. Icould hear Gizmo prompting the Rabbi with the Terrible Oath of Secrecy, but theRabbi did not stir. Then his body slowly slid to the floor, a horrificexpression on his face. He was dead.The Doctor said it was pulmonary infarction. I knew better. With his initiationof me, his life's work was complete. I was now his Follower.A few short months after this I received a call from my old friend, the famousoccult editor (and fellow initiate) B., apprising me of Mr. DuQuette's intentionto publish the Rabbi's legendary lost manuscripts on the Chicken Qabalah andinsinuate that Ben Clifford was merely a figment of his own imagination and theworks were his own!I was outraged. As the true heir to the Master's work, I felt that I and I alonecould explain it—for was I not the first and only initiate of our Order never tobe sworn to secrecy? The Lord had struck our Master down in order that I mightbe allowed to speak the truth to the world about Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford.However, after reading DuQuette's lovingly respectful editing and introductionsto the texts, I must confess he has done an admirable job. I certainly cannotfault him for exploiting his own celebrated status to bring the works of thisgreat Qabalist to the general public.And so, dear reader, here for the first time you have the Master's work in yourhands. I cannot completely condone its provinance, though I bow to itsmagnificent simplicity of thought—a small but perfectly formed nugget ofQabalistic wisdom. I hope you enjoy it. In the words of the Master's favoritemagical expression: V.I.T.R.I.O.L.!—Rodney OrpheusLos Angeles, California"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION CONFESSIONby Lon Milo DuQuetteFor hundreds of years a small but zealous number of orthodox1[part0020.html#itr_ft1] Jewish men have preserved a complex and highlystructured tradition of study and meditation, based partly upon an intenseanalysis of the Hebrew scriptures and Talmudic texts, and partly upon thewritings of several influential thinkers of the Medieval and Renaissanceperiods. These pious and dedicated Kabbalists2 [part0020.html#itr_ft2] absorbedthemselves passionately in a perpetual quest for the revealed word of God.Parallel to this, for hundreds of years non-Jewish mystics have seized many ofthe tools of Qabalistic study and applied them to Christian,3[part0020.html#itr_ft3] heretical, magical4 [part0020.html#itr_ft4] and, mostrecently, New Age paradigms. This latter group, while not discarding completelythe fascination with the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, focuses primarily onthe consciousness-expanding benefits derived from the practice of Qabalisticmeditative exercises rather than the parochial revelations resulting fromscriptural exegesis.KABBALAH-CABALA-QABALAHUnderstandably, orthodox Kabbalists do not have much respect for Cabalists andQabalists, and, from their point of view, this snobbery is well justified.Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that great spiritual benefit can be derivedfrom Qabalistic thought and exercise, even if the student chooses not to embracethe Hebrew religion, or make a spiritual commitment to traditions or articles offaith which may be incongruent or irrelevant to his or her spiritual worldview.At the present time, disciples of the non-traditional Qabalah represent a muchwider spectrum of seekers than that of the orthodox community. Included in thisbroad band of Qabalistic dabblers are mathematicians, physicists, psychologists,entertainers, as well as students and practitioners of the Western Hermetictraditions of esoteric Freemasonry, Tarot, Ceremonial Magick, Rosicrucianism,Astrology, and Alchemy. With all due homage and respect to the adepts andtraditions of the orthodox Hebrew Kabbalah, it is to this larger group ofunorthodox (or non-orthodox) Qabalists that this book is addressed.QABALAH—FUNNY?For the last twenty years I have attempted to introduce the Qabalah to studentsof Tarot and Ceremonial Magick, in particular to those who are interested in thework of the Golden Dawn and/or Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis. Thescope of this work is relatively narrow, and deals primarily with the meaningsand numerical equivalents of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the mysteriesof the schematic diagrams known as the “Tree of Life,” and the “Cube of Space,”and the various exercises with which the diligent student “connects everythingin the universe with everything else until there is no ‘anything' left.”Early on, I discovered that I could quickly convey the fundamentals by usingsimple anecdotes and metaphors. As the years progressed, these homespun taleshave become increasingly colorful, outrageous and, in my humble opinion, quiteamusing. Moreover, students and critics repeatedly tell me that they seem toabsorb and retain the information more efficiently (and have a better chance ofstaying awake) when the material is presented to them in this manner.When I began to organize the material for this book, I realized that the vastmajority of readers would not be familiar with my personality and the subtlenuances of my comedic timing. I knew that, if I were to plunge the unsuspectingreader directly into the waters of my Qabalistic fairyland, the poor souls wouldimmediately imagine themselves drowned in pure silliness. So I turned to aliterary device that has a long and distinguished history in the world ofQabalistic literature—pseudepigraphy, or the ascription of false names ofauthors to certain works. Revered Hebrew scholar, Gershom G. Scholem wrote:For a long time we have known that literary forgeries represent a flight intoanonymity and pseudonymity just as often as they indicate trickery; and not fornothing have we retained the foreign word, “pseudepigrapha” to designate inparticular a legitimate category of religious literature…the Zohar is the mostimportant but by far not the only example of such love of masquerade in Jewishliterature.5 [part0020.html#itr_ft5]I decided to do just what Rabbi Moshe de Leon did when he wrote the Zohar,6[part0020.html#itr_ft6] in the 13th century. He credited authorship to afictitious holy man, Rabbi Shimon Ben Yohai, a second-century victim of theRoman persecution who, while hiding for thirteen years in a cave, was inspiredby God to write the Zohar. Scholars may debate whether de Leon or a contemporarywas actually the author of the Zohar, but none considers the text to befraudulent in the ordinary sense of the word. It is obviously based on mucholder material and the practice of ascribing ancient authorship to documents wasa common and accepted practice in those days. So why not today?For my purposes I invented Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, legendary l'enfant terribleof the modern Qabalisitic movement. Ben Clifford has afforded me the opportunityto soar to outrageous (and hopefully) memorable heights and, when necessary,stand apart from the silliness to highlight the golden eggs of Qabalistic wisdomnested therein. This may smack a bit of schizophrenia, and I must admit I haveenjoyed being the Rabbi's biographer and critic. I hope the reader will also beable to suspend his or her disbelief long enough to join in the fun and learnthe fundamentals of the Qabalah.While it is certainly not my intention to offend anyone with Rabbi BenClifford's escapades, it is perhaps inevitable that the format of this book willchafe the sensibilities of those who have forgotten that spiritual discovery canbe a joyous experience and that great truths can be transmitted through themedium of laughter. To each and every one of you who finish this little book andstill feel offended by its content or style, I offer you in advance my sincereand profound apology.I also caution and rebuke all hatemongers and bigots whose dangerous pathologiesand diseased minds would interpret my playful treatment of Jewish themes asbeing anything other than lovingly good-natured.Now that's been said, I think it is time to sit back, suspend your disbelief andpretend for a few hours that Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford is real. Listen carefullyto what he has to say. I did—and now I'm proud to say, “Hell yes! I'm a ChickenQabalist!”"},{"pageContent":"0WHO WAS RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD?First of all, I feel I must apologize to the reader for the unusual format ofthis book. The raw material came from wildly varied sources and I confess myediting skills were severely challenged. With the exception of The TenCommand-Rants and Commentary, which appeared in the Winter 1989 issue of Gomermagazine, and his 1992 interview in Augury Today magazine, all of Ben Clifford'swritings were unpublished and unedited. Several articles were written aslectures to the imaginary students of his equally imaginary “ZerubbabelInstitute of Philosophical Youth,” and others, like “Frequently Asked Questionsabout Chicken Qabalah,” were compiled from letters written to students aroundthe world. Arguably, the most unusual section of the book is the uneditedscreenplay text from his Let's Learn Chicken Qabalah, a never-produced videodocumentary. Try as I might, I was unable to translate this remarkable work intostraight text without losing vitally important information provided by visualgimmicks and queues from the Rabbi's delightfully twisted imagination.Before July 23, 1997, when his disciples reported him missing, Rabbi Lamed BenClifford was virtually unknown to the world of modern esotericism. The fewindividuals who knew of the man and his work were violently polarized in theiropinions. Most dismissed him as a mad and impudent charlatan. A tiny number,however, passionately embraced his “Chicken Qabalah,” and reveled in hisirreverent and sometimes offensive style, proclaiming it “dust in the eyes ofthe profane.”There is no question about it, Ben Clifford was in many respects an unabashedphony. He was a fraud from the insipid propeller atop his yarmulke to the“talismanic” lifts in his shoes. He most certainly was not a bona fide Rabbi.Despite his protestations to the contrary, he held no academic degrees orcertificates of rabbinical training. He was not the president of the ZerubbabelInstitute of Philosophical Youth (Z.I.P.Y.), nor, to the best of my knowledge,has such an organization ever existed. His name was obviously bogus and thosethat knew of his passion for sweet-and-sour pork will confirm that he probablydid not consider himself a practicing Jew.On the other hand, it appears no one was ever harmed by Ben Clifford'schicanery. To my knowledge, he was never accused of any crime more serious thanthat of bad taste. No one has ever denied that he was extremely well-read, andthat some time in his nebulous past he most certainly achieved deep and profoundlevels of spiritual illumination. Be that as it may, I did not write this bookas a defense of this colorful eccentric, but to introduce the golden treasuresof the man's thoughts to a broader audience.I'm sure it will be apparent to the reader who is already well versed on thesubject, that Ben Clifford's teachings are far from an exhausting exposition ofthe myriad (sometimes conflicting) doctrines of the Qabalah. For example, heomits altogether any discussion of the Qliphoth or the false Sephirah Daath. Healso chose to adhere exclusively to the venerable, yet simplistic, doctrine of afour-part division of the soul, ignoring (at least in print) the more complextheories which posit a greater Neshamah subdivided intoNeshamah-Chiah-Yechidah.1 [part0020.html#chap0_ft1]However, I caution the adept reader against jumping to the conclusion that BenClifford's teachings in any way “dumbs-down” the Qabalah. He has, in my opinion,accomplished the nearly impossible task of distilling to its essence one of themost (if not the most) complex spiritual sciences in the world. He offers thenew student the opportunity to grasp the big Qabalistic picture before he or shefeels obliged to start (as the Rabbi wrote) “counting the nostril hairs of God.”At the same time, his unpretentious approach to the subject serves to remind theveteran Qabalist (who perhaps has been counting the nostril hairs of God formany years) that there is a big Qabalistic picture.The last thirty years have witnessed a proliferation of interest in the occultand all aspects of the Western mystery tradition. There is no argument among thewell-informed that the Hebrew Qabalah throbs at the very heart of thistradition, sometimes as the source, sometimes as the transmitter of the wisdomof the ages. To this new generation of seekers, some of whom may be destined toplumb the deepest mysteries of the Qabalah, and others who will be satisfiedjust to scratch the surface, I am honored to present The Chicken Qabalah ofRabbi Lamed Ben Clifford.—Lon Milo DuQuetteNewport Beach, California"},{"pageContent":"1FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CHICKEN QABBALAHIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteWe are Qazbalists not to prove the Bible is holy—we are Qabalists because everything is holy.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDWithout doubt, the first question people asked Rabbi Lamed Ben Cliffordconcerned his choice of the word “Chicken” to describe his brand of Qabalisticstudy and practice. It is clear to me, after reviewing scores of letters on thissubject, that he delighted in giving a different answer to every individual whoasked, “Why do you call it Chicken Qabalah?” Indeed, for this reason, I hadaltogether given up the idea of including any of them in the “Frequently AskedQuestions” chapter. Then, shortly before returning the last draft of themanuscript to my publisher, I received a telephone call from one of the Rabbi'sstudents living in New York City. She was a wealth of information and happilycorroborated the following story, which was part of a 1987 letter to a Jamaicandisciple.Why do I call it Chicken Qabalah? Actually, the term “Chicken Qabalah” issuedfrom the mouth of an arrogant and hateful old man who attended my New York CityYOU-CAN-FORGET-90-PERCENT-OF-WHAT-YOU-KNOW-ABOUT-THE-QABALAH seminar. After mytalk he approached me, so obviously infuriated that he could hardly speak.He said, “Sir, you speak blaspheme! You are no Kabbalist! You don't evenpronounce the word correctly—it is Kahb-bah-' law! Kahb-bah-' law! What youteach is not Kabbalah! It is…it is…”The poor man's face turned bright red and his whole body began to shake as hesearched his mind for a word fowl [sic] enough to describe my work.“It is—it is—Chicken! Chicken Kahb-bah-' law!”It was instantly obvious to everyone in the room that he was painfullyembarrassed at the ill-chosen and infantile words that blurted mindlessly out ofhis mouth. People started to chuckle. He then became so flustered that he spatupon the floor and said, “You and your teachings merit only spit! Spit!” andthen he stormed out of the hall.As I am vowed to interpret every phenomenon as a direct communication from Godto my soul, I recognized this awful slobbering man as an angel of the Lord, sentto reveal to me the name of the spiritual science that would forever cling to myname. That night in meditation I examined his message Qabalistically.The Hebrew word for phlegm or spittle is images [../images/00005.jpeg] (KICh),and the word for merit is images [../images/00006.jpeg] (NE). To my great joy,the phrase “merit spit,” images [../images/00005.jpeg] images[../images/00006.jpeg], enumerates1 [part0020.html#chap1_ft1] to the number 93,one of the holiest of numbers. Number 93 relates not only to the divine conceptsof Love and Will, but also to the great secret Word by which we triumph overdeath. I then looked down at my notes to discover that the very same lettersarranged in the very same order rendered in English characters the word images[../images/00007.jpeg] (ChI KEN).I cannot say that I actually believe the above story. It might have some basisin fact, but, like most of the Rabbi's stories, it is probably pure fiction (oras he would say, “a Holy Whopper”). As we will soon see, however, the lies ofRabbi Lamed Ben Clifford can contain some very great truths.The list of questions and answers, below, was not compiled by Ben Clifford. Icompiled it with the kind help of his secretary and “magical son,” Gizmo BenLamed, from nearly 6 years of the Rabbi's personal correspondence with disciplesand detractors.What is Chicken Qabalah?Chicken Qabalah is the deceptively self-effacing term given to those aspects ofthe Holy Hebrew Qabalah that are of practical value to practitioners of theWestern Hermetic spiritual tradition. While giving the most profound respect toindividuals and institutions that teach the rich parochial traditions ofspeculative Qabalah, Chicken Qabalists, like students of Zen, focuspragmatically on the mind-transcending techniques of the art.Who are Chicken Qabalists?Anybody can be a Chicken Qabalist, but at this point in history most arestudents of Tarot, Psychology, Astrology, Ceremonial Magick, Rosicrucianism,Alchemy, Mystic Freemasonry, or Witchcraft.”Is Chicken Qabalah real Qabalah?Hell yes! Don't worry about it, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.So-called orthodox Qabalahs are only other people's Chicken Qabalahs that havebeen around for a long time.Is there a correct way to spell the word Qabalah?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. Cabala, Kabbalah,Quabbbalah, Caqubabalalah—They're all wrong! (So they may as well all becorrect!) We'll talk about that more when you are a little more familiar withthe Hebrew alphabet.Is it hard to become a Chicken Qabalist?Hell no! Don't worry about it. But, if you feel you need some externalvalidation, sign this, cut it out and put it in your wallet. No need to send inan application or pay any dues. If the omniscient Deity really exists, It willsurely recognize your bold act of spiritual audacity.Zerrubbabel Institute of Philosophical YouthZ.I.P.Y.This is to certify that_________________________wallows guiltlessly in the nonsectarian freedom of thoughtexemplified in the Mystical Science of theChicken Qabbalah ofRabbi Lamed Ben Cliffordand because of that act of intelligence and good taste isentitled to the honor and respect of all self-assured andunpretentious seekers of truth everywhere, and forever isentitled to bear the august title ofCHICKEN QABALIST“Hell no! I don't worry about it!”Figure 1. Wallet card for the Chicken Qabalist.There! You're a full-fledged Chicken Qabalist. Now, the first thing you need tolearn is that everyone's Qabalah is uniquely their own. Your Qabalah is not myQabalah or anyone else's. A personal Qabalah is placed in your hands the momentyou take up the study. It's alive, and grows upon what you feed it. The more youlearn, the more you use. No two students study or work the same.For example: I know people who have studied most, if not all, of the classictexts. They know their Hebrew backward and forward, and a whole poop-load of thetraditional correspondences. They can twist and abuse numbers and letters allnight long and send you out the door screaming with their nonstop raving. Theycan manipulate your address and phone number to prove you're the antichrist, andyour real name is Rumplestiltskin. However, all that doesn't necessarily meanthey are using that knowledge to do anything other than bore their friends todeath. On the other hand, you might be inclined to learn and use only one or twoQabalistic tricks of the trade. That's fine. Used everyday with tenacity andskill, even the most elementary exercises can drive you crazy just as fast asthe complex and exotic operations—maybe faster! Don't worry about it!Do I need to be Jewish?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't need to beborn anything, believe anything, or belong to any religion, cult, order, orpolitical party. You don't need to believe in the Hebrew God, or Moses, or theGreat Goddess, or Jesus, or L. Ron Hubbard, or Mohammed, or any other savior,prophet, or salesperson. You don't even need a faithful heart or an open mind.The brain-warping power of Qabalistic thought will soon make all those thingsirrelevant.Will I need to learn the Hebrew language?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't have tolearn to speak Hebrew. But you will have to recognize and be able to write the22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. You will also have to know the meanings andthe numerical values of each Hebrew letter.2 [part0020.html#chap1_ft2] There isno escaping this part of your education. Eventually, as you study and work withthe alphabet, you will become familiar with various Hebrew words that areimportant to the system.Soon, if your studies take you in that direction, you will be able to recognizethese words in the original Hebrew texts. This skill is very impressive tofriends and relatives who always thought you were stupid and unspiritual. Bestof all, it will make them feel guilty and have agonizing doubts about their ownreligious beliefs because they can't read their own scriptures in the originaltongue. Go ahead. Rub it in! Being a Chicken Qabalist is fun!Won't I be intimidated by serious Jewish Qabalists and others who speak Hebrew?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. The first liberatingsecret Chicken Qabalists learn is that (as far as the Qabalah is concerned)there is no such thing as correct Hebrew pronunciation!3[part0020.html#chap1_ft3] Yep! That's right. No matter how you pronounce thevarious words in the system, some snob is sure to pop up (especially in public)and correct you. Remember that Hebrew, as a spoken language is relatively young.Sure, there are those who speak Yiddish, or Judezmo, Sephardic, or Ashkenazic,and a score of other regional and ethnic dialects. There are correct ways topronounce these dialects, but nobody, I repeat, nobody knows for sure what thesacred language of the ancient Hebrews sounded like, or even if it was spoken atall! Pronunciation has less than nothing to do with the study and practicalspiritual applications of the Qabalah.Be proud of the fact that you are informed and honest enough to admit you arenot sure how the words are pronounced and, what's more, you don't even care.Such crass indifference is unbearable to those who would dare belittle the workof the Chicken Qabalist. That being said, it's always a good idea to remember:Rabbi Lamed's Helpful Hint Number 1: Never correct other Qabalists'pronunciation of Hebrew words no matter how silly it sounds. First of all, theymight be right. Secondly, your silence will make them think you are a highlyintelligent person because you agree with them.Rabbi Lamed's Helpful Hint Number 2: Better still, just don't talk with otherQabalists.I hear the Qabalah is based on the Bible. Do I have to believe in the Bible?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it. You don't have tobelieve in anything. If the Bible leaves a bad taste in your mouth, welcome tothe club. But before you throw old King James out the window, I'd like to pointout that the Bible is holy—but so are the phonebook, Webster's Dictionary,Robert's Rules of Order and the menu at McDonalds. As you will learn from theTen Command-Rants,4 [part0020.html#chap1_ft4] everything is holy and anything iscapable of being the vehicle of divine revelation. Key books of the Bible,however, were written by Qabalists for Qabalists and so should be of particularinterest to us.I know, you're probably not thrilled about Bible study. Perhaps like me you'vehad unpleasant experiences with people who are convinced that the Bible teachesthe most ridiculous and monstrous things. Well, now you can tell all thosespiritual bullies who tried to terrorize you with the eternal agonies of hellthat they can just go there. I'm going to share a little secret with you thatonly Chicken Qabalists (and a few musicians) have the courage and wit to handle:The people who wrote the Qabalistic books of the Bible never intended for themto be read by the public.There! I've said it. I feel so much better. Be honest with yourself. Deep inyour heart, you've always known it was true, haven't you? How many times haveyou tried to wade into Genesis or Ezekiel, and finally just gave up and said,“What the hell are these guys talking about?” Don't feel bad. You weren't meantto know what they're talking about—not unless you held vital interpretive keys.I know that sounds snobby and elitist, but it's the truth. These texts werecrafted by mystics possessed of profound understanding of the universe and themysteries of human existence. At a time when writing was reserved for priestsand royalty, they used poetry and parables to express thoughts that everydaylanguage could not accommodate. They assembled the phrases with great art fromindividual words that conveyed an even deeper level of truth; and finally, eachword was made up of unique symbolic letters, each of which revealed yet anotherstory—a story so profound and abstract it could only be told and understood inthe pure language of numbers and mathematics.These sages were full-time holy guys. They wrote this stuff for other full-timeholy guys, and the tiny segment of every generation who would be equipped withthe intelligence, the spiritual drive (and leisure time) necessary to embarkupon a lifelong quest for enlightenment. I assure you, these ancient mysticswould have produced a radically different body of work had they in their wildestnightmares imagined that in some future dark age their secret coded scriptureswould be seized by half-witted and sadistic European cannibals and interpretedliterally, like some grotesque and racist history book.Will the study of the Qabalah make me a better person?No! You'll have to do that yourself."},{"pageContent":"2THE TEN COMMAND-RANTSIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteDon't worry if none of this makes any sense to you right now.It is enough to remember that Realization of One is thesecond-to-last goal of all Qabalists. The final goal isto attain the consciousness of Nothing.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDRabbi Ben Clifford claimed that in the winter of 1989 he made a pilgrimage tothe Holy Land, where he climbed Mount Sinai to, as he put it, “touch base andget further clarification” on several matters pertaining to scripture. On thesummit, the Supreme Deity allegedly appeared to him in the form of a rotatingtongue sandwich that lectured Ben Clifford for about six minutes. To quote theRabbi:The Lord's lustrous lingua lashed from the luminous laser-like lights thatlicked the length of the lush and lonely landscape. Later, I laughed like alunatic as I lay lifelessly limp and lingered upon the lilt of the last littlestletter of the Laws and the laudable lessons I so lately learned.Of course this story is a complete fabrication. To my knowledge, Ben Cliffordnever visited Israel, and in 1989 would have been physically unfit to climb anymountain. In fact, I have spoken to several of his early students, who informedme that in the winter of 1989 the Rabbi was hospitalized in New York City aftersuffering an emotional breakdown on the observation deck of the Empire StateBuilding after becoming violently ill at the Carnegie Deli.Be that as it may, the fact remains that in late 1989 Ben Clifford did indeedpublish a short treatise on the nature of the creation and the underlying theoryof Qabalistic study. These “Ten Command-Rants,” as he called them, are a work ofunquestioned genius. They are perhaps the most concise description of the natureof reality ever penned, reducing complex and inscrutable concepts to theiressence. Their publication in the prestigious Qabalah magazine, Gomer, resultedin Rabbi Ben Clifford's overnight transformation from crazy-old-burned-outlunatic to crazy-old-burned-out-lunatic holy man.I consider his subsequent commentaries on the Ten Command-Rants the bestintroduction to the Qabalah ever written. They continue to be, for me, aperpetual reminder of why I am on the great Qabalistic adventure. I stronglyadvise the student to refer to them often throughout the years of his or hermystical career.The Ten Command-Rantsimages [../images/00008.jpeg]COMMENTARIES ONTHE TEN COMMAND-RANTSFirst Command-RantAll is One.This statement is hardly a veil-rending revelation to anyone who has dabbledeven slightly with abstract thought. It's easy to imagine everything in theuniverse lumped together into one big something beyond which there is nothing.But it's the concept of nothing that sends our primate minds into a tailspin.Now, the very young Chicken Qabalist might be tempted to think of this divinenothingness as kind of a negative “enO” from which the “One” somehow popped intobeing as if from behind a mysterious looking-glass. But, as the SecondCommand-Rant will demonstrate, “nothing” is “something else” altogether.Second Command-RantThe First Command-Rant is a lie. All is Nothing.Astronomers and physicists tell us there is more nothing in the universe thananything else. In fact, they now say that most of the matter and energy in thecosmos (well over 90 percent) is somehow hiding in all this nothingness. Come tothink about it, even matter that we can see is really mostly nothing. There isinfinitely more nothing in an atom than protons and electrons. There is morenothing in our bodies than anything else. We are full of tubes and pockets andsacs and bladders and cavities and chambers and openings and voids. Every cellin your body is mostly nothing. When a cell starts to divide to produce morecells, it first folds in on itself to create more precious nothing to work with.Even your brain grew out of the nothingness of this embryonic internaldisappearing act.images [../images/00009.jpeg]images [../images/00010.jpeg]Physicists cannot even say with any certainty that matter, as most people thinkof it, exists at all. The components of atoms (protons, neutrons, electrons,quarks, charm, etc.) are not matter. They are tendencies. (Tell that to yourhead the next time you slam it getting into your car!) Physicists and mysticsare now using the same vocabulary, and it is only a matter of time before ourlearned men and women of science will announce clearly what Qabalists have beensaying cryptically for centuries.Elements of creation as we know them—minerals and metals, animals and people,planets and stars, light and energy—are merely the husks of an invisibleuniversal force that sustains the entire cosmos. We're like dead skin cells thathave flaked off from the body of the unmanifest Super-Being. This force—thisnothingness, is better than reality. It is undiluted, unlimited potentiality! Itis the ultimate reality, and the nature of that reality is pure consciousness.The first thing that attracted me to the Qabalah as a young Chicken Qabalist(hatchling) was the concept that everything proceeded out of this “Nothing.”That made Nothing the ultimate creator, not the Elohim,1[part0020.html#chap2_ft1] or Jehovah, or any of the other ill-tempered bulliesof the Old Testament. I liked the idea of brooding and inscrutable Nothingbehind everything in the universe.You can think about the Elohim creating stuff like crazy; you can think aboutYHVH Elohim2 [part0020.html#chap2_ft2] blowing life into Adam's nose; you caneven think about a sneaky stinky cloud killing the first-born babies in ancientEgypt; but you can't think about Nothing! Anything you can think about —anythingyou can capture and hold in your mind's eye—is automatically disqualified frominfinityhood and can't possibly be the ultimate Deity.Qabalistic tradition informs us that everything proceeded from the Great One,and the Great One proceeded from a very special kind of Nothing—actually threevery special kinds of Nothing. Beginning Chicken Qabalists need not spend agreat deal of time trying to grasp this concept because, first, it can't beunderstood, and second, if you did understand it, there would no longer be aneed for you to study anything. However, as you approach the meditative summitof your career as a Chicken Qabalist, the irrational mystery of the three kindsof Nothing will increasingly absorb you. For this reason I offer the following.The first kind of Nothing is called Ain images [../images/00011.jpeg]3[part0020.html#chap2_ft3] This Nothing is really nothing—not even the concept ofno-thing (i.e., the absence of anything). Now, if Ain just sat around nowheredoing nothing it's a sure bet that nothing was going to get done. However,something happened to make Ain actually become Nothing (maybe because it wasNothing all along and just had to wake up to the fact). This new, definedNothing the Qabalists call Limitless Nothing, or Ain Soph images[../images/00012.jpeg]. The third kind of Nothing is a hybrid Ain Soph calledAin Soph Aur, images [../images/00013.jpeg], Limitless Light. I view it as thelight bulb that goes off in the vastness of Ain Soph when it realizes theperfect Notness of its Nothingness! Nothing is Not! This double negative istantamount to saying “Something is!” and sets the stage for the first Positivein the universe—the concept of One.4 [part0020.html#chap2_ft4]Don't worry if none of this makes any sense to you right now. It is enough toremember that realization of “One” is the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists.The final goal is to attain the consciousness of “Nothing.”Third Command-RantThere really isn't a creation, time or space, Heaven or Earth…Get used to it. Ultimate reality is Nothing, so all perceivable phenomena,including time and space, are illusions. We could take a picture proving this ifour camera had a wide enough lens. That lens, of course, would have to take innot only the absolute One, but all that Nothing, too!Third Command-Rant (continued)…But there is a you!On the other hand, you are real5 [part0020.html#chap2_ft5]—a sparkling image ofthe absolute reality. You must remember, however, that the real you is somethingfar different and more wonderful than your ape-like brain and reptilian nervoussystem can grasp. The real you is not just a piece of the force of universalconsciousness—the real you is, in essence, the universal consciousness itself!You are not your body, or your brain, or your mind, or your astral body, or anyof the more subtle sheathes that yogis and spoon-benders say you are nestledinside. Bodies and brains and minds are as unreal as creation, time, space,Heaven or Earth. The real you doesn't eat, or drink, or think, or sleep, or die.I'm sure we would all be amazed to know just how skinny, and light, andthoughtless, and sleepless, and immortal we really are.fourth Command-RantWe perceive there is a creation, time and space, Heaven, and Earth because of afundamental defect in our powers of perception.Our eyes cannot see infrared or ultraviolet; our ears cannot hear a dog-whistleor the extra-low frequencies generated by giant redwood trees; most people'snoses can't even smell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Even if we couldutilize all the sensitive new scientific instruments that enable us to see more,hear more, or smell more, do we really think that we could ever gather enoughinformation (or develop powers of intelligence profound enough to interpret thatinformation) to unveil the ultimate reality? Get real! We are all sleepwalkersstumbling blind, deaf, and numb through a life we could never understand even ifwe could see, hear, feel, or smell like Superman.It is perfectly natural for you to ask, “Why is there evil in the world?” or“Why do bad things happen to good people?” but stop flattering yourself. You'renever going to find an answer to those questions by gathering information withyour senses and attempting to process that information with your brain.Fifth Command-RantThis defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome.Caution: Most people will be happier if they never try to overcome this defect.That is why most people in the world find it so easy to believe the mostoutrageous religious concepts without batting an eyelash. The rest of us braveand foolish souls must consciously misuse our defective powers of perception toour advantage. This is done by Qabalistic study and thought.Six Command-RantIn order to overcome our defective powers of perception we must be willing toabuse them until they break.Qabalistic study and thought is designed to make you crazier than most people byrequiring that you attain the all-encompassing consciousness of the real you.Obviously, this is not easy to achieve, but you may as well bite the bullet andget to work because it is the ultimate fate of all units of evolvingconsciousness—even Chicken Qabalists!In order to hit this mystical and omniscient mark, it will be necessary for youto partially disable the mechanisms of normal thought by overloading yourlaughably inadequate mind with data from your laughably inadequate powers ofperception. If all goes well, you will become so sick of the whole ponderouscosmos that your inadequate faculties will look for any way out of the insanityand eventually surrender to transcendent consciousness.6[part0020.html#chap2_ft6]The first step is easy. All you have to do is join 99 percent of the world'spopulation and accept creation/time/space/Heaven/Earth as “reality.” Then,through Qabalistic exercises, you systematically dissect and analyze everyaspect of that “reality.” You connect everything you can think of witheverything else you can think of until there is no “anything” left.This process is not as tedious as it may at first appear because the illusionaryuniverse obligingly provides us with three very helpful Command-Rants of itsown.♦ Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.♦ Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven andEarth.♦ Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heavenand Earth.Seventh Command-RantEverything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.This one's easy. We are living in a wall-to-wall universe. Everything isconnected to everything else. The lox on the cream cheese rests upon the bagel;which is connected to my fingers; which are connected to my hand; which isconnected (via the rest of my body) to my foot; which is connected to my shoe;which is connected to the floor; which is part of the delicatessen; which restsupon Earth; which is spinning in space; which also contains and is connected tothe Sun, the Moon, the stars, and all the other heavenly bodies in the universe.It follows, then, that all lox is ultimately connected to all cream cheese,bagels, fingers, hands, feet, shoes, floors, delicatessens, planets, Sun, Moon,stars and heavenly bodies everywhere. It also follows that each unit of loxpossesses a special affinity with every other unit of lox by virtue of itsvibratory “loxness,” and by the fact that they are all indirectly connected.Naturally, the same can be said for all cream cheese, bagels, body parts, andextraterrestrial delicatessens.Eightth Command-RantEverything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven andEarth.A piano has 88 keys, but theoretically we could build a piano with an infinitenumber of keys stretching forever lower in one direction and forever higher inthe other. But no matter how big we make our piano, we will never have more thantwelve notes with which to play. We can draw similar parallels in thecharacteristics of light and color, and the behavior of organic and minerallife.In the subatomic realm, electrons orbit the nucleus of the atom in the same waymoons orbit their planets, and planets orbit stars, and solar systems orbitwhatever inscrutable “thing” is at the center of their galaxies, etc.Look around. You are smack dab in the middle of a ribbon of repeating patternsstretching infinitely toward macrocosmic immensity in one direction, andinfinitely toward microcosmic smallness in the other. As above, so below. If westudy the tiny subject, we simultaneously study its giant counterpart and viceversa.Nineth Command-RantEverything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heaven andEarth.This Command-Rant is really an extension of the previous one. As everything inHeaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth, everyreflectee houses a faithful blueprint of that which it reflects. Sinceprehistoric times, this was observable in flora and fauna, but now we aremagically blessed with the wondrous knowledge of DNA. Not only does everythingin Heaven and Earth contain the pattern of everything in Heaven and Earth,everything is first cousin to everything in Heaven and Earth!Tenth Command-rantLook hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything.Only then, dear Chicken Qabalist, will you have an eye big enough to reallyclose…so you can finally get some well-deserved rest."},{"pageContent":"3THE SEPHER YETZIRAHIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteWhat happened to Jehovah? Isn't Jehovah God?Didn't Jehovah create Heaven and Earth? Hell no!Elohim did, and Elohim is a very peculiar word.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDThe Qabalah is not a book. There are, however many texts which form the literaryfoundation of Qabalistic study. A rather extensive bibliography can be found atthe end of this book. Of primary interest to fledgling Chicken Qabalists is theSepher Yetzirah or Book of Formation. This work is ascribed to the patriarchAbraham (but, to quote Rabbi Ben Clifford, “That's a crock!”). Nevertheless, theSepher Yetzirah is very old—perhaps the oldest philosophical treatise written inHebrew.1 [part0020.html#chap3_ft1]There are three important features that make the Sepher Yetzirah particularlyattractive to the lazy and pretentious. First of all (and most importantly) itis very short and relatively easy to understand. Second, it introduces us to theconcept of the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations that emerge from the primal unity. Inlater Qabalistic literature the concept of the 10 Sephiroth develops into theTree of Life, a very helpful schematic, especially for Chicken Qabalists.2[part0020.html#chap3_ft2]Third, it tells the simple story of how Deity created the Hebrew alphabet thenused the letters to form the words that brought the universe into being. Thisconcept may sound a little silly, but this silliness is the foundation of theQabalistic worldview and meditative exercises that will eventually obsess thediligent student.Now, I am putting you on your honor to obtain at least one of the classictranslations of the Sepher Yetzirah and put it in a conspicuous spot on yourbookshelf. If you are a serious student you will most certainly wish to read it.But I warn you, even the best translations will appear very strange—full oftiresome and seemingly irrelevant ramblings. I confess that as a young student,I lamented the fact that, even though the Sepher Yetzirah was short, all thereally useful information was buried under piles of archaic language andstupid-sounding redundancies. Imagine my great joy when I was introduced to BenClifford's marvelous and practical “translation.”Naturally, like all of the Rabbi's works, the text is surrounded by controversy.Ben Clifford swore to his students this version of the Sepher Yetzirah was afaithful translation of the most ancient and authoritative manuscript available,but there is no doubt that this is another one of his pathetic and transparentlies. The work is obviously a modern counterfeit. (The text even carelesslymakes references to pizza and the theme music from the television game show“Jeopardy.”) One of the Rabbi's students, who asked to remain anonymous, told mehe believed the Rabbi himself concocted the “translation” in 1983 whilerecovering from a bout of Montezuma's revenge in a motel room in Ensenada,Mexico.Be that as it may, like his Ten Command-Rants, Ben Clifford's treatment of theSepher Yetzirah cuts straight to the heart of what Chicken Qabalists need tolearn first. I do not hesitate to reprint the entire text, including hisprovocative introduction written to the students of his imaginary institute.The Sepher Yetzirahimages [../images/00014.jpeg]AN ADDRESS BYRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDTO THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY OF THEZERUBBABEL INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHICAL YOUTHimages [../images/00015.jpeg]And said the Elohim, Let there be light: and there was light.—Genesis 1 :3I'M SURE MANY OF YOU students are asking yourselves why I am starting our studyof Genesis with the third verse of chapter 1 instead of the first. The answer issimple. Verse 1 tells us squat! It informs us; “In the beginning the Elohimcreated Heaven and Earth.”3 [part0020.html#chap3_ft3]Big deal! What the hell is an Elohim? Is it God? Translators of the EnglishBible seem to think so. Most versions read: “In the beginning God created Heavenand Earth.”What happened to Jehovah? Isn't Jehovah God? Didn't Jehovah create Heaven andEarth? Hell no! Elohim did, and Elohim is a very peculiar word.El (images [../images/00016.jpeg])4 [part0020.html#chap3_ft4] is the root wordfor Deity. Eloh (images [../images/00017.jpeg]) is a feminine singular, in otherwords, a female Deity (a Goddess); im (images [../images/00018.jpeg]) is theplural ending for things that are masculine. Elohim (images[../images/00019.jpeg]), then, should be translated either “Gods and Goddesses”or “Dual-Gendered Deity.” Later on in verses 26 and 27 the Elohim even refer tothemselves as plural, “And said the Elohim, Let us make Adam in our image, afterour likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over thefowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the Earth, and over everycreeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. And created the Elohim Adam in theimage of Elohim created they them, male and female created they them.”Surprised? So was everyone who had their hearts set on God not having a vaginaand everyone who believed that Adam was an historical character, like GeneralCuster, and not just a name for the human race. They were so upset when theydiscovered that in the beginning the Dual-Gendered Deity created Heaven andEarth that they made sure that Elohim and innumerable other special names wouldbe translated “God” or “Lord” or “Lord God” or other such ambiguousmasculine-sounding names.5 [part0020.html#chap3_ft5]Besides this little titbit, verse 1 leaves us in the dark concerning what Heavenis, what Earth is, or how the Elohim went about creating these things. Verse 2is even worse:And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of thedeep. And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.If Earth was void and formless, where was all this water coming from? If theauthor was trying to be inscrutable, he sure did a damned good job of it.Verse 3 finally gives us something we can dig our teeth into:And the Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light.The key word here is “said.” That's how everything was created—the Elohim talkedeverything into existence.6 [part0020.html#chap3_ft6] The Elohim said it, and itwas so. Obviously words are very important in the grand creation scenario. Aword is a vibration, and vibration creates and sustains the universe. The atomicweight of the chemical elements is just another way of measuring theirvibration. Molecules hold themselves together and bond with other molecules bythe “glue” of their compatible vibrations. That's what is meant by the term “thecreative Logos, or Word.” That's what John7 [part0020.html#chap3_ft7] wastalking about when he wrote, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word waswith God, and the Word was God.” Duh!And what, my sleepy students, are words made up of? Letters! Our Hebrew alphabet(and what other alphabet would the Elohim dare use?) is made up of 22 sacredletters, and the story of their creation is not found in the Bible, but in amysterious little masterpiece called the Sepher Yetzirah: The Book of Formation.Several years ago, I personally had the extraordinary good fortune of beingallowed to purchase the earliest known manuscript of this sacred work from amysterious street vendor just outside of Hussan's Cantina in Ensenada, Mexico. Ipainstakingly translated it by carefully copying the Hebrew characters into mypersonal computer using the standard Hebrew fonts included in my word processingprogram. When I finished, I simply selected the entire text and globally changedthe font to Times New Roman. To my amazement it translated exactly as you seeit. A Qabalistic miracle.Sepher Yetzirah The Book of InformationPROLOGUEDeity, whom we call Yah, Yea-man, Jehovah of hosts, Joe Heavy, What-It-Is, theBig Kahuna, the Mighty Duh, the living Elohim, King of the Universe, Omnipotent,All-King and Merciful, Supreme, and Extolled is all-powerful, eternal; who isreally, really holy and very, very large; who is so big It is both King andQueen of the Universe, who is so all-encompassing and huge that It has nowhereto sit down because all the chairs are inside of Itself; who, because It iseverywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing, had no one to play with—thisDude of Dudes created the Universe (with the help of three imaginary friends,“Numbers, Letters, and Words”) in 32 Mysterious Paths of Wisdom. They consist ofI 0 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.The Deity divided the 22 Letters into three divisions: Three Mothers(fundamental letters), Seven Double letters, and Twelve Simple letters.THE 10 SEPHIROTH OUT OF NOTHINGTen of these paths came out of nothing. (Because the Deity is everything, It hadlots of nothing to play with.) These ten paths are called Sephiroth oremanations. Because they came out of nothing they aren't actually real. (Butthen, of course, only the Deity knows that for sure.)The 10 Sephiroth out of nothing are reflected in the human body by our tenfingers and toes, five on each side. In between the two sets of fingers is thetongue, and in between the two sets of toes are the naughty bits that makehumans creative beings, too—just like the Deity!Ten are the Sephiroth not 9; 10 and not 11 or 12, or 6 %. Think about that for awhile. Inquire into it. Put it in your pipe and smoke it. Ponder it while themusic from “Jeopardy” plays, and roll it around in your mouth a little beforeswallowing. Render it evident and lead the Creator back to Its throne so we canall go home.But—at the same time, don't talk about it. Don't even think about it. If yourmouth urges you to speak, burn its roof with hot pizza! If your heart urges youto think about it, turn on the television! As it is written, “Your answer mustbe in the form of a question.”Then 10 Sephiroth out of nothing are infinite in ten ways (I'll put them in Treeof Life order): 1. Beginning Infinite 3. Good Infinite 2. End Infinite 5. HeightInfinite 4. Evil Infinite 6. Depth Infinite 8. West Infinite 7. EastInfinite 9. North Infinite 10. South Infinite Then 10 Sephiroth out of nothing appear like a lightning flash. Being endless,the Deity's word is in them when they go and return. They run like hell when theDeity orders them around, and are constantly groveling before the throne.From the Spirit of the Living God (1) emanated Air (2), from the Air emanatedWater (3), from the Water emanated Fire Æther (4), from the Æther emanated theHeight (5), and the Depth (6), the East (7), and the West (8), the North (9),and the South (10).THE 22 LETTERSThe remaining twenty-two paths are the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Theyform the foundation of everything we can think of, and all the other things thatwill never occur to us. The Deity weighed them and measured them, poked them andprodded them, issued them numbers, stapled and two-hole punched them; stampedtheir passports and organized them, according to all the crazy sounds It couldmake with Its infinite and eternal mouth. Formed by the breath of Air, It fixedthem on five places in the mouth: the Throat, the Palate, the Tongue, the Teeth,and the Lips.The Deity divided the 22 letters into three divisions: Three Mothers orFundamental Letters, Seven Doubles, and Twelve Simple Consonants.THE THREE MOTHERSThree are the Fundamental Letters. Three not four, not sixteen, not even3.14159. Think about that real hard. Turn it over in your mind. Put it in theblender and hit puree. Render it evident and put a fresh battery in thepacemaker of the Most High.The Three Fundamental Letters —images [../images/00020.jpeg]—(Aleph, Mem, Shin)are real Mothers and are extremely cool. Deity took their temperatures andtissue samples, and measured their cholesterol levels, issued them numbers,certified them, and formed by them lots of things, such as the breast, body, andhead, and Heaven, Earth, and the atmosphere, and heat, cold, and moistness—butwho cares about that stuff!First and foremost, they represent the Three Primitive Elements in the universeand the spheres of consciousness those elements represent—Air (images[../images/00021.jpeg] Aleph), Water (images [../images/00022.jpeg] Mem), andFire (images [../images/00023.jpeg] Shin).8 [part0020.html#chap3_ft8]The Three Fundamental Letters—images [../images/00020.jpeg]—(Aleph, Mem, Shin)are also the Three Famous Dimensional Twins who, because of their amazingability to stretch themselves to infinity, create the cosmic elbow room in whichthe entire universe manifests. Their names are: images [../images/00021.jpeg]Aleph—Updown, images [../images/00022.jpeg] Mem—Eastwest, and images[../images/00023.jpeg] Shin—Northsouth. Dost thou get this? Needest thou apicture?

Hoist them up yourflagpole. Clear your palate with them. Spay or neuter them, and spring for theCreator's bail.The 7 Double Letters—images [../images/00025.jpeg] —(Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph,Peh, Resh, Tau) are rather confused and can be pronounced in a hard way and in asoft way. Because they can't make up their minds, they symbolize sevenopposites: Life-Death, Peace-War, Wisdom-Folly, Wealth-Poverty, Beauty-Ugliness,Fruitfulness-Sterility, and Dominion-Slavery.The 7 Double Letters also stand for the six dimensions (that were created whenthe Three Famous Dimensional Twins did their act and stretched themselves out).images [../images/00026.jpeg] Beth for Above, images [../images/00027.jpeg]Gimel for Below, images [../images/00028.jpeg] Daleth for East, images[../images/00029.jpeg] Kaph for West, images [../images/00030.jpeg] Peh forNorth, images [../images/00031.jpeg] Resh for South, and the hardworking images[../images/00032.jpeg] Tau stands in the center and holds the whole thingtogether.

Even the laziest Chicken Qabalist needs to learn theHebrew alphabet and at least some of its traditional correspondences.4[part0020.html#chap4_ft1] As Rabbi Ben Clifford said in “Frequently AskedQuestions,” this doesn't mean that you will have to learn, speak, or read theHebrew language. In fact, once you have learned the Hebrew alphabet and itsQabalistic and numerical secrets, you will most likely spend a lot of timeexamining English words and letters using their Hebrew equivalents.Another thing that is absolutely necessary for your study is a small basiclibrary of reference works. You don't have to have these books right now, butyou will want them very soon. Of course you will collect more books as youdescend into Qabalistic madness, but these texts (and this book, of course) willbe enough to get you on the road:Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings (York Beach, ME: SamuelWeiser 1990);David Godwin, Godwin's Cabalistic Encyclopedia (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1994);Ehud Ben Yehuda, Ben-Yehuda's Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew-English Dictionary(New York: Pocket Books, 1991).We must remember that Ben Clifford wrote this little twenty-five page essaysimply to help beginning students remember how to recognize and correctly draweach Hebrew letter. I believe he succeeded admirably in doing this. Several ofhis descriptions evoke bizarre and unforgettable images: “Tau looks like a Reshholding a dead dolphin by the tail,” or “Lamed looks like a snake that hasswallowed a brick and is now having second thoughts.”As a purely Qabalistic work, however, this essay is far from comprehensive. Hiscomments on the letters are limited primarily to basic definitions of theletters. Occasionally he muses briefly about how the primitive meanings may beapplied to cosmic, psychological, or sexual principles, but for the most part,he seems satisfied to offer us simply an appetizer to further food for thought.The stunning exception is found in his comments on the letter Yod. I stronglyurge the reader to carefully read and re-read that section. In 210 words, BenClifford casually reveals the supreme symbolic secret of creation by drawing ourattention to that most mysterious of natural numbers known to mathematicians asthe Greek letter Phi, and to architects as the Golden Mean or Golden Section.This number, or ratio (1.6180339887499), like the irrational number Pi, seems toissue from, and set the pattern for, the basic structure of the entire cosmos.But, unlike other abstract numbers, the pattern set by Phi is revealed naturallyand universally in all living things and all things that grow and develop instages. One of the most striking examples of this pattern of growth can found inthe shell of the nautilus, which, when cross-sectioned, reveals a breathtakingrepeating pattern of what looks like extended Hebrew Yods or English letter Gs.On a grander scale, it can be found in the formation of the great spiralnebulae. This primal pattern of patterns is, indeed, the “G” signature of the“Great Architect of the Universe,” the name by which Freemasons refer to Deity.As far as I know, Ben Clifford is the first Qabalist (or alleged Qabalist) tomake this profound and fundamental connection.images [../images/00049.jpeg]Figure 6. Yod, the Golden Mean, Yin-Yang.I suppose inevitably there will be those who view as crude and offensive BenClifford's sexual allusions to Hebrew letters and other elements of Qabalisticstudy. Admittedly, at first glance it does appear that he places an inordinateemphasis on phalluses and vaginas, wombs and sperm, and such. As he is no longerhere to defend himself, I feel I must say a few words on the Rabbi's behalf.For the last two thousand years there has been a concerted effort by those whowould guide the spiritual life of Western Civilization, to divorce human lifefrom nature (on one end of the scale) and from God on the other. We are taughtthat we are superior to other living things because we were created in the imageof the Deity and can do what we damn well please with the environment and thecreatures around us. At the same time, we are told that the Deity is outside ofus—that we stand eternally separated from It because of an ambiguous act ofdisobedience committed by our mythological ancestors— that we are cursed by thesimple act of being born. Ben Clifford's 7th, 8th, and 9th Command-Rants cleanlyexpose this spiritual schizophrenia as a cruel and unwholesome fraud.Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven andEarth.Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heaven andEarth.Nothing can be separated from anything else, including all aspects of the humancondition. To discuss sexual matters within a religious context is as proper asdiscussing matters of scripture, or mathematics, or physics. Since a great dealof our time is already spent thinking about sex, it is only logical that asignificant part of our meditations on any subject should be dominated by theuniversal truths inherent in sexual imagery. Ben Clifford was fond of misquotingFreud and often told his students, “Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar…andsometimes it is the supreme creative force of the universe.”I applaud Ben Clifford's healthy attitude and casual candor. Furthermore, I cansay with some small measure of authority that much of what he has to say in thisarea reveals the most profound level of understanding. I advise the seriousstudent to ponder his words carefully. To those who are still offended orembarrassed by the Rabbi's comments I say, “Thank you for buying this book—nowgrow up!”Meet Hebrew Alphabetimages [../images/00008.jpeg]A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTERS OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET—THEIR FORMATION. MEANINGS, AND CORRESPONDENCESBYRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDDOES GOD SPEAK HEBREW?Hell no! God's a Chicken Qabalist and doesn't worry about it. Do you actuallythink there is a white-bearded giant in the clouds who created the universe andeverything in it by belching out nouns and verbs right out of some celestialedition of Ben-Yehuda's Hebrew dictionary? I don't think so. The creative fiat,the language of the Deity, is not one of grunts and gurgles and hisses andsighs. It is a language of numbers. Numbers do all the work. What distinguishesthe Hebrew alphabet is not its pronunciation or its words and grammar, but itsintimate relationship with numbers.If God “said” anything in the beginning, it was most likely, “Let there be 3.”That's all that needed to be said because, as we learned in the Sepher Yetzirah,the 3 dimensions then just took off on their own and extended from the centralpoint to instantly form 7 and 12 spatial coordinates—a tight little 22-piecetoolbox of creation.Let's start our brief study of the Hebrew alphabet by first observing that the22 letters are divided into 3 categories: 3 Mother letters, 7 Double letters,and 12 Simple letters. 3—7—12. What a coincidence.3 MOTHER LETTERS[representing three primal elements]images [../images/00050.jpeg]7 DOUBLE LETTERS[representing the seven planets of the ancients]images [../images/00051.jpeg]12 SIMPLE LETTERS[representing the twelve signs of the zodiac]images [../images/00052.jpeg]Figure 7. These 22 Letters join the 10 Sephiroth and, in doing so, create theTree of Life.images [../images/00053.jpeg]Figure 8. The Tree of Life.1images [../images/00054.jpeg]Aleph—Aimages [../images/00055.jpeg]Aleph is Path No. 11. It joins Kether (Crown) to Chokmah (Wisdom).Aleph doesn't look like any other Hebrew letter and is therefore easy torecognize. It has one long diagonal bar that looks like a banana separating twosmall Yods. The Yod at the top right is connected to the banana at midpoint by athin line (a Yod on a stick). The Yod at the bottom left is flattened at thebottom like a foot and is connected to the banana underneath its left shoulder.Aleph is spelled images [../images/00056.jpeg] (ALP). The three lettersenumerate to 111 (or using Peh Final 831) and mean “ox.” In ancient cultures,the ox that pulled the furrowing plough was a supreme symbol of the fertilizingforce of creation. Aleph is a letter of breath and the closest thing the Hebrewalphabet has to a vowel. As the plough of the ox penetrates and aerates thesoil, so the breath of life penetrates and vivifies you and me. Oh hell! I'llcome out and say it—the Air of Aleph is more than just the firmament ofatmosphere surrounding Earth—it is the Life-Force itself, the Prana of theHindus, the active ingredient that makes the Holy Spirit holy). Give it somerespect!Aleph is one of the 3 Mother Letters and represents the element Air.TAROT TRUMP: The Fool.2images [../images/00057.jpeg]Beth—Bimages [../images/00058.jpeg]Beth is Path No. 12. It joins Kether (Crown) to Binah (Understanding).Note that the roof of Beth is an elongated Yod that slides to the right anddrips down to smoothly form a leg. The leg is connected to a long right-leaningparallelogram that serves as the base of the letter. The leg connects near butnot at the right edge of the base.Beth images [../images/00059.jpeg] Do not confuse with Kaph images[../images/00060.jpeg]Beth is spelled images [../images/00061.jpeg] (BYTh). The three lettersenumerate to 412 and mean “house.” Its shape suggests a cave, the earliesthouse. In biblical times, a house was often a tent. A house is fundamentally acontainer, but it is also a shelter, a sanctuary, and a resting place, and mostimportantly, a place to exist. Beth is the fundamental structure of theuniverse, a container of existence, a receptacle of life, an atom, a livingcell, a body. Astrologers divide the Heavens into twelve “houses.” Familybloodlines and households are also considered “houses,” such as the House ofDavid or the House of Frankenstein.Beth is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Mercury.TAROT TRUMP: The Magician.3images [../images/00062.jpeg]Gimel—Gimages [../images/00063.jpeg]Gimel is Path No. 13. It joins Kether (Crown) to Tiphareth (Beauty).Gimel starts with a Yod that extends straight down from its bottom tear. Thisleg connects to a short right-leaning parallelogram that serves as the base ofthe letter. Note that the leg connects only partially to the top right edge ofthe base:images [../images/00064.jpeg] Do not confuse with Nun images[../images/00065.jpeg]Gimel is spelled tea images [../images/00066.jpeg] (GML). The three lettersenumerate to 73 and mean “camel,” also to couple or team up. Like the ox, acamel is an animal domesticated to the service of humanity. The ox, however, isexploited in the cause of nourishment, the camel in the cause of communication.A camel is the “ship of the desert,” a vehicle of life and commerce, capable ofcrossing the vast abyss of sand. The Path of Gimel on the Tree of Life alsocrosses the Abyss and joins Kether to Tiphareth.In Aramaic (the language allegedly spoken by Jesus) the word camel and the wordrope are spelled exactly the same, “gamla.” I wasn't there, so I can't say forsure, but I'll bet in Matthew 19:24 Jesus says, “It is easier for a rope (notcamel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into thekingdom of God.” Duh!Gimel is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the Moon.TAROT TRUMP: The High Priestess.4images [../images/00067.jpeg]Daleth—Dimages [../images/00068.jpeg]Daleth is Path No. 14. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Binah (Understanding).Daleth has a firm level roof. It is connected by a leg on the right side. Notethat the leg connects near but not at the right edge of the roof. A little partof the roof hangs over the leg.images [../images/00069.jpeg] Do not confuse with Reshimages[../images/00070.jpeg]Daleth is spelled images [../images/00071.jpeg] (DLTh). The three lettersenumerate to 434 and mean “door.” A door is a valve that can bar or accommodateboth the entrance and exit of things. It is a tent flap, a threshold, and agate. Walk out of the door of your house and you move from the unity of yourhome to the multiplicity of the world and vice versa.The most important “door” for humans is a woman's womb and/or vagina. Itaccommodates the entrance of the fertilizing male member, and nine months later,it is the door through which we all enter the world.Daleth is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Venus.TAROT TRUMP: The Empress.5images [../images/00072.jpeg]Heh—H, Eimages [../images/00073.jpeg]Heh is Path No. 15. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Tiphareth (Beauty).Heh is drawn exactly like Daleth, but has an additional left leg. Note that theleft leg does not touch the roof.images [../images/00074.jpeg] Do not confuse with Cheth images[../images/00075.jpeg] or Tau images [../images/00076.jpeg]Heh is spelled images [../images/00077.jpeg] (HH). The two letters enumerate to10 and mean “window.” Also to breathe, to exist, to become, and to desire. Awindow is a transparent door, an eye through which we look out on the world.From within the house, we look out of the window at approaching visitors, so wecan decide who to allow through the door and who to bar. A window also allowslight and air to penetrate the house. Heh also means the identification of astar, as for navigation or astrology.Its shape introduces the concept of openings—a small opening on the left and alarge opening from below. This is suggestive of all things receptive, female, ornegatively charged.Heh is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Aries.TAROT TRUMP: The Emperor.6images [../images/00078.jpeg]Vau—V,W,U,Oimages [../images/00079.jpeg]Vau is Path No. 16. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Chesed (Mercy).Vau starts with a Yod at the top that extends straight down from its bottom tearto form a right leg. Note that the leg connects to the top right edge of theYod.images [../images/00080.jpeg] Do not confuse with Zain images[../images/00081.jpeg]Vau is spelled images [../images/00082.jpeg] The two letters enumerate to 12 andmean “nail” or “hook” or “pin.” A hook can be used to suspend things from above.Nails and pins are sharp, pointy things that join two objects together by meansof penetration. By its very shape, it represents the phallus. This implies union(yoga), and union with God is the goal of all mystics, especially ChickenQabalists. The process is theoretically simple. Find the proper Vau and you cannail yourself to God! This concept of union is further underscored when weremember the letter Vau is the Hebrew conjunction “and.”Its shape introduces the concept of penetration, and is suggestive of all thingsaggressive, male, or positively charged.Vau is a one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign ofTaurus.TAROT TRUMP: The Hierophant7images [../images/00083.jpeg]Zain—Zimages [../images/00084.jpeg]Zain is Path No. 17. It joins Binah (Understanding) to Tiphareth (Beauty).Zain is a Yod with a leg dropping down from its bottom center.images [../images/00085.jpeg] Do not confuse with Vau images[../images/00086.jpeg]Zain is spelled images [../images/00087.jpeg] (ZYN). The three letters enumerateto 67 (or using Nun Final 717) and mean “sword.” A sword is a weapon of bothoffense and defense. It is the weapon of i nvoked force. It can be brandished asa deterrent or wielded to enforce the decisions of authority. A sword is also aninstrument of division, separating one thing from another (like your enemy'shead from his shoulders), and of discretion and analysis, separating one ideafrom another. In a way, it is just the opposite of Vau, which unites things.Zain is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Gemini.TAROT TRUMP: The Lovers.8images [../images/00088.jpeg]Cheth-Chimages [../images/00089.jpeg]Cheth is Path No. 18. It joins Binah (Understanding) to Geburah (Strength).Cheth is drawn exactly like Heh but both legs touch the roof.images [../images/00090.jpeg] Do not confuse with Heh images[../images/00091.jpeg] or Tauimages [../images/00092.jpeg]Cheth is spelled images [../images/00093.jpeg] (ChYTh). The three lettersenumerate to 418 and mean “field” and “fence.” A fenced-in field impliescultivated land—land that has been set apart, defined, and then plowed by theox. A fence encloses an area and sets it apart from the surrounding area. It isa wall, a hedge, a membrane, a shell, a womb, a crust, a fortress, a citadel. Itsurrounds and protects the sacred life and light within from the danger anddarkness without. Cheth also indicates the Life-Force itself, and anythingliving.Cheth is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign ofCancer.TAROT TRUMP: The Chariot.9images [../images/00094.jpeg]Teth-Timages [../images/00095.jpeg]Teth is Path No. 19. It joins Chesed (Mercy) to Geburah (Strength).Teth has a firm rectangular base from which sprout a mini-Zain from the leftedge and a sharp leftward-crashing wave arising from the right edge. I think itlooks like the profile of a duck swimming on the water looking back at a big Yodthat's stuck to the tip of its tail. Note that the duck's bill does not touchthe Yod on its tail.images [../images/00096.jpeg] Do not confuse with Mem images[../images/00097.jpeg]Teth is spelled images [../images/00098.jpeg] (TYTh). The three lettersenumerate to 419 and mean “serpent.” Human beings are vertebrates and our spinesare home to unimaginable energy and power. We are snakes with arms and legs, andthis serpent energy is the key to our divine birthright. Like a snake swallowingits tail, there is truly no end to the mystery of the serpent. The one thattempted Eve is the same one that Moses elevated on a pole, and the same one thatJesus told us to be as “wise as.”It is also interesting to note that the ancients were aware that individualsperm cells look like tiny snakes with giant (lion-like) heads.Teth is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Leo.TAROT TRUMP: Strength.10images [../images/00099.jpeg]Yod-Y, I, Jimages [../images/00100.jpeg]Yod is Path No. 20. It joins Chesed (Mercy) to Tiphareth (Beauty).Yod is a flame. Blow upon it and you create all the other letters of thealphabet. Yod is my favorite Hebrew letter because it is so simple. It is theperfect pattern of primal creation—a point extending to become the whirlingmotion. It is Phi, the seed of the Golden Spiral; the mystic “G” in yourgrandfather's Masonic ring; the Yin and Yang; the human embryo; the blueprint ofthe ram's horn and the nautilus; the swirling cream in your coffee, and thebillowing dynamics of smoke and air and water. It sets the pattern for ourfingerprints, our DNA and the shape of great galaxies. It is the primalmale-Shiva divine fire that plunges joyously into the female-Shakti ocean ofdivine water.Yod is spelled images [../images/00101.jpeg] (YVD) [which is not a public healthquestion]. The three letters enumerate to 20 and mean “hand.” Using Qabalisticlogic, Yod is the key creative instrument of the Deity in the same way that thehand is a key creative instrument of human beings. Follow me? The human hand,however, is only the mundane member of creation. A secret and more profoundequivalent of the creative hand is the spermatozoon, itself, of which I believeYod is the most appropriate hieroglyph.Yod is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Virgo.TAROT TRUMP: The Hermit.20images [../images/00102.jpeg]Kaph-Kimages [../images/00103.jpeg]Kaph is Path No. 21.

The three letters enumerateto 100 (or using Peh Final 820) and mean “palm.” Kaph even looks like theprofile of a hand opening to grasp something, the thumb forming the base (thehand of Yod in the process of creation). At the risk of sounding crude, we mustremember that for young men, the palm of the hand was our first sexual partner.Palmists are quick to point out that our destiny can be read in the palms of ourhands. Kaph's association with Jupiter (the Tarot's Wheel of Fortune) wouldunderscore this association.Kaph is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Jupiter.TAROT TRUMP: The Wheel of Fortune.30images [../images/00108.jpeg]Lamed—Limages [../images/00109.jpeg]lamed is Path No. 22.

Lamed looks like a snake that hasswallowed a brick and is now having second thoughts.Lamed is spelled images [../images/00110.jpeg] (LMD). The three lettersenumerate to 74 and mean “ox goad,” also to teach and to discipline. The ox goadis the pointy stick that prods the ox (images [../images/00111.jpeg]—Aleph) downthe straight and narrow furrows of the field. Without the ox goad, the ox wouldbe an undomesticated animal (and Aleph would spin completely out of control).This indicates that there is a special relationship between Lamed and Aleph.images [../images/00112.jpeg] (AL) is the name of God most holy and images[../images/00113.jpeg] (LA) means “not.” Lamed makes sure that the infinitepower of the Holy Spirit of Aleph is channeled into what we perceive as naturalpatterns.I am proud to have been named Lamed because it also means teacher and scholar.Lamed is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Libra.TAROT TRUMP: Justice40images [../images/00114.jpeg]Mem—Mimages [../images/00115.jpeg]Mem is Path No. 23.

The numerical value of Nun Final is 700.Nun is spelled images [../images/00124.jpeg] The three letters enumerate to 106(or using Nun Final 756) and mean “fish.” Fish are known for their ability tobreed like crazy. Nun represents fecundity and regeneration. When dead, fishdecay rapidly and smell terrible. Nun is also the letter of decay. This reallyisn't a paradox when you consider the fact that fertilizer smells terrible, buthelps things grow.Nun is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Scorpio.TAROT TRUMP: Death.60images [../images/00125.jpeg]Samekh—Simages [../images/00126.jpeg]Samekh is Path No. 25.

The three lettersenumerate to 120 (or using Kaph Final 600) and mean “tent peg” or “prop.” Inbiblical times, the tent peg was a most important and potent symbol because itwas an absolutely indispensable tool for the proper erection of the tent. Notonly did it ensure the tent would rise toward Heaven, but it also andsimultaneously secured it to Earth.All this pointy phallic symbolism seems rather paradoxical when we consider theextremely female shape of the letter itself. Samekh's meaning is phallic, butits shape suggests all things circular; the canopy of Heaven, the vagina, thewomb.Samekh is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign ofSagittarius.TAROT TRUMP: Temperance.70images [../images/00129.jpeg]Ayin—Ay, Au, O, Ngimages [../images/00130.jpeg]Ayin is Path No. 26.

Through the eye our inward being looks out at the world.For this reason (and numerous others) Ayin has traditionally been associatedwith the meatus, the opening at the tip of the penis, through which the semenpasses on its one-way adventure to eggland. Ayin also means fountain, spring,source.

When used at the end of a word it looks like along Vau with a tongue. The numerical value of Peh Final is 800.Peh is spelled images [../images/00138.jpeg] (PH). The two letters enumerate to85 and mean “mouth.” What goes in the mouth as nourishment is vital to humanlife, but what comes out of the mouth as speech is vital to our minds. It is nocoincidence that the first and most important gift the mythological gods gave tohumans was the gift of speech. Speech is one of the primary characteristics thatseparate humans from other living creatures. Once we started talking, ourthought patterns were drastically overhauled. This had a profound effect uponour ancestors' self-image and view of reality, not to mention the way our brainswould evolve from that point onward.Peh is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Mars.TAROT TRUMP: The Tower.90images [../images/00139.jpeg]Tzaddi—Tz, Ximages [../images/00140.jpeg]Tzaddi is Path No. 28.

The three letters enumerateto 186 (or using Peh Final 906) and means “back of head.” Qoph really must bemeditated upon in conjunction with the following letter Resh, which means “theface” or “the front of the head.” The back of the head is the location of thecerebellum and the medulla oblongata (also known by the Hindus as the “mouth ofGod”). This area is the most primitive part of our brain, and could care lessabout the evening news or your job or what wine to drink with fish. It keepsitself active even when we are asleep, unconscious or otherwise wiped out. Qophis the Hebrew letter of sleep.

The three lettersenumerate to 360 (or using Nun Final lOlO) and mean “tooth.” Qabalistictradition holds the letter Shin in particular reverence. If Aleph is the activeingredient of the Holy Spirit, Shin is the Holy Spirit itself. Its number, 360,is also the sum of the letters of the Hebrew words RVCh ALHIM which means theBreath of God. When the letter Shin is introduced into the middle of the wordimages [../images/00155.jpeg] (YHVH) Jehovah, it becomes images[../images/00156.jpeg] (YHShVH) Jeshuah—Jesus.Shin is one of the 3 Mother Letters and represents both the element Fire and theelement Spirit.TAROT TRUMP: Judgement.400images [../images/00157.jpeg]Tau-Th, Timages [../images/00158.jpeg]Tau is Path No. 32.

His sarcasm regarding this subject was never more stingingthan in the introduction to his essay on the Tetragrammaton. His fanciful story,in which he purports to explain the true circumstances surrounding the yearlyutterance of images [../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image:images [../images/00005.jpeg] by the High Priest of lsrael has been justifiablycondemned by pious institutions as vulgar and offensive. His reference to thesacred Ark of the Covenant as “Ole Sparky” was particularly insensitive.However, many modern students are tantalized by aspects of his story that raiseprovocative and intriguing questions, and so, after much deliberation, I havedecided to present his essay complete and unedited.The True Pronunciation of the Ineffable Name of Godimages [../images/00008.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg]AN ADDRESS BYRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDTO THE 1986 ZERUBBABEL INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHICAL YOUTHTRACK AND FIELD TEAMAs I HAVE SAID ON NUMEROUS occasions, Hebrew pronunciation is not important tothe study of the Qabalah. However, because knowledge of the true pronunciationof the Tetragrammaton images [../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is coverimage: images [../images/00005.jpeg] (Yod Heh Vau Heh) has been one of thegreatest mysteries in the history of religion, Chicken Qabalists should be awareof the real story behind the correct pronunciation of the Great Name. I willtake just a moment at the beginning of today's address to share with you thatgreat secret.images [../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg] is called the ineffable name because no one but the HighPriest of Israel was allowed to pronounce it, and then only once a year undervery peculiar circumstances. For this reason when pious worshippers run acrossthe word in print they substitute the word “Adonai” (Lord) in its place. images[../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg] first appears in Genesis 2 verse 7:images [../images/00168.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg]And formed YHVH Elohim Adam of the dust of the ground and breathed into thenostrils the breath (Neshemah) of life (Chiah) and Adam became a living soul(Nephesh).This is commonly translated:And the LORD God formed man [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into hisnostrils the breath of life.Up until this verse, the single word images [../images/00169.jpeg], Ignore ifimage is cover image: images [../images/00005.jpeg] (Elohim1[part0020.html#chap5_ft1]) was used in Genesis to designate the creator God. Inother words, the Deity who created human beings (Adam) by performing CPR on adirt statue, was a new kind of Elohim, or probably more likely, a specificaspect of Elohim—a jehovah-Elohim.Why are pious Jews so afraid to pronounce images [../images/00167.jpeg], Ignoreif image is cover image: images [../images/00005.jpeg] and Christians say theword “Jehovah” with such impunity? The answer is simple. Pious Jews are taughtto respect the author or authors of the Pentateuch—mystics who knew that images[../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg] is not really a name at all, but a formula that revealsthe basic mechanics of creation and human existence. Christians, on the otherhand, historically and by tradition, are encouraged to look no deeper intoscripture than the textual narrative, and seem quite satisfied to relegate themagnificent forces of creation to an ill-tempered and fickle mountain-thundergoblin named Jehovah.Ironically, the Germans gave us the pronunciation Je-ho-vah. It's not a bad try.As we all know, there are no vowels in Hebrew. The little dots and lines(dageshes or points) we see placed over and under the letters of Hebrew words togive dues to pronunciation are a very new innovation to the language. Theoriginal texts did not have these points, and so each letter of a word could bepronounced in many different ways.A simple method to examine just one of the pronunciation choices available is toadd a long English vowel sound (A, E, I, O, U) after any given letter. Let'stake the letter “B” or Beth images [../images/00026.jpeg], Ignore if image iscover image: images [../images/00005.jpeg] in Hebrew. Beth can sound like “bay,”or “bee,” or “by,” or “bow,” or “boo.” The letter “P” or Peh images[../images/00170.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg] can sound like “pay,” or “pee,” or “pie,” or “pow,” or“poo.” If there was a Hebrew word spelled images [../images/00171.jpeg], Ignoreif image is cover image: images [../images/00005.jpeg] it might be pronounced“pap,” or “payp,” or “peep,” or “pip,” or “pipe,” or “pop,” or “pope,” or “pup,”or “papa,” or “pappy,” or “popeye,” or “peepee,” or “poopoo.”2[part0020.html#chap5_ft2]Table 2. Sounding Out the Letters.images [../images/00172.jpeg]In Table 2 I have itemized just some of the various ways the letters of theTetragrammaton (Yod, Heh, Vau, Heh) can be sounded out.

Truly, there is no end to the possible pronunciations of images[../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg].♦ Students of Zen could meditate upon the inscrutable I-He-We-Who?♦ Chanting the mantra You-Who-Way-High might bring the devotee to therealization of I-Who-Way-High?♦ Tantric lovers might lure their divine lover by cooing “Yoo-Hoo!

Ha-Wah-Ee!”♦ Perhaps the God of cowboys is called Gee-Hah! Wah-Hoo!Tradition informs us that each year on the tenth day of Tisri (October 10), theDay of Atonement, the High Priest of Israel made three trips into the Most HolyPlace of the Great Temple and sprinkled the Ark of the Covenant with blood.Around his leg was tied a long braided rope. The other end of the rope was heldby friends of the High Priest who were stationed well outside of the veiledconfines of the Most Holy Place. On his third visit to the Most Holy Place,while a multitude of the faithful stood outside the temple and made a lot ofnoise, the High Priest placed his hands directly upon the Ark and uttered theIneffable Name as the fiery Deity revealed Itself in cloud and lightning abovethe lid (“Mercy Seat”) of the Ark.Sounds like a simple ritual, doesn't it? It was not unlike those practiced byEgyptian and Babylonian priests who once or twice a year penetrated their God'ssanctum sanctorum, and offered prayers and oblations before sacred statues orother holy objects. What made this ceremony a little different, however, had todo with that rope the High Priest had tied around his leg. It was put there fora very good reason—a reason that, while perhaps not immediately apparent, hadeverything to do with the correct pronunciation of images[../images/00173.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg]The rope was needed because every once in a while, at the climax of this supremeceremony, the High Priest exploded! Not only that, after the poor fellow'sspectacular departure, the Holy of Holies filled with so much smoke and firethat it became too dangerous to enter, and the barbecued remains of the Priesthad to be dragged from the chamber by the rope.4 [part0020.html#chap5_ft3] Thenext year a new High Priest would have to give it another try.In order for us to understand these strange circumstances and the truepronunciation of the Ineffable Name, it will be necessary for me to talk brieflyabout the Ark of the Covenant.First of all, we have to remember that the warring people of Old Testament timeswere a very superstitious lot. They carried their gods into battle with them inthe form of statues, or animals, or other talismanic objects, such asmeteorites, or monumental cheeses.4 [part0020.html#chap5_ft4] If one sidehappened to win a battle, their god was considered superior to the god of theloosing side. Very often the first thing the vanquished army would do afterregrouping was to steal the god of the winners and put it to work for them. Weread in First Samuel this happened to the Ark of the Covenant. The Philistinesstole it, but later returned it when they discovered it kept killing anyone whotried to move it. Good riddance!The Ark was a rectangular box that contained the magic goodies from the exodus:Aaron's rod5 [part0020.html#chap5_ft5] that performed all those miracles inEgypt; a pot of manna, the heavenly food that sprang up like mushrooms in themorning dew and fed the children of the exodus in the wilderness; a pan ofliquid referred to as anointing oil, and most importantly, the stone tablets ofthe Law.In Exodus chapter 25, images [../images/00173.jpeg], Ignore if image is coverimage: images [../images/00005.jpeg] gave very specific directions how the Arkwas to be constructed:And they shall make an ark of shittim wood, two-and-a-half cubits long, and acubit-and-a-half broad, and a cubit-and-a-half high.6 [part0020.html#chap5_ft6]And you shall overlay it with pure gold, without and within shall you overlayit, and shall make upon it a crown of gold roundabout. And you shall cast fourrings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof, and two rings onthe other side of it. And you shall make poles of shittim wood, and overlay themwith gold. And you shall put the poles into the rings by the sides of the ark,that the ark may be borne with them. The poles shall remain in the rings of theark; they shall never be taken out of them. And you shall put into the ark thetestimony which I shall give you. And you shall make a mercy seat7[part0020.html#chap5_ft7] of pure gold, two-and-a-half cubits long, and acubit-and-a-half broad. 8 [part0020.html#chap5_ft8] And you shall make twocherubim of gold, of cast work shall you make them, on the two sides of themercy seat. And make one cherub on the one side, and the other cherub on theother side of the mercy seat; thus you shall make two cherubim on the two sidesthereof And the cherubim shall spread forth their wings on high, covering themercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; towardthe mercy seal shall the faces of the cherubim be. And you shall put the mercyseat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that Ishall give you. And there I will meet you, and I will commune with you fromabove the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark ofthe testimony, of all things which I will command you concerning the children ofIsrael.The Ark was a lethal weapon and the Israelites treated it like one. They kept itwrapped in cloth and leather, and the men who carried it had to wear specialclothes and special shoes. That didn't always help. The Bible tells us thatpeople who accidentally touched or got too near the Ark were struck by lightningor consumed by flashes of fire.The Great Temple of Solomon appears to have been built not so much as a house ofworship, but as a prison for the dangerous and unpredictable Ark. The Holy ofHolies where the Ark rested was built like a containment chamber, a perfectcube, thirty feet long, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet high. The floor,walls, and ceiling were lined with pure gold, weighing an estimated 45,000pounds, and riveted in place with golden nails. Sometimes the Ark would belchout so much smoke that the Priests of the Temple were driven completely out ofthe building and could not perform their routine duties.9[part0020.html#chap5_ft9]It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that a wooden box with a double liningof gold and closed with a slab of gold, containing pots of mysterioussubstances, heavy plates and rods submerged in a pan of liquid, was in alllikelihood a gigantic and highly unstable battery. The two cherubim on the lidserved as the anode and cathode, and a spark or “arc” (the flaming presence ofGod) jumped madly between the tips of the two highly conductive golden wings.I can hear you laughing, dear students, but I must remind you that viablebatteries have been found in Egyptian tombs of this period and before.10[part0020.html#chap5_ft10] I am confident if you review the biblical descriptionof the Ark, and its deadly behavior, you will find nothing inconsistent with theperformance of such a primitive electrical device. Such a spectacular and deadlylightshow would most certainly have been an awful spectacle of terror, and avery useful tool if one wanted to keep the troops in line during a 40-yearcampout.The High Priest must have been a pretty brave fellow to enter that room and playelectrical Russian roulette with “Ole Sparky.” As he lay both hands upon thatterrible device, his flesh would divert the current that normally arced betweenthe Cherubic wings and for one spectacular moment the power of images[../images/00167.jpeg], Ignore if image is cover image: images[../images/00005.jpeg] literally dwelt in his contorting body. If he survivedthe event, he was most likely transformed into a very mellow holy man,exhibiting the same docile behavior and mystical inscrutability of patients ofmodern shock therapy. I would guess he was also pretty interesting to talkto—full of spiritual insights and profound messages from God.So that, dear ones, is the secret of the Ark of the Covenant. But, I hear youasking, what about the true pronunciation of images [../images/00167.jpeg],Ignore if image is cover image: images [../images/00005.jpeg] the ineffable nameof God? Well, I think every year it was pronounced a little differently, but ifI were to give you a general idea of how it sounded, I would say it soundedsomething like…"},{"pageContent":"6THE FOUR QABALISTIC WORLDS AND THE FOUR PARTS OF THE SOULIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteThere aren't really four Qabalistic Worlds—only one with amnesia.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDIn the Spring of 1991, Rabbi Ben Clifford became obsessed with the idea ofmaking a Qabalistic documentary. He approached several Southern Californiafilmmakers who predictably gave him no encouragement whatsoever. Undaunted, hebegan in earnest to write the script. He was absolutely convinced that, “Oncethe Qliphotic demons of media see the Assiahic manifestation of my Briahesquegenius, they will immediately recognize its pure Atziluthness and transformthemselves into angels of Yetzirah and demand to be part of its fullmaterialization in Assiah.”1 [part0020.html#chap6_ft1]The documentary, of course, was never made. Although the Rabbi claimed to havefinished writing the entire text, no finished manuscript has ever beendiscovered. The largest and most complete remnant of the script remains in thepossession of Dr. I. Z. Gilford, Ben Clifford's veterinarian, who found itlining the floor of the Rabbi's rooftop pigeon coop.Fortunately, for present and future Chicken Qabalists, this surviving fragmentdeals with the all-important subjects of the Tetragrammaton images[../images/00174.jpeg] Yod Heh Vau Heh), the four Qabalistic worlds, and thefour parts of the human soul. I think you will agree with me that it is a pitythat the documentary was never produced. The Rabbi had a surprisingly keen senseof how familiar visual images can be used to communicate abstract concepts. Dr.Gilford, who has graciously allowed me to reproduce the Rabbi's the manuscript,has requested that I reproduce the material complete with Ben Clifford'ssomewhat amateurish notes for stage directions, casting, and blocking. I haverespected his wishes, and hope the reader will use “the mind's eye” to bring BenClifford's dream of a Qabalistic documentary to life.Let's Learn Chicken Qabalahimages [../images/00175.jpeg] AN ESOTERIC DOCUMENTARY WRITTEN AND NARRATED BY RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDPART IThe Four Qabalistic WorldsSketch: The Qabalistic ElevatorSCENE ILocation: Parking lot of a four-story office building.RABBI:This building is the universe. Not only the physical universe which we perceivewith its awkward limitations of time and space—but the whole ball of wax—thetotality of every dimension, energy, and aspect of consciousness. Qabalists tellus that each of us is a miniature version of this totality.[pointing to building]All that was, is, and shall be is right in there…[pointing to his own heart]…and right here.This Supreme One is too profoundly simple for our poor minds to contemplate. Inorder for us to even begin to speculate upon the nature of this One we areforced to hypothetically divide it up and consider it in various parts.If we divide it into two parts we can consider it in terms of dualities:darkness-light, male-female, on-off, hot-cold; you get the picture.If we divide it into three parts, we can consider it in terms of thethesis-antithesis-synthesis trinity of your choice;creation-preservation-destruction; father-mother-child; too hot-too cold-justright.Do you see where this is taking us? The more we divide the Great One, the moreknowledge and understanding we uncover from the individual parts. But, at thesame time, we drift farther from the abstract perfection of the One.The ancient Qabalists delighted in dividing the One in many ways, but theprimary, and some say, supreme division was by four, and they gave this fourfoldDeity a four-letter name: Yod Heh Vau Heh.[pointing again to building]That building over there is one building with four floors. Let's go inside andsee what One looks like when it is divided into four parts.RABBI enters door marked:images [../images/00176.jpeg]SCENE IILocation: Furniture warehouse showroom.[The first interior shot is of a furniture warehouse showroom of chairs.Thousands of chairs of every size and description, even benches, stools, andpews. Rabbi walks over to a huge overstuffed chair, sits down and says:]RABBI:Ah…. This is what I need. We are in the chair division of the material universe.There are lots of other divisions, too. In fact, there is a section on thisfloor for absolutely everything in the phenomenal universe, including you andme— a table section, a tree section, a canned soup section, a section for smallvibrating appliances—even a section for solar systems and galaxies— all righthere on Floor One.Qabalists call this world Assiah,2 [part0020.html#chap6_ft2] the material plane.It's the lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds, and is represented by the finalletter Heh in the Great Name.But back to these chairs. Where do they all come from? You might answer that thewood comes from trees, and the nails come from raw metal, and the wool coveringscome from sheep, but you would be wrong, because all you are really saying isthat the wood comes from the tree section of this floor, the nails from themetal section, and the wool from sheep division of the material plane.That being the case, where on Earth do all these chairs come from? The fact is,nothing on this floor comes from Earth at all. These chairs and everything elsein the phenomenal universe only manifest here.[Rabbi struggles to get out of the easy chair…perhaps has to be helped up bycrew member. Once up, he walks toward the elevator. Camera follows:]To begin to understand where things really come from we have to go one floor up.RABBI enters elevator.images [../images/00177.jpeg]SCENE IIILocation: Interior of elevator.[From inside the elevator Rabbi pushes button marked:]images [../images/00178.jpeg]SCENE IVLocation: Blueprint room.[Elevator door opens to reveal a room where hundreds of blueprints are hung byinvisible wires. The room is filled with people in white, short-sleeved shirts,loud ties, and black slacks. All have pocket protectors and wear dark-rimmedglasses (some broken and taped at the bridge). Many are holding pencils, pens,T-squares, compasses, protractors, and other mechanical drawing instruments.They are all engaged in animated conversations, making broad gestures with theirhands as they talk.]RABBI [voice hushed]:These nerds are angels…[Rabbi is interrupted for a moment by juvenile squeals and wildly irritatinglaughter from one of the nerds.]…quite low on the hierarchical scale, actually, but they are hard workers andsmart as whips.We are one floor up and directly above the chair area of Assiah, the world ofHeh Final. This place is Yetzirah, the world of Vau. It's called the FormativeWorld, and these angels are hard at work putting the final touches on theblueprints for all those chairs down on the first floor. They can't actuallymake the chairs up here because this is the world of thought, not matter.[Camera pans to a group of nerds gathered around a slide projector projectingthe photo of a chair on a screen. Excited applause and more irritatinglaughter.]This level of creation is “the mind's eye.” Absolutely everything, tangible orintangible, that is conceived of in the mind, is formed here in Yetzirah.Artists who know what their paintings should look like before they startpainting, composers who can hear their own music in their minds before it isplayed, grandmas who know in July what the Thanksgiving table should look like,are all communicating directly with the angels on this floor.But, smart as they are, these guys need inspiration and direction from a higherconsciousness. They must take their orders from somewhere else.RABBI enters elevator.images [../images/00177.jpeg]SCENE VLocation: Interior of elevator.[From inside the elevator Rabbi pushes button marked:]images [../images/00179.jpeg]SCENE VILocation: Shower stall of Thomas Edison's bathroom.[Room is very steamy. Subtitle appears on the screen: “Thomas Edison'sbathroom—1877.” We hear the sound of running water and the voice of ThomasEdison singing “You Light Up My Life.”]RABBI [voice hushed]:The person in the shower isn't really Thomas Edison. Actually, he's an angel, avery high angel, really. For our purpose, we can even call him an archangel. Thereason we find him in the likeness of Edison and taking a nice shower in thegreat inventor's bathroom is to help us illustrate something about thisQabalistic World—the world of Briah, the Creative World.Now, Edison didn't invent the chair, but he did invent (or improve upon) anunbelievable number of things that brought revolutionary change to the world;the light bulb, the phonograph, and motion pictures, to name a few. There's nodoubt about it, the man was a genius. But we might ask, how could one manpossibly invent all of those things? Where did he get the time? Let's watch fora few moments.[Suddenly the singing stops. The water is turned off Silence. Then Edisonshouts:]EDISON:Yessssssss![Edison opens the door to the shower stall and steps out in a cloud of steam. Hedances excitedly, naked before the large steamed-over mirror in front of thesink.]EDISON:Yes! Yes, Yes, they'll love it! They'll absolutely love it! We'll make millions!Millions! Mary! Mary! Send for Clifford, my chief engineer. Get him in hereright now!RABBI [voice hushed]:Actually, we don't know if Clifford was the name of Edison's chief engineer. Forour purposes it doesn't really matter, so I named him after my father.[Edison's chief engineer timidly enters the bathroom. He is wearing the exactsame outfit as the nerd angels in Yetzirah. Edison goes to the steamed-overmirror and begins to draw things on the mirror with his finger.]EDISON:Clifford, I've invented a machine that can record and play backsounds—voices—music—body noises—anything![Edison outlines a crude cylinder on the mirror—his finger makes a squeakingsound as it rubs the glass]EDISON:Hear that? You know how things make a sound when you rub them together orscratch them? Well, we make a “rubby-scratchy thing” out of a rotating cylinderor something, see? And then you connect it to something else—1 don't know what—asomething that we then somehow hook up to that telephone diaphragm we made. See?And then somehow you get the rubby-vibrations to scratch up the “rubby-scratchything.” Then all we have to do is figure out how to rub those scratches withsomething else, then maybe run the scratchy vibrations along to anotherdiaphragm or something, so we can replay the same kind of noise that made thescratches on “rubby-scratchy thing” in the first place. See?[Clifford scratches his head]EDISON:Then, then—You'll love this![Edison draws a large cone on the mirror.]EDISON:Then you get the scratchy sounds to go in the small end of this cone, see? Andwhen it comes out the big end it's real loud! Real loud! See?RABBI [voice hushed]:.Let's just take a look at that mirror. All we see is a crude cylinder, twosquiggly lines, something that looks like a box, and a cone resting on its sidewith an arrow pointing at the large end and the words, “Big noise comes outhere!”images [../images/00180.jpeg][Clifford stares blankly at the mirror.]EDISON:I call it the phonograph. Run along now, and tidy up the details. I want to seea working model by the weekend. I'm going fishing with Hank Ford and WilburWright. There's a good fellow.RABBI:Now, I'm not sure that's exactly what happened when the phonograph was invented,but generally speaking, this is just how Edison operated. Very often he wouldcome up with the very vaguest of ideas, scribble down a crude drawing and a fewnotes, and then turn it over to a team of well-paid and highly motivatedassistants. These “angels” would then bring Edison's concept to life bypainstakingly inventing all the little devices that would make Edison's inspiredbig machine work.Edison's ideas (archangelic inspirations) came from the creative world of Briah,his assistants (angelic executors of the archangelic will) were the workers inthe formative world of Yetzirah, who eventually manifested the inventions on thematerial plane of Assiah.Or, more simply—Everything in the Material World exists as a pattern in theFormative World that has its motivation for being in the Creative World.But what is above that?—in the highest Qabalistic world. Atziluth, the World ofYod.images [../images/00177.jpeg]SCENE VIILocation: Interior of elevator.[From inside the elevator Rabbi pushes button marked:]images [../images/00181.jpeg]SCENE VIIILocation: Cloud-filled formless world of swirling light and mists.[Rabbi stays inside the elevator and holds the door open as camera enters themist. Ambient music is playing. Within the music we hear the faint sounds of aman and a woman—in unison—making sensuous love sighs. The light pulsateserotically against the undulating clouds giving the abstract appearance of a manand a woman locked in a writhing embrace:]RABBI [voice hushed]:This is Atziluth, the Archetypal World. Atziluth could be considered the will ofthe Deity in its purest aspect. It's the highest and most perfect of the fourworlds. In Atziluth there is no separation of the male and female aspects of theDeity; they are eternally united in blissThe remaining three worlds are the products of this ecstatic union, and as wehave seen, continue to diminish in purity as we descend to the lower floors.But, luckily for us, what looks like degenerating energy from the Deity's pointof view, looks like creation itself to us pitiful creatures rooting around downon the first floor.RABBI [whispering]:Remember, we are standing four floors directly above that lovely lounge chair inthe chair section of the first floor. Let's see what the Deity has on Its mind.[Music lowers and the voices can be heard clearly. Voices never speakseparately, but always say their lines in perfect unison.]THE DEITY:[male and female aspects locked in ecstatic embrace]“Aaaaah! Was it good for us?Ooo yes! It's always and eternally good for us.Mmmm! But we're a bit tired now, aren't we?Wouldn't we like to rest now?Oh yes! Yes! Oh, for a moment to pause.Even ecstasy is boring if it never stops.”RABBI [whispering]:Well, things are pretty vaporous in Archetypal World. Up here in Atziluth thereare no forms or images, just pure conscious energy—a dynamo of bliss. But itsounds like even this dynamo needs to kick back and relax on occasion, if onlyto experience within itself the pulse of an expanding and contracting creationcycle.Of course, in other sections of this floor, the Deity is germinating othernebulous desires that will eventually manifest on the first floor in Assiah asabsolutely everything in the phenomenal universe. But right here in Atziluth,three levels above the chairs in the Material World, the vague desire for restis unique to this particular section of the Deity's consciousness.Oh listen! I think a divine impulse from the Atziluthic Deity is about toinspire the Thomas Edison Archangel of chairs one floor down in Briah…[Voices rise in an ecstatic crescendo of:]“Yes! Rest! Yess! Rest! Yesss! Rest! Rest! Rest!”CUT TOSCENE IXLocation: Thomas Edison's bathroom.[Edison looks at himself in the mirror, heaves a heavy sigh, squats and attemptsto sit where there is nothing to sit upon, and tumbles to the floor. Strains ofcelestial music are heard. For a moment a great light appears above Edison'shead. He looks up, becomes inspired with the universal concept of rest, thenrealizes the immediate need for a device to sit upon. He shouts:]EDISON:Clifford! Get in here!RABBI:The Archangelic intelligence of Briah then communicates broad general conceptsof seating devices to the detail-loving Angel-nerds of Yetzirah…CUT TOSCENE XLocation: Blueprint room.[Clifford hurriedly distributes memos to excited nerd angels. Much juvenilesquealing and wildly irritating laughter is heard.]CUT TOSCENE XILocation: Furniture warehouse showroom.[Rabbi is back seated comfortably in the easy chair.]…who finally manage to inspire someone down here in Assiah to quit daydreamingabout things and get off their rear ends and actually construct the chair of hisor her dreams.[From his easy chair, Rabbi uses a pointer to indicate the Hebrew lettersimages[../images/00182.jpeg] on a nearby blackboard.]Yod—Heh—Vau—Heh is the fourfold creative process. It is the formula by which thepure consciousness of the Deity (Yod) descends into matter (Heh Final). From ourpoint of view down here in Assiah, it appears like the wonder of creation.You might think that, from the Deity's point of view, this creative processappears to be a depressing degeneration of energy and power. But I don't thinkthat is the case.Remember the Third Command-Rant—There really isn't a creation, time or space,Heaven or Earth—because the ultimate reality resides not in Assiah…[Pointing to the letter Heh Final images [../images/00183.jpeg]…or Yetzirah…[Pointing to the letter Vau images [../images/00184.jpeg]…or Briah…[Pointing to the letter Heh images [../images/00185.jpeg]…But right here in Yodland…[Pointing to the letter Yod images [../images/00186.jpeg]…Atziluth, the environment of pure and infinite consciousness—infinite bliss.The other worlds are as unreal as your shadow.[Rabbi pulls three pair of sunglasses out of his pocket and puts them on, oneover the other.]Assiah is like looking at the Sun with three pairs of sunglasses. The MaterialWorld is just the heaviest, slowest, and grossest aspects of the Divine light.[Takes off one pair of sunglasses.]We see more in Yetzirah…[Takes off another pair of sunglasses.]…and Briah is much brighter but…[Takes off last pair of sunglasses.]But those three worlds are just the distorted image of the real thing.[Rabbi rests back in the easy chair and closes his eyes. Camera slowly zooms inon his peaceful face as he falls asleep in the easy chair.][At extreme close-up, image blurs completely, then refocuses on Rabbi's face,then pulls back to reveal Rabbi's dead body lying on its back on a dissectiontable in a morgue.

Four Qabalistic Worlds.PART IIThe Four Parts of the SoulSketch: The Qabalistic AutopsySCENE ILocation: Operating room of morgue; Rabbi's body on table.[Music: Organ, Hymn, “Abide with Me. ”]RABBI [voice over]:Then shall the dust return to Earth as it was, and the spirit return unto Godwho gave it.[Music stops. As Rabbi narrates, camera slowly pans his body from toe to head(for modesty's sake his genital area and the genital areas of his tattoos aremarked off with black tape).]I really look natural, don't I? This is a dissection room of the Qabalisticmorgue, and I have volunteered my body for a little demonstration of the fourparts of the soul.Because humans are “made in the image” of the Deity, we reflect the samedynamics as our huge and eternal counterpart. Each of us is a four story Yod,Heh, Vau, Heh, with our own little Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah righthere inside us—four parts of our soul which Qabalists refer to as (starting atthe top) Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach, and Nephesh. Like the Qabalistic worlds, thethree lower parts of the soul are just the distorted image of our real identity,Chiah, the life-force itselfRABBI:The lowest part of the soul, which corresponds to Assiah, the Material World, iscalled the Nephesh—animal vitality or the animal soul.The physical body is not really the Nephesh, but the veil of the Nephesh. I callit Nephesh crust. As science advances and we learn more and more about theneural-electrical-magnetic nature of the body, it gets harder to determine wherethe crust leaves off and the Nephesh begins. Let's just say for starters thatthe Nephesh is that primitive level of consciousness that we share with theanimal kingdom—our instincts, our primitive appetites, emotions and sex drive,our survival mechanisms. We can observe the Nephesh manifest most clearly inindividuals who, because of unfortunate circumstances, are deprived of theproper function of the rational mind. We can also spot it in ourselves inmoments of blind rage, or when we are so frightened of a fire we jump out thewindow of a 16-story building, or when we get so horny we forget this fling willruin our lives.Wild and dangerous as the Nephesh can be, it makes each of us complete—anaccurate reflection of the greater spiritual reality—it is where we live—it isour personal Assiah and every angel in the celestial realms would give its rightwing to own one.[Morgue Doctor in surgical clothes moves into the picture. She takes a scalpelfrom the instrument tray and moves toward the Rabbi's head. Camera zooms in onthe neck area, as the scalpel blade nears the throat. Camera moves away beforeany incision is made]The part of the soul that corresponds to Yetzirah, the Formative World, iscalled the Ruach—the intellect. Just as the physical body is the crust of theNephesh, the Nephesh forms the crust of the Ruach.images [../images/00177.jpeg]SCENE IILocation: Medical Laboratory, complete with Bunsen burners, glass tubing, andelectronic instruments.[Special effects: Rabbi's severed head is sitting up on its neck facing thecamera. It is resting in a shallow laboratory pan half-filled with liquid.Several tubes lead from the liquid to bubbling beakers. Rabbi's head opens itseyes and now becomes the narrator.]RABBI'S HEAD:Don't try this at home. This is just a cheap trick to introduce us to the nextpart of our soul, the Ruach.Above the Nephesh, corresponding to the world of Yetzirah and the Vau of theTetragrammaton, is the Ruach— the Intellect and the vehicle of Self-awareness.Now, obviously my physical head and brain are not the real Ruach, because allorganic things are too gross to qualify for Ruach-hood. But as you look at myhead here in this laboratory pan, I want you to think.If your feet and your legs were amputated, you would still be you, right? And ifyour arms were amputated, wouldn't you still consider yourself you? Providedscience could keep you alive, how much of your body could be amputated orremoved before you would lose your you-ness?You might answer you would still be you as long as you can think and maintainconsciousness of yourselfBut that's the big Ruach lie! Thinking and consciousness are not the samething—not the same thing at all.The Ruach part of your soul monopolizes your attention to such a degree that youidentify yourself completely with the thinking process. Descartes fell for thishook, line, and sinker when he said “Cogito ergo sum—I think, therefore I am.”Ultimately, the real you doesn't need the “think” part of the equation to“maintain consciousness.” Even if you could no longer “think” there would stillbe “you” and there would still be “consciousness.” The Ruach part of your soul,however, is incapable of grasping that subtle fact. It is unable to transcenditself to imagine a self without thinking.Like a narcissistic and domineering mother, Ruach consumes your fullattention—causing you to think about life rather than live it—seek understandingrather than enlightenment—comprehension rather than bliss.[Morgue Doctor again moves into the picture. She picks up a power drill. Camerazooms in on the Rabbi's head as the Doctor places the drill-tip directly to hisforehead at the area of the third eye. Camera moves away before the drillingbegins. The Rabbi's head continues his narration over the sound of thedrilling.]The part of the soul that corresponds to Briah, the Creative World and the Hehof the Tetragrammaton, is called the Neshamah—the seat of our TranscendentAwareness. Just as the physical body is the crust of the Nephesh, and theNephesh forms the crust of the Ruach, the Ruach forms the crust of the Neshamah.[Special effects: The camera enters the darkness of the neatly drilled hole inthe Rabbi's forehead]RABBI:Practitioners of ceremonial magick often argue with each other over thequestion, “Are angels, demons, spirits, and other magical phenomena objective orsubjective realities? Do they exist outside of us or are they just in ourheads?”The answer is simple. The spirits and every other denizen of objective realityare all in your head—only—you have no idea how infinitely huge your head is!images [../images/00177.jpeg]SCENE IIILocation: Interior Rabbi's head—a cozy den with a modest fireplace before whichwe find a golden retriever asleep on a braided rug, and the Rabbi reclined in aneasy chair. He is calmly smoking a pipe. His eyes are closed, but the brow ofhis forehead is furrowed as if he is in profound thought or mystical reverie. Henever opens his eyes but continues his narration in voice-over.RABBI:The Neshamah, the Thomas Edison Archangel part of your soul, is the SoulIntuition. It is our Transcendent Awareness, that part of us that rises abovethe thinking process and vibrates in greater harmony with the ultimate reality.We can't really understand the Neshamah because the machinery of our thoughts isbased in Ruach, and can only take in so much information before going intooverload and breaking down.For our illustration here, we view my Neshamah as being centered inside myphysical skull. It may or may not be centered there, but there is one thing forcertain—the Neshamah part of our soul reaches infinitely farther than theconfines of our physical body. As a matter of fact, for all intents andpurposes, the scope of the Neshamah is infinite. It is in touch with energiesand levels of consciousness our Ruach would not understand even if it couldconceive of them.We have all heard stories of mothers, separated from their children by hundredsor thousands of miles, knowing instinctively when their young one's are indanger. Is this because at the traumatic moment the child emits some kind ofsignal is that telegraphed across the ocean to the mother? No! It is because themother's Neshamah is so huge the child can never escape it, no matter how manymiles separate their physical bodies.A mother's intuition is only a very primitive example of this TranscendentAwareness. It is clear to me that if it were possible to understand the scopeand potential of the human Neshamah we could solve many of the mysteriessurrounding the so-called “supernatural” events of religious traditions and theunanswered questions of modern psychic research.The highest part of the soul that corresponds to Atziluth, the Archetypal World,and the Yod of the Tetragrammaton, is called the Chiah. It is the undilutedLife-Force itself, and it is our true identity. All the other parts of the soulare veils of the Chiah. Just as the physical body is the crust of the Nephesh,and the Nephesh forms the crust of the Ruach, and the Ruach forms the crust ofthe Neshamah—the Neshamah forms the crust of the Chiah. If we found the Neshamahhard to talk about, our Chiah is even more challenging.[Special effects: The camera backs up to reveal that the entire scene of theinterior of the Rabbi's head is only an image on a television screen. A hand,holding a remote clicker comes into view. The hand aims the clicker at thetelevision and pushes a button. The television screen changes to the blank andsnowy image found in between channels.][Over the white noise of the blank screen the Rabbi continues his voice-overnarration.]RABBI:We've all seen this snowy image and heard this irritating hiss whenever we tunein a television channel that isn't carrying a broadcast signal. Astronomers nowtell us that what we are seeing and hearing is nothing more or less than theradiation echo of the Big Bang itself, which emanates hauntingly from the emptyspace between the stars. If we personified this unimaginable energy as a God, itwould dwarf to insignificance all the lesser forces and beings in the celestialfamily. Such is the nature of the Chiah when compared to the other parts of thesoul.Yod—Heh—Vau—HehAtziluth—Briah—Yetzirah—AssiahChiah—Neshamah—Ruach—NepheshThe Nephesh lives but is not self-aware. The Ruach is self-aware and aware theself is living. The Neshamah is the essence of life's awareness, but the Chiahis Life itself, the soul's true identity.If there is any purpose for our incarnations, it is to perfectly integrate thefour parts of our soul so that we can function as perfect units of the supremeconsciousness and uninhibitedly manifest that consciousness on all planes ofexistence.[Special effects: The hand, holding a remote clicker, comes again into view. Thehand aims the clicker at the television and pushes a button. The television goesdark except for the tiny white dot in the center of the screen.

It is pure consciousness. Its radiance neverdiminishes. The nine Sephiroth beneath it simply separate andfilter the light. This trickle-down consciousness, not somemythological fruit-eating incident, is the real “Fall of Man.”—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDTo Chicken Qabalists (and other modern students who presume a more exaltedopinion of themselves), the schematic image known as the Tree of Life is themost recognizable symbol of Qabalah. Esteemed as it is, this diagram of theanatomy of God is by no means the most ancient1 [part0020.html#chap7_ft1]Qabalistic device, but its components (the 10 primal emanations of creation, orSephiroth,2 [part0020.html#chap7_ft2] and the 22 paths that connect them)display with remarkable simplicity the most important and venerable principlesof Qabalistic doctrine.Although the Tree of Life, as such, is not mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah,3[part0020.html#chap7_ft3] it is the visual elaboration of the fundamentalstatement of that great text that informs us that “Deity created the universe in32 mysterious paths of wisdom—1 0 Sephiroth out of nothing and 22 letters.”How did the author(s) of the Sepher Yetzirah reach the conclusion that 10Sephiroth out of nothing and 22 letters were the vehicles of divine creation?Most certainly it was an oral tradition predating the Sepher Yetzirah, but ithad to have originated somewhere. Predictably Rabbi Ben Clifford had the answer,and this chapter is dedicated to his thoughts on the matter.What follows are transcriptions and notes from two long-suppressed taperecordings made by Ben Clifford in 1978 and 1979. During the period of hispublic ministry, these early tapes, and the so-called documents that accompaniedthem, posed somewhat of an embarrassment to his students who believed, with goodreason, that if they were made public Ben Clifford's reputation would beirreparably damaged. The source of this concern stemmed not from the content ofthe material (which, as we shall soon see, is rich in Qabalistic wisdom), butfrom the incredulous format of the presentation.It appears the Rabbi would actually have us believe that he possessed original“essays” written over twenty-five hundred years ago by students of theZerubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth. I am sure I do not have to tell thereader that Ben Clifford is again having us on in this matter. But please don'tlet this literary device tempt you to dismiss the value of these littlecompositions. They are some of the most ingenious examples of Qabalistic logic Ihave ever seen displayed. I find it quite easy to believe that, sometime in thedistant past, the fundamental elements of the Qabalah were developed in a mannernot too dissimilar to that outlined by these imaginary students.Sacred Numbers and the Creation of the Tree of Lifeimages [../images/00175.jpeg]EDITED FROM THE TRANSCRIPTIONS AND NOTES OFTHE TAPE-RECORDED PRESENTATIONS OFRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDGOOD MORNING MY FRIENDS. Please help yourselves to coffee and doughnuts. Today'spresentation is a very special one (I'm even tape recording it), so I want youall to stay awake. I am very excited about today's lecture and I think youshould be, too. Not only are we going to learn about sacred numbers and thecreation of the Tree of Life, we are first going to discover some astoundingthings concerning the history of this beloved institution. So, let's take ourseats and quiet down. (Unintelligible question from a student) Yes, but pleasekeep your socks on.I am often asked, “Rabbi Ben Clifford, you speak often of the ZerubbabelInstitute of Philosophical Youth, yet we see no buildings, find no trace of suchan organization in the directories of schools, or even the telephone directory.Is not Z.I.P.Y. a child of your own imagination?” Well, dear friends, mock andscoff as you will, you need look no further than the sacred scripturesthemselves. Behold! It is written in the eleventh chapter of the Book of Ezra.4[part0020.html#chap7_ft4] (A facsimile of this page is reproduced for interestedreaders on page 108 [part0015.html#page_108].)images [../images/00189.jpeg]Figure 11. From the Book of Ezra.Thus, more than 2,500 years ago, was born the Zerubbabel Institute ofPhilosophical Youth, or Z.I.P.Y., and you, my dear students, are the inheritorsof that proud tradition.Let's imagine that we are the first students of that great Qabalistic school. Weare not sure how we got here. Perhaps we earned a scholarship. Perhaps ourfathers are wealthy, or members of the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce, or theyare government or temple officials. Regardless of how we came to be here, ourassignment is simple. We are to think about things—all day—all night.To focus our considerations, and to give us scaffolding upon which to performour mental gymnastics, our teachers have provided us with a single text, ThePentateuch: The Five Books of Moses.5 [part0020.html#chap7_ft5] We are told thatthese writings are holy, and if we apply ourselves diligently, every mystery ofHeaven and Earth will reveal itself to us in these pages.“But sir?” a learned student might have injected, “I've read the Pentateuchscores of times, and the mysteries of Heaven and Earth have not revealedthemselves to me.”“Then, my son,” our teacher might have answered, “You must seek them—onesentence, one word, one letter at a time. If that doesn't work, you are to readthe texts backward, count the words, count the characters, transpose, transfer,translate, transliterate, shuffle and braid the letters—skin, dissect, magnify,synonymize, antonymize, homonymize them until your brain explodes. Only then canyour mind purge itself of the false reality of contradiction. Then and only thenwill the pure wisdom of God flood into your vacuous skull to fill the void.”“But sir? If God made everything and His essence pervades everything then wouldnot examination and meditation upon any text, indeed any thing whatsoever rewardus with the same spiritual enlightenment?“Yes, my son, you are absolutely correct. But the fact remains we have enteredinto an exclusive covenant with the publishing house of Nut & Geb to supplyPentateuchs in deluxe editions to the school in perpetuity.”Of course there is no way of telling whether or not such a conversation evertook place between student and teacher.

We are not told that snakes, or aardvarks, orfish, or worms, or any other animals or plants were created in the image of theElohim.It seems to me that the question that begs asking is: “What separates humanbeings from other animals?” I think I have the answer, at least I have ananswer.Thumbs! We have thumbs!Sure, apes and monkeys and a few lemurs have thumbs, but none of them use themto create things. The fact that our thumb opposes the other four fingers is onevery important thing that separates us from the rest of our animal neighbors.With the opposable thumb our ancestors made weapons, harnessed fire, fashionedtools and implements, created works of art, and hitch-hiked. Our hands make uscreative beings (just like the Deity), and the thumb is the key to our hand'ssuccess. Therefore I have made the following conclusions: * The “hand” of the Creator (or the creative mechanics of the universe) must be an absolute unity (represented by the thumb), and that It executes Its creative power through a fourfold process (represented by the four fingers). This, I believe, is the primary reason our venerable ancestors worshiped one God whose great Name is composed of four letters,8 [part0020.html#chap7_ft8]images [../images/00190.jpeg] * The Hebrew word for “hand” is images [../images/00191.jpeg] YOD. Yod is the 10th letter of the Hebrew alphabet and the fundamental letter of the alphabet. As my father taught me, “Yod is a flame. Blow upon it and you form all the other letters of the alphabet.” Yod represents the number 10 in our system of counting. Furthermore, we can see that the holy number 4 itself conceals the number 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10).Conclusion:After meditating upon myself and my hand I conclude that there is one God whocreates through a fourfold process and ultimately manifests through ten levelsof expression. For this reason, I contend that the numbers ONE, FOUR, and TEN beconsidered holy and of primary importance in our study.Final Note:Dear Dr. Roe,This essay is 398 words in length. Do I get extra credit?—Shechaniah, the son of Jehielimages [../images/00192.jpeg]Winning Essay No. 2Submitted by Ramiah, the son of JeziahI am sure I speak for the entire class when I say that I am filled with greatadmiration for my classmate, Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, whose dissertationyesterday on the creative nature of God was a thrilling display of logic andinsight. I agree wholeheartedly with all his conclusions and wish to use them asthe foundation of further discussion.I think we can all agree that the creative power of the human hand, with itsopposable thumb, is a key characteristic that separates humans from other formsof terrestrial life. It is also very logical that we, being created in the imageof God, should conclude that God is an absolute monad who executes Its creativepower through a fourfold process. This supports our tradition of the FourQabalistic Worlds9 [part0020.html#chap7_ft9] which are mirrored in humans by theFour Parts of the Soul,10 [part0020.html#chap7_ft10] and should earn ourveneration for the numbers ONE and FOUR. Brother Shechaniah also pointed outthat, because the word Yod (hand) is the tenth letter of the sacred HebrewAlphabet, and that Yod represents the number 10, we should hold the number TENin high regard as well. Also, we must remember that we have two hands, with atotal of ten fingers, and this fact further underscores the importance of thenumber TEN.I now wish to point out that the word Yod (YVD images [../images/00193.jpeg]images [../images/00194.jpeg] images [../images/00195.jpeg]) spelled in full(Yimages [../images/00195.jpeg] = 10, Vimages [../images/00194.jpeg] = 6,Dimages [../images/00193.jpeg] = 4) adds to the number TWENTY, which reminds usthat we (and therefore God) have twenty digits, for, as the wise cobbler said,we mustn't forget our toes.Now you may ask, “Is TWENTY as significant and as holy a number as ONE or FOURor TEN?” I say no, because our ten toes, while providing certain symmetry to ourbodies, do not exactly set us apart from other less spiritually endowedcreatures. But in between our two sets of fingers there is one thing that does.Our tongue! We have a tongue—the power of speech! Through speech we communicateand inform—just as the Deity does! Through speech we create images in our mindsand in the minds of others— just as the Deity does! Through speech we give namesto all things in our environment and organize our thoughts—just as the Deitydoes! Through speech we bless and curse our friends and enemies—just as theDeity does! Through speech we command, subjugate, and exploit anyone whose willis weaker than our own—just as Deity does!Finally, between our two sets of toes is another member that actually gives usthe power to create other human beings in our own image. True, humans are notthe only creatures who reproduce. But our father Abraham entered into a covenantwith the Deity, a covenant sealed by a curious gesture of mutilation. The riteof circumcision not only symbolizes our obedience to our God, but also ouracknowledgment to ourselves that we can master and control our sexual drives forthe greater good of family, our race, and humanity in general.Conclusion:I think we all can agree that our unique powers of speech, and the godlike powerof creation (that both men and women carry in their loins), certainly qualify asdivine characteristics, and elevate the marvelous number TWENTY-TWO to equalstatus with ONE, FOUR, and TEN. As our holy Hebrew alphabet is composed of 22letters, I think there can be no debate on this matter.—Ramiah, the son of JeziahASSIGNMENT No. 2: Role-Playing Exercise.You are the Deity. You have not yet created anything.How would you go about making everything in theuniverse out of your Oneness?EXTRA CREDIT: Discover other Holy Numbers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Winning Essay No. 1Submitted by Zabad, the son of AzizaAfter studying the last few winning essays, I have to confess that I'm a littleembarrassed to share the fruits of my meditations. I don't come from the bigcity like most of my fellow students, and so I guess the wheels of my mindnaturally seek out the ruts of homier byways of deliberation.All I know is that if I were the Deity before creation, I must have been verylonely. Being the only and absolute Being, I might not even realize the natureof my own self. I symbolize this pre-creational state as a simple circle (I havechosen this figure because a circle has no beginning or end) and designate it bythe holy number ONE.images [../images/00196.jpeg]Figure 12. The Holy Number 1.Now, since I am ONE and absolute, it follows that ONE is the only realnumber—the only legitimate reality. As the Deity, I think I would be quite happyin my condition of oneness, and leave it at that, but something clearly happenedto induce me to create. In order for me to create the many things in theuniverse, I would need to create more numbers. I think it happened like this:I was alone and bored, and began to ponder the nature of myself. “What am I?”This was difficult because I was the only ONE. I had nothing else with which tocompare myself. I wasn't a “this” or a “that” because I had not yet created“thises” or “thats.” I was the absolute, there was no “outside” of me. I couldnot hold up a mirror and look at my image and say, “Oh look! I'm one of those!”I could, however, with great stillness and concentration, turn the focus of myattention inward and, like the holy men of India, observe my perfect reflectionat the very center of my being. I would then for the first time be conscious ofmyself. “I am this!” I would shout.Even instantly, as these words echoed in my absoluteness, I would fall from mypristine state of singularity, for I would now have to admit the concept of TWO:Myself (“I am…” )images [../images/00196.jpeg]and my reflection (“…this”).images [../images/00197.jpeg]Figure 13. The concept of two.Oh! Curse the moment I ever brought TWO into existence, because the moment mySelf became conscious of my reflection (my Not-Self), a third concept wascreated, that is…the knowledge of the difference between Self and Not-Self. “Iam ‘this' but ‘that' is not I.”images [../images/00198.jpeg]Figure 14. The concept of three.Conclusion:I assert that creation commenced when the Deity stirred from undistractedecstasy and became self-conscious, an act which transformed Its self-existence(as the inscrutable Divine Unity) into Its self-image (as the Deity ofcreation). Therefore, I suggest that we also consider the number THREE one ofour primary holy numbers.—Zabad, the son of Aziza--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Winning Essay No. 2Submitted by Jozabad, the son of ShimeiAdar, 28th, 520 B.C.My compliments to Zabad, the son of Aziza, for his wonderful essay on the Holynumber THREE. I'm sure he would have gone on to enlighten us further had he notbeen in such a hurry last night to slink off to West Bethany, so he could“accidentally” bump into someone else's girlfriend at a “certain” off-limits innand ply her with pomegranate fizzes, while his classmates stayed up late workingon this assignment.Be that as it may, my self-control and dedication to study has rewarded me withthe following:Since TWO and THREE are merely attributes of ONE, they should be consideredalong with the number ONE as a Trinity Unit.images [../images/00199.jpeg]Figure 15. The trinity.The Trinity Unit then behaves in precisely the same manner as the original ONEdid when it reflected itself to become TWO. It reflects itself to create asecond Trinity Unit:images [../images/00200.jpeg]Figure 16. The second trinity.A third Trinity Unit is instantly created in the same way that the originalTHREE was instantly created upon the birth of TWO:images [../images/00201.jpeg]Figure 17. The third trinity.Conclusion:As Zabad concluded, creation commences when the Deity defines itself and becomesself-conscious—a three-part act which defines ONE as an abstract andunmanifested Trinity (the Supernal Triad). But what Zabad was apparently toodistracted to realize was that the Deity cannot stop at self-knowledge. Momentumhas been established which will result in a further series of six phenomenalemanations by which the universe will categorize itself and organize itsinfinite potentialities. The following diagram will illustrate this idea.images [../images/00202.jpeg]Figure 18. Projection, Shattering, and Manifestation of the Divine Light.I believe that TEN hangs from the three Triads like a cosmic dingle-berry andprovides an environment—a Kingdom—that traps the diffused and crystallizeddivine light inside a prison of matter. We live in this Kingdom. It is thelowest of the emanations. It is where the Divine Light vibrates at its lowestfrequency. It is where the invisible becomes visible.—Jozabad, the son of Shimei--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Winning Essay No. 3Submitted by Zabad, the son of AzizaI abase myself before my esteemed colleague Jozabad, the son of Shimei, for hisstunning demonstration of spiritual insight. I hereby propose that his diagramarrangement of the 10 emanations or Sephiroth be known from this day forward as“THE TEN NUMBERED BUBBLES OF JOZABAD.”With all due respect to my friend's genius, however, I would like to point out afew important aspects of his ten bubbles that, in his flurry to ennoble himselfin the eyes of the faculty, have escaped his attention.When we look at all ten steps of creation, we see that the TENTH emanation isthe reflection of the NINTH, which is the reflection of the SIXTH, which is thereflection of the ONE.images [../images/00203.jpeg]images [../images/00204.jpeg]Figure 19. The steps of creation.To form the backbone of the Ten Numbered Bubbles of Jozabad, the numbers images[../images/00205.jpeg]and images [../images/00206.jpeg] are as critical to thestructure of the universe as the spine is to the human body. They are alsoindicative of the four letters of the name of Diety ,images[../images/00207.jpeg](Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh) and all that It represents in theuniverse and the human soul.11 [part0020.html#chap7_ft11] If the class has anydoubt about this, let me point out that the sum of images [../images/00205.jpeg]and images [../images/00206.jpeg] equals 26, the same as the supreme name of Godimages [../images/00207.jpeg].Furthermore (and most importantly I believe), when we insert the three pathsthat join images [../images/00205.jpeg] and images [../images/00206.jpeg] wecreate a total of 12 paths. (I call them Zabad's Twelve Paths of Glory.) These12 paths link the 10 emanations and bring the total steps of creation to thesacred number TWENTY-TWO!images [../images/00208.jpeg]Figure 20. The 12 Paths.Conclusion:I believe that I have succeeded in demonstrating how the Deity (1) through themedium of 4, 10, and 22, created the universe and the nature of reality as weperceive it. I think it should be obvious to Rabbi Roe and the entire class thatI have mastered the assignment and have wrenched all the wisdom that can beextracted from this line of thinking. I suggest we now move on to anothersubject, like when do we go co-ed?—Zabad, the son of Aziza--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Grand Prize Winning EssaySubmitted by Ramiah, the son of JeziahOnce again I am stunned at the intelligence and wisdom exhibited by myclassmates, especially the fruits of the recent exchanges between Zabad, the sonof Aziza, and Jozabad, the son of Shimei. I most humbly confess that my feeblemind could never have developed the Ten Numbered Bubbles of Jozabad, or Zabad'sTwelve Paths of Glory. Please know that anything I might add at this point mustonly be viewed as my dwarfish mental stature standing upon the shoulders ofthese two giants.Still, I must strenuously disagree with Zabad's assertion that we have concludedour meditation on the diagram that he and Jozabad have labored so diligently toerect. As I was the first in the class to draw our attention to the holiness ofthe number 22, I must respectfully point out certain flaws in Zabad's thinkingconcerning his “Twelve Paths of Glory.” I will begin by pointing out that Ibelieve there are two additional pillars that flank the middle pillar (Figure 21[part0015.html#fig21]).As it is postulated, each one of us is made in the image of the Deity. These twopillars correspond to the right and left side of the human body (the middlepillar being the spine). They also accommodate the entire spectrum of universalopposites that so profoundly divide our perception of reality; light-darkness,male-female, strength-weakness, the middle pillar serving to balance andharmonize these extremes.images [../images/00209.jpeg]Figure 21. Note the two additional “pillars.”Furthermore, I believe that the paths which join the 10 Sephiroth are not merelynails that attach the emanations, but are actually conduits of divineintelligence, which transmit the influence of each Sephirah back and forthbetween its neighbor. Consequently, all the Sephiroth should be joined by paths(shown in figure 22 [part0015.html#fig22] on page 124).You will notice in my diagram that I have drawn broken paths leading from 3 to 4and from 2 to 5. This is because I believe that these paths do not exist. Toexplain this, we must return for a moment to Zabad's earlier essay, whichexplained how ONE became THREE. If you recall, he wrote that ONE is the onlyreal number. TWO is just a projected reflection of ONE, and THREE merely acondition of recognition that TWO is not ONE.images [../images/00210.jpeg]Figur 22. All Sephiroth are joined.So, too, images [../images/00211.jpeg] is the only real Triad; the Triad ofimages [../images/00212.jpeg] is only its reflection, and the third Triad ismerely the replication of the second. The area between the first Triad and thesecond Triad is like the impenetrable surface of a mirror. It is an inscrutableAbyss.As I gaze into the mirror hanging on the wall in my dormitory room, I see myreflection, an unreal image of the real me in my real room. So it is with theDeity. The Supernal Triad (images [../images/00211.jpeg]) is the real thingexisting on the real side of the mirror/Abyss. On the unreal side of the Abyssare all the unreal things (including you and me and everything we perceive inthe universe). They assume a semblance of reality because they, like myreflection in the mirror, are bound by the image of the real supernal patternsand forms.Just as I give a kind of life to my reflection in the mirror, so all themanifold units of creation are vivified by the Living Light of the SupernalTriad. Indeed, that Light is our true identity. What we think is our body, ourworld, our self, is only the shadowy reflection of the Divine Being whoseradiance shattered at the Abyss. We aren't even truly alive, we are just thereflection of real life. “And created the Elohim Adam in the image of Elohimcreated they them, male and female created they them.”Just as we cannot walk into a room reflected in a mirror, a path cannot existbetween images [../images/00213.jpeg] of the Supernal Triad and images[../images/00214.jpeg] of the second Triad. Other paths appear to cross theAbyss, but they aren't really Paths, but either reflected paths or avenues ofreflection:images [../images/00215.jpeg]Figure 23. Reflecting paths.images [../images/00002.jpeg] The path joining images [../images/00216.jpeg] andimages [../images/00217.jpeg] is the avenue of reflection between images[../images/00216.jpeg] and images [../images/00217.jpeg].images [../images/00002.jpeg] The path joining images [../images/00218.jpeg] andimages [../images/00214.jpeg] is the avenue of reflection between images[../images/00218.jpeg] and images [../images/00214.jpeg].images [../images/00002.jpeg] The path joining images [../images/00213.jpeg] andimages [../images/00219.jpeg] is the avenue of reflection between images[../images/00213.jpeg] and images [../images/00219.jpeg].images [../images/00002.jpeg] The path joining images [../images/00216.jpeg] andimages [../images/00218.jpeg] is reflected as the path joining images[../images/00218.jpeg] and images [../images/00217.jpeg].images [../images/00002.jpeg] The path joining images [../images/00216.jpeg] andimages [../images/00213.jpeg] is reflected as the path joining images[../images/00213.jpeg] and images [../images/00217.jpeg].images [../images/00220.jpeg]Figure 24. Completed Tree of Life.Conclusion:This leaves us with 22 paths joining the 10 Sephiroth. I presume to call theentire thing “Ramiah's 32 Mysterious Paths of Wisdom.” It is my firm belief(although I am not prepared to elucidate further at the moment) that these 22paths have a direct correspondence with the 22 letters of our sacred Hebrewalphabet. I further contend that the mystery of their placement upon this Treeof Life (as I have also presumed to name it) is the key to eventual return toour original divine estate.—Ramiah, the son of Jeziah"},{"pageContent":"8QABALISTIC MAGICK AND THE TREE OF LIFEIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteIt's all in your head, you just have no idea how big your head is.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDTo the horror of many in the orthodox community, Rabbi Ben Clifford encouragedhis students to learn and practice the magical art of spirit evocation. Also, hemade no secret of the fact that he himself, on occasion, conjured demons andspirits to help him address specific personal problems. He taught that summoningspirits to do one's bidding was perfectly compatible with his field-theory,which states, “It's all in your head, you just have no idea how big your headis.” He insisted that the successful completion of any act of will was a form ofspirit evocation.Unfortunately, he left no record of his personal workings in this area and, ashe never made it a regular part of his course of instruction, very littlematerial could be found to give us a glimpse into this colorful aspect of hisspiritual career.The work that follows was originally written as a postscript to the Z.I.P.Y.papers regarding the genesis of the Tree of Life. It was obviously neverintended to serve as a comprehensive treatise on spirit evocation. It does,however, contain an extremely useful hierarchical flow-chart of the Archangels,Angels, Intelligences, and Spirits that clearly outlines who is in charge of whoin a Tree of Life universe. The accompanying essay also reveals Ben Clifford'sbasic attitudes regarding the underlying theory of Qabalistic ceremonial magickand, I believe, should be of immeasurable value to anyone who may wish to embarkon such practices.But before we turn to the essay, I would like us to examine the contents of ashort but provocative letter Ben Clifford wrote to an Indiana student in 1988.His letter is in response to several questions the student posed concerning theevocation of spirits of the Goetia.1 [part0020.html#chap8_ft1]The Rabbi himself confessed that his answers were gross simplifications.Nevertheless, I know of no better definition of the underlying theory ofQabalistic magick and spirit evocation than his last sentence: “Gods,archangels, angels, spirits, intelligences, and demons are personifications ofall our abilities and potential abilities—a wondrous hierarchy of consciousnessthat represents the subdivisions of our own soul.”Are the spirits good or evil?Yes, they are good. Yes, they are evil! Are the spirits real or just imaginary?Yes, they are real. Yes, they are imaginary. Are the spirits part of me, or do they live an existence independent of me?Yes, the spirits are part of you. Yes, to all appearances, and for all practicalpurposes, they live an existence independent of you. Are the spirits dangerous?Yes, most definitely, spirits are very dangerous. Can the spirits hurt me?Yes, most definitely, spirits can hurt you. They hurt you all the time. Can the spirits ruin my life?Yes, most definitely, spirits can ruin your life. Can the spirits kill me?Yes, most definitely, spirits can kill you. Can the spirits harm my loved ones, my neighbors, my nation, or the Earth'sfragile ecosystem?Yes! Most definitely! As a matter of fact, there is no atrocity you can imagine,no wickedness you can conceive of, no monstrous act you can picture in your mindthat the spirits cannot inflict upon you, your loved ones, your neighbors, theEarth, or the human race. Aren't you sorry you asked?The most important question is the question you did not ask—Why on Earth would anyone want to have anything to do with such awful andterrible entities?And the answer is probably the answer you do not want to hear—but here goes:Because, until you master these spiritual forces and consciously redirect theirunimaginable power to more constructive projects, their wild energies willcontinue to gush like burning Drano through your soul—along every avenue ofleast resistance large or small. When you are weak—when you are tired—when youare sick—or stressed, or drunk, or drugged, or jealous, or angry, or hurt, orinsulted, or resentful, or in pain, or succumbing to greed, or being flattered,or when you are afraid—especially when you are afraid—and they can ruin yourlife, harm or even kill you and your loved ones, and make your life a livinghell.Of course these are worst-case scenarios. Most of us have enough reign on ourspirits to keep us out of prison or the booby hatch. But all of us could do muchbetter—and the world most definitely would be a better place if we all didbetter.Let's take another look at your questions that I answered so glibly, and givethem just a bit more attention.Are the spirits good or evil?Yes, the spirits are good or evil, in the same way electricity is both good andevil depending upon how it is directed.Are the spirits real or just imaginary?The spirits are both real and imaginary, but most of us do not realize how realour imagination is.Are the spirits part of me, or do they live an existence independent of me?The spirits are inside you, but most of us do not realize (1) how big ourinsides really are, or (2) how much out of control and seemingly independent thethings inside us can be.For a moment, let's pretend that your brain (and remember, scientists tell us weuse only a tiny fraction of our brain's potential) is the source of all yourpower and ability to do anything. (Of course it isn't. Remember the four partsof the soul and the fact your Neshamah, the Soul Intuition, was incredibly huge,and that it was the part of the soul that enables your mother to freak outwhenever you're in trouble, even if you were on the Moon?) But, just forsimplicity's sake, let's say all your powers and abilities are functions of thebrain.Because the brain (under this pretend scenario) is the all-powerful director ofour being, we could call it the god of our lives. This god is a goodadministrator, and knows how to effectively delegate authority to get thingsdone. However, having no resources outside of itself to draw upon, the brain-godmust divide itself into several large departments, creating from itself a boardof directors.One board member controls our logical and deductive processes, another ourimagination and artistic sensibilities. Another board member dominates our sleepand dreams, and one quietly interfaces with our nervous systems. These largesections of the brain—these members of the board of directors, are archangelswho execute the will of the brain-god.If we were to dissect the archangel areas of the brain, we would discover thatwithin each of them are smaller areas that do more specific jobs within thearchangel's province. For instance, within the archangel of logic we would findthe area that adds and subtracts and observes and registers the process of causeand effect. We might find within the artistic archangel an area that allows usto appreciate a beautiful painting, or a sector that sounds an alarm when we seea man wearing brown shoes and white socks with a tuxedo. These middle-managementsubdivisions of the archangelic zones of the brain are angels.Further dividing the brain, we discover that within each of these angelicregions are even smaller areas that control even more specific applications oftheir angelic department. We could keep dividing and dividing, creating eversmaller ever more specific intelligences, spirits, and yes, even demons.Magical evocation is merely identifying the specific spirit who accomplishes thetask we want accomplished, then activating in descending order the areas of thebrain that control it.Gods, archangels, angels, spirits, intelligences, and demons arepersonifications of all our abilities and potential abilities—a wondroushierarchy of consciousness that represents the subdivisions of our own soul.spirit evocationimages [../images/00175.jpeg]EDITED FROM THE TRANSCRIPTION AND NOTES OF TAPE-RECORDED PRESENTATIONS OF RABBILAMED BEN CLIFFORDI'M SURE YOU ALL AGREE with me that the essays by your ancient classmates aretruly remarkable and provide great insight into the logical progression ofconcepts that went into the creation of the Tree of Life. I'm confident that youare all saying to yourselves, “Why, I would have thought of that if I hadnothing to do all day but to think about stuff!” However, there are manyimportant and practical aspects of the Tree that were not covered in thesedocuments by the first ZIPYites, and so it falls to me to fill in some of thegaps.Before I go on, however, I want you never to lose sight of the fact that when wetalk about the Sephiroth we are talking about levels of consciousness. When Iuse the term “pure light of Kether” I'm not talking about some big flashlight inthe cosmos, I'm talking about the pure omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient,omni-the-whole-damned-ball-of-wax consciousness of Deity.Keeping that in mind, we must remember that even before we toyed with the ideaof the Tree of Life we pondered three kinds of wonderful Nothing (Ain, Ain Soph,and Ain Soph Aur) that, like some huge and tiny cosmic egg, somehow managed tobring ONE (Kether, the Crown, the Self of Deity) into existence. The rest of theSephiroth on the Tree of Life are merely aspects of this ONE. They appear todegenerate in purity as they descend the Tree, but in actuality, this is just anillusion.images [../images/00221.jpeg]Figure 25. The cosmic egg.The light of Kether is One. It is pure consciousness. Its radiance neverdiminishes. The nine Sephiroth beneath it simply separate and filter the light.This trickle-down consciousness, not some mythological fruit-eating incident, isthe real “Fall of Man.”In figure 26 [part0016.html#fig26], we see this process of degenerationprojected upon the Tree of Life, and colorfully personified somewhat like acosmic dysfunctional family.images [../images/00222.jpeg] ONE: Kether (Crown), the Self of Deity.images [../images/00222.jpeg] TWO: Chokmah (Wisdom), the Cosmic Father.images [../images/00222.jpeg] THREE: Binah (Understanding), the Cosmic Mother.images [../images/00222.jpeg] FOUR: Chesed (Mercy), the expressed Father,paternal, organized, authoritative.images [../images/00222.jpeg] FIVE: Geburah (Strength), the expressed Mother,active, ferocious, yet nurturing.images [../images/00223.jpeg]Figure 26.

Each Tree corresponds to one of theFour Letters in the Great Divine Name Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh, the four QabalisticWorlds, and the four parts of the human soul (see figure 27[part0016.html#fig27], page 139).Remember, these are levels of consciousness, and not places or heavens locatedsomewhere out in space. If you are waiting to die so you can go to one of these“higher” planes, you might be very disappointed. Death might not be what youthink it is, and there is no reason to believe you will be any smarter than youwere when you were alive. Make the effort to attain illumination while you stillhave a four-part soul.This Divine pecking order is the corporate flow chart of the universe, and ofyou and me. The ten segments of Deity in Atziluth rule the ten archangels inBriah, who rule the ten groups of angels in Yetzirah, who rule the variousspirits down here in the material plane of Assiah. It's easy to see who ruleswhom if we imagine the four trees placed one over another, as shown in figure 28[part0016.html#fig28] on page 140.Spirits are the agents who actually do all the heavy lifting on the materialplane. You may think you disagree with me on this. You could point out thatnatural forces, people, and machines seem to be the instruments that push thingsaround down here. But in truth, it is a spiritual hierarchy that is executor ofeverything that gets done in the phenomenal universe.images [../images/00224.jpeg]Figure 27. The Qabalistic Worlds and the human soulimages [../images/00225.jpeg]Figure 28. The Divine Pecking Order.For example, I am standing here at the podium at the head of the classroom. I amthirsty and would like a drink of water. I ask a student if he would be kindenough to bring me a glass of water. The kindly student gets up, goes to thewater cooler at the back of the classroom, draws me a glass of water anddelivers it to me.This simple scenario doesn't seem very magical does it? However, from my pointof view it was a miraculously successful conjuration. By strength of my will(and with only a few well-chosen magical words of enchantment) I set intoobedient motion an entire hierarchy of spiritual beings;images [../images/00222.jpeg] I, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford (the Deity),images [../images/00222.jpeg] had a need which I defined and named as “thirst”(Divine Name of a desire formulated by the Deity—Atziluth).images [../images/00222.jpeg] Activating my unambiguous spiritual authority asyour teacher, I declare the Divine Name (vibrations of sound declaring mythirst) and inspire an archangel (student— Briah) to fulfill my desire.images [../images/00222.jpeg] The archangel then activates an army of angelswithin himself (in Yetzirah); angels of the eye to seek out and locate the watercooler, angels of nerves and muscles and equilibrium to propel him through spaceand around obstacles until he reaches his goal.images [../images/00222.jpeg] At the water cooler, the angel then employs theIntelligences and Spirits of gravity and hydrodynamics to fill the glass withwater (Assiah).images [../images/00222.jpeg] The process is then reversed until the archangeldelivers the water to me thereby fulfilling the will of the Deity.This may not be what you think of when you think of magick, but I assure you itis magick. In fact, most of the spiritual activity that took place in the abovescenario actually occurred on the invisible plane. No one could see my words ofenchantment. No one could see the internal processes that inspired and propelledthe student to the water cooler, or the invisible force of gravity. For allintents and purposes, I wanted a drink of water and only seconds after focusingmy will upon that desire, a glass of water traveled through space and appearedin my hands.Since spirits do the dirty work of creation, Qabalistic magicians theorize thatit is only logical that they should be compelled to work for us. After all,these guys are easily bamboozled. They go where they're pointed and do whatthey're told. They're accustomed to following orders from higher intelligences.However, in magick, it's not what you know but who you are that counts, andbefore you can proceed to bamboozle a spirit into believing you are a higherintelligence, you must first bamboozle yourself into believing you are a higherintelligence!If I want to enchant Tina, the girl next door, to fall in love with me, itdoesn't matter that I know that Jehovah Tzabaoth is that aspect of Deity servedby Haniel, who governs Anael of the Elohim, who commands Hagiel by whom isKedemel2 [part0020.html#chap8_ft2] compelled. I must first perfectly realizethat somewhere in my own complex spiritual composition is a perfect workingmodel of Jehovah Tzabaoth, Haniel, Elohim, Anael of the Elohim, Hagiel, andKedemel. I must be able to actually identify with the top guy in my ownorganization, and from that position of authority beseech the archangel to helpme conjure the angel that I may order the intelligence in his name so that thespirit will listen to me when I command it to do my bidding.Now, does this mean that you will have to study and master all thosetongue-twisting god-names and archangels, and angels that (let's face it) meannothing to you? Does this mean that you will then have to labor to somehowintegrate this mountain of memorized data into your subjective consciousness?Hell no! You're a Chicken Qabalist! Don't worry about it! The essence of thiswonderful organization is already integrated into your spiritual matrix. It (andthe infinite number of other ways of looking at creation) came as standardequipment when you were born as a human being.You can, of course, memorize all the goodies if you want to, and I'm sure therewill be some of you who will want to.3 [part0020.html#chap8_ft3] But I want youto know that it is not essential to do so. It is only necessary that you programyour spiritual worldview with this image of an ordered hierarchy ofconsciousness. Eventually, your recognition of these Qabalistic facts of lifewill enable you to effortlessly and naturally align and harmonize the variousaspects of your consciousness with the Qabalistic facts of life. Once this isachieved (and it will most likely happen without you realizing that it hashappened) you will discover your place in the divine hierarchy and why only youcan fill that position.I have prepared a flow chart (Table 3 [part0016.html#tab3], pages 144-145) thatshows the classic Qabalistic hierarchy of divine name, archangel, angel (and theangelic choir to which it belongs) and the intelligence and spirit attributed toeach Sephirah on the Tree of Life. You can use this information to constructcomplex rituals of formal evocation, such as those found in any number ofmagical texts.You can also design simple house-and-garden variety spells such as this ditty Iwrote and recited at the appearance of Venus in the evening or early morningsky: O Lord of Hosts, Jehovah Tzabaoth,You know the dreams of fools.Thee I invoke to hear my oath,In Nogah where Venus rules.O Haniel, Great Archangel.Glory of God thou art,Send Anael, love's bold AngelTo touch sweet Tina's heart.Come Hagiel! Come Hagiel!In Anael's name, obey!Compel Kedemel to do my willTina love me night and day!Table 3.

You are the King of the universe, whohas fallen asleep and is dreaming he is the Queen, who has fallen asleepand is dreaming she is the Prince, who has fallen asleepand is dreaming he is a sleeping Princess.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDRabbi Ben Clifford's passionate embrace of the Tarot represents perhaps his mostdramatic departure from the traditions of Orthodox Qabalah. His 1992 interviewin the American Tarot journal, Augury Today, gave his enemies all the ammunitionthey would need to permanently discredit him. Still, he seemed to enjoy theridicule heaped upon him from conservative quarters, and took fiendish delightin promoting the study and use of the tarot cards.While it is true that little or no evidence exists that would suggest that theTarot was the invention of ancient Hebrew Qabalists, it is obvious to anyone notblinded by sectarian prejudice that the 78 cards of a standard tarot deck areconstructed, organized, and characterized in perfect harmony with fundamentalQabalistic principles.It is a sad fact that Ben Clifford did not write extensively on the tarot. Whatfollows is the entire Augury Today interview and illustrations reprinted withthe kind permission of Credulity Publications, Inc. We must keep in mind thefact that in this interview Ben Clifford was addressing a readership ofprofessional Tarot readers and enthusiasts, and not his own students (orimaginary students). Consequently, we see that he was obliged to introducefundamental Qabalistic principals that have already been touched upon elsewherein this book. I hope the reader will forgive these redundancies because theinterview is a wonderful example of how the Rabbi went about introducing theQabalah to non-Qabalists.I should like especially to call the reader's attention to the final section ofthe interview in which Ben Clifford discusses the exceptional status of the fourPrincess cards of the tarot. Besides exhibiting the Rabbi at his irascible best,it is a marvelous essay that neatly dovetails many Qabalistic principles we'velearned so far concerning the nature of the soul. It also introduces us to theconcept of the Holy Guardian Angel, a key element of modern Qabalisticpractices.Long Island Queballa1 [part0020.html#chap9_ft1] Guru Sez Tarot Cards Are“Aleph-OK!”images [../images/00008.jpeg]BY IDA PENGALA[AUGURY TODAY, VOL. II. NO. 2. JULY-AUGUST 1992. REPRINTED WITHPERMISSION OF CREDULITY PUBLICATIONS. INC., CHICAGO]AT: I'm talking today with Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. The Rabbi operates whatI guess we could call an ashram at his home in Montauk, New York, where heteaches the marvelous-mystical-magical art of the Qabalah. Is that how youpronounce it Rabbi? Qabalah?LBC: Pronounce it any damned way you want.AT:: Well…so…I will then. Thank you. That lifts a burden from my shoulders.I'm always afraid I'm going to mispronounce all these exotic and esoteric words.LBC: Lifting spiritual burdens is my job. I've worked hard to gainenlightenment just so you won't have to.AT: Oh…well…Thank you. Now, Rabbi…may I call you Ben?LBC: No.AT: Right then. Let's start by asking why an authority on the Hebrew Qabalahsuch as yourself would be interested in Tarot cards?LBC: Because working with the Tarot is the fastest way I know of learningQabalistic fundamentals and one of the most practical things one can do with theQabalah.AT: I don't understand.LBC: The Hebrew Qabalah forms the foundation of the Western Mystery Traditionand the Western Hermetic arts. This tradition includes Astrology, Alchemy,Jewish and Christian Mysticism, Ceremonial Magick, and Tarot. Of all of thesedisciplines, the Tarot is the most perfect representation of Qabalisticfundamentals and is the common denominator between the various systems.Whether we realize it or not, when we work with the Tarot, we are working withthe Qabalah. Tarot's like the DNA of the Qabalah— better than that—it's actuallythe picture-book of the Qabalah. I know there are many tarotists who are awareof the Qabalistic roots of the Tarot but, for one reason or another, they choosenot to incorporate any Qabalistic wisdom in their arsenal of Tarot tools.AT: Perhaps that's because the Qabalah is based on the Bible, is it not? Howcould it possibly be relevant to those of us who are not Jewish or Christian?LBC: Some people think that because the Qabalah seems to be based on the Biblethat it must be reserved for Jews or Christians, and therefore it has no placein neo-pagan or New Age thought. Such is not the case. The Qabalah is not abelief system. It's a way of looking at things. It's a way of organizing youruniverse so neatly that you eventually discover your own place in it. It's a wayof connecting absolutely everything in the universe with absolutely everythingelse until, eventually, you achieve a transcendent level of consciousness inwhich you realize there is nothing left to connect.AT: Is the Qabalah a book?LBC: No, the Qabalah is not a book, but there are many Qabalistic texts, someof them are pretty bizarre. If you're not careful, you'll wind up squanderingthirty or forty years of your life counting the nostril hairs of God. I knowfolks who have done just that. It's sad. It's worse than falling asleep withleprechauns when you're young, and waking up old and gray—with dead leaves inyour pockets and snowflakes in your hair.AT: Al…mighty then. Could you please explain your Qabalah universe and how itrelates to the Tarot cards?LBC: First of all, there is only one universe, only one absolute. Call it God.Call it what you want, but It's the One thing that contains all the other thingsin the world—It's the great One beyond which there is nothing. Now, that“nothing” is a pretty important concept in the Qabalah, because that's where theOne and subsequently all the other stuff comes from. In the Tarot, thissuper-nothing is represented by the Fool card.A pure buffoon skips toward his doom.An abyss of profound uncertainties.It takes a Fool to seed that wombWith all possible, possibilities.Ultimately, the Fool is the only real Tarot card. In essence, all the othercards live inside the Fool—just like you and me and all the other components ofcreation live inside the inscrutable consciousness of Deity.AT: Do all 78 cards live inside the Fool card?LBC: Technically, yes. Of course they do. But for our purposes it will bebetter to think of the Tarot as two distinct groups of cards. The Greater Arcana(or the 22 Trumps); and the Lesser Arcana (56 cards broken up into four suits,each suit containing one Ace, four Court Cards, and nine Small Cards).Let's look first at the trumps. We put the Fool under our microscope and we seethat there are 22 trumps (including the Fool). These are the cards most peoplethink of when they hear the word Tarot: Fool, Magician, High Priestess, Empress,Emperor, Hierophant, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Hermit, Wheel of Fortune,Justice, Hanged Man, Death, Temperance, Devil, Tower, Star, Moon, Sun,Judgement, and World.Now, there just so happens to be 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet. What acoincidence! The Hebrew alphabet is really the foundation of the Qabalah and(though it might not be immediately obvious) the 22 trumps are the visualexpressions of the 22 letters and their esoteric meanings.Now, some of your readers, might use the 22 trumps exclusively when they readthe cards for themselves or others. If that's the case, each spread couldactually be spelling out words.AT: You mean the cards could be literally spelling out the answer to aquestion?LBC: That's exactly what I'm saying. Tell me, what is one of the most commonquestions a Tarot reader is asked to answer?AT: Questions of romance, I suppose. “Should I marry my sweetheart?”LBC: “Should I marry my sweetheart?” Fine! Using a standard ten-cardCeltic-Cross spread with the Empress as the significator, you lay out theEmpress. Hierophant, Hanged Man, Tower, World, Emperor, High Priestess. Hermit,Sun and Justice. I'm sure there are infinite ways to interpret these cards inthis order, but one unmistakable characteristic of the spread is the fact thatthe cards spell the words “DUMP THE GIRL.”Vaporous mysticism is fine, but for Heaven's sake don't ignore the obvious! Whatif the Hermit, the Magician and the Hanged Man are really trying to tell yourclient to buy IBM?2 [part0020.html#chap9_ft2]AT: My goodness! I had no idea…LBC: I didn't think you did. Each of the 22 letters also has a basic meaning.For example, the Hebrew letter that is attributed to the Fool card is Aleph, andAleph means “ox.” Now, it's probably unlikely that any of your clients are evergoing to scream, “My god, I'm going to marry an ox!” but there are many otherrelevant things to the modern world of which the word “ox” issuggestive—strength, stability, fertility, harnessed energy—see what I mean? Youcan never predict how your awareness of this attribute might someday trigger apsychic reaction and provide you and your client the answer.The meanings of the Hebrew letters for the rest of the trumps are:Magician—House Hanged Man—Water High Priestess—Camel or Rope Death—FishEmpress—Door Temperance—Tent pole Emperor—Window Devil—Eye Hierophant—NailTower—Mouth Lovers—Sword Star—Fish hook Chariot—Fence Moon—Back of the headStrength—Serpent Sun—Head or face Hermit—Hand Judgement—ToothWheel of Fortune—Paim ofthe handWorld—Mark or Signature or CrossJustice—Ox goad If you did nothing more than learn the meanings of the Hebrew letters for eachtrump you would have 22 additional sources of information to draw upon whenreading the cards.AT: Again, Rabbi, I have to say…LBC: Look, do you want to hear what I have to say or not?AT: Most certainly, I beg your…LBC: Qabalists attribute twelve letters of the Hebrew alphabet to the signs ofthe zodiac, seven letters to the seven planets of the ancients, and threeletters to the three primitive elements.Now, it just so happens that the 22 trumps of the Tarot are divided andattributed in precisely the same way. What a coincidence! The Emperor is Aries,Heirophant Taurus, Lovers Gemini, Chariot Cancer, Strength Leo, Hermit Virgo,Justice Libra, Death Scorpio, Temperance Sagittarius, Devil Capricorn, StarAquarius, and Moon Pisces.images [../images/00228.jpeg]Figure 29. The 22 tarot trumps are created by the 22 letters of the sacredHebrew alphabet.In a reading, a zodiacal trump might obviously be pointing to a specific time ofyear, perhaps the questioner's birth-sign, or that of someone else important tothe reading. Maybe the card is pinpointing an appropriate time to schedule anevent such as a wedding, or a vacation.AT: But aren't these attributes astrological rather than Qabalistic?LBC: Hello? Don't you get it? Astrology and Qabalah come from the same place.Duh! Now please, let me go on.Signs of the zodiac represent more than just time coordinates. Each sign (andconsequently each zodiac trump) has attached to it a litany of traditionalplants, animals, precious stones, foods, drugs, and deities sacred to culturesand mythologies from around the world. All these attributes are hiding justbelow the surface of each card. I've got them all organized in a giant Rolodexin my garage.Whether we consciously recognize them or not, these are archetypal images thatwe share with every other human being on the planet—and Qabalah is the glue thatholds them all together. Depending upon the circumstances, the Justice cardcould stand for an emerald, or an aloe plant, or an elephant. The Emperor mightsuggest ruby, or geranium, or a ram.AT: But how can a tarot reader apply this information practically in areading?LBC: It all depends upon the question. If it concerns matters of health, azodiac sign is attributed to each part of the body. The Moon card (Pisces) couldindicate the feet, or the Lovers (Gemini), the lungs, or Strength card (Leo),the heart. There's no end to the applications.Now please, I would like to move on to the planetary trumps. I'm getting hungry.You did say the magazine was treating me to dinner, didn't you?AT: Yes, of course, the Carnegie Deli if you like.LBC: Dear God no! Maybe Ethiopian food.AT: Whatever you would like. You were going to tell us about planetarytrumps.LBC: I love Ethiopian food.AT: Ethiopian food then.LBC: Great! Okay let's look at planetary trumps: The Magician is Mercury, theHigh Priestess is Luna, the Empress is Venus, the Wheel of Fortune is Jupiter,the Tower is Mars, the Sun card is the Sun, and the World is Saturn.Those of your readers who are familiar with astrology know how importantplanetary influences are to a person's life. Obviously, we're not allastrologers, but the planetary trumps (like the zodiac trumps) have lots oftraditional correspondences based on the Qabalah. For instance, each of theseven planets represents a day of the week. The Sun card obviously representsSunday, the High Priestess is the Moon and Monday, the Tower is Mars andTuesday, the Magician is Mercury and Wednesday, the Wheel of Fortune is Jupiterand Thursday, the Empress is Venus and Friday, the World is Saturn and Saturday.Each of the planetary trumps also can point to one of the planetary metals. Youmay not think you will ever need to use this information in a reading, but justin case, it might be helpful to know that mercury is the metal for the Magician,silver rules the High Priestess, copper rules the Empress, tin rules the Wheelof Fortune, iron rules the Tower, gold rules the Sun, and lead rules the World.The planetary trumps also represent parts of the human body. This informationcould be helpful in a reading concerning health matters. The Magician rules thenervous system, the High Priestess the lymphatic system, the Empress rules thereproductive system, the Wheel of Fortune rules the digestive system, the Towerrules the muscles, the Sun rules the circulatory system, and the World cardrules the bones.AT: That leaves three final trump cards which stand for the elements—Air,Water, and Fire—Am I correct?LBC: Correct.AT: What happened to the Earth element? Is there no room for Earth in yourQabalah universe?LBC: Don't be absurd. Of course there is room for Earth. But Earth is somewhatthe stepchild of the universe—in precisely the same way that human beings aresomewhat the stepchildren in the family of spiritual beings. We're vitallyimportant stepchildren, however, and I want to talk about that later. But nowlet's get back to the elemental trumps.There are three (actually four) trumps that represent elements: The Foolrepresents Air, the Hanged Man Water, and Judgement, Fire. These three trumpsare attributed to the three Mother Letters of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, Mem,and Shin. The fourth element— Earth—is represented by the World card thatassumes double duty with the very compatible planet Saturn.From a Qabalist's point of view, the elements (as represented by the fourelemental trumps) convey a much higher octave of significance than the elementalbuilding-blocks of nature which we will soon see are represented by the Aces,Court Cards and Small Cards. The elemental trumps might be more accuratelyviewed as profound and primitive spiritual elements.For instance, the Air of the Fool, instead of representing the mundane conceptsof Air, symbolizes the vital essence that animates all life (the Breath ofLife). The Water of the Hanged Man is the Great Sea—the universal menstrum thatcarries the vital essence oflife (the Blood of Life); the Fire of Judgement isthe central fire of life—the Holy Spirit—the spark that sustains, and finallyconsumes and transforms all existence.The World, being last and lowest of the trumps, represents both the planetSaturn and the element Earth. Saturn, according to mythology, swallowed his ownchildren. This dual attribution is a not so subtle hint that Earth is both theend and the beginning—the foundation of the universe and its dissolution.However, some very basic and practical attributes of the four elemental trumpsare particularly helpful to me when I read the cards. For instance, they can beused to determine direction. The Fool is Air, which by tradition indicates theEast; the Hanged Man is Water and the West; Judgement is Fire, traditionallysacred to the South; and the World is Earth, symbolic of the cold North. I'msure your readers can imagine a circumstance where this directional informationcould be helpful in a reading?Finally (and then we're going to move on to the Lesser Arcana— I'm starving todeath), the four elemental trumps can represent our senses: The Fool smells…AT: (Laughter)LBC: Oh grow up! The Hanged Man tastes, Judgement sees, and the World touchesand feels.AT: Rabbi, I must tell you that I have learned more practical information injust these few minutes than I have in nearly ten years of working with the tarotcards. Are all Qabalists tarot experts also?LBC: I'm sad to say that most traditional Kabbalists (they spell it with a Kand two Bs) accuse me of apostasy. They hold me and my teachings in greatcontempt. They view my practical applications of the tarot as unspiritual and myembrace of universal religious concepts as very heretical. But I don't care. Itell my students if they don't intend to actually use this information for theirown spiritual enlightenment then get out. I call my brand of Qabalah ChickenQabalah to show that I'm proud to be a practical holy man.AT: You seem to be just that, Rabbi. Now, please tell us about the LesserArcana—the Aces, the Court Cards, and the Small Cards.LBC: Okay—the trumps are what we saw when we sliced the FOOL into 22 pieces.But if we slice the Fool into only four pieces we see the four Aces—and insideeach Ace we find four Court Cards, and nine Small Cards. Can you visualize that?images [../images/00229.jpeg]Figure 30. The Aces hold the Court Cards and the Small Cards.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT: But why four? Why are there four Aces? Why are there four suits in thetarot?LBC: That is the best question you've asked today. Most of us are aware thatthe four suits are by tradition attributed to the elements of Fire, Water, Air,and Earth. But where did the concept of these four elements come from? Theanswer comes straight out of the most fundamental doctrine of Hebrewmysticism—the Great Four-Letter Name of God—YOD HEH VAU HEH. Most nonJewspronounce this Jehovah. Most Jews hold the word in such reverence they neverpronounce it at all. Hermetic Qabalists refer to it by its technical name,Tetragrammaton.In Hebrew mysticism and Qabalah, the great absolute Deity is too abstract tothink about. I guess they figured they had a better chance at conceptualizingDeity if they chopped It up into pieces and then methodically meditated aboutthe pieces. The Number Two was still too abstract, and the Number Three was heldin such veneration that I guess they finally decided that it would be okay tochop Deity up into four pieces that they called Yod Heh Vau Heh.To these four pieces they attributed four worlds, which are really layers orfrequencies of divine consciousness by which Deity creates everything with Itsown thought.AT: How does that work exactly?LBC: How does that work exactly? Give me a break here! If I knew how itworked—exactly—I would be as smart as the Deity, wouldn't I? Theoretically,here's the drill: the Deity gets a good idea up in world number 1 (Atziluth, theArchetypal World); and then that idea gets organized in world number 2 (Briah,the Creative World); then that organized idea gets visualized and formulatedinto a blueprint of the idea in world number 3 (Yetzirah, the Formative World);and finally, the idea actually manifests as an object, or a force, or an energy,down here in world number 4 (Assiah, the Material World). The concept is sort oflike the Will, the Heart, the Mind, and the Flesh of Deity.Because, according to Qabalistic tradition, each of us was created in the imageof this four-part Deity, each of our souls is also divided up into four parts.The highest part of the soul is called the Chiah, the Life-Force itself. Thencomes the Neshamah (the Soul Intuition), then the Ruach (our Intellect), andfinally, the Nephesh (our Animal Soul). The four suits of the tarot are aperfect reflection of this concept. Can you see this?AT: I think so. I can picture the Deity divided into four parts, and I canimagine the same with the soul, but I don't quite understand exactly how thefour parts of Deity and the four parts of our souls are connected.LBC: : Just pretend the Deity is comprised of four incredibly gigantic tuningforks that are vibrating four musical notes in a descending scale. (Rememberthese are vibrations of consciousness, not sound.) Now pretend your soul iscomprised of four tiny tuning forks tuned to the same four notes. Even thoughour tuning forks are infinitely smaller, they are still set into motion by thevibrations of the Deity's tuning forks, and vibrate in perfect tandem with them.Do you follow me?AT: Yes, I believe so.LBC: If you divide the 56 cards of the Lesser Arcana into four stacks, onefor Wands, Cups, Swords, and Disks, you have this fourfold universe laid out infront of you. To really organize your world, lay each of the four stacks faceup, with the Ace on top. Beneath the Ace put the four Court Cards (King, Queen,Prince, Princess), then the Small Cards (2 through 10).The four stacks with the Aces on top are the four letters in the Great Name, YODHEH VAU HEH, and the cards underneath are the pieces of Deity, Its universe andour own souls. The Wands are the Yod stack, and by tradition are attributed toFire; the Cups live in the first Heh stack and represent the Water element; theSwords are the Vau stack and Air; and the Disks are the Final Heh stack and areattributed to the Earth element.Now these elements are more than just the fire in your fireplace, or the waterin your swimming pool, or the air in your lungs, or the earth in your garden.They are all things—all forces—all energies in the universe divided intocategories that are either fiery in nature (like nuclear radiation, or Tabascosauce, or enthusiasm); or watery in nature (like electromagnetism, or beer, ormirrors); or airy in nature (like daydreams, or radio signals, or winds) orearthy in nature (like a coal mine, or stubbornness, or gravity).It's the job of these four elements to join with other elements in differentcombinations and proportions to create the universe. They do this with the helpof a fifth element called Spirit. Spirit enables the elements to stick togetherthe same way atoms bond together to form molecules. At the same time, thismagical element, Spirit, serves to separate the individual elements just enoughso that each tiny unit of Fire, or Water, or Air, or Earth maintains itselemental identity. If Spirit didn't exist, the four elements would just smashtogether, turning the universe into mush.Spirit is represented in both the Greater and Lesser Arcana of the Tarot. TheJudgement card, as we recall, does double-duty as the Trump that represents bothSpirit and Fire. But it is in the Lesser Arcana that Spirit reveals itself inremarkable detail by the four Aces, the Court Cards, and the Small Cards thatlive inside them (see figure 30 [part0017.html#fig30], page 159).The four Aces are really the big YOD, HEH, VAU, HEH and everything that goeswith it. The Ace of Wands is Spirit of Fire; Ace of Cups is Spirit of Water; Aceof Swords is Spirit of Air; Ace of Disks is Spirit of Earth.Together, the four Court Cards of each suit are a miniature YOD HEH VAU HEH thatsubdivides their Aces into four parts. Kings are the fiery nature of their suit,Queens are the watery nature of their suit, Princes are the airy nature of theirsuit, and the Princesses are the earthy nature of their suit. Are you followingthis?The King of Wands is Fire of Fire. Do you see? Fire because he is a King, andFire because he's a Wand. The King of Cups would be Fire of Water. Fire becausehe is King, and Water because his suit is Cups. See how it goes? The Queen ofCups would be…?AT: Water of Water!LBC: and the Princess of Swords would be…?AT: Earth of Air—the Princess is the earthy nature of her suit and Swordsare Air. I get it!LBC: The Qabalist sees the wonders of creation as the result of the Deityshuffling the cards and dealing them out in different numbers and combinations.It shuffles and draws three or four here—perhaps to create the elemental recipefor a duck; or it deals out three or four cards over there to create pond scumor an aardvark. Do you see what I'm saying?AT: Yes! Absolutely fascinating! But how can we use this information tohelp us out in a tarot reading? Court Cards are for me the most difficult cardsto interpret.LBC: With the Court Cards, we are in luck, because the Kings, Queens, andPrinces each represent 30 degrees of the year (from 20° of one zodiac sign to20° of the next sign).AT: What about the Princesses?LBC: Good question. I'll talk about the Princesses later. For the timebeing, let's just look at the Kings, Queens, and Princes. The reason why thesetwelve Court Cards rule from 20° of one sign to 20° of the next is to underscorethe necessity for the elements to mix with other elements. If they ruled theentire 30° of a zodiac sign there would be no elemental mix. Besides, we alreadyhave twelve perfectly good zodiacal cards represented by the twelve zodiactrumps.It's pretty easy to determine which days in any given year a King, Queen, orPrince represents. This is extremely helpful in a reading, especially wheninspiration fails us. At such times we can always remember that the Queen ofCups represents June 11th to July 11th, or the Knight of Disks is August 12th toSeptember 11th.2 [part0020.html#chap9_ft3] This is also helpful knowledge if youwanted to use a person's birthdate as a significator, or it might even be thebirth card of someone who is important to the reading.It can be even more meaningful to think about the elemental mix of a Court Card,and how that would translate in the character of an individual or a situation.Kings are the fiery aspect of their suit and so display the most violent anddynamic aspects of their element, also the most fleeting. Queens, being watery,are receptive and hold on to, as well as reflect, the nature of their suit(although, like a good mother, she will eventually relinquish her hold to passit on to her children). The Prince and Princess are literally the offspring ofthe King and Queen; the Prince the more active of the two.Certain elements combine harmoniously and others don't, but don't think you cannail down hard and fast definitions to the character of any tarot card by simplycombining buzzwords. No card lives in a vacuum. Its ultimate meaning depends onits relation to its neighbors and the nature of the question. For this reason,the tarot reader should ideally be a Qabalist—armed with the knowledge of thefundamental classifications of everything in his or her universe. Eventuallyillumination will come, not through analysis or contemplation, but as the resultof profound and simple observation.AT: Why Rabbi, that's sublime. I hardly know what to say.LBC: Good. Now let's talk about the 36 Small Cards. (I won't forget thePrincesses). Each of the 36 Small Cards represents one decan (10°) of the year.Their positions are determined with perfect Qabalistic logic, and they nestleneatly under the rulership of a King, or a Queen, or a Prince of their suit. Ibrought a couple of charts that I hope you can print with this interview to showthis far better than I can explain it.Each of the 36 Small Cards (in figure 31 [part0017.html#fig31], page 165)represents one decan (10°) of the zodiac:images [../images/00230.jpeg]Figure 31. Each of the 36 Small Cards rules one decan (10°) of the Zodiac.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------♦ The 2s, 3s, 4s represent the cardinal signs of the zodiac: Aries, Cancer,Libra, and Capricorn;♦ The 5s, 6s, 7s represent the fixed signs of the zodiac: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio,and Aquarius;♦ The 8s, 9s, 1 Os represent the mutable signs of the zodiac: Gemini, Virgo,Sagittarius, and Pisces.images [../images/00231.jpeg]Figure 32. Rulership of the Kings. Queens, and Princes. It is the cosmic duty ofthe elements to mix with each other and knit creation together. Therefore,instead of ruling from 0° to 0° of each zodiac sign, the Kings. Queens, andPrinces rule from 20° of one sign to 20° of the next.images [../images/00232.jpeg]Figure 33. The planets allotted to the Small Cards on the Tree of Life. Startingwith 0° Leo, the planets are in descending order: Saturn images[../images/00233.jpeg], Jupiter images [../images/00234.jpeg], Mars images[../images/00235.jpeg], Sun images [../images/00236.jpeg], Venus images[../images/00237.jpeg], Mercury images [../images/00238.jpeg], Moon images[../images/00239.jpeg]. Mars is repeated at the end and beginning of the solaryear.In other words, the 2, 3, and 4 of Wands represent the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decan ofAries—because 2s, 3s and 4s represent Cardinal Signs. Wands are Fire and Ariesis the cardinal fire sign of the zodiac.AT: As simple as that?LBC: As simple as that. And not only that, a planet is also assigned to eachof the 36 Small Cards. Starting with 0° Leo (the 5 of Wands), planets areallotted to the Small Cards in descending Tree of Life order. For your readerswho are unfamiliar with the Tree of Life, I'll just tell you what that order is:Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon.You'll notice that Mars repeats itself at the last decan of Pisces and the firstdecan of Aries. Qabalists explain this by saying that at the end of winter andthe beginning of spring the year needs an extra boost of Mars' strength to helpusher in spring. (Hey! Don't blame me. I didn't invent the system.)Now can you see where the Small Cards get their traditional meanings? It's acombination of their Qabalistic and astrological attributes. The 2 of Wands iscalled Dominion because it is first and foremost a strong and fiery Wand, thesuit of the Will; then it is a Two, the purest and strongest position in theSmall Card sequence; then it is the first decan of Aries, the strong, aggressiveand energy-filled sign of the zodiac; finally, the planet attributed to the 2 ofWands is Mars, and Mars is very, very happy to be in Aries. In other words—Wandplus Two plus Aries plus Mars equals “Dominion”All the Small Cards aren't as obvious as the 2 of Wands, but I guarantee that ifyou carefully examine the suit, the number, the zodiac sign, and the planetattributed to each Small Card, you will eventually see why it bears itstraditional meaning—why the 3 of Cups is Love, why the 6 of Wands is Victory,and the 9 of Swords is Despair and Cruelty.AT: Absolutely amazing. I guess I always thought the traditional tideswere…well…traditional.LBC: Traditionally Qabalistic. Okay, I want to wind this interview up. I'mreally hungry! I promised to talk about the four Princesses. These four maidsare treated differently from the other twelve Court Cards. This stems from theQabalistic doctrine concerning the exiled condition of the human soul.Now, when I say “exiled” I'm not referring to the old superstition about Adamand Eve getting kicked out of the Garden of Eden, and now we're all under somekind of bad ju-ju from an abusive creator. And I'm certainly not talking aboutthat obscene and perverted doctrine known as original sin. Whoever the ignorant,woman-hating, insecure, irrational, terrified, guilt-ridden, diabolical,self-despising horse's ass was who came up with that diseased and malevolentconcept should have been thrown into the Nebuchadnezzar Institute for theCriminally Insane. The ridiculous belief that humanity could be cursed andcondemned to eternal torment because mythological characters fiddled with thewrong fruit has caused more suffering and mental illness than any other“religious” or political concept in history (coughing).It still amazes me that seemingly normal people—folks with pagers andcomputers—folks who can fill out their own tax forms and program their VCRs, canwalk around and smile with this malignant spiritual tumor nestled deep withintheir otherwise intelligent brains. It's not only absurd, it's downright toxic!The story of Adam and Eve was originally written as a Qabalistic fable. It, andmany of the other “Holy Scriptures,” were crafted to illustrate profoundcosmological and spiritual principles. They were created by and for very smartand highly educated specialists in the field of spiritual literature. They aretechnical texts that were never intended to be consumed like horror comics, andthen misinterpreted to further the ambitions of mean-spirited religious bullies(coughing) and others who just can't seem to (coughing) resist the temptation toenslave the minds and the sex-lives of their fellow creatures (coughing).AT: Rabbi, can I get you a glass of water?LBC: Thank you, please. It just gets me so mad. Sorry. Where were we?AT: We were talking about the Princesses.LBC: Right! Remember what I said about four suits representing the fourQabalistic worlds, and that the human soul is a microcosmic reflection of thisgigantic four-part reality?AT: Yes, and that the four Court Cards in each suit are furthersubdivisions of all this…LBC: Correct. Now think about the Court Card Kings as representing Atziluth(the Archetypal World), and, at the same time representing the highest part ofeach of our souls, the Chiah (the Life-Force);AT: Okay.LBC: Queens represent the second highest world, Briah (the Creative World),and our Neshamah (the Soul Intuition). Princes represent Yetzirah (the FormativeWorld), and the Ruach, our Intellect; and finally, Princesses represent thelowest world, Assiah (the Material World) and the lowest part of our soul, theNephesh (the Animal Soul). Follow me?AT: Why yes. Amazingly enough, I believe I do.LBC: Okay…listen up. Assiah, the material world we see around us, is justthe lowest vibratory expression of the universe. It is where the pureconsciousness of Deity is so slowed down—so doped up— that it actuallycrystallizes. It is where light and energy become matter and the invisiblebecomes visible.The Nephesh, the Animal Soul, is our own personal version of Assiah. It is theonly world our Nephesh recognizes. From this extremely limited point of view,both Deity and you and me are trapped, exiled in a frozen prison of matter. Weare a Princess who has forgotten her royal birthright. We have fooled ourselvesinto believing that Assiah is the only reality. We identify ourselves completelywith this lowest level of divine consciousness and the lowest part of our soul.But there is a way out—a way to escape the prison of matter and live in thebliss of the highest Qabalistic world. A classic fairytale shows us the way.A Princess, a daughter of a King and Queen, is the victim of a magic spell andfalls into a deep coma. A charming Prince (also the son of a King and Queen)sees the motionless perfection of this sleeping beauty and falls hopelessly inlove with her image. Even though she is asleep (and unlikely to respond in kind)the Prince stoops down into her sarcophagus and kisses her. The pure lovecoursing through his lips is the magic that awakens the Princess. She is liftedfrom her tomb and marries the Prince, the act of which simultaneously makes herthe Queen and him the King.That's where the fairytale stops, but in the Qabalah, the new King then makeshis new Queen pregnant. After doing this, he rolls over and goes to sleep. TheQueen gives birth to twins, a Prince and a Princess, who leave the castle foradventures of their own. They get separated. She gets cursed—falls asleep—yadayada yada—we know the story from there.That's how Kings are made. If there were no Princesses—there could be no Kings.She may be asleep, she may be slumbering in the deepest forest, guarded byheight-challenged mining engineers, but without her redemption the old sleepingKing will never reawaken, and the entire electricity of the universe willshort-circuit. This two-way incestuous circuitry is the dynamo that creates andsustains the universe.AT: This is all very quaint, Rabbi, but how does it apply to…LBC: We're talking about you and me here, booby. The you that you think isyou is not you. It is a dream you. In fact, the you that you think is you is adreamer inside a dreamer inside a dreamer inside a dreamer. You are the King ofthe universe, who has fallen asleep and is dreaming he is the Queen, who hasfallen asleep and is dreaming she is the Prince, who has fallen asleep and isdreaming he is a sleeping Princess.The first step in our return to our original state is to trick our own Princeinto kissing us and waking us up. This is pretty difficult, but it's notimpossible, because we've all got one of these Princes running around in the“more awake” world. Even now, he's beating his f ists against the lid of ourglass coffin, trying to wake us up so he can marry us and can get on with hiscareer. Modern Qabalistic magicians call this Prince the Holy Guardian Angel andview the union with their HGA as the first step toward spiritual enlightenment.AT: How do we achieve union with our Holy Guardian Angel?LBC: You do it by falling head-over-heels in love with love. You do it byusing your inner imagination to create the Deity in the image of your most ideallover, and then surrendering yourself completely and unconditionally.Now this may sound uncomfortably like what Christians, and Buddhists, and Hindustell you that you must do to their guys, and up to a point it is. But, no matterwhat they may tell you, no religion or creed can corner the market on thisuniversal experience. It is totally universal and nonsectarian. It reallydoesn't matter what you call the object of your devotion, or how you visualizeit. Anything and everything is capable of being the focus for your love for theHoly Guardian Angel.Now can you see why the Princesses are special? Like you and me, they arepositioned at the lowest end of the elemental universe, but they also embody thefoundation of the entire universe, and are the key ingredient in the greatrecipe of creation.Qabalists call the dream world of the sleeping Princess the Microcosm, or littleuniverse. It is the world of Assiah and the Nephesh part of our soul. They placeit at the very bottom on the Tree of Life. Here, I have some illustrations.images [../images/00240.jpeg]Figure 34. The World of the Princesses.The world of the Prince is Yetzirah, the next higher Qabalistic world, which isknown as the Macrocosm, the big world. In us it's our Ruach. On the Tree ofLife, the Macrocosm is attributed to the six Sephiroth in the middle of theTree.images [../images/00241.jpeg]Figure 35. The World f the Princes.images [../images/00242.jpeg]Figure 36. The World of the Queens.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The world of the Queen is Briah, the next higher Qabalistic world, which isrepresented on the Tree of Life by the third Sephirah of the Supernal Triad,Binah. This corresponds to the Neshamah part of our soul, the Soul Intuition.The world of the King is Atziluth, the highest Qabalistic world, which isrepresented on the Tree of Life by the first and second Sephiroth of theSupernal Triad, Kether and Chokmah, and the Chiah part of our soul, theLife-Force, itselfAT: This is all breathtakingly interesting Rabbi. I can see why thePrincesses and the Earth element are unique and important, and I certainly dowant to hear more about this Holy Guardian Angel fellow, but before we end ourinterview you promised to explain why the Princesses do not represent degrees ofthe zodiac like the other twelve Court Cards.LBC: You're right. I have rambled on, haven't I? Well, I had to, in order foryou to see that the Princesses are just as much a defining key to their suit asthe Ace is. The Ace and the Princess are like the Alpha and Omega of their suit.Actually the Princess is the Throne of her Ace.images [../images/00243.jpeg]Figure 37. The World of the Kings.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------While the other Court Cards and Small Cards represent coordinates of time, byruling degrees of the zodiac and days of the year, the Aces and their Princessesrule quadrants of Heaven which translate to quadrants of space and areas righthere on Earth.Imagine yourself looking down upon the North Pole of the Earth. Now divide theworld in two by drawing a line that runs from the North Pole through Giza andall the way around the world back to the North Pole. Then quarter section theglobe by drawing another line at a right angle to the first. The four quadrantsof Earth are attributed in Yod Heh Vau Heh order thusly:♦ The Quadrant east of Giza or most of Asia is ruled by the Ace and Princess ofWands;♦ The Ace and Princess of Cups rule the area of the Pacific;♦ The Ace and Princess of Swords rule the Americas; and♦ The Ace and Princess of Disks rule most of Europe and Africa.

The world coordinates.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT: This is incredible information. It could be very helpful in readingsconcerning global matters or international finance.LBC: Or if the question treats on the subject of travel.AT: Absolutely amazing.LBC: You know, just winding up here, you and your readers might not thinkthat learning all these attributes is going to help your Tarot readings in anyway, and I can't. promise that it will. But what I can promise is that in theprocess of learning these traditional attributes, you'll discover that you'regiving yourself a wonderful liberal arts education in religion and philosophy.It's possible that you might never be called upon to use any of this Qabalisticinformation in your career as a Tarot reader. But, I can almost guarantee that,as a result of your study, you'll discover that you've become a more interestingand eloquent person. And these are certainly traits people look for in acompetent reader ofTarot.AT: Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford, it has indeed been a pleasure and a mostenlightening afternoon. Thank you very much. I'm sure our readers will find thismost provocative."},{"pageContent":"10RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD'S LAST LECTURE: GAMES QABALISTS PLAYIntroduced by Lon Milo DuQuetteIn the game of Qabalah the object of the play is to lose yourself—the winnergets nothing, and you've only yourself to play with.—RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDThis chapter is perhaps the most unusual in the entire book. It was compiledfrom fragmentary notes and diagrams that represent, as far as I can determine,the last known instructional writings of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. Less thanthree weeks after he scribbled the following apparently unfinished essay, he wasreported missing by his disciples. The police found nothing in his apartmentthat would indicate foul play, or give them any clue as to the circumstances ofhis disappearance. A search of local newspaper clippings of that period revealednothing out of the ordinary occurring that week in his Montauk neighborhood,other than a brief electrical brownout and an unseasonably intense infestationof gnats.Personally, I would like to believe that the man who called himself Rabbi LamedBen Clifford is still alive and living somewhere on the East Coast. His work nowdone, he has dropped his colorful persona and resumed whatever life he hadbefore his bizarre incarnation as the rebel Rabbi and guru of the ChickenQabalah movement.This last paper appears to be yet another address to the imaginary students ofZ.I.P.Y., serving as their introduction to the fundamentals of Gematria,Notariqon, and Temura. But as we will see, the essay repeatedly dissolves intothe most extraordinary digressions, and becomes something quite more.This work ends abruptly with a curious poignant musing on the perfection of theuniverse. It is clear by the tone and intensity of the “lecture” up until thatpoint that Ben Clifford was approaching the transcendent level of consciousnesshe so often advertised possible through the practice of Qabalistic exercises—astate of mind in which he perceived virtually everything connected, reflected,and forming the pattern for everything else.We feel an almost voyeuristic self-consciousness as we peer through the windowof his words, to glimpse the fabled Qabalistic chain-reaction of thoughtscoursing like a multiple helix through his remarkable mind. “What does it allmean?” he asks repeatedly. “Who cares!” he joyfully answers, with Zen-likenonattachment. Whether it is madness or illumination, we can't help but stand inmute admiration, as he valiantly struggles to keep objectively focused on thesubject at hand. Again and again he loses the fight, and merrily slips the bondsof linear rationality, plunging deep into the heart of the very processes he istrying to describe. In so doing, he demonstrates that the soul of the Qabalah istruly universal, revealing itself not only in Hebrew letters and books of theBible, but in things as familiar as one's own name, or as innocuous as thewords, “Have a nice day!”Gematria, Notariqon, Temura— Games Qabalists Playimages [../images/00245.jpeg]NOTES TOWARD AN ADDRESS BYRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORDTo THE GRADUATING STUDENTS OF THEZERUBBABEL INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHICAL YOUTH I'VE TITLED TODAY'S TALK “Gematria, Notariqon and Temura—Games Qabalists Play.”I can tell by the looks on your guileless faces that you have been lookingforward to this discourse. After all, isn't this what most of you think Qabalahis all about— playing games with numbers, and letters, and words, until youdecipher a personal message from God explaining the secrets of creation andaffirming the fact that you are the Holy Chosen One? Well, my haplesshatchlings, by playing these games you can, indeed, discover the secrets ofcreation. You may even become afflicted with the knowledge that you are, infact, the Holy Chosen One. (For God's sake—please don't tell anybody!) But Ithink that it's only fair to warn you that Qabalistic games are very powerful,and different from any other games you have ever played.First of all we need to know why we are encouraged to play these mind-bendinggames. Let's start by reviewing what we've learned from the Ten Command-Rants:1. All is One.Realization of the “One” is the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists.2. The First Command-Rant is a lie—All is Nothing.The final goal is to attain consciousness of Nothing.3. There really isn't a creation, time, or space, Heaven, or Earth…but there isa you!Aren't you happy to hear that?4. We perceive there is a creation, time, and space, Heaven, and Earth becauseof a fundamental defect in our powers of perception.Our faulty powers of perception keep us trapped in illusionary existence.5. This defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome.How do we overcome this defect?6. In order to overcome our defective powers of perception, we must be willingto abuse them until they break.Bingo! But this can be very dangerous. It may be true that every enlightenedsage is insane, but it does not necessarily follow that every insane person isan enlightened sage! We must employ discipline, and strictly limit ourtechniques of self-abuse to fundamental observations of the illusionary worldaround us. These observations reveal to us that:7. Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven andEarth.8. Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven andEarth.9. Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heavenand Earth.You are not likely to gain enlightenment simply by examining all the “things” inillusionary Heaven and Earth. But it is possible to achieve realization of theOne (the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists) by a profound and transcendentawareness that you are an indispensable component of the connections, thereflections, and the patterns of the Supreme Being.10. Look hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything.The object of your observation can be anything at all. Qabalists have learned,however, that some things reveal the Divine connection-reflection-pattern easierthan others.Mathematics is the most profound example because it lays bare, to the tenaciousstudent, the very structure of the universe. Language is another excellent toolfor spiritual dissection because, by its very nature, it is a vehicle ofconnections, reflections, and patterns. Language evokes and transfers imagesfrom mind to mind in a manner not dissimilar to the creative fiat of themythological gods of creation.• • •Orthodox Qabalists believe that Hebrew is the most sacred of all languages, andthat the letters of the Hebrew alphabet are both the building blocks of creationand the tools that put them all together. They believe the Holy Scriptures weredivinely inspired and originally written in Hebrew to veil and reveal layer uponlayer of ever-deepening spiritual truth. Certainly for devoted Jewish Qabaliststhis is the case, whether or not there is any historic validity to their beliefor not.As a Chicken Qabalist I have the greatest respect for the remarkable way partsof the Bible yield astounding treasures to the tinkering student. Furthermore, Igive thanks to the Great Poulterer that we have at our disposal that vast bodyof sectarian literature— hundreds of years of self-referential material,including classic Qabalistic texts, that employ biblical passages asspringboards for the most illuminating exegesis. This material remains thefoundation of our study whether or not we choose to embrace any of the religiousaspects of the work (and this, dear students, is what separates us from ourorthodox brothers and sisters)—we are not Qabalists to prove the Bible isholy—we are Qabalists because everything is holy. Look hard enough at anythingand you will eventually see everything! Right now— right where you are, God istalking to you from the pages of the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas—from the funnypapers, billboards, street signs, ticket stubs, and automobile license plates.We don't always have to be quick to tinker with the letters and numbers when weuse the techniques of Gematria, Notariqon, or Temura. We are perpetuallybombarded by countless numbers nestled within the billions of impressions weprocess each day. How many times a day do we write the date? What is 57 doing ona jar of pickles? We listen to the Top 40, watch the News at 7 and go to work bytaking the 405 freeway to the 55 to the 5 to the 101.The ancient Qabalists didn't spend much time on the turnpike and probably didn'tlisten to the Top 40. What they did do was spend a lot of time studying thescriptures, and as the Tenth Command-Rant informs us, the scriptures arecertainly as holy as a jar of pickles.As a matter of fact, the Bible is already crawling with numbers. Perhaps you'dlike a better understanding of what Ezekiel was talking about in his famousvision? A due might be found in the very first chapter [part0009.html] and verseof his book. In English it reads:Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth dayof the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that theHeavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.1 [part0020.html#chap10_ft1]I personally do not think it was important for Ezekiel to make sure we all knewthe exact publication date of his book. I do, however, think that he wanted tomake it perfectly clear that he might be writing about something other than hispsychedelic escapades with flying saucers, four-headed aliens, and dancingskeletons.In the first verse we find the numbers 30, 4 and 5, or the Hebrew letters images[../images/00246.jpeg] and images [../images/00035.jpeg]-H, or the Hebrew wordimages [../images/00247.jpeg] which means “birth.”The second verse has a similar message: In the fifth day of the month, which wasthe fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity, we find 5 (images[../images/00035.jpeg]-H), and 5 (images [../images/00035.jpeg]-H) (duh!)—or theHebrew word images [../images/00035.jpeg]images [../images/00035.jpeg], whichmeans “window!” A window is something through which we observe. It also permitslight to enter. Birth, the result of penetrating light? Light penetrating where?The Book of Ezekiel sounds a little more intriguing now doesn't it? Take a peakat how chapter 8 [part0016.html] starts out:And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day ofthe month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, thatthe hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. (Ezekiel 8: 1).We find the numbers 6, 6, and 5. I couldn't find any significant words spelledVVH or even HVV, but when I put the three numbers side-by-side, I see the number665 which is the sum of the Hebrew words images [../images/00248.jpeg] “thewomb,” which certainly seems to carry on the theme that was started in chapter 1[part0009.html]: verse 1. Light penetrating the womb which gives birth—givesbirth to what?The 20th chapter may tell us. It begins with even more numbers:And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day ofthe month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, andsat before me. (Ezekiel 20:1).Number 7,510? Well, we can really get bogged down on numbers that large, but ifwe reduce the 10 to a 1 we get the number 751, which is the sum of the Hebrewword for “finished man” or “perfect man'': images [../images/00249.jpeg] or AYShThM. Thus, by investigating the numbers that are mentioned openly in these fourverses, we find ourselves teased with the concept of Light penetrating the wombgiving birth to the Perfected Man.Was that the message Ezekiel was trying to convey? Probably not. But who cares!Whatever it was that the old boy was originally trying to say shrinks toinsignificance. It is far more important to my spiritual enlightenment that mymind was forced to churn at breakneck speed to put all of this together, andthen open itself up to the infinite potentialities of meaning. Look hard enoughat anything and you will eventually see everything! It doesn't even have to makevery much sense what you connect to what. It's all ultimately connected! Don'tyou see?The Qabalah doesn't enable me to merely interpret what somebody else meant tosay; it forces me to hear what I need to hear! Each time I make anotherconnection on paper, I am creating a new connection in my head (or perhapsreattaching a connection that was disconnected from the heads of our ancestorsvast ages ago), and I am one step nearer to the realization that everything inHeaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.I'll now leave Ezekiel to the pizza cutter of your own wit. Time is short. Imust push on with subjects of Gematria, Notariqon, and Temura, by which we canwring more truths (and Holy lies) from numbers and words. Please remember thatthese are not the only ways to warm up your cosmic translator, but theycertainly are three classic, tried-and-true methods of the Chicken Qabalist.GEMATRIAGematria2 [part0020.html#chap10_ft2] is the process by which each letter of aword or series of words is converted to its numerical equivalent. Words yieldingthe same value are connected by their common numerical vibration and (on oneplane or another) descriptive of each other. These correspondences are seldomobvious, and it is the student's quest to meditate upon the words and numbersuntil he or she achieves the level of consciousness in which the illusorycontradictions are resolved.For example, The Hebrew word for “riches” and “power” is images[../images/00250.jpeg] (DBA). The three letters add to the sacred number 7. Ifwe spell DBA backward, we get the word images [../images/00251.jpeg] (ABD) whichmeans “loss” or “ruin”While it doesn't take a rocket-scientist to realize that the opposite or richesand power is loss and ruin, the order and meanings of the individual Hebrewletters in these words tell a simple but profound story.The Hebrew word “riches” images [../images/00250.jpeg] (DBA) suggests a doorimages [../images/00252.jpeg] to a house images [../images/00253.jpeg] or barnopening to enclose an ox images [../images/00254.jpeg] (an ancient symbol ofwealth).However, the word for “loss” or “ruined” reverses the letters and suggests theox images [../images/00254.jpeg] of wealth finds the barn's door images[../images/00253.jpeg]images [../images/00252.jpeg] and escapes. Or, to put itbluntly: Door + Barn + Ox = Good! Ox + Barn + Door = Bad!Another famous paradox of Gematria demonstrates that the Hebrew word for Messiahimages [../images/00255.jpeg] (MShYCh) and the word used to describe the serpentimages [../images/00256.jpeg] (NChSh) that tempted Eve in the Garden of Edenboth add to 358. Could this mean that the serpent might be the savior of theworld, and the Messiah might lead us to damnation?Christians certainly think “Jesus” (images [../images/00257.jpeg]= 326) is the“Lord” (images [../images/00258.jpeg]images [../images/00253.jpeg]= 32), andthose two words together = 358 = Messiah. I bet they'd be surprised, however, tolearn that every time they dutifully end their prayers in the “name” (images[../images/00259.jpeg] = 340) “Jesus” (images [../images/00257.jpeg]= 326), theyare Qabalistically invoking 666, the number of the Beast of the Book of theRevelation, and for many, one of the scariest anti-Christian characters in theBible. Could it be we really don't understand the meaning of either of theseconcepts and the number 358 might be our only clue?Now, I'm sure you're asking yourselves, “How did Rabbi Ben Clifford know thatall these Hebrew words added to these numbers?” Well, you may not believe thisbut, in 1979, I took a few months off and rented a cabin in upstate New York,where I added up every Hebrew word in the Bible, a well as in all the majorQabalistic texts, and put them in my Rolodex. It's so big I have to keep it inthe garage because my Mom says it's a breeding-ground for dust mites.3[part0020.html#chap10_ft3]Table 4 [part0018.html#tab4] is a quick and dirty view of English letters, theirHebrew counterparts and numerical equivalents.4 [part0020.html#chap10_ft4]Table 4. English Alphabet with Possible Hebrew Numerations.images [../images/00260.jpeg]Some letters have multiple numbers because phonetically they can sound likeother letters and those other letters have different numbers. For example, theEnglish word “cat” could be spelled many ways using Hebrew letters. Just a fewways it could be spelled are shown below:images [../images/00261.jpeg]As Hebrew doesn't use any vowels, “cat” can also be spelled with just theconsonants:images [../images/00262.jpeg]The numeration of the word changes, with variations in spelling offering us morefood for thought and more opportunity for intellectual overload so coveted byChicken Qabalists. As far as I'm concerned, all spelling is equally correct aslong as it evokes a chain reaction of thoughts. The Chicken Qabalist should feelfree to transliterate English letters and words using a broad assortment ofmethods. For example, if I change each English letter of my name to a logicalHebrew counterpart (a very un-Hebrew thing to do) we arrive at the number 419: LAMED 30 + 1 + 40 + 5 + 4 = 80 BEN 2 + 5 + 50 = 57 CLIFFORD 20 + 30 + 10 +6 + 6 + 6 + 200 + 4 = 282 = 419Now 419 is a very interesting number. First of all, it is a Prime Number andcannot be divided by any other number but itself. There are some prettyimportant Hebrew words that add to 419. The word for the Hebrew letter Teth(images [../images/00263.jpeg]) adds to 419. images [../images/00263.jpeg] means“serpent” and all the wonderful and scary things that go with the idea ofserpent. According to our Sepher Yetzirah, Teth is the letter of the zodiac signof Leo. On the Tree of Life, Teth is the path that joins the fourth Sephirah,Chesed, to the fifth Sephirah, Geburah. In the Tarot, Teth is the Strength card.Wow! Isn't 419 a great number? But if we look a little deeper, we discover thatthe Hebrew words Sodom and Gomorah images [../images/00264.jpeg] also add to419, and we know what the Bible tells us happened to those communities. Oops!Maybe I better spell my name differently. In more strict Hebrew, it might bespelled as follows: LMD 30 + 40 + 4 = 74 BN 2 + 50 = 52 CLPhRD 20 + 30 + 80 + 200 + 4 = 334 = 460But 460 is also a wonderful number (and a big number in traditional Judaism)because it is the sum of the letters of the words “Holiness to the Lord” images[../images/00265.jpeg]. These words were engraved upon a gold plate that theHigh Priest of Israel wore on his hat.My first name can further be reduced to the simple letter L (images[../images/00258.jpeg]), which, after all, is spelled LMD images[../images/00266.jpeg] and rendered “Lamed” in English. I can also treat the “C”in Clifford as a “Q,” and we get the following: L 30 = 30 BN 2 + 50 = 52 QLPhRD 100 + 30 + 80 + 200 + 4 = 414 = 496Here a very interesting number. Hebrew words that add to 496 include the greatsea-devil Leviathan images [../images/00267.jpeg] and Malkuth images[../images/00268.jpeg] the tenth and lowest Sephirah on the Tree of Life.Determining a word's number is only the beginning of the fun. Next we pick thenumber apart by every means known and a few that we will make up. For example:496 is the sum of the numbers 1 through 31. (In other words, if 496 was a barrelof wine, 31 would be the brandy distilled from that wine.) Turning to one of ournumber texts5 [part0020.html#chap10_ft5] we find that 31 has several entries.The two most important, in my opinion, are AL (images[../images/00258.jpeg]images [../images/00254.jpeg]) which is the simplest wayto say God in Hebrew, and LA (images [../images/00254.jpeg]images[../images/00258.jpeg]) which means “not.” This reminds us of the first twoCommand-Rants; All is One, AL (images [../images/00258.jpeg]images[../images/00254.jpeg]) and All is Nothing, LA (images[../images/00254.jpeg]images [../images/00258.jpeg]). Say what you will aboutIslam, but Allah is a great name for God!There are no hard and fast rules about how you go about chasing one number toanother. Go crazy. That's the idea!6 [part0020.html#chap10_ft6] Feel free tobreak into other levels of correspondences. For instance: 496 = Malkuth, and onthe Tree of Life it is 10, and represents the material plane. That means that496 must also represent all things 10ish (after all 4 + 9 + 6 = 19 and 1 + 9 =10). The Hebrew letter Yod enumerates to 10. Yod means “hand.” Using Hebrew forEnglish, HA images [../images/00269.jpeg] means “this” and ND (images[../images/00252.jpeg]images [../images/00270.jpeg]) means “a skin bottle.”Also, HAND images [../images/00271.jpeg] = 60. The number 60 is the Hebrewletter images [../images/00272.jpeg] (Samekh) which suggests the phallus (Oh myGod! This skin bottle!) and when spelled in full is images[../images/00273.jpeg] SMK, which enumerates to 120, which is the number of theword “on,” the sacred Greek word for “existence” and “being,”7[part0020.html#chap10_ft7] and one of the most holy Egyptian words for Deity inthe person of the Sun.See what we've done? Even this little excursion around Gematrialand has rewardedus with the provocative revelation that Yod, the creative hand of God, and theessence of existence and being, manifests as the Sun in our macrocosmic solarsystem, and also as the human phallus (this skin bottle, no less!) in themicrocosmic material plane of Malkuth, the 10th and lowest Sephirah on the Treeof Life—whose number is 496.What does this all mean? Who cares!You can see where this is all going, can't you? Like a mountain goat leapingecstatically from crag to crag, one thought springs into another, and another,ad infinitum. You can continue, almost forever, connecting things that you neverthought were connected. Sooner or later something's going to snap and you willovercome the fundamental defect in your powers of perception.But don't expect illumination to come as the result of some particularrevelation concerning numbers or language. No, no, no, my children! Getting allworked up over those discoveries will chase away your friends and ruin yoursocial life. Your Qabalistic enlightenment will come quietly from the simple,but profound, realization that you are integrally connected to everything—justlike these numbers and letters.Now let's move on to the techniques of Notariqon and Temura. They are reallyelaborations on Gematria because, in the final analysis, the number of theletter or word remains of primary importance. Let's look first at Notariqon.NOTARIQONThere are two kinds of Notariqon.8 [part0020.html#chap10_ft8] The firstcondenses a word, sentence, or a phrase into a more simple form in order toextract a more fundamental truth. The second method expands a word into asentence whose component words are the initials of the original word.The former is the most commonly used, and is exercised by using only theinitials of the composite words to arrive at another word or number ofsignificance. There are thousands of examples of this to be found in the Hebrewwords and phrases in the Bible. Quite frankly, it's not really very impressive,because anybody can make most anything say most anything else. It all dependsupon your personal or sectarian prejudices.9 [part0020.html#chap10_ft9] Thespiritual pay-off does not come from proving a word is the perfect cryptographicdefinition of something else, but by breaking free of our day-to-day thoughtpatterns and realizing that anything is potentially anything else.For our example, observe that the phrase, “I did it on time,” reduces to theword “IDIOT.” IDIOT = I (10) + D (4) +I (10) + 0 (6) + Th (400) = 430 = Nephesh,the Animal Soul of Man. (Oh God! This is getting too easy!)The next form of Notariqon is a process that expands a letter, a word, or asentence. For our example, let's continue the chain of ideas we started earlierand expand upon the letter Yod: Yod means “hand” and the word HAND can beexpanded to reveal America's most worn out and meaningless blessing, “HAVE ANICE DAY.”But let's not stop here. When we expand “Have a nice day,” we discover that theindividual letters of that nauseating mantra of insincerity expand into thedelicious axiom of decadence: “HEROIN AND VODKA EASE AGONY. NOTHING IS CERTAINEXCEPT DEATH AND YESTERDAY.”What does it all mean? Who cares!TEMURAWith Temura,10 [part0020.html#chap10_ft10] letters are replaced by otherletters. It is the classic “secret code.” There are infinite ways this can bedone, so I will only show you a few. The most primitive form of Temura simplyrearranges the letters in a word or phrase. Let's look at the phrase “HAVE ANICE DAY.” It can be rearranged to yield all sorts of profundities.♦ You may start your day with the simple affirmation—EACH DAY NAÏVE♦ Or coldly curse people by telling them to “HAVE AN ICE DAY.”♦ You might suggest a dessert to your friend, “HAVE A ICE, ANDY.”♦ Or meet someone at the uncomfortable corner of HAY AND ICE AVE.♦ Did you ever begin your prayer to David, the patron saint of outlawmotorcyclists?—AVE, CHAIN DAVE.♦ Movie villains may ask, “CAN A HEAVY DIE?”♦ What a stupid question. Of course, A HEAVY CAN DIE.♦ You might admire someone's firm handshake and exclaim, “YEA! A VICE HAND.”♦ You might eat too much chocolate and have to warn people, “I HEAVE A CANDY!”♦ Your dentist might make you wear a sign that says I A DECAY HAVEN.♦ Or she may cruelly admonish you, HA! NAÏVE DECAY!♦ To honor dead spies, paradise might host a yearly CIA HEAVEN DAY.♦ A hypochondriac might try to color his imaginary illness and DYE A VAINACHE.Unfortunately, none of the above statements make any sense—but who cares! Lookat all the unconnected things that got themselves connected. However, if we weredealing with Hebrew letters and words that have their own numerical equivalentsand multiple definitions, we might find all sorts of entertaining andenlightening messages.The most common way Qabalists replace one letter with another is by utilizing atable called AIQ BKR, or The Qabalah of the Nine Chambers. See Table 5[part0018.html#tab5], page 195.Letters having the same single digit root [1-10-100], [2-20-200], [3-30-300],etc.) are grouped together in nine chambers. The letter A can be replaced by I(or J or Y) or Q. The letter B can be replaced by K or R, thus the name AIQ BKR.The Hebrew word for “bull,” PR images [../images/00252.jpeg]images[../images/00274.jpeg](280) could be replaced by the Hebrew word for “bosom” ChBimages [../images/00275.jpeg] (10). The English word LID (34) conceals the wordShAM (341).Table 5. The Qabalah of the Nine Chambers.images [../images/00276.jpeg]The Qabalah of the Nine Chambers (Table 5) [part0018.html#tab5] is particularlyhelpful for those Chicken Qabalists who dabble with Magick Squares. A MagickSquare is really the numerical matrix of its parent Sephirah on the Tree ofLife. In other words, Binah is the third Sephirah, and therefore is theSephiratic expression of the planet Saturn. Consequently, the Magick Square ofSaturn is a square 3 × 3.This follows right down the Tree of Life and right up the number scale: theMagick Square of Jupiter (4th Sephirah, Chesed) is a square 4 × 4; the MagickSquare of Mars (5th Sephirah, Geburah) is a square 5 × 5; the Magick Square ofthe Sun (6th Sephirah, Tiphareth) is a square 6 × 6; the Magick Square of Venus(7th Sephirah, Netzach) is a square 7 × 7; the Magick Square of Mercury (8thSephirah, Hod) is a square 8 × 8; and the Magick Square of Luna (9th Sephirah,Yesod) is a square 9 × 9.These Magic Squares (see figure 39 [part0018.html#fig39], page 196) are filledwith numbers—the same amount of numbers as there are squares in the MagicSquare. Thus, the Magick Square of Saturn/Binah (3 × 3 = 9) will contain thenumbers 1-9; the Square of Jupiter/Chesed 1-16; the Square of Mars/Geburah 1-25;the Square of Sol/Tiphareth 1-36; the Square of Venus 1-49; the Square ofMercury 1-64; and the Square of Luna 1-81.images [../images/00277.jpeg]Figure 39. Planetary Magick Squares.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The numbers of all Magick Squares are ingeniously arranged such that the sum ofthe integer in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always thesame.You will also notice that the numbers 1 through 10 and the numbers 20, 30, 40,50, 60, 70, and 80 are in bold type wherever they appear in the various MagickSquares. This is because these numbers also represent Hebrew letters. Qabalisticmagicians have for centuries used these Magick Squares to create the sigils orsignatures of angels and various other spiritual beings who personify variousaspects of each individual Sephirah. These sigils capture the mathematicalessence of the spirit. They can be used to charge talismans or amulets, or whendrawn in the air with a magic wand, evoke and focus the spirit's energy.Obviously all the Hebrew letters cannot be represented by all the squares. Eventhe biggest square, that of Luna, has only 81 squares, completely leaving outroom for the letters, Tzaddi (90), Qoph (100), Resh (200), Shin (300), and Tav(400).The poor Magick Square for Saturn has only 9 numbers/letters to work with. Howcould I create the sigil for the bumbling nerd Angel named DORKAEL11[part0020.html#chap10_ft11] on the Saturn Magick Square? (See figure 40[part0018.html#fig40] below.) I can find the 4 for D and the 6 for O and the 1for A and the 5 for E, but what do I do for the R and the K and the L? 200 and20 and 30 don't appear on the Magick Square of Saturn. Am I out of luck? No!images [../images/00278.jpeg]Figure 40. Creating a Sigil.images [../images/00279.jpeg]Figure 41. The AthBSh.images [../images/00280.jpeg]Figure 42. The ALBth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's where the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers (Table 5 [part0018.html#tab5])comes in. I look up R in the Nine Chambers' chart and see that R (200) sharesits chamber with K (20) and B (2). There isn't a 20 in the Magick Square ofSaturn but there is a 2. So, in creating the sigil for DORKAEL, I will treat the200 of R as the 2 of B and use the square of 2. I will also have to use the 2square for the K as well.Other techniques of Temura divide the alphabet in two parts in various ways andreplace letters with the letter in the box above or below it. The version infigure 41 [part0018.html#fig41] (above) is called AThBSh (after the first fourletters in the code).The version of Temura in figure 42 [part0018.html#fig42] is called ALBTh (afterthe first four letters in its code).As you can imagine, there are nearly infinite ways to rearrange the letters sothat they…12 [part0020.html#chap10_ft12]…rearranging the letters…to peel back……infinite ways……all we can do is rearrange… …it just looks like creation…Sometimes it is so…We don't really climb the Tree of Life to get back to theGodhead…we just peel back…peel back…like Solomon in the nut garden13[part0020.html#chap10_ft13]…one membrane peeled back to reveal another andanother…the center germ of the nut is invisible…is nothing…yet it carries thecode of all of its ancestors and the potential of infinite nuts to come…I'm thatcenter germ…not the shell, not the meat, not the membranes….I'm the nothing inthe middle.…sometimes it just becomes so very….Well, I think I've said enough about Temura and …perhaps I've just said enough now.Please excuse me.You know, dear friends, when all is said and done, it makes no difference how werearrange or substitute our letters. It makes no difference if one numberreveals another number, or word, or—or any of it—as long as all this helps usmake a final connection. Because, at the end of the day, it really doesn'tmatter what we've done, only that we did.Every letter, every number, every word, every image, every concept, everythought and component of thought is at once the loving creator, offspring anddestroyer of every other letter, every other number, every other word, everyother image, every other concept, every other thought and component of thought.It's really quite lovely, actually—so tidy.Yes, so very tidy, and…and so very, very…smooth.14 [part0020.html#chap10_ft14]"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUESHEM-HA-MEPHORASHFor I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union. This is the creationof the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy ofdissolution all.—AIWASSIt is fitting that we end our study of the Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed BenClifford with what I believe to be his greatest work, The Secret ofShem-ha-Mephorash. This tiny masterpiece was meticulously hand-printed on theback cover of his Games Qabalists Play notebook, and could very well be the lastwords he ever wrote.Shem-ha-Mephorash means “divided name,” and has traditionally been the subjectof much Qabalistic speculation and discussion.

For reasons which I do notaltogether understand, many Jewish proponents prefer to treat the Q as a K anddouble the B when rendering the word into English letters.3 [part0007.html#itr_fn3] Christian students prefer to spell it Cabala.4 [part0007.html#itr_fn4] Ceremonial magicians prefer to spell it Qabalah.5 [part0007.html#itr_fn5] Gershom G.

Depending upon the dialect, there are, ofcourse, many correct ways to pronounce Hebrew words. However, the point Ibelieve Ben Clifford was trying to make is that, so far as the study of Qabalahis concerned, pronunciation is ultimately irrelevant. Arguing over it is a wasteof precious time. By assuming this cavalier attitude, the Chicken Qabalistenjoys an exhilarating level of spiritual freedom to pursue the more importantaspects of the work.4 [part0009.html#chap1_fn4] See chapter 2.CHAPTER 21 [part0010.html#chap2_fn1] See chapter 3.2 [part0010.html#chap2_fn2] See chapter 3.3 [part0010.html#chap2_fn3] It is a Qabalistic mystery of the highest order thatthe three letters, AIN (meaning “not” or “Negative Existence”) when reorderedANI become the Hebrew word for “I” and “Myself.”4 [part0010.html#chap2_fn4] Ben Clifford's translation of the Sepher Yetzirah(see chapter 3) says: “Deity…created the Universe (with the help of threeimaginary friends, “Numbers, Letters, and Words”) in 32 mysterious paths ofwisdom. They consist of 10 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.”5 [part0010.html#chap2_fn5] At least I am real. To tell you the truth, I'm notsure about you.6 [part0010.html#chap2_fn6] Isn't this a recipe for madness?—Wake up! You'realready crazy— and blind, deaf, and numb to boot! See chapter 10, Gematria,Notariqon and Temura—Games Qabalists Play.CHAPTER 31 [part0011.html#chap3_fn1] Even the most respected translators of the SepherYetzirah admit that the source texts from which they worked contain internalinconsistencies and other obvious evidences of severe corruption. HermeticQabalists of the 19th and 20th centuries (particularly the adepts of the GoldenDawn) freely adjusted certain planetary and zodiacal letter assignments toconform to modern and universally acknowledged astrological standards. Rabbi BenClifford's “translation” conforms to this modern tradition.2 [part0011.html#chap3_fn2] See chapter 7.3 [part0011.html#chap3_fn3] The Biblical translations here are obviously thoseof the Rabbi himself, who worked from the standard Hebrew texts.4 [part0011.html#chap3_fn4] Editor's note: Ben Clifford claimed that when he wasborn, his mother, who at the time was a groupie with the Cliffy Eban KlezmerBand, was unsure exactly who fathered her child. She wished to name him “El”after God, but her colleagues cautioned her that to do so might be considered ablaspheme. Instead, she named him simply “L,” which in English is pronounced“El” and is rendered images [../images/00258.jpeg], Lamed, in Hebrew.5 [part0011.html#chap3_fn5] It might surprise you to know that traditionally theconcept of God as a father is foreign to the ancient Jewish mind. Abraham wasthe father of the Jews, and the father figure to the Jews. In the Bible, Abrahamnever referred to God as father, neither did Noah, Moses, Elijah, Elias,Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Jonah, Solomon, Ezra, or Nehemiah. In fact, in theentire Old Testament only two verses in the book of Isaiah and one Psalm ofDavid make reference to the fatherlike qualities of Deity.6 [part0011.html#chap3_fn6] Qabalists are quick to point out that because thephrase images [../images/00282.jpeg] images [../images/00283.jpeg], “and Godsaid” (literally “and said Elohim”) appears ten times in the first chapter ofGenesis, that the number I 0 is the key number of creation.7 [part0011.html#chap3_fn7] The Gospel According to Saint John, 1:1.8 [part0011.html#chap3_fn8] The element Earth, like Malkuth, the lowestSephiroth, is somewhat of a cosmic stepchild. It is represented by a Hebrewletter (ה, Tau), which also represents the planet Saturn. Early in the creationscenario, however, the three primitive and primary elements were Air, Water, andFire.9 [part0011.html#chap3_fn9] Some Hebrew letters look very much like otherletters. We will learn more about this in chapter 4.CHAPTER 41 [part0012.html#chap4_fn1] Some of you may already have a good workingknowledge of the Hebrew alphabet, and will be tempted to skip over the nextsection. Please resist such temptation, and read it through at least once. Youmay learn a thing or two you don't already know. At the very least, it may helpyou with your Hebrew penmanship.CHAPTER 51 [part0013.html#chap5_fn1] Pronounce it any way you want.2 [part0013.html#chap5_fn2] Peh images [../images/00274.jpeg], can also bepronounced like an “F.” images [../images/00274.jpeg] images[../images/00274.jpeg] could also be pronounced “faf,” or “fafe,” or “feef,” or“fif,” or “fife,” or “fof,” or “fofe,” or “fuf,” or “fafa,” or “faffy,” or“fofeye,” or “feefee,” or “foofoo,”.3 [part0013.html#chap5_fn3] Editor's note: Here again, the Rabbi's penchant forthe dramatic becomes evident. It is clear that the High Priest did not alwaysdie in a spectacular explosion. It is most likely, however, that it was expectedthat he would be rendered unconscious by the act of touching the Ark anduttering the Ineffable Name.4 [part0013.html#chap5_fn4] Editor's note: Rabbi Ben Clifford is quite correctconcerning the use of battle gods by ancient peoples. However, his referencehere to monumental talismanic totem cheeses appears to be completely devoid ofhistoric or traditional foundation.5 [part0013.html#chap5_fn5] Editor's note: Aaron's rod was a staff of almondwood that, at a very auspicious moment, miraculously bloomed. The Hebrew wordsfor “a rod of almond” images [../images/00284.jpeg] enumerate to the primenumber 463. The three Hebrew letters that enumerate to 463 are images[../images/00285.jpeg] and images [../images/00270.jpeg] (Tau, Samekh, andGimel). On the Tree of Life (see page 43) Tau, Samekh, and Gimel form the middlepillar—the most balanced and direct path from material existence to supremegodhead—of which the human spine is the microcosmic reflection. Whatevermaterial Aaron's rod was actually made of, it was described as being “a rod ofalmond” in order to communicate to anyone interested in how it worked. It is notunreasonable to speculate that a central rod (middle pillar) running between apositive current (the right-hand Pillar of Severity) and a negative current (theleft-hand Pillar of Mildness) might be an object containing magnetic orelectrical properties.6 [part0013.html#chap5_fn6] About 3¾ feet (about 1. 1 meters) long and 2¼ feet(about 0.7 meter) wide and high.7 [part0013.html#chap5_fn7] Also called an atonement cover.8 [part0013.html#chap5_fn8] About 3¾ feet (about 1. 1 meters) long and 2¼ feet(about 0.7 meter) wide.9 [part0013.html#chap5_fn9] “Then Solomon assembled all the tribes of Israel,all the heads of the tribes, and the chiefs of the fathers, to him in Jerusalemto bring up the ark of the covenant of images [../images/00286.jpeg] out of thecity of David which is Zion….

It iswithout a doubt the most blatant falsehood Ben Clifford ever offered. Accordingto his closest disciples, no such Rolodex ever existed. The Rabbi used a varietyof lexicons and texts that were readily available at the time. In fact, BenClifford was often seen clutching his tattered copy of 777, the Qabalah ofAleister Crowley (777 and Other Qabalistic Writings, published by Samuel Weiserin 1970, 1981, 1986, and still today) that contains Sepher Sephiroth, acompilation of significant Hebrew words and their numerical equivalents.4 [part0018.html#chap10_fn4] For a more complete chart, see chapter 4.5 [part0018.html#chap10_fn5] Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other QabalisticWritings, Israel Regardie, ed.6 [part0018.html#chap10_fn6] Editor's note: What follows is a classic example ofBen Clifford's slide into the disciplined “madness” symptomatic of the earlystages of Qabalistic illumination. Please make every attempt to follow theprocess. When the chain of his ill-logic begins to actually make sense to you,you are “on your way” to Qabalistic illumination. (Caution: when this occurs, itis likely that you will become giddy with Qabalistic fervor. At such a time, itis unwise to try to share your illumination with family and friends. You mightfind yourself “on your way” to the rubber room hotel.)7 [part0018.html#chap10_fn7] As in “ontology,” the metaphysical study of thenature of being or reality.8 [part0018.html#chap10_fn8] Pronounce it any way you want.9 [part0018.html#chap10_fn9] Editor's note: I cannot resist reprinting thefollowing excerpt from my book, Angels, Demons images [../images/00288.jpeg]Gods of the New Millennium (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1997), p. 30. I thinkthe Rabbi would have been amused:Perhaps the most famous example [of Notariqon] is BRAShITh, the first word ofGenesis commonly translated “In the beginning.” B-R-A-Sh-I-Th can be expanded tosay—BRAShITh RAH ALHIM ShIQBLV IShRAL ThVRH: “In the beginning Elohim saw thatIsrael would accept the law.” The shortcomings of this exercise are obvious, forwhile the above sentence may have profound meaning to a Qabalist who is anorthodox Jew, the Christian Qabalist might prefer Prosper Rugere'sinterpretation—BBVA RBN AShR ShMV IShVo ThOBVDV: “When the Master shall comeWhose name is Jesus ye shall worship.” Then again, the diabolist might arguethat B-R-A-Sh-I-Th really means—BRAShITh RAH AShMDAI ShIQBLV IShRAL ThChLVM: “Inthe beginning Asmodai (the demon king) saw that Israel would accepthallucinations.”10 [part0018.html#chap10_fn10] Pronounce it any way you want.11 [part0018.html#chap10_fn11] Ben Clifford appears to have invented an angeljust for the purpose of illustration.12 [part0018.html#chap10_fn12] It is at this point that Ben Clifford's lastessay begins to quickly disintegrate. I've attempted to replicate the brokenword placement of the original handwritten manuscript. I believe it allows us arare and poignant glimpse of the moment when his Ruach finally loosened its irongrip on his self-identity, allowing him to more perfectly identify with thehigher aspects of his soul.13 [part0018.html#chap10_fn13] Song of Songs, 6:11.14 [part0018.html#chap10_fn14] The Smooth Point.

The following copy comes from my book, Angels, Demons &Gods of the New Millennium.1 [part0020.html#gls_ft1] One of the most impressive displays of Qabalistic gymnastics is an elaboratedissection of the Tetragrammaton called Shem-ha-Mephorash, the “divided name.”Based upon the four letters of the Great Name it is one of the finest examplesof how Qabalists develop new ways of viewing the dynamics of the universe andidentify the spiritual agencies who run the machinery.After exhausting all the tricks of Gematria, Notariqon, and Temura to harvestspiritual enlightenment from the Great Name, it occurred to some bright Qabalistto arrange the four letters in the form of a Pythagorean tetractys and addingthe sum of the letters.images [../images/00290.jpeg]It was decided that seventy-two is a primary expression of images[../images/00291.jpeg] and the key to an expanded (divided) name of God.Now, as there are seventy-two quinaries (groups of five degrees) in the zodiac,and each of those periods of five degrees represent approximately five days ofthe year, it followed that each part of images [../images/00291.jpeg]'s dividedname governed specific days of the year. This was an exciting prospect, for itpromised the opportunity to more closely examine the Deity by translating theeternal and inscrutable aspects of creation into the familiar time-spacelanguage of Earth's yearly cycle. The next quest was to find the seventy-twonames forming the Great Name.Turning to the Holy Scriptures it was discovered that three consecutive verses(19, 20, 21) of chapter 14 of Exodus each contained exactly seventy-two letters.All that needed to be done was to Qabalistically play with these three versesuntil they yielded the 72 Holy Names.It should be pointed out that these three verses are among the most significantand memorable of the entire Bible. Not only did they make Charlton Heston animmortal icon of American cinema, they narrate the story of a massive display ofthe Hebrew God's power manifested on Earth.Verse 19:images [../images/00292.jpeg]And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behindthem; and the pillar of the cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.2[part0020.html#gls_ft2]Verse 20:images [../images/00293.jpeg]And it came between the army of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it wascloudy and dark all the night, but it gave light all the night to the childrenof Israel, so that they could not draw near one to another all the night.Verse 21:images [../images/00294.jpeg]And Moses lifted up his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to goback by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land, and thewaters were divided.They then arranged the three verses in three lines. Verse 19 on top (writtenfrom right to left); verse 20 directly beneath verse 19 (written from left toright); and verse 21 on the bottom (written from right to left). The seventy-twothree-lettered names of God were then revealed in the seventy-two columns formedby this arrangement.SUPERNAL TRIAD—Kether-Chokmah-Binah: The three Sephiroth existing above theAbyss. Even though each of the three Sephiroth stand as separate emanations,they really comprise a trinity, each reflecting a different aspect of theSupreme Monad (Kether).TEMURA: General term for an assortment of cryptographic methods whereby oneletter is substituted for another. See AIQ BKRTIPHARETH—Beauty: The Sixth Sephirah on the Tree Life; Shemesh—The Sphere of theSun; Divine Name (in Atziluth): ‘YHVH Eloah va-Daath (Lord God of Knowledge);Archangel (in Briah): Raphael (God has healed); Angelic Choir (in Yetzirah): TheMelekim (Kings); Angel (in Yetzirah): Michael; Intelligence (in Assiah):Nakhiel; Spirit (in Assiah): Sorath.TREE OF LIFE—Etz ha-Chayim: Schematic representation of the fundamentalstatement of the Sepher Yetzirah, which states (using Rabbi Ben Clifford'stranslation) “Deity…created the Universe (with the help of three imaginaryfriends, ‘Numbers, Letters, and Words’) in 32 mysterious paths of wisdom. Theyconsist of 10 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.” The Tree of Life isusually represented as 10 circular emanations (Sephiroth) and 22 paths to whichthe letters of the Hebrew alphabet are attributed.YETZIRAH—The Formative World: The second of the four Qabalistic Worlds;corresponds to the Vau of the Tetragrammaton; the element Air; and the suit ofSwords in the tarot. In Yetzirah, the universal organization of Briah becomesspecific, and a hierarchy of Angels with individual duties is established. Thisworld is the Mind and the Mind's Eye of the Deity. Yetzirah's corresponding partin the human Soul is Ruach—Intellect.YESOD—Foundation: The Ninth Sephirah on the Tree of Life; Labanah—The Sphere ofthe Moon; Divine Name (in Atziluth): Shaddai El Chai (Almighty Living God);Archangel (in Briah): Gabriel (God is my strength); Angelic Choir (in Yetzirah):The Kerubim (who intercede); Angel (in Yetzirah): Also Gabriel (go figure);Intelligence (in Assiah): Malka be-Tarshishim ve-ad be-Ruah Shehaqim; Spirit (inAssiah): Chasmodai."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYBischoff, Dr. Erich.
