Magick is something you are!~Donald Michael Kraig 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2.xhtml#footnote-002]Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity withwill.~Aleister Crowley 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2.xhtml#footnote-001]I was an eighteen-year-old atheist when my passion for all things magical andmystical was born out of a psychedelically triggered epiphany ofself-realization. In a timeless slit of eternity I saw (in blinding Technicolorcertainty) that all things in the cosmos—light, time, space, energy, matter,motion, and my own self—were merely cascading fractals of a supreme and awesomesingularity of consciousness; furthermore, I giddily surrendered to the most“Self”-evident of self-evident Truths that this supreme singularity ofconsciousness was God and myself.In the days and weeks that followed that curious awakening, I combed the stacksof my college library for books on Zen, yoga, and other varieties of Easternmysticism, hoping to find in classical literature other examples and parallelsto my chemically induced experience. I soon found the works of Alan Watts,Paramahansa Yogananda, and a wide selection of other material to capture myattention. My timing for such a quest could not have been more culturallysynchronistic. The pop world of the mid-1960s viewed such esoteric studies andpractices as being where it’s at, hip, socially aware, and sexy. Oh, I was goingto look so cool losing my ego!For the next ten years or so, I made a real effort to become a good yogi (Itruly don’t regret a moment of mantra chanting, fasting, and pranayama), buteventually I came to the realization that I was fundamentally hardwireddifferently than the Eastern mystic I was trying to emulate. I was objectiverather than subjective, active rather than passive. I began to seek out somesort of Western system of consciousness expansion and self-transformation. WhatI eventually found was Qabalah and six thousand years of philosophies, spiritualpractices, arts, sciences, and mythologies that lie at the heart of Westernphilosophy and religion; indeed, it forms the foundation of Western civilizationitself. I found “Magick.”Even under the best of circumstances ceremonial magick is an awkward anddifficult study, especially at the beginning. There is no such thing as “Magick101.” It seems that wherever one chooses to begin, one should already befamiliar with (or have mastery of ) a half dozen obscure and esoteric subjectsabout which one is woefully undereducated. Fledgling magicians are forced todive into the deep side of the pool and sink or swim. Looking back, I’m not surewhy I didn’t drown in the murky waters of the magical swimming pool. Perhaps Iwas too lazy to get out of the water.One thing is for certain: at the beginning of my magical career, things wouldhave gone dramatically smoother had I a textbook like Llewellyn’s Complete Bookof Ceremonial Magick—a single volume I could turn to to get a primary esotericeducation in the most important subjects I needed to learn in order to properlyprepare myself for postgraduate work. Such a tool would have shaved years off mymagical learning curve.I admit, I am the laziest man in the world, and even though I have written anumber of books and songs and been involved in one way or another in numerousother publishing efforts, each time a project is presented to me I have to bedragged kicking and screaming into the process. When my friends at Llewellynapproached me about a massive project called the Complete Book of CeremonialMagick, my initial response was, “It sounds like too much work!”I think they thought I was joking. When pressed why I was reluctant to come onboard, I responded by saying something like this:It would mean … first trying to contact a score of the most celebrated magicalscholars and practitioners in the world and convince them to drop whatever it isthey are doing and write the equivalent of a small masterpiece of a book thatwould encapsulate and illuminate the essence of an essential aspect of thescience and art of ceremonial magick. Even if we could get these cloisteredesoteric superstars to agree, they are all geniuses! Do you know how hard it canbe to work with even one genius? Can you imagine trying to work with a coupledozen geniuses at once? This thing will probably drag on for years as we gatherup and edit. No! It sounds like too much work!Obviously, I changed my mind.The project’s profound and historical potential (and my own sense ofresponsibility to future generations) won out over my inherent slothful nature.Much to my surprise, I found it far easier than I expected to personally contactand secure the goodwill and participation of the brightest stars of thetwenty-first century’s magical firmament. Each was remarkably gracious andenthusiastic. Furthermore, the gods smiled and inspired each of our contributorsto create for us real mini-masterpieces … some of the best work of theircareers—true examples of magical genius. And that is the real magick of theComplete Book of Ceremonial Magick.I would especially like to draw the reader’s attention to the epilogue of thiswork, The Future of Ceremonial Magick by Brandy Williams. It will be apparent tothe reader that the format Brandy is offering is different from that of theother sections. It is a true prophetic document and a breathtaking example ofthe visionary inner eye of a true magician. The reader is urged to read it in ameditative state.A Special Thank YouAs I’ve confessed, I am the laziest man in the world. The editorial labornecessary for a work of this scope is monumental and far beyond my skill orcapacity to shoulder alone. This work would never have seen the light of daywithout the herculean efforts of my friend and co-editor, Dr. David Shoemaker(who is also the author of Book Nine[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173] of this work). Thankyou, Dr. Shoemaker, and let’s hope our next project is a bit easier.—Lon Milo DuQuette[image/ChapterOrnament1.png]Never let your love of Clarity overtake your lust for Mystery.~Bill Nelson, musician/magicianAs a young doctoral student in clinical psychology, I found myself frustrated bythe status quoof the available training in clinical theory and practice. The emphasis inclinical psychology over the past several decades has been on empiricallyvalidated clinical approaches, favoring easily researchable modalities over themore traditional (but unfashionable) “depth” psychology of Freud, Jung, andothers. This was a needed corrective to the occasionally slack critical thinkingevident in the earlier approaches, but it limited the light of investigation toonly one corner of the human experience. In this intellectual climate, I foundmyself seeking a psychological worldview that would satisfy my curiosity aboutthe deeper mysteries of human consciousness. This quickly led me to the work ofCarl Jung, and I soon realized that I was not only seeking a foundation of mypsychological approach, I was seeking a renewal of my spiritual life. Themystery I was lusting after would not be discovered in any book or in anytheory, but only in my own personal approach to the divine. I soon found thework of Israel Regardie in the form of The Middle Pillar,3[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2.xhtml#footnote-000] which introduced me toQabalistic psychology and the writings of Aleister Crowley. When I finallydelved into Crowley’s writings, I knew I’d found my path.In most of life, it is only occasionally that we meet an individual who trulyshines with Self-hood, whose very presence is a lesson in a certain way of beingand of living. When I began attending events presented by various magicalorders, I found that these organizations were absolutely filled to the brim withsuch people!—and I am so very pleased and honored to say that the contributorsto this volume are among the best and the brightest of these brilliantindividuals. It has been a true delight to read and edit this collection and tohear the unique voices of the various authors discussing their respective areasof specialty with such clarity and passion.In assembling this volume, we considered the diverse array of philosophies,spiritual traditions, and ritual styles that might reasonably fall within theconceptual net known as ceremonial magick. In each book of this volume, we willfeature a different tradition, highlighting the key concepts, philosophicalunderpinnings, and ritual approaches that constitute its unique contribution tothe field of magick. Text boxes in each book will give more detail aboutimportant historical figures or submovements relevant to the tradition. Thesequence of books is roughly chronological, to aid the reader’s ability to tracethe evolution of magick across cultures and over the course of millennia.Furthermore, as many traditions built on the foundations of earlier doctrinesand practices, approaching the work chronologically more clearly traces theinfluences each body of work exerted on the others. As one might expect, we wereinevitably forced to explore some traditions in more detail and others only inpassing. We encourage the reader not to assume that this represents doctrinalbias on the part of the editors but rather the limitations of the space andscope of this volume.The very worthwhile price to pay when assembling a volume of this diversity andmagnitude is that the unique viewpoints of the various authors may sometimescontradict each other. We made an editorial decision to embrace thesedifferences as an inevitable, positive result of bringing together a group ofsuch devoted and learned specialists rather than attempting to impose auniformity of doctrine and interpretation that, in fact, is not actually there.Accordingly, we invite the reader to approach this volume with critical thinkingskills fully engaged, and to let the interplay of views enrich your research asyou come to your own conclusions. In a similar vein, we have made no attempt tostandardize the spelling or usage of the technical terms and concepts thatappear throughout this volume. As they say, reasonable people may disagree onsuch things, and the various traditions represented here often have their ownunique usages as well.To my good friend, co-editor, and brother in the Great Work, Lon Milo DuQuette(who, judging by his prolific career of writing, speaking, teaching, and makingmusic, isn’t as lazy as he thinks): Thank you for sharing the very magical taskof compiling and editing this work. It has been a challenging but extremelyfulfilling journey, and I share your hope that generations to come may benefitfrom what we’ve assembled here.And finally, to the reader: May you discover the eternal light of Magick withinyourself, and bring that light to bear on your path, finding much joy andfulfillment in every step.—David Shoemaker1 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2.xhtml#footnote-002-backlink].

The practices and traditionsdiscussed in the volume in your hand call themselves forms of ceremonial magickbecause of this. Agrippa created a critical compendium of magical lore thatstill enriches our practice to this day, but much of this lore was notconsidered magic by those who practiced it.Scholars from Lynn Thorndike to Ronald Hutton have suggested there is acontinuity in the development of Western ritual magic from ancient times tomodern.4 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-064] As a body, thisstream of practice has been termed the Western Mystery Tradition, or morerecently the Western esoteric tradition.5[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-063] So much will have to belightly touched upon here due to the limits of space, but those parts thatbecome our magic will be the focus.What Is Magic?Before we can undertake a history of Western magic—particularly if the historyis to be a short one—we need to have some idea about what we do and do not meanby the word. 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-062] Yet aprecise definition is not easy to fashion.Magic is thought of by many as being in opposition to religion. Magic is oftendefined as the manipulation of spiritual forces for specific, usually materialends, while religion is said to focus on worship and general supplication forhelp. This is a popular distinction, but counterexamples are not hard to find.We regard the animal sacrifices of the ancient Greeks to be religious, notmagical—and yet the ancient Greeks always expected an answer. Even today, anyoneattending a Catholic mass or Protestant service will note the specificity ofpetitional prayer.Others define the difference between religion and magic as the differencebetween the legitimate and the illegitimate use of spiritual resources,withmagic of course constituting the illegitimate. And indeed, every culturedistinguishes between common acts of piety and esoteric or forbidden magic—butunfortunately for our purposes, these dividing lines are drawn very differentlyfrom one culture to another. The same magical square that a magician in Londonmight formulate in private to attract celestial forces, a Hindu shopkeeper inNew Delhi will hang openly behind the cash register to attract the blessing ofthe gods and good fortune.Moreover, many practices have been thought of as magic at one time in historyand yet not at another. For example, both Agrippa in 1500 and the Golden Dawn in1900 used the term magic to describe their practices, while Iamblichus, who in300 was at the root of these same practices, did not. Particularly for ancientpeoples, these practices were not regarded as magic but simply as a part oftheir religion—the operational part.Once we remove the cultural framework around the words religion and magic, noobjective differences remain. This realization will guide our exploration of theancient forms of magic, and we may see them as entirely a part of theirreligious framework while no less means of accomplishing ends.And so, what is magic? In my view, magic is religious action or operativereligion. It is any use of religious or spiritual resources to achieve a result,whether that result is spiritual or material. To put it flatly, magic is notseparate from religion in any meaningful sense; rather, it is part of religion,specifically that part that seeks an outcome.Equipped with this definition, we can now look at the ancient sources that arethe foundations of Western ceremonial magic. The history that follows is asummary of a long journey, one whose beginnings are older than history itself,that takes us through the ancient cultures that contributed to our understandingof those practices we now call magic.We’ll look into the depth of time and consider the limited information ourforebears had of the Bronze Age. The path becomes easier for us to follow as weenter the Iron Age, and from there we can trace the philosophical traditionthrough more than a thousand years of development, culminating in the practiceof theurgy as developed and taught by Iamblichus of Chalcis around 300 BCE.The tradition was interrupted by the rapid rise and domination of Christianityand the fall of the Roman Empire, but from about 500 on, we can again track thedevelopment of magical theory and practice through the Middle Ages and the earlyRenaissance. At last, this short history will bring us to the dawn of the modernera, when in 1510 Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa wrote his Three Books of OccultPhilosophy, a scholarly compendium of magical lore that still influences andenriches our practice to this day.Discussing aspects of this history in more depth and continuing the journey tothe present day is the work of the rest of this volume. Later books coverplanetary magick; the influence of the Kabbalah of the Jews, the Cabala of theChristians, and the Qabalah of the hermeticists; the grimoire traditions and theEnochian magick of John Dee; alchemy; the Abra-Melin system; and influentialorders such as the Rosicrucians and Freemasons, and later the Golden Dawn, theOrdo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), and the A[image/6.jpg]A[image/6.jpg]. In thefinal chapter, after this long journey, ceremonial magic is returned to itspolytheistic roots.Deep Time and the Bronze AgeModern humans, of the species Homo sapiens sapiens, have been around for perhaps300,000 years. The deep past, of course, always casts a subtle influence on thepresent, but only in the last few hundred years have we begun to possess realinformation about ancient cultures. Not until 1822, for example, was the ancientEgyptian language translated; the translation of Sumerian was only beginning in1838.When we look at the deep ancient world, then, we have to remember that untilrelatively recently we had only a dim and often erroneous idea about ourinheritance. Our old ideas about the origins of the Western magical traditionwere mostly projections based on whatever architecture, artifacts, and otherfragments of the past had survived into the Iron Age. Even these scatteredpieces had often themselves been changed along the way, transformed by ancientpeoples before being written down and delivered to us in the form of myths,legends, and scriptures.A variety of scientific developments, however, have increased our skill atreconstructing the past. We have better indications now of what humans weredoing as deep as 33,000 BCE, when the Red Lady of Paviland was buried in what isnow Britain. The body, which was covered in red ocher, was buried with seashellnecklaces and rings and rods carved from the ivory of a mammoth’s tusk. When theRed Lady was unearthed in 1823, scientists speculated that “she” was aprostitute from the time of the Roman Empire; only since the 1960s has analysisrevealed that the skeleton is male and dates from tens of thousands of yearsearlier. The ocher and the adornments must have had some symbolic meaning andprobably indicate some form of ritual activity. The Red Lady is now thought tobe the oldest known ceremonial burial in Europe. These ancient cultures,however, are mostly cut off from us by the last ice age, which ended about12,000 years ago.The stone circles of Europe were once thought to have been erected by theancient Druids, who were contemporary with the ancient Romans. We now know thatthese were actually built by much older cultures beginning in about 3300 BCE.Even earlier are chamber tombs and cairns, which we can date to 4000 BCE at thelatest, in the early Neolithic period. Long before these is the Göbekli Tepe inwhat is now Turkey, built in about 11,000 BCE by people who had not yetdeveloped agriculture.The historical record changes dramatically after a period of decline anddestruction that began about 1200 BCE. Within about a half-century, most of thegreat cultures of the Western world at that time—including the Egyptian,Hittite, Minoan, Assyrian, Babylonian, and Mycenaean cultures—either collapsedor were significantly diminished. During this period, almost every importantcity on the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea was destroyed; many of themwere never occupied again. Historians still debate the causes—drought, warfare,widespread piracy, and the failure of rigid political systems to adapt to changeare all possible contributors—but in any case, this collapse marked the end ofthe Bronze Age.Here is where our story can really begin.When the Lights Come on Again: The Iron Age and the Ancient WorldWe can trace the origins of our modern practices all the way back to about 900BCE, to the culture that arose as humanity began to recover from the Bronze Agecollapse. What survives from this prehistoric world is mostly Greek and Roman,along with some Hebrew elements. It was through the lenses of these greatcultures that the still more ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures wereunderstood.This final period of prehistory, the Iron Age, was first named by the ancientGreek poet Hesiod in his poem Theogony. For Hesiod, the Iron Age was the thirdand most brutal of the mythic ages during which the gods had their origins.Together, the epic poems of Hesiod and Homer formed the cosmic narrative thatbecame the basis for Mediterranean culture. Beginning with the conquests ofAlexander the Great starting around 325 BCE, the swell of great empires spreadthese myths and legends broadly.What comes forward from this ancient period are streams of knowledge andpractice: philosophy, myth, spellcraft, fragments of worship practices, and bitsof early science and math. Much of this lore would be hidden and inactive untilthe Renaissance, except for such pieces as were later absorbed andpreserved—though in distorted forms—by the Church.The line between the Iron Age and the beginnings of written history is notsharply defined. It was around this time that philosophy had its beginnings inattempts to find a rational basis for understanding and interpreting the ancientpoetic myths. But it wasn’t long before philosophers expanded their horizons andwere trying to explain the whole world without reference to the literarytraditions. We call these ancient philosophers the pre-Socratics, and thefirst—at least of those whose names and works have survived—was Thales (c.624–546 BCE), who told us “all things are full of gods” and began organizing thediscipline of geometry.Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE), who is credited with coining the term philosophy,created a community of followers that long outlasted him. He taught usinggeometric proofs, and he required discipline and contemplation from hisstudents. His contributions ranged from theories of musical harmonics topractices for the attainment of a good life. The doctrine of ethicalreincarnation is attributed to him, as well as a number of mathematicaltheorems.Our image of a holy man or sage comes, in part, from the mystic philosopher andhealer Empedocles of Sicily (495–444 BCE). Empedocles was said to go aboutwearing elaborate purple robes, a crown, and golden sandals. This sartorialsplendor was criticized by some in his own day as being eccentric and overdone,but it was the common garb of priestfolk during worship.Empedocles claimed to remember other lives and to know that he was a divinebeing incarnate on earth. In his great cosmogonic poem On Nature, he wrote thatthe conflict between two divine forces, Strife and Love, was the dynamic thatpropels all action. In this poem, he also gave us the first Western presentationof the four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, which he called “roots.” Hetook his leave of life (or at least of Sicily) by jumping into a volcano,leaving his sandals on the edge of the crater.Socrates (470–399 BCE) was a stonecutter in Athens whose method of teaching wasnot to profess to know but only to ask. We have no writings of his, only whatPlato, Xenophon, and a few other contemporaries wrote about him, and it may bethat the Socrates we meet in Plato’s dialogues is more of a literary constructthan an accurate portrait. Socrates was noted for his unusual method ofteaching, which consisted of asking a series of questions, and for his ethicalvirtues, which ultimately brought him into conflict with the leadership ofAthens and led to his trial and his death by hemlock.For magical practitioners, it is important to note that Socrates claimed to beguided by his personal daemon, mostly by being told what not to do. Scholarsstruggle with this, but the descriptions that we have make it clear he wasdealing with the same phenomenon we know today as the Holy Guardian Angel.Little is known about Diotima of Mantinea, but it is important that weacknowledge her as the one whom Socrates referred to as his teacher, accordingto Plato’s Symposium. She introduced Socrates to the notion of divine ascentthrough beauty and love, starting with the particular love, as of an individual,and slowly learning to generalize and abstract that love until one can perceiveand unite with the Good and Beautiful that are the Source of Being. Diotima’steachings illustrate why understanding ancient philosophy is vital to us.Philosophy was the theology of its time, and it provides the theoreticalunderpinnings for magical practice today.Philosophical development in the West comes to a head with Plato (c. 428–347BCE). Plato was the founder of the first institution of higher learning in theWestern world, and while he was not the first to be called a philosopher, hisformulation of the discipline is so influential that in the West he can beconsidered philosophy’s inventor. Plato’s dialogues summarize the thought ofmany thinkers before him, and in many cases it is only through Plato that weknow of them at all. Importantly, Plato’s work was preserved (though it was lostto the West from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance), and it came to form thebasis for all philosophy and theory of magic thereafter.Yet to Plato himself, the written word was not the most important part of histeachings. In the dialogue Phaedrus, he wrote that “he who has knowledge of thejust and the good and beautiful … will not, when in earnest, write them in ink,sowing them through a pen with words which cannot defend themselves by argumentand cannot teach the truth effectually.” The unwritten doctrines that expressedPlato’s true understanding were to be conveyed by the spoken word.Plato’s philosophy developed in two major phases after his life. The first wecall Middle Platonism, and it starts with Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 125–68 BCE),who rejected the hard skepticism of his teachers at the Third Academy, whodenied humans the ability to know the absolute.Plutarch (c. 45–120) is the preeminent writer of Middle Platonism. He alsorejected the strict determinism of the Stoics and asserted the freedom of thewill. He disagreed with the Epicureans and declared the soul immortal. ForPlutarch, matter, although transformed by the Creator into the World Soul, wasnonetheless the source of all evil. For him, the Supreme Being wastranscendental to the world, yet worked within the world through the gods anddaemons of popular religion.In the Roman Empire at this time, participation in politics was limited by theimperial system to a small portion of elite society. For the leisured classesand anyone else who had an education, philosophy and religion had become venuesfor self-expression and advancement. This was an era that saw the writing of theCorpus Hermeticum, the Sepher Yetzirah, the Chaldean Oracles, the Gnostica, andthe Gospels.Neoplatonism, which emerged in the third century, is the name we give to thenext phase of development in Platonic thought. Eventually, Neoplatonism splitinto two branches, one purely philosophical and the other theurgic andritualizing. It is from this theurgic branch that the Western magical traditionsprings, specifically “learned” magic.When Plotinus (204–270) arrived in Alexandria to study philosophy, he despairedof finding what he sought until he was pointed to Ammonius Sakkas (datesunknown), who held the chair of philosophy at Alexandria. On returning to Rome,Plotinus taught his own vision of Platonic philosophy. The teachings of Plotinusbear some striking similarities to Vedantic thought, and recent scholarshipsuggests that his teacher’s family may have come to Alexandria from northernIndia. Plotinus’s cosmology and ideas about the soul were the origin of theconcepts that magic users today have about the world and ourselves.Plotinus gave us a relatively simple fourfold cosmological model that wasdebated and elaborated upon by his successors but that would be familiar to anyQabalist. It consists of a hierarchy of four hypostases, or entitativestabilizations. The highest realm is that of the Creator and source of being,called to hen, the One. Next highest is the realm of nous, the intelligiblemind, the domain of whatever can be apprehended only with the nondiscursivemind. Below that is the realm of psyche, the soul. The soul is perhaps mostsimply understood as that which leaves the body upon death, but here itconstitutes an entire living cosmic domain and underpinning of the materialworld. This realm is the natural place of the gods of myth and culture in thissystem. The lowest realm is that of hyle, matter, which consists of the entirephysical cosmos out to and including the eighth sphere of the fixed stars.Plotinus’s cosmology assumed that this fourfold cosmos is of similar characterto the humans in it. The entitative unity of a human comes from the presence ofthe One in us. As Plotinus expressed it in his last words, “Strive to give backthe One in yourself to the One in the All.” The nous in humans, corresponding tothe nous in the cosmos, is our intelligence. Yet in a real sense what arepresent in us are merely the participating images of the real One and the realnous, just enough to give us these qualities of unity and mind. Where we reallybegin is at the level of the psyche, or soul, which lives in the material worldof hyle, in, on, or permeating the body.We have Plotinus’s thought because his lecture notes and essays were compiledand edited by one of his students, Porphyry of Tyre (c. 234–305). We arefortunate that Porphyry was an excellent writer, as is shown by his other workssuch as On Abstinence from Animal Food, Aids to the Study of the Intelligibles,and Philosophy from Oracles, which gives us parts of the Chaldean Oracles. Thepopularity of his Against the Christians can be inferred from the fact that theRoman emperor Theodosius II ordered the burning of every copy in 435—and thenhad to repeat the order in 448.Porphyry’s work was important to science, as his writing on the Aristoteliancategories became the basis for biological taxonomies. But it is his Letter toAnebo that is important to Western magic. There are competing theories as towhat this letter is really about, but in it Porphyry critiqued the modes ofworship of the day and raised the idea—which Christians would later adopt—thatthe recipients of burnt and bloody sacrifice were demons and not gods.Most scholars think that Porphyry’s critique was literal and sincere. Many ofhis views in this letter, however, are contradicted by his later writings, whichhas led some to suggest that this text should be regarded as an example of“disputations and solutions,” a common mode at the time for discussingphilosophical topics, in which the author listed all the debates on a subjectand then systematically answered each one.We have the Letter to Anebo at all only because it is part of a work byPorphyry’s own student, Iamblichus (c. 240–325).7[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-061] Iamblichus was born inthe town of Chalcis in northern Syria. He lived and taught in the Syrian city ofApamea, where the Chaldean Oracles are said to have been written and kept. Onlya small portion of Iamblichus’s books have survived. He is known todayprincipally because later writers wrote about him, sometimes quoting passagesfrom his works. In this way we have fragments from two commentaries on Platonicdialogues and from his work On the Soul. We also know about other works of histhat are completely lost, including one on the Chaldean Oracles, with at leasttwenty-eight chapters.One exception to this sad loss is the work generally referred to as Demysteriis, or On the Mysteries. This, Iamblichus’s longest-surviving work, isproperly titled The Reply of the Master Abamon to the Letter of Porphyry toAnebo, and the Solutions to the Questions It Contains. In this work, Iamblichusdefends theurgy, which is advanced polytheistic practice, and he presents arationale for cultic worship of heroes, spirits, archons, angels, and gods,leading eventually to union with the One that is All. It also explains the useof divination, divinization through divine possession, the art of sacrifice, andother allied practices generally termed magic today. Importantly, Iamblichusgives us the pedagogy that provides the skills needed to do all this and thatunderlie all magical practice. This work, like the rest of Iamblichus’s writingsand teachings, integrated worship and philosophy in a way that had not been seenbefore but which came to dominate Neoplatonic philosophy in the ancient world.The last major philosopher of the ancient world whom we have space to cover isProclus (412–485), who was the head of the later Athenian Platonic Academy. Manyof the ideas that were first exposited by Iamblichus were developed—andsometimes criticized—a few generations later by this important thinker.8[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-060] We have also been blessedby a collection of Proclus’s hymns which show us an implementation of theurgicpractice in verse.9 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-059]We are fortunate to have some of Proclus’s longer works, such as PlatonicTheology and The Elements of Theology, all of which had a profound influenceduring the Renaissance when they were translated and became available to Europe.Most precious to us is Brian Copenhaver’s 1988 translation of “On the PriestlyArt According to the Greeks,” as this is one of the very few explicit writingson the actual practice of theurgy.10[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-058] Copenhaver speculatesthat this text is a précis, culled by a Byzantine philosopher, of a larger workby Proclus. The text is especially important due to its influence on Ficino, andit figures prominently in his Three Books on Life. It explains the power andubiquity of prayer and explains the use and theory behind what we call todaycorrespondences.11 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-057]The excessive prevalence of men in this story is partly an artifact of the wayhistory was written. Even if there is little information about them, we mustremember Diotima of Mantinea, Socrates’s teacher mentioned previously; Sosipatraof Ephesus (c. 325), mystic and teacher of philosophy; and Hypatia of Alexandra(c. 350–415), teacher, astronomer, and mathematician. Joan Breton Connelly’swork shows the importance of women in the religious culture of the ancientworld, mostly lost to us because the women did not write.12[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-056]Maximus the ThaumaturgeMaximus of Ephesus (c. 310–372) was a Neoplatonist philosopher, theurgist, andmage who studied at the school of Iamblichus’s greatest pupil, Aedesius,alongside the famous sage Eusebius. Maximus became the most influential teacherof the future emperor Julian, who would attempt to reestablish classicalpaganism in the Roman Empire. Eusebius tried to warn Julian off becomingMaximus’s pupil on account of his penchant for sorcery, relating an occasionwhen Maximus invited him and others to the temple of Hecate. There he salutedthe statue of the goddess and told his audience that they would soon be witnessto his lofty genius. He then burned a grain of incense while muttering anincantation, whereupon the statue of the goddess seemed to smile before burstingout laughing. Urging his audience not be afraid, he warned them that the stonetorches in her hands would shortly burst into flame, which they immediately did.Eusebius advised Julian that such theatrical sorcery merely tricked the senses,insisting that the purification of the soul is of primary importance, and thatwas to be achieved by reason alone, which was the position of Plotinus ratherthan Iamblichus.Julian nevertheless headed straight to Ephesus, where Maximus taught himIamblichan theurgy, which was based primarily on the Chaldean Oracles and themagical religious rites that he had inherited as a son of the last solarpriest-king of Emesa. Animal sacrifice and divination were central rituals. Onassuming the throne, Julian attempted to establish a cult of Helios the Sun, asthe supreme deity of Creation.Eunapius, the Greek historian from whom we derive most of our knowledge ofMaximus, met the great wizard in person, and gives us perhaps the bestdescription of a pagan magus of late antiquity that has come down to us:While still a youth [I] met him in his old age and heard his voice, which wassuch as one might have heard from Homer’s Athene or Apollo. The very pupils ofhis eyes were, so to speak, winged; he had a long grey beard, and his glancerevealed the agile impulses of his soul. There was a wonderful harmony in hisperson, both to the eye and ear, and all who conversed with him were amazed asto both these faculties, since one could hardly endure the swift movements ofhis eyes or his rapid flow of words. In discussion with him no one ventured tocontradict him, not even the most experienced and most eloquent, but theyyielded to him in silence and acquiesced in what he said as though it came fromthe tripod of an oracle; such a charm sat on his lips.*Eunapius also recounts an episode in which the great philosopher and mysticSosipatra was bewitched by a relative who had fallen in love with her. Maximusdetected the spell and was able to counter it with a spell of his own. After thedeath of Julian just two years into his reign, Maximus was arrested andeventually executed.—Guy OgilvyGuy Ogilvy has been a practising spagyrist and student of the Western esoterictradition for many years. He has written several books on esoteric subjectsunder various names, including his latest, The Great Wizards of Antiquity(Llewellyn, 2019), the first of a trilogy on the history of magic and alchemy inthe West. He has appeared on several television networks in Britain, Japan, andthe US to share his expertise on magic and alchemy.* Philostratus and Eunapius, The Lives of the Sophists, trans. Wilmer CaveWright, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1921), 427.Our Theurgic FoundationThe fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century and the dominance ofChristianity thereafter disrupted the development and continuity of this branchof philosophy and religious practice. Some religious and magical technologieswere passed on in spite of the interruption, such as the collection of spellsand recipes called the Kyranides. The Northern peoples and their practices wouldbe absorbed into the hegemonic cultures of the Mediterranean during the earliermedieval period (500–1100), and fared about as well as the Southern peoples.Others survived because they had been translated into Arabic or Hebrew but werelittle known in Christendom for a thousand years until the recovery of magic inthe Renaissance.The Renaissance, however, would see the recovery of ancient magic in a new andvital way we will examine below, but what was central to that recovery was thelast great fluorescence of traditional pre-Christian religion, a profoundsynthesis of religious thought. This synthesis was developed by the ritualizing,theurgic branch of Neoplatonism, and it began with Iamblichus.What is critical about this, and not always recognized, is that this synthesisprovided a complete theory and justification for all traditional ancientworship. It provided for every level of development and education, from theholiday visits of common worshipers, to the temple to ask for boons, to theneeds of cities and states for divine blessings, to the exalted practices of thephilosophers and priestfolk, and even to the completely immaterial mind-onlypractices of the rare and few.What we have of this is most thoroughly presented in Iamblichus’s De mysteriis.Other philosophers such as Proclus and Damascius (c. 458 to after 538) would addto this understanding, but not in such a practical manner as in De mysteriis.It is fair to argue that theurgy is the central pillar of all magical practicein that it is the basic technique for worshiping the gods, attracting theirpresence and power to enable those practices of wonders and transformations wecall magic. Divination, spirit conjuration, and divine possession are allembraced by, and made actionable in, theurgic practice. In this way, Demysteriis is the cornerstone of the entire Western magical tradition. No otherwork provides as strong and thorough a theoretical basis for all the practiceswe call magic today as this one does.Yet never does Iamblichus refer to magaia in De mysteriis. He appears to havethought of the practices not as magic but rather as a kind of advancedreligiosity and deep spirituality.In De mysteriis, Iamblichus, who was in fact a Syrian noble of a priestlyfamily, wrote in the character of an Egyptian priest. With great vigor andeloquence, he answered each of Porphyry’s challenges to worship and spiritualadvancement, and in the process he delineated a justification for worship of thegods as well as for the advanced form of that worship, which is theurgy.Prayer, sacrifice, and divination were the tools used by Iamblichus and thetheurgists. De mysteriis gave a critical analysis of each. Not satisfied withmerely being in the gods’ good graces, the practitioner used sacrifice andprayer to come into a closer relationship with the deity, eventually to thelevel of union.13 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-055]Divination was employed to refine theurgic practice by seeking the deity’sinstructions to improve it.Where philosophy was used to speculate upon the nature of the gods and how toapproach them, divination augmented that understanding with revelation. Then thepractices of sacrifice and prayer actively applied and tested that knowledge,resulting in better communications with the gods.The Iamblichan Paradigm of TheurgyIn Iamblichus’s view, the theurgist lives in a world created by a divinehierarchy that is descended from the One, the supreme and ultimate grand unityof being. The world gets its structure according to the principles of mediation;as a mean is required between all extremes, the hierarchy has many layers, allin keeping with the cosmic strata.These strata are derived from Plotinus: unity, mind, soul, and matter. Thematerial realm, the cosmos, is organized by the classical Ptolemaic cosmology.The earth, along with the four elements, are at the center. This terrestrialrealm is surrounded by the celestial realm, which includes the moon, the sun,and the rest of the planets, and ends with the sphere of the fixed stars.Outside the cosmos, the divine realm begins.The power of creation and divine presence ever flows from the One. It flows downthe hierarchy of divinities and daemons in emanation, prohodos, and it flows inreturn, epistrophe. It is this returning current that the theurgist exploits toascend the hierarchy, eventually back to the One.The deities of worship, myth, and legend are, in philosophical terms, thePlatonic ideas or forms. The deities emanate their essences (their selves) intothe cosmos, giving otherwise formless and insensible matter its distinctcharacteristics. When manifested in material form, these divine ideas are calledwords, or logoi, and so the texture, color, shape, and what we call today thechemical or medical properties of things, as well as all other characteristics,are to the theurgist the literal presence of the deity in the object. Theseanagogic logoi of the gods that can be found in matter are called sunthemata, ortokens, and by contemplating and sacrificing these “wondrous deposits,” thetheurgist becomes herself divinized.14[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-054]Moderns will recognize this as the ancient understanding of correspondences,although that term was not used until after the Renaissance. Proclus, in his Onthe Hieratic Art, explained that the “sympathy of lower things for those above”is the inherence of the logoi of the divine ideas present in objects, prayers,and thought. The logoi are not only the distinguishing characteristics in allthings, they are themselves the divine presence. When Proclus wrote of their“use made in the priestly art,” he explained how and when these things areapplied and their logoi are activated.Proclus wrote that the divine light comes “to what is capable of sharing it,”using the analogy of a warm candlewick that, having been made fit (epitedeiotes)by being warmed, can be lit by a flame that is merely held nearby withouttouching. It is through the performance of the invocation that the theurgist is“warmed” and that the contact with the divine is made. In this analogy, thelighting of the wick represents the “divinization of mortal entities,” and theillumination that results is the approaching of the divine. Proclus citesChaldean Oracle, fr. 121: “For the mortal who has approached the fire willpossess the light from God.” 15[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-053]The human theurgist is a microcosm of the larger world. Within her constitutionis the One in the soul, the manifestation of the One in the individual thatgrants unity and individuality. She also possess nous, or nondiscursive mind,which resides above and complements her discursive mind, dianoia, for it is nousthat is able to experience the logoi directly. Most properly, her rank is thatof a soul, and from the mean between nous and hyle she takes her own properplace in the divine hierarchy, albeit as its least member.The theurgist’s soul, like those of all humans, is imbued with the divine logoi.The gods, who are the source of the logoi, are present to her and within her aspart of her very constitution. She shares in the composite life of the body andis constrained by its lawful needs, and yet with the help of the gods she isable to free herself from the body, its limits, and its passions, and ultimatelyto attain the rank of the angels and coadminister the cosmos.Bridging the gap between the material body and the incorporeal soul is theaetheric and/or pneumatic vehicle, called the augoeides soma or ochema, theegg-like body or vehicle.16[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-052] Once purified, thisvehicle becomes the tool for the ascent to the creative cause and the screen onwhich “blessed visions” arise as the gods communicate to the theurgist.Theurgy is an advanced religious practice, and so the would-be theurgist must beprepared. At the beginning, she undergoes a time of study. She learns of theworld from Aristotle, and she learns of higher things from the Platonicdialogues (including their copious commentaries), the Corpus Hermeticum (inwhatever form it existed in Iamblichus’s time), the Chaldean Oracles,Pythagorean mathematics, and other supportive works. Parallel to this was thecultivation of virtue, moderation, and piety in all actions. Supporting all thiswas her lifelong practice of ordinary, traditional worship and cult.The theurgist is then to practice devotion, making sacrifice and spending longhours in invocation. First, she will be illuminated by the gods as she comes toknow them firsthand, and she will be purified by their sunthemata, which areactivated by their presence in offerings. Later, she will become united withtheir will, and she will join in their projects. Eventually, she will be joinedto the gods in ineffable union, theosis.As part of her approach to the divine, she invokes and makes offering to eachand every daemon, angel, and archangel. First, she worships the terrestrial godsof her culture and of the places around her. This is the first step up thehierarchy of divine beings, which proceeds up through the celestial realm to thenoeric (soul) gods, to the noetic (mind) gods, and finally to the henadic realmof the many gods that are one.When she is able to stand on the firm foundation given by the terrestrial gods,she next worships the sun and practices photogogia, light-guiding, fillingherself with divine fire. From the sun, she asks to know and converse with thepersonal daemon, called today the Holy Guardian Angel, who was given her by thedemiurge at her creation and who will guide her on her theurgic path. One afteranother, she invokes the gods until she comes to know them all and awakens theirlogoi within her, uniting herself to the cosmos and eventually leading her up tounion with the One, henosis.As she advances along this path, her sacrifices become less material. Shegradually dispenses with “bodies,” or material offerings, as she moves tosymbols, word images, and actions. Eventually, as her epitedeiotes, or“fitness,” to receive the gods improves, she dispenses with symbols as well,making purely immaterial offerings.As the divine union becomes more pure and stabilized, as her will becomes moreunited with the gods, the theurgist’s actions become those of demiurgic mimesis,imitating the Creator as she fulfills her purpose, continuing creation so thatthe promise of the Timaeus (41b–c) is fulfilled, that the cosmos be complete orelse be imperfect.Notably, there are no voces magicae, what we call barbarous tongues, listed aspart of this preparation. Nor are there any arcane practices, strange symbols,and the like. There are places for these things in theurgy, and if the theurgistis trained in the use of these tools, or if she is an initiate of such mysteriesas provide them, they will provide divinely empowered access or activity. But,though they may be helpful, they are not necessary.In essence, theurgy was for the most part performed simply by participating inordinary cultic activities. These activities were performed, however, with theunderstanding and intention of being moved by the activated sunthemata along thepath to greater intimacy with the gods. By taking what we might call the“theurgic view,” the theurgist makes her participation in all religiousactivity—even that from outside her own culture—serve her theurgic advancementand attainment. This is key to understanding the practices of Agrippa’s occultphilosophy and, later, those of the Golden Dawn.17[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-051]The Medieval AgeWith the fall of the Roman Empire in the West, reckoned from about 500 CE, a newera dawned. This age was profoundly dominated by the Church and Christianity.Never had the West seen a religion that was so militant and aggressive, sodedicated to removing all other spiritualities from its domain.As the Church spread into the lands of the Franks, Germans, and Britons, itworked primarily to convert the local leadership. But there were also thetraditional religious practices of those peoples to be dealt with. Thesepractices were “pagan,” which is to say non-Christian, so the Church could notallow them to continue; yet they were also vibrant and necessary to life, sothey proved impossible to erase. In the interest of easing conversions, however,the Church made accommodations.In spite of the Church’s condemnation, magic was widespread and in use in everystratum of society.18 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-050]This was a time of limited medical knowledge and few life-supportingtechnologies, and magic, in the sense of the use of spiritual resources formaterial ends, was one of the very few recourses available for the stricken.Every European culture had developed its own collection of spells and recipesdesigned to alleviate troubles. After the spread of Christianity, thesecollections were still made and used, but where once they had called on thedeities and spirits of the local cultures, they now called more often on saints,angels, and the Holy Trinity, either in whole or in part.19[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-049]Incantations, amulets, and actions laden with meaning or power were still usedto aid the needful and smite enemies.20[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-048] Divination was still usedto prognosticate or diagnose.21[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-047] But more often than not,a Christian “coat of paint” was added so that the people would redirect theirdevotions to Christian deities and their loyalties to Church authorities. Withina few generations, the “pagan” origins of these practices were a faint memory,and everyone was a baptized Christian.The text of the Kyranides, which contains elements from the Greek magicalpapyri, shows how these ancient spells endured well into the Christian period.22[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-046] Formalized speech,physical objects having natural “occult” properties or consecrated with verbalformula, and images of the afflicted or cursed, usually empowered by invokingChristian spiritual entities, were common.23[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-045] The Church alternatelypromoted and condemned these practices, for it presumed that the powers invokedwere not those of the Christian Trinity or the saints but those of non-Christiandemons.24 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-044] Making the signof the cross or saying the Pater Noster could be acceptable, but because theycould be also deployed for dishonorable purposes such as cursing, they were notentirely encouraged. The blessing of Church-ordained priests, on the other hand,was considered helpful to all magics, and could be requested to empower spellsand amulets. Consecrated eucharists were used by priests in a talismanic fashionto protect and to bless with fertility and good fortune cities, villages,fields, and flocks.25 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-043]Book-derived magic, including the conjuring of spirits and demons, was practicedamong the educated and often mislabeled as necromancy.26[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-042] Yet the usual hallmark oftheurgy, the use of such practices for spiritual advancement, was absent here.Scholars have identified certain texts and practices that can be consideredtheurgy, and some of these were possibly influenced by Iamblichus. ClaireFanger, in the compilation Invoking Angels, outlines the major forms of theurgythat were emerging in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries.27[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-041] This collection ofessays, edited by Fanger, presents a number of Christian texts that show some ofthe characteristics of theurgy we have seen in the Iamblichan paradigm. Thesetexts clearly were used to invoke beings, namely angels, in order to receiveknowledge and experience visions.28[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-040] In the absence ofpolytheism, however, the practice was limited by having only one god to invoke.By the High Middle Ages, 1000–1250, and the dawn of the Renaissance beginningaccording to various opinions as early as the fourteenth or fifteenth century,the religions that the Church worked so diligently to suppress were mostly gone.As for their magics, although the serial numbers were filed off and fresh coatsof paint applied in new colors, much of the same underlying methods were therebut now the new God and his angels and saints were the divine ones invoked.Michael Scott: The Wizard of the NorthMichael Scott (1175–c. 1232) was a multilingual, wandering Scotsman who studiedastrology in Toledo, taught mathematics to Leonardo Fibonacci in Bologna,* andspent some years as court astrologer and scientific advisor to the great HolyRoman Emperor Frederick II, the King of Jerusalem, Germany, Italy, Sicily, andBurgundy. Frederick was a great zoologist, so it’s likely that Scott’stranslation of Aristotle’s nine-volume History of Animals caught his attention.As a member of the famous Toledo School of Translators, he was a colleague ofYehuda ben Moshe, the translator of the infamous Arabic grimoire Picatrix, acompendious handbook of talismanic magic. Scott referred to a book he studied inToledo that contained spirits that, when the book was opened, would cry out,“Say what you want and it shall be done forthwith.” ** Scott was longaccredited, perhaps erroneously, with writing a book on demonic magic owned byAbbot Trithemius, the teacher of Cornelius Agrippa. He certainly wrote works onalchemy, astronomy, physiognomy, and chiromancy, many of which survive, but hissuccess during his lifetime was largely based on his great learning, shrewdintelligence, and ability to perform apparent wonders. Our idea of the classicmedieval wizard may be based chiefly on him. Scott had already earned aformidable reputation as a magus by the time he made an impressive entrance atFrederick’s multicultural court in Sicily, dressed in a pointy hat and flowingrobes cinched at the waist. Frederick is said to have done his best to exposethe wizard’s deception, but when the wily Scott defeated all his best efforts,he asked him to accept a position at court.Scott gained a pernicious reputation as the most feared sorcerer and alchemistin Europe. Dante even found a place for him in his Inferno, specifically in thefourth bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for sorcerers, astrologers,and false prophets.Despite his reputation, he was a well-qualified clergyman and was offered anarchbishopric in Ireland by Pope Honorius III, which he turned down because hisknowledge of Irish Gaelic was limited.Scott became known to history by many titles, including the Wizard of the North,the White Wizard, and the Lost Genius. He is now acknowledged by historians ofscience for his contributions to such subjects as medicine, anatomy,reproduction, and the rare phenomenon of supernumerary rainbows, which heappears to have observed in the Sahara in the company of Tuareg tribesmen.29[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-039] He is celebrated by somestage magicians as a brilliant illusionist and hypnotist who used hisunderstanding of physiognomy for “cold reading” his audience.—Guy Ogilvy* Fibonacci discovered the magical sequence of numbers named after him thatillustrates the fractal nature of the universe. He dedicated his Liber Abaci,which included the sequence, to Scott.** Lynn Thorndike, Michael Scot (London: Nelson, 1965).These centuries were also a time of narrowing choices for the Jewishcommunity.30 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-038] In the1400s, Jews were persecuted in Austria and expelled from Cologne, Augsburg, andmany other cities and districts of Germany.31[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-037] Jews were expelled fromSpain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497. In 1536, the Inquisition waspermanently established in Portugal for the purpose of exposing Jews. The Talmudwas burned in Italy in 1553, Hebrew books were censored by the Church in 1554,and Pope Paul VI ordered the Jews of Rome into a ghetto in 1555.32[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-036]This same period saw the development of the Jewish mystical tradition calledKabbalah,33 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-035] from thefirst appearances of foundational works such as the Bahir and the Zohar in thethirteenth century to the sixteenth-century reinterpretations by Isaac Luria andothers in the Galilean community of Safed, which developed in reaction to theincreasing persecution of the Jews.Kabbalah drew on earlier mystical traditions, including the Merkabah (chariots)and Hekhalot (palaces) schools of mysticism, the mysticism of the SeferYetzirah, based on the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and Neoplatonism with itshierarchy of cosmic realms.Fanger cites both Moshe Idel and Gershom Scholem as presenting significantarguments as to how the various aspects of Jewish practice constitute a kind oftheurgy, both through its attempts at unio mystica, divine vision, and throughits pursuit of practical results.34[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-034] Idel argues that thesimple practice of the commandments, even in the absence of any ritual activity,were also an effective form of theurgy.35[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-033]The RenaissanceThe medieval period is often called the Dark Ages for good reason. So muchknowledge and so many writings had been forgotten or lost with the fall of theRoman Empire and the rise of the Church that little was known or understoodabout the ancient world except for what it suited the Church to preserve. Of theclassical philosophers, only Aristotle was preserved in something approachingcompleteness, and that was largely because his work had been given life in thecontext of the Church by Thomas Aquinas.Out of Plato’s many writings, the West still possessed only one dialogue, theTimaeus, and some small fragments of other works. What little else was known ofPlato came mostly from one book, The Consolation of Philosophy, that becamepopular during the late Middle Ages. This summary of philosophy was written bythe Roman senator and philosopher Boethius in 534 as a way to pass the timewhile awaiting his execution for treason.The rest of Plato’s works, along with the works of Plotinus, Iamblichus, andmany others, had been preserved by the Arabs, who had translated them intoArabic, and by the Byzantine Greeks. But the Roman Catholic Church was at warwith the Islamic World throughout much of the Middle Ages, and the Greek andLatin sides of the Church had been divided ever since the Great Schism of 1054.If these works from the ancient world had remained lost to the West, the Westernmagical tradition might have ended during the Middle Ages. The rebirth of thattradition came about because these texts were rediscovered by the West. And thatrediscovery can be traced back to a meeting in 1438 between Cosimo de’ Mediciand a Greek scholar. At least that’s the popular version of the story.Historians disagree about whether there was ever an actual meeting between thetwo. But the Greek scholar’s influence on Cosimo is certain.This scholar, Georgius Gemistus, was the first person to call himself aHellene—the Greek equivalent of a Pagan—in Christian times. Through his writingand teachings, Gemistus reintroduced Plato to the Western world. Because of hisprofound knowledge of Plato, he was known as Plethon, meaning “like-Plato.” 36[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-032]Many people know about the Medicis, and in particular Cosimo, who was a wealthymerchant and banker, a patron of art and scholarship, and the effective ruler ofFlorence, Italy. Far fewer have heard of Plethon, who came from the Peloponnesein Greece. In 1438 Plethon traveled to Italy, along with a delegation from theEastern Orthodox Church, to attend the Council of Ferrara. The council was oneof several attempts that were made to reconcile the Eastern Orthodox and RomanCatholic Churches. (The council, like all the other attempts, was ultimatelyunsuccessful; the Orthodox and Catholic Churches were unable to resolve theirdifferences and remained divided.)It was in Ferrara that Plethon may have met Cosimo.37[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-031] Neither man was adelegate to the council, but both were among the many great men who attended andwatched from the sidelines. Cosimo was also paying for the event.We can’t be sure that Cosimo and Plethon met in Ferrara, nor in Florence, wherethe council was moved after a year to avoid an outbreak of plague. But popularhistory holds that it was Plethon who inspired Cosimo to seek out and acquirecritical Platonic and Neoplatonic texts, the Corpus Hermeticum, the OrphicHymns, and other ancient Greek writings. It is also possible that Cosimoacquired from Plethon a short version of the Chaldean Oracles. Cosimo laterfunded the education of Marsilio Ficino, who translated these texts into Latinfor the first time.Marsilio FicinoCosimo de’ Medici began sending his agents to find and purchase works by Platoand other Greek philosophers. But as Greek was no longer widely spoken in theWest, the texts would have to be translated into Latin.Cosimo found the translator he needed in Marsilio Ficino, the young son of hispersonal physician. He arranged to have Ficino taught Greek by an exiledOrthodox priest. Between 1462 and 1484, Ficino translated all of Plato’sdialogues into Latin. He also translated works of many of the Neoplatonists,including Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.Cosimo lay on his deathbed when he acquired a manuscript of what we now call theHermetic Corpus. Ficino stopped working on Plato in order to translate it asquickly as possible so he could read it to Cosimo in his final hours.Ostensibly a commentary on Plotinus, Ficino’s own Three Books on Life containsin its third book a functional presentation of theurgy that many later writersexploited and built upon.38[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-030] Ficino’s works, though,are heavy with theory; the practicalities of theurgy received only lighttreatment from him.Even so, we have stories of him singing the Orphic Hymns accompanied by thelyre. These invocations, along with his instructions in the third book, made fora kind of celestial therapy that dared not call itself magic, or at least notyet. That would come with his students and, more powerfully, a generation laterwith Agrippa.Renaissance KabbalahKabbalah entered the world of the Renaissance though Ficino’s student, the youngCount Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Kabbalah was thought by some to be thesecret teachings of Moses, but for Pico it supported the divinity of Christ andother Christian theological positions, which meant that it could be used toprovide a Christian justification for magic. The tale of Pico and the Kabbalahlies outside our scope, but it has been well covered by others.39[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-029]Through their own works, two of Pico’s students added considerably to anunderstanding of these teachings. Johannes Reuchlin published De Verbo Mirificoin 1494 and De arte Cabalistica in 1517, and Franciscus Gregorius published Deharmonia mundi totius cantica tria in 1525.To understand Kabbalah itself, we can turn to the father of its modern study,Gershom Scholem, and his student Moshe Idel. According to Scholem, Kabbalah isthe traditional and most commonly used term for the esoteric teachings ofJudaism and for Jewish mysticism, “especially the forms which it assumed in theMiddle Ages from the 12th century onward.” 40[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-028] Scholem, Idel, and a hostof scholars since then have explored the richness of this kind of Jewishmysticism, finding in it a beautiful and lively depth.Neoplatonism is an essential dimension of Kabbalah. As Scholem has written,“Inasmuch as early Kabbalah needed a theoretical foundation it was largelyinfluenced by neoplatonism.” 41[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-027] Kabbalah can even be seenas a kind of theurgy. In Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Moshe Idel dedicates achapter to exposition of devekut, the practice of cleaving to Yahweh (YHVH), thepatron deity of the Jewish people.42[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-026] Idel noted that sourcetexts on the subject employ Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and hermetic terminologyas “a garb used by the mystics in order to articulate their experiences.” 43[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-025] Idel also wrote that theNeoplatonic and hermetic influences have “strong magical interests, widely knownas theurgy.” This fusion of purpose and nomenclature between Neoplatonic theurgyand Kabbalah also extends to the idea of the transformation of the soul throughthe use of devekut through ordinary worship.Agrippa and the Modern EraAt last we come to the modern era, which can be said to have begun in 1517 onOctober 31, the precise moment of its beginning marked by the blow of a hammeras Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Cathedral ofWittenberg.The dominant figure in Western magic in the early modern era was HeinrichCornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486–1535). Agrippa is considered a humanistand was contemporary with Erasmus (1466–1536), with whom he corresponded, andMartin Luther (1483–1546), whom he first supported and later denounced.44[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-024] In intellectual history,he is known most positively for his De vanitate, considered an important work onearly modern skepticism.It was his writing on the occult, however, and especially his Three Books ofOccult Philosophy (TBOP) that made him most famous. Perhaps infamous is thebetter word—his fame was so great that he is considered to have been a majorinfluence on the popular legend of Faust selling his soul to the Devil,especially in the plays of Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.45[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-023]Agrippa considered himself to be a son of Cologne, Germany; however, little isknown of him before 1507, the date of his earliest surviving letter.46[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-022] He matriculated at theUniversity of Cologne in 1499 and received a licentiate in art in 1502. He laterclaimed doctorates in canon and civil law and at times claimed to be a doctor ofmedicine.47 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-021]Besides his intellectual career, Agrippa was also a man of action, seeingmilitary service in Spain and Italy. This is perhaps what led to his claim ofknighthood on the title page of TBOP.48[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-020] There is also evidence ofhis service to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope. This service brought Agrippato stay in Italy between 1511 and 1518, where he was exposed to the Italianhumanists and the work of Ficino, Pico, and Reuchlin. He married an Italiannative of Pavia and attempted to settle, lecturing at the University of Pavia onthe hermetic Pimander.49 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-019]Agrippa’s knowledge of the occult was not solely theoretical. He claimed to beable to manufacture gold alchemically, but said that the process was tooexpensive to be profitable.50[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-018] Perhaps more important,there is significant evidence in his letters that he formed occult groups,possibly oathbound to secrecy, wherever he traveled.51[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-017] Of their influence we canonly speculate.Three Books of Occult PhilosophyAgrippa finished writing his first version of Three Books of Occult Philosophyin 1510. Twenty years passed before the publication of its first volume, whichAgrippa spent serving first the city of Metz 52[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-016] and then the nobility ofEurope.53 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-015] At the sametime, he was studying Kabbalah and hermeticism, and he added discussions of bothsubjects to TBOP before its first volume was published in 1530. This volumecaused such an uproar among the censors that the publication of the remainingtwo volumes was delayed for three years.54[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-014]In TBOP, Agrippa drew on the works of Pico, Reuchlin, and Gregorius as well ason other sources of Kabbalistic knowledge.55[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-013] The brothers Paolo andAgostino Ricci were major contributors and possibly known by Agrippapersonally.56 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-012] Paolo Ricciis known for his translation of the Sha’arei Orah of Joseph ben AbrahamGikatilla, while Agostino Ricci was the author of a number of works and a likelysource of Agrippa’s knowledge of the important Kabbalistic text the Zohar.57[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-011] Another source ofinformation was Pietro Galatino’s Opus de arcanis Catholicae veritatis,published in 1518. Agrippa possessed a copy of this Latin text on the Kabbalahby 1532 and cited it in TBOP. 58[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-010]With its influences from Neoplatonism and theurgy, Kabbalah fit well into TBOP.Agrippa could not have known that Kabbalah had, as a matter of historical fact,been informed by Neoplatonism. But he certainly saw the parallels, and herealized that Kabbalah could serve as a vehicle for presenting Iamblichantheurgy in a suitably “de-paganized” form to be acceptable for use byChristians.The final two volumes of TBOP were published in 1533, and Agrippa died just twoyears later. Over time, many editions of TBOP were produced, many of themunauthorized. At one point a spurious fourth book was published; thisincorporated some of Agrippa’s own work on geomancy but also contained ritesintended to summon specific demons, which were outside the scope of Agrippa’soriginal project.59 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-009] TBOPwas translated into English in 1651, and this edition was plagiarized to produceFrancis Barrett’s The Magus and the DeLaurence edition of Agrippa’s Philosophyof Natural Magic.60 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-008] Inhis study of the history of grimoires, Owen Davies notes the presence ofAgrippa’s Three Books (and often the spurious fourth) in all the time periodsand most of the locales he explores.61[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-007]The influence of TBOP is hard to overstate.62[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-006] TBOP informed thecunning-folk and underpinned many of the grimoires that came after it. GiordanoBruno (1548–1600), John Dee (1527–1608), the Rosicrucian documents (1614–1617),and the Freemasons (1717) were all influenced by it. By the 1850s Freemasonrymetastasized into “Fringe Masonry,” with orders and lodges that reassertedsocial hierarchy and explored more esoteric spirituality. 63[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-005] This kind of Freemasonrybecame the container for the French occult revival, the medium of transmissionof hermetic and other ancient thought systems, and the population with theappropriate skills to be able to produce several magic or theurgic societiessuch as the Élus Coëns, or Martinists (c. 1766), and the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn (1888).64 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-004] TheGolden Dawn extensively used the concepts and language of TBOP to structure itsteachings, rituals, and other practices.65[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-1.xhtml#footnote-003]This can be seen as the successful result of Agrippa’s purpose for TBOP: thereformation and redemption of occult philosophy—magic—for contemporary use.Agrippa accomplished this task by reorganizing the grimoire magic of his day onthe basis of Iamblichan theurgy. Theurgy gave Agrippa a coherent theory forexplaining the nature of magical practice and its use for spiritual advancement.Then, by translating theurgical concepts—particularly the Neoplatonic cosmologyand divine hierarchy and the theurgical notions of the soul, its parts, and itsvehicle—into their Kabbalistic equivalents, Agrippa made this “pagan”spirituality sufficiently Christian to be acceptable for use in his time.So now we have come to the end of our journey through the past. We have seen howthe ancient world bequeathed to us—as filtered through the perceptions of theGreeks and Romans—their religious insights and a portion of their magicalpractices; how the Neoplatonists, especially Iamblichus, developed thisinheritance into theurgy, which became the foundation for the Western magicaltradition; how Christianity tried to end this tradition even while carryingpieces of it forward; how the recovery of ancient texts by way of Byzantium andthe Islamic world led to its renewal; and how Agrippa gave us a masterful andinfluential summa of our great inheritance.Throughout the rest of this book, dear reader, you will find the best andbrightest of us explaining the depths of that inheritance and providing you withthe tools and means to practice its many branches.May you have success!BibliographyAgrippa von Nettesheim, Heinrich Cornelius.

The history of Qabalah is long, andits literature is vast. Our brief survey can offer only a few glimpses of thisastounding tradition. We hope these glimpses will inspire students to pursuedeeper knowledge.The Hebrew word Qabalah ([image/8.jpg]) means “tradition.” 66[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-171] In esoteric contexts, itmeans the tradition of Jewish mysticism.67[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-170] Tradition impliescontinuity of ideas and practices, yet the greatest Qabalists have always beeninnovators. Each school of Qabalists has sought new mystical interpretations,while carefully preserving historical continuity. Scholars have described Jewishmysticism as “simultaneously conservative and radical.” 68[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-169] Qabalah is a livelytradition of creativity, forever changing and growing.This tradition of innovation led to surprising developments in the Renaissance.Christian magicians created a Hermetic Qabalah, reinterpreting fundamentalqabalistic theories and practices in non-Jewish terms. Hermetic Qabalah evolvedinto the Golden Dawn magical system, the basis of ceremonial magic today.Some Historical NotesProphecy and Apocalypticism (Sixth through Second Centuries BCE)The Babylonian exile and the destruction of the Temple (sixth century BCE)threatened the Jewish faith.69[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-168] The prophet Ezekieloffered hope of a return from exile. Ezekiel’s vision of God enthroned upon achariot has inspired mystical practices ever since (see inset). As Ezekielforetold, the Jews returned home and rebuilt the Temple.Ezekiel’s VisionThe prophet Ezekiel’s cautiously precise account of his experience has hadimmeasurable influence through the centuries. The chariot-throne inspired Jewishmysticism; the four living creatures inspired Christian iconography. Renaissancehumanists mingled Ezekiel’s powerful images with Greek philosophical themes inthe tarot. The following quotations come from Ezekiel 1:4–6, 10, 14, 26, and 28.And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, anda fire infolding itself, and a brightness …Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. Andthis was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. …As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and theface of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on theleft side; they four also had the face of an eagle. …And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash oflightning. …And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne,as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne wasthe likeness as the appearance of a man …As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was theappearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of thelikeness of the glory of the Lord.During the Second Temple Period (516 BCE–70 CE), prophecy took the form ofapocalyptic visions. Prophets described ascending to the heavens, where angelsexplained cosmological mysteries and revealed future events. Apocalyptic textsoffered assurance that God was in control of an orderly cosmos. The book ofDaniel (second century BCE) included visions of Ezekiel’s chariot and Isaiah’smessianic king. Expectations of a Messiah increasingly shaped Jewish beliefs.Apocalyptic literature enriched Judaism with several other ideas. It featured awell-developed angelology. It taught that God created everything in heaven andon earth with sacred words. It hinted that exceptional people could learn thosewords and wield their power.Rabbinic Judaism, Chariot and Palace Mysticism (First through Sixth CenturiesCE)The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE ended biblical Judaism.Sacrificial rites ceased, and the power of the priesthood faded away. A group oferudite sages stepped forward to transform the religion. Scripture replaced theTemple as the focus of Jewish spirituality. Prayer and pious behavior replacedsacrifice. These innovations enabled Judaism to survive the Greater Exile thatbegan in 135 CE.The new Jewish leaders inherited many duties expected of holy men in ancienttimes. Serving as judges, scholars, soothsayers, exorcists, and rainmakers, theypreferred the simple title rabbi, “teacher.”Rabbinic Judaism recognized two sources of authority. The Bible declared thewritten law, available to all. But an oral law, reserved for the elite,expounded the Bible. This oral tradition was already well established when therabbis came to power. Within it was an even more recondite tradition of mysticalpractice. Eventually the rabbis recorded portions of the oral law in the Mishnahand Talmud. Simultaneously they recorded portions of their mystical tradition inthe Chariot and Palace texts.The rabbinic sages aspired to experience what biblical figures had experienced.They wanted to see the divine chariot (merkavah) and prophesy like Ezekiel. Theywanted to enter the seven heavenly palaces (heikhaloth), receiving revelationslike Enoch.70 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-167] They wantedto understand how God created the world with words, as Genesis told.The Chariot and Palace texts were instruction manuals for attaining suchexperiences.71 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-166] They gaveadvice on necessary preparations. They provided lengthy prayers and incantations(couched in abstruse language to veil their purpose). The prayers emphasizeddivine names, especially God’s holiest name, the Tetragrammaton.72[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-165] Sacred names and amuleticseals were passwords for the angelic sentinels at the palace gates. Graduallyascending through all seven celestial spheres, worthy aspirants would finallybehold the chariot.Before daring these astral adventures, aspirants received formal initiation andinstruction. They fasted and strictly maintained ritual purity. They armedthemselves with virtue, plus an arsenal of sacred names and amulets. Thesespiritual practices were dangerous. Even the visions of the lower heavens couldcause insanity or death.73[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-164] In time, speculation onthe mysteries of creation became the prevailing form of Jewish mysticism. The“work of Genesis” (maaseh Bereshith) was safer than the “work of the chariot”(maaseh merkavah).The fourth-century Sepher Yetzirah (Book of Formation) is the most importanttext from this period.74 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-163]It declares that God created the world by means of “thirty-two mysterious pathsof wisdom.” 75 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-162] Thesepaths are the twenty-two Hebrew letters plus ten sephiroth.76[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-161] The word sephiroth isuntranslatable: its meanings include “numerals,” “spheres,” “eons,” and possibly“sapphires.” The connections among these meanings are not obvious today. Ancientastronomy envisioned the heavens as a system of ten concentric crystallinespheres. The Bible compared the heavens to sapphire (as in Ezekiel 1:26).Qabalah describes the ten sephiroth as emanating from God, like the eons inGnostic cosmology. Ten numerals represent all numbers, as the alphabetrepresents all words—and as the ten spheres represent all of creation. Thebook’s unknown author, fond of playful ambiguity, surely intended multiplemeanings. Qabalists today are still clarifying their understanding of thesephiroth. The short, cryptic Sepher Yetzirah laid the foundation of all laterJewish mysticism.77 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-160]The Early Qabalistic Period (Twelfth through Thirteenth Centuries)After the sixth century CE, no new Chariot or Palace texts appeared. The currentof Jewish mysticism flowed quietly underground. In the middle of the twelfthcentury, it burst forth with fresh vigor.78[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-159]39Sepher ha-BahirThe Book of the Brilliance is a key manuscript in the evolution of Qabalah. Infact, this twelfth-century text first used the word Qabalah to mean Jewishmysticism. The Bahir ascribes its opening words to the second-century adeptNehunia ben ha-Qanah. References to the Chariot also help set the book in thecontext of earlier mysticism.*The Bahir appeared between 1150 and 1200 in Provence but incorporated oldermaterial. Its unknown author likely had some connection to Isaac the Blind.(Scholars disagree about the specifics of that connection.) In brief homiliesinterpreting biblical verses, the Bahir established much of the qabalisticsymbolism used today.The Bahir propounded a new conception of God by reimagining the sephiroth. TheSepher Yetzirah had introduced the sephiroth as tools that God used in creatingthe world. In the Bahir, the sephiroth became parts of God, dynamic emanationsconstantly interacting. The book envisioned one God with ten emanations—aneternal equilibrium produced by ceaseless motion.The Bahir arranged the sephiroth in a particular sequence, “one above theother.” ** It gave each sephirah a name. It introduced organic symbolism,including the tree metaphor, to explain the sephiroth. The qabalistic Tree ofLife originated here. The Bahir conceptualized the divine as a plurality offorces—both male and female.Renaissance scholars Flavius Mithridates and Guillaume Postel translated theBahir. Aryeh Kaplan published the first English translation in 1979.The Yetzirah and the Zohar are more famous, but Sepher ha-Bahir made comparablyvital contributions to the development of Qabalah.* Kaplan, The Bahir, 1, 25, 32.** Kaplan, The Bahir, 45. The text usually calls the emanations attributes(middoth) rather than sephiroth.An entirely new set of works solidified themes from Chariot literature, addingnew interpretations. Earlier mystics had believed their souls literally ascendedto the planets. Qabalists believed the ascent happened within themselves.Chariot and Palace texts had symbolized divine energy as fire. Qabalistic textspreferred water: God’s energy flows like a fountain through the sephiroth.Qabalists did not just behold divinity, but actively participated in the life ofthe divine. Different mystical schools emerged simultaneously in the twelfthcentury, each making unique contributions.An unknown master from Provence composed Sepher ha-Bahir (The Book of theBrilliance) sometime after 1150 (see inset). Slightly later, Isaac the Blind (c.1160–1235) became the first Qabalist definitively identified by historians.Dedicating his whole life to the study of Qabalah, Isaac led a Provençalqabalistic school. He wrote a commentary on the Sepher Yetzirah and developednew mystical doctrines. Isaac said God exists beyond the sephiroth, in a mannerbeyond human comprehension: intellect can only express it negatively, saying Godis not limited or God is not. The subtle yet daring speculations of Isaac theBlind remain central to Qabalah today.Different innovations came from a German school of “pious ones,” or Hasidim.79[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-158] They emphasized love ofGod and stern asceticism. The Hasidim combined Chariot mysticism with a magicalsystem based on the Hebrew alphabet. Using gematria (calculating numericalvalues of words), they sought God’s hidden will in the Bible. The German Hasidimalso studied the lore of demons and ghosts.Eleazar of Worms (c. 1176–1238) was a gifted, prolific writer from a leadingHasidic family. German Hasidism culminated in his books. His interests includedethics, Chariot mysticism, the Sepher Yetzirah, and numerical symbolism.Eleazar’s ideas—especially his mystical technique of combining letters—inspiredAbraham Abulafia a generation later (see inset).Abraham AbulafiaAbraham Abulafia (1240–c. 1292) was absolutely not a typical Spanish Qabalist.He was not a rabbi, and he preferred philosophy to Talmudic studies. He rejectedthe sephiroth as idolatrous. Modern scholarship, however, considers Abulafia apivotal figure in the history of Qabalah.A wandering sage, Abulafia traveled throughout the Mediterranean region. Heconferred with mystics of other faiths. Abulafia’s unique system of mysticalpractices shows some curious similarities to Sufism and even Yoga.Abulafia scorned speculative mysticism. His only interest was experiencing unionwith God, which would produce ecstasy and prophecy. (Hence scholars label histeachings the Prophetic school or the Ecstatic school.) Abulafia believed thenames of God were secret keys to attainment. His mystical system incorporatedbreathing, singing, positioning the hands and head, and pronouncing divinenames.Insisting that meditation on earthly things cannot reach the divine plane,Abulafia meditated on the alphabet. Letters and words preceded creation,existing before God said “Let there be light.” Words suggest the earthly thingsthey signify, but letters are ideal for meditative purposes. Abulafia meditatedon letters, individually and in combination (tzeiruph) with other letters. Healso pondered their numerical values. Abulafia’s work with the letters greatlyinfluenced practical Qabalah.Believing all languages derive from Hebrew, Abulafia considered any alphabetsuitable for meditation. He applied his methods to the Greek and Latinalphabets, contemplating words in several languages. He taught his idiosyncraticmysticism to Jews and Christians alike.Abulafia’s mysticism was solitary, seeking an internal and entirely personalexperience of God. He recommended isolation, considering separation andwithdrawal necessary to reach religious perfection. Abulafia stated that humanteachers are useful only until a spiritual teacher appears. Abulafia’s teachingscould have influenced the magical system of Abramelin. (See Book Six: The Magickof Abra-Melin.)At age forty, Abulafia attained union with God. He emphasized the divine ecstasyof this union, describing it with erotic imagery. Abulafia’s understanding ofdivine union as orgasmic bliss later inspired Hasidic theories of prayer.After his experience of union, Abulafia began writing prophetic books. Like manyQabalists, he came to believe he was the Messiah. Abulafia had the wisdom to seehis mission of redemption as primarily internal and personal. Nonetheless, hedid attempt to convert the Pope.Some of Abulafia’s voluminous writings have survived. His ideas shaped Jewishqabalistic practice. Abulafia’s universalism appealed to Renaissance humanists,deeply influencing Hermetic Qabalah. Scholar Moshe Idel has written extensivelyon Abulafia.Abulafia’s Prophetic school was one of several mystical schools in medievalSpain. Some mixed Neoplatonism with Qabalah, producing systematic metaphysicaldoctrines. Others explored Gnosticism, speculating on the nature of evil.Joseph Gikatilla (1248–c. 1305), one of Abulafia’s students, condensedqabalistic thought into well-organized treatises. His Gates of Light explainedthe sephiroth and theoretical Qabalah. His Nut Garden explained the letters andpractical Qabalah. In later centuries his ideas influenced Hermetic Qabalah.Isaac Kohen of Castile (late thirteenth century) mythologized evil, introducing“full-blown Gnostic dualism.” 80[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-157] His Treatise on the LeftEmanation postulated a demonic parallel universe called the Other Side. (LaterQabalists called it the Sitra Ahra and the Qlippoth.) Samael, Asmodeus, andLilith rule there. As human virtue empowers the sephiroth, sin empowers theOther Side. Kohen believed good and evil will someday meet in battle. TheMessiah will vanquish the demons and deliver the Jewish people. Kohen’s ideasmade a deep impression on Moses de León.The Zoharic Period (Thirteenth Century to the Present)Sepher ha-Zohar (The Book of Splendor) marked an epoch in the history ofQabalah. It appeared, piece by piece, during the last quarter of the thirteenthcentury. Moses de León (c. 1240–1305) wrote this massive qabalisticcollection.81 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-156] He combinedthemes from Palace mysticism, German Hasidism, and the Provençal and Spanishqabalistic schools. The result was a masterpiece of theoretical Qabalah unlikeany previous qabalistic book.The Zohar is not a textbook but a collection of tales, with characters and plot.The narrative follows several rabbis, sharing biblical insights as theyexperience progressively more miraculous events. The Zohar even offers a lovestory, the eternal romance of Tiphareth and Malkuth.82[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-155] The demon Samaelthreatens their sexual union, so Qabalists must assist the sacred marriagetheurgically. “Through an action below, an action above is aroused.” 83[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-154] The highly symboliclanguage of the Zohar established a new mystical vocabulary.For two centuries, Sepher ha-Zohar made little impact outside the IberianPeninsula. But in 1492, Jewish refugees carried their manuscripts to newcountries. As printed versions appeared, the Zohar rapidly became “the Bible ofKabbalah.” 84 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-153]The theme of exile recurs throughout Jewish history. In 1492 religiousnationalism prompted the expulsion of all Jews from Spain. Tens of thousandsfled to the more tolerant Ottoman Empire. Many Spanish Qabalists settled in theGalilean town of Safed. Their various traditions merged in a remarkably creativenew school. Soon Qabalists from all over the Jewish world came to study atSafed.Moses Cordovero (1522–1570) was the principal architect of the Safed school’sqabalistic synthesis. His Garden of Pomegranates “systematized and integratedall the speculative elements of cabalism to his time.” 85[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-152] Abulafia’s practices alsoinspired him.Isaac Luria (1534–1572) succeeded Cordovero as leader of the Safed school. Manyconsider him the greatest of all Qabalists. Luria’s vivid imagination andintense mystical visions expanded the symbolism and theology of Qabalah. Hebuilt an extensive theology around the concept of exile. Luria believed sparksof divine fire are trapped—or exiled—in the demonic realm. Because human virtuecan liberate the sparks, striving for spiritual perfection has cosmicsignificance. Qabalah has the power to hasten the Messiah’s coming and end theJews’ exile.Luria’s thought centered on recurring cycles of birth and death, of cosmicexpansion and contraction. He speculated on the world’s creation anddestruction. He believed even God dies and gives himself rebirth (as recountedin Genesis). Luria taught that human souls enter new bodies after death. Hebelieved he could read the history of a soul in a person’s face. Having writtenthe Zohar in a past life, Luria could read it with special insight. Luria’shighly original mysticism added deeper mythical dimensions to the Zohar.Modern Hasidism and Modern Judaism (Eighteenth Century to the Present)Israel Baal Shem Tov (c. 1700–1760) started a new Hasidic movement in Poland.Rabbi, amulet maker, and healer, he energized Luria’s abstruse metaphysics withemotional enthusiasm. His revived Hasidism considered emotion more importantthan erudition. During prayer, emotion can overwhelm rational consciousness,exalting the pious to communion with God. Because even familiar daily prayerscan produce communion, the Hasidim consider prayer dangerously powerful: “It isonly by God’s grace that we remain alive after praying.” 86[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-151] Hasidism itself remainsalive and well today, representing “practical mysticism at its highest.” 87[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-150]Another influential eighteenth-century movement, the Jewish Enlightenment,differed from Hasidism in virtually every way. Advocating modernism andacculturation, Jewish Enlightenment rationalists condemned mysticism of anykind. They despised Qabalah as “a system of metaphysical delirium,” 88[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-149] and reviled the Zohar as“a book of lies.” 89 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-148]In the twentieth century, academic inquiry into Qabalah gradually displacedJewish Enlightenment prejudices. Gershom Scholem (1897–1982) contended thatQabalah was in fact the heart and soul of Judaism. A large and valuable body ofscholarship on Jewish mysticism exists today.The academic study of Qabalah has also stimulated lively interest amongcontemporary Jews. Women and men, observant and secular, find the essence oftheir Jewish heritage in Qabalah.Meanwhile, qabalistic initiation continues among the Orthodox. Mostconspicuously, the twenty-first-century Hasidim cultivate lives of traditionalJewish piety, steeped in Qabalah. After two millennia of change, the ancientJewish mystical tradition is thriving today.Hermetic Qabalah in the Renaissance (Fifteenth through Seventeenth Centuries)Throughout the Middle Ages, Christians knew virtually nothing of Qabalah,Judaism, or the Hebrew language. They generally regarded Jews not with curiositybut with fear of Jewish sorcery.In the fifteenth century, humanist scholars rediscovered the ancient Hermetictradition.90 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-147] Seeking theunity of all knowledge, they blended Christian faith with pagan philosophy andtheurgy. Qabalah, reinterpreted in Hermetic and Christian terms, became thekeystone of their universal synthesis. Inextricably linked with Qabalah,ceremonial magic emerged from this same Renaissance synthesis.Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) was the first Christian Qabalist. Picobelieved Qabalah unified all philosophies and religions while upholdingChristianity. In 1486 he proclaimed, “No science offers greater assurance ofChrist’s divinity than magic and the cabala.” 91[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-146]For the next two centuries, Qabalah fascinated European intellectuals.Enthusiasm for Jewish mysticism elicited unheard-of empathy for Jews andinterest in Jewish thought. Universities began teaching Hebrew. Latintranslations of Jewish texts appeared, alongside the first books of HermeticQabalah. Persecutions continued, but the humanists fought for tolerance.Johann Reuchlin (1455–1522) faced the Inquisition to halt the burning of Jewishbooks. Less successfully, he attempted to convert Jews with qabalistic argumentsabout the name Jesus. Adding the letter shin to the Tetragrammaton (God’s truename), Reuchlin revealed “the name of YHSVH, the true Messiah.” 92[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-145] Christian Qabalists, atleast, welcomed this Pentagrammaton.Two striking innovations—both anticipated by Abulafia—extracted Hermetic Qabalahfrom its Jewish matrix. Hermetic Qabalah asserted that qabalistic truth is notrestricted to Judaism or the Hebrew language. This idea exalted Qabalah touniversal importance but uprooted it from its native soil. Hermetic Qabalah alsodeemed initiation unnecessary, radically altering the nature of qabalisticlearning. Instead of receiving formal initiation into a master’s secretteachings, Hermetic Qabalists studied books.Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535) blended Christian, Jewish, and pagan traditionsinto a system he called ceremonial magic. At the center of his synthesis wasHermetic Qabalah. Agrippa’s Occult Philosophy, the “magical encyclopedia of theRenaissance,” 93 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-144]revolutionized sixteenth-century magical practice. Five hundred years later,ceremonial magicians continue to build on Agrippa’s qabalistic foundation.By the seventeenth century, “some knowledge of cabala was part of the equipmentof every scholar in every part of Europe.” 94[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-143] Christian Knorr vonRosenroth (1636–1689) produced the crowning work of Renaissance scholarship onQabalah. Knorr’s Kabbala Denudata remained the standard reference for HermeticQabalists until the twentieth century.95[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-142]Modern Hermetic Qabalah and the Golden Dawn School(Nineteenth Century to the Present)Qabalah, like most spiritual interests, lost prestige during the Enlightenment.In the nineteenth century, Éliphas Lévi (1810–1875) revitalized HermeticQabalah. Lévi maintained that Hermetic, Jewish, and Christian dogmas “completeand explain one another and their synthesis will be the religion of the future.”96 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-141] Lévi’s ideasinfluenced Freemasonry, Theosophy, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.The Golden Dawn was a formally organized school of Hermetic Qabalah.97[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-140] Its founders lectured onQabalah; they translated the Yetzirah and portions of the Zohar. They introducedEnglish readers to these essential qabalistic texts, “the kernel of that oraltradition.” 98 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-139] However,the Golden Dawn was not a literary association but a system of initiation.Initiates learned the theory of Hermetic Qabalah and the practice of ceremonialmagic. The Golden Dawn structured its initiatory, magical, qabalistic synthesison the Tree of Life. The initiation rituals symbolized a gradual ascent throughthe sephiroth.Anchoring Hermetic Qabalah in an initiatory tradition (like Jewish Qabalah) wasan important development. The Golden Dawn school introduced several othersignificant innovations. It improved Agrippa’s system with better knowledge ofQabalah. It forged Lévi’s rhapsodic ideas into workable rituals. Its secretinterpretation of the Sepher Yetzirah thoroughly integrated the tarot with theTree of Life. The Golden Dawn school enriched qabalistic symbolism with newcorrespondences, including elaborate color symbolism.After the schism of 1900, initiates published many of the order’s secrets.Israel Regardie (1907–1985) produced the clearest and most influentialrevelation. Regardie’s Golden Dawn revolutionized twentieth-century magicalpractice. Despite his Jewish heritage, Regardie was emphatically a HermeticQabalist. He maintained that Qabalah “could and should be employed withoutbinding to it the partisan qualities of any one particular religious faith.” 99[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-138]Generations of students have preserved the order’s qabalistic doctrines withsurprisingly few alterations.100[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-137] The Golden Dawn systemhas become the standard of modern ceremonial magic and Hermetic Qabalah.The marvelously innovative Golden Dawn school deserves serious study. Studentsmust understand, however, that Qabalah neither began nor ended with the GoldenDawn. The founders did extraordinary work with the qabalistic informationavailable to them in 1888. Far more information is available today. Studentswill find popular introductions, translations of ancient texts, and scholarlymonographs by the thousands. We hope these brief historical notes will motivatestudents to explore.Some Basics of Theoretical QabalahQabalists divide their tradition into theoretical and practical branches.Theoretical Qabalah, involving the ten sephiroth, is more contemplative, moremystical. Practical Qabalah, involving the twenty-two letters, is more active,more magical. Together, these complementary approaches embrace the thirty-twopaths of wisdom enumerated in the Sepher Yetzirah.Theoretical Qabalah provides the foundational theologies upon which practicalQabalah operates. It includes metaphysical and mystical speculation concerningdeity, souls, angels, and demons. It contemplates creation, the evolution of thedivine and the divine realm. Theoretical Qabalah expounds the sephiroth, thefour worlds, and the veils of negative existence. It informs the ascent towardknowledge of (and perhaps union with) divinity.Theoretical information has always dominated published writings on Qabalah. Onereason for this is that the sephiroth are relatively stable and unchanging. Theten sephiroth resemble well-known destinations, while the letters resemble thejourneys to those destinations. Each person’s journey is unique.Theoretical Qabalah often takes the form of stories and homilies. These seemintended to instruct initiates while hiding the true meaning from outsiders.Readers unfamiliar with the underlying symbols and definitions may find theBahir and the Zohar frustrating.It is important to remember that there is no single, unvarying qabalistictheology. Every period, every school, every individual Qabalist has a uniqueunderstanding of the tradition. This brief introduction mentions only a fewwidely accepted concepts. It emphasizes the teachings of the Golden Dawn schoolof Qabalah.The Tree of LifeA diagram called the Tree of Life is the most familiar symbol of Qabalah (Figure1 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor008]). It is a visualsummary of the Sepher Yetzirah. It shows the sephiroth as ten circles, and theletters as twenty-two lines connecting the circles.[image/Book2_Fig1.png]Figure 1. The Tree of Life of the Golden DawnQabalists have imagined the Tree of Life differently over the centuries. TheTree of Life that the Golden Dawn adopted is one version among many.101[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-136] Because of the GoldenDawn’s influence, however, it is the most common Tree in ceremonial magic.The SephirothThe Sepher Yetzirah introduced the ten sephiroth. It described them asinstruments or tools that God used when creating the world. The ten sephirothrepresent all of existence just as ten digits represent all numbers.Sepher ha-Bahir described the sephiroth as parts of God, ten aspects of onedivine consciousness. The Bahir spoke of the sephiroth as individuals withdistinct personalities and gave them names.The sephiroth are vessels of divine force. Each contains distinct powers,including a divine name, an archangel, a choir of angels, and an intelligence.These beings vary in their powers, functions, and missions. Their individualnames allow Qabalists to work with specific aspects of the divine. Qabalistsunderstand there is true power in knowing a name. To master the divine andangelic names is to possess a certain control of the sephiroth.The correspondences of the sephiroth come mostly from Jewish Qabalah. HermeticQabalists added correspondences such as the tarot and non-Jewish deities.102[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-135] The Golden Dawn used theqabalistic tarot correspondences extensively with both the sephiroth and thepaths, which will be discussed later. This emphasis on the tarot attributions tothe Tree of Life is a point of departure for some modern magicians with theGolden Dawn system. A thorough account of the tarot exceeds the scope of thischapter.Kether ([image/9.jpg]), “Crown,” is the first sephirah on the Tree of Life.Kether is the first emanation, the first manifestation of God’s will. No thoughtor differentiation exists here. Kether is the sphere of the “first moved.” 103[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-134] The divine name is Eheieh([image/10.jpg]), “I am.” The archangel is Metatron ([image/11.jpg]), the Princeof Countenances, “who bringeth others before the face of God.” 104[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-133]Chokmah ([image/12.png]), “Wisdom,” is the second sephirah. Chokmah is thesphere of the stars (often represented by the twelve constellations of thezodiac). Masculine, vigorous, and active, Chokmah is the Father, eternallyunited with the Mother, Binah. It is the Word, or logos, the written law.Chokmah is the yod ([image/13.jpg]) of the Tetragrammaton. The divine name isYah ([image/14.jpg]), “God.” The archangel is Raziel ([image/15.jpg]), “thePrince … of the knowledge of hidden and concealed things.” 105[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-132]Binah ([image/16.jpg]), “Understanding,” is the third sephirah. Binah is thesphere of Saturn, the dark waters of creation. It is the flowing waters ofdivinity. Binah is the feminine potency who is co-equal with Chokmah. Binah isthe supernal Mother, the Queen, “the great feminine form of God, the Elohim, inwhose image man and woman are created.” 106[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-131] Binah is the Qabalah, theoral law. Binah is the heh ([image/17.jpg]) of the Tetragrammaton. The divinename is Tetragrammaton Elohim ([image/18.jpg]), “Lord God.” The archangel isTzaphqiel ([image/19.jpg]), “the Prince of the Spiritual Strife against Evil.”107 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-130]These three sephiroth constitute the supernal triad. Below the supernal triad isthe abyss and the “false sephirah” Daath ([image/20.jpg]), “Knowledge.” Daath isnot a sephirah and should not appear as such on the Tree. (If it did appear onthe Tree of Life, Daath would occupy the empty space in the center of the firstsix sephiroth.) It is a barrier that aspirants must cross to reach the supernaltriad.Chesed ([image/21.jpg]), “Mercy” or “Loving-kindness,” is the fourth sephirah.It is also called Gedulah ([image/22.jpg]), “Greatness.” The word Chesed hasmultiple meanings, including “love” and “charity” (like the Greekagap[image/23.jpg]). Chesed is the sphere of Jupiter. A masculine potency, itrepresents peace and benevolence. Moses at Sinai, begging God to have mercy onhis people, illustrates Chesed. It is the mercy that a king acquires once he hasreceived wisdom and understanding. The divine name is El ([image/24.jpg]),“God.” The archangel is Tzadqiel ([image/25.jpg]), “the prince of Mercy andBeneficence.” 108 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-129]Geburah ([image/26.jpg]), “Strength,” is the fifth sephirah. It is also calledDin ([image/27.jpg]), “Judgment.” Geburah is the sphere of Mars. A femininepotency, it represents war and violence. It is the violent rushing waters of atsunami, water in its most destructive form. It is the flaming sword of Godsitting in judgment. The Golden Dawn warned of the dangers of imbalance betweenGeburah and Chesed: “Remember that unbalanced force is evil, that unbalancedseverity is but cruelty and oppression, but that also unbalanced Mercy is butweakness which would allow and abet evil.” 109[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-128] When Geburah is out ofbalance with Chesed, its wrath can turn to evil. Geburah then becomes thegateway to the demonic realm of the Other Side. The divine name is Elohim Gibur([image/28.jpg] [image/29.jpg]), “Mighty God.” The archangel is Kamael([image/30.jpg]), “the Prince of Strength and Courage.” 110[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-127]Tiphareth ([image/31.jpg]), “Beauty,” is the sixth sephirah. Tiphareth is thesphere of the Sun. A masculine potency, it represents balance, spirituality,compassion, and harmony. Occupying the center of the Tree, Tiphareth has adirect connection to every sephirah except Malkuth. It is the manifested,reflected light of God. Tiphareth is the Blessed Holy One, the Son of Chokmahand Binah. He is the bridegroom to the bride Shekhinah (Malkuth). Tiphareth isthe vau ([image/32.jpg]) of the Tetragrammaton. The divine name isTetragrammaton Eloah va-Daath ([image/33.jpg]), “Lord God and Knowledge.” 111[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-126] This twelve-letter nameis unique to the Golden Dawn school. In Jewish Qabalah the divine name ofTiphareth is the Tetragrammaton. The archangel is Raphael ([image/34.jpg]), “thePrince of Brightness, Beauty, and Light.” 112[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-125]Netzach ([image/35.jpg]), “Victory,” is the seventh sephirah. Netzach is thesphere of Venus. A masculine potency, it represents eternal love and harmony.Netzach is the ability to persevere and to conquer using passions and emotions.Netzach displays the qualities of Binah (such as intuition and insight) andChesed (mercy and love), but on a lower level. The divine name is TetragrammatonTzabaoth([image/36.jpg]), “Lord of Hosts.” The archangel is Haniel ([image/37.jpg]),“the Prince of Love and Harmony.” 113[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-124]Hod ([image/38.jpg]), “Splendor,” is the eighth sephirah. Hod is the sphere ofMercury. A feminine potency, it represents the intellect. Hod shows thequalities of Chokmah (such as wisdom) on a lower level. This manifests in Hod aslearning and ritual. Hod is the realm of the magician. The divine name is ElohimTzabaoth ([image/39.jpg]), “God of Hosts.” The archangel is Michael([image/40.jpg]), “the Prince of Splendour and of Wisdom.” 114[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-123]Yesod ([image/41.jpg]), “Foundation,” is the ninth sephirah. Yesod is the sphereof the Moon and reflects the Sun of Tiphareth. This interesting sephirahrepresents the genitals of God. It is the location of the union betweenTiphareth above and Shekhinah (Malkuth) below. Yesod is the well of souls, wheresouls are deposited before birth. Yesod is the astral plane. The divine name isShaddai El Chai ([image/42.png] [image/43.jpg]), “Almighty Living God.” Thearchangel is Gabriel ([image/44.jpg]), “the Prince of Change and Alteration.”115 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-122]Malkuth ([image/45.jpg]), “Kingdom,” is the tenth sephirah. Malkuth is alsocalled Kavod ([image/46.jpg]), “Glory,” and Shekhinah ([image/47.jpg]),“Presence.” Malkuth is the sphere of the elements. A feminine potency, it is themost complex of all the sephiroth (see inset). Malkuth represents theterrestrial world and the gateway to the world of the divine. It is the funnelfor all the other sephiroth into the material plane. Malkuth is the Daughter ofChokmah and Binah. She is the bride of Tiphareth. Malkuth is the final heh([image/17.jpg]) of the Tetragrammaton. The divine name is Adonai ha-Aretz([image/49.jpg]), “Lord of the Earth.” The archangel is Sandalphon([image/50.jpg]), “the Prince of Prayer.” 116[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-121]The ShekhinahThe Bahir postulated a feminine, visible, knowable aspect of God, the Shekhinah.The Shekhinah, or “Presence,” is the channel through which the divine watersflow. Also called Kavod, or “Glory,” she is the boundary between the divineworld and creation. She receives the life force from the masculine Tiphareth anddispenses the force to creation. She is a passive force, with no identity of herown. Like a mirror, she is always full but only reflecting energy from above andbelow. The Shekhinah is the point of contact between God and creation.The Shekhinah is the Daughter of Chokmah and Binah. Unlike Binah, who is aflowing fountain, the Shekhinah is a closed well. “A garden inclosed is mysister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed” (Song of Songs 4:12).The Zohar states, ‘‘When the need arises, She becomes a spring; when the needarises, She becomes a well.” * The Shekhinah must be protected from the eviloutside the garden, so when evil threatens she becomes a well. “If life on earthis corrupt, Shekhinah turns into a well, and the waters must be drawn byrighteous heroes.” **The relationship between Tiphareth and Shekhinah is based on sexual intercourse.The Shekhinah is the Sabbath bride, ushered into the synagogue with the song“Lekha Dodi (Come, My Beloved).” The meaning of this qabalistic song from Safedis mostly lost to non-qabalistic Jews.Hasidim understand communion (devequth) as a mystic sexual union with the divinefeminine presence: “Moving your body in worship, thus reminding yourself thatthe Shekinah is standing before you, will rouse you to a state of intenseexcitement.” *** Hasidim engage in theurgic coitus, intending to assistTiphareth and the Shekhinah in their union.The Shekhinah has many correspondences. She is a rose, earth, fountain, garden.She is both pure and highly sexualized. She is the guardian on the Ark of theCovenant. She is the God that spoke to Moses on Sinai. She is the gateway to thedivine.* Matt, Zohar, 181.** Zohar 1:60a-b, in Matt, Zohar, 292.*** Testament of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem, quoted in Dan, The Teachings ofHasidism, 110.The Three Trinities and the Tetrad of MalkuthThe Tree of Life holds three triangles or trinities (Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor009]). Each comprises amale, a female, and a union. The highest trinity is the supernal triad, alsocalled the Crown, King, and Queen. Kether, Chokmah, and Binah are three combinedinto two, to make one. Chokmah and Binah are not a duality but a singularity:they are never separated. The supernal triad exists above the abyss of Knowledgeand beyond Reason. In the Golden Dawn’s color symbolism (Queen scale), thesesephiroth are white, gray, and black, respectively.[image/Book2_Fig2.png]Figure 2. The Three Triads on the Tree of LifeThe second trinity includes Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphareth. They form adownward-pointing triangle, as if reflecting the triangle above. This triadconcerns leadership and governance, mercy and power. Reconciling these oppositesis Tiphareth, the Sun, whose light brings forth beauty and peace. The primarycolors blue, red, and yellow correspond to these sephiroth.The third trinity consists of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. They form anotherdownward-pointing triangle, a second reflection. This triad governs the elementsand natural forces. The secondary colors correspond to these sephiroth. The blueof Chesed and the yellow of Tiphareth make the emerald green of Netzach. The redof Geburah and the yellow of Tiphareth make the brilliant orange of Hod. Theblue of Chesed and the red of Geburah produce the brilliant purple of Yesod.Malkuth is unique in the Hermetic tradition. In Jewish Qabalah, Malkuth standsalone at the bottom of the Tree, connecting only to Yesod and not part of anytriad. However, in Hermetic Qabalah, Malkuth connects to Hod and Netzach as wellas Yesod, forming a tetrad. Malkuth is the final convergence of all thingsabove. As the sphere of the four elements, Malkuth has four colors, three ofwhich are duller versions of Netzach (olive), Hod (citrine), and Yesod (russet).The fourth color (black) demonstrates how far Malkuth is removed from the primalbright white light of Kether. At the same time, black suggests a return to thenothingness of Ain to be reborn in Kether. This mystery exemplifies theqabalistic formula “Kether is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether.”The Three PillarsThe ten sephiroth form three columns or pillars (Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor010]). As in the threetrinities, there is a male, a female, and a union.[image/Book2_Fig3.png]Figure 3. The Three PillarsThe Pillar of Mercy, on the right-hand side of the Tree, represents the elementof fire. It includes the masculine sephiroth Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach.The Pillar of Severity, on the left-hand side of the Tree, represents theelement of water. It includes the feminine sephiroth Binah, Geburah, and Hod.These two pillars balance each other.The Pillar of Mildness, in the center, represents the element of air. Itincludes Kether, Tiphareth, Yesod, and Malkuth. This Middle Pillar reconcilesthe other two.The Middle Pillar Exercise is a simple, purely qabalistic meditation taught bythe Golden Dawn.117 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-120]Through visualization and intonation, students establish the Middle Pillarwithin themselves. By internalizing the Tree of Life, students embody itssymbolism of balance.The Veils of Negative ExistenceThe Tree of Life is the central construct of Qabalah. Other systems, symbols,and mystical theories have developed from it. These additional theories expandthe symbolism of the Tree. They explain various aspects of creation and thedivine, starting with what existed before creation.[image/Book2_Fig4.png]Figure 4. The Veils of Negative ExistenceWhat existed before the universe is concealed and transcendent. No words candescribe this pre-existence. It is possible to speak of it or imagine it only innegative terms. Qabalists call it negative existence, understanding God in thispre-existence as Ain ([image/51.jpg]), “not” or “nothing” (Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor011]). Out of purenegativity came Ain Soph ([image/52.jpg] [image/53.jpg]), “without end” or“limitless.” And finally came Ain Soph Aur ([image/54.jpg]), “no end of light”or “limitless light.” “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light”(Genesis 1:3).Positive existence began when the limitless light focused itself into a singlepoint, called the Crown. As the universe emanated from Kether, the Crown, Godbecame manifested and (somewhat) knowable. God remains omnipresent and infinite,but it is possible to describe the manifested God in positive terms.The Four WorldsThe four worlds represent the four stages of creation or four fundamental statesof being.118 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-119] Each worldcorresponds with a letter of the Tetragrammaton and an element. Hermetic Qabalahassigns each world a suit of tarot cards as well as a court card.Qabalists conceptualize the four worlds in two ways. One way regards the worldsas four distinct Trees of Life. The Golden Dawn assigned a complete “scale” ofcolor symbolism to each of these Trees.119[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-118] The other way considersall four worlds as specific sephiroth on a single Tree.Atziluth ([image/55.jpg]), “Nearness,” is the first world, closest to God.Atziluth is the world of archetypes, where an idea originates—the point ofinspiration. Atziluth is the yod ([image/13.jpg]) of Tetragrammaton, the Father,corresponding to the element of fire. In the tarot it is the suit of wands andthe four knights (or princes) among the court cards. On the Tree, Atziluth isassociated with Chokmah and the divine names of God.Beriah ([image/57.jpg]), “Creation,” is the second world. Beriah puts in motionthe idea conceptualized in Chokmah. An emotional attachment gives the ideamomentum. Beriah is the heh ([image/17.jpg]) of Tetragrammaton, the Mother, theelement of water. In the tarot it is the suit of cups and the four queens. Onthe Tree, Beriah is associated with Binah and the archangels.Yetzirah ([image/59.jpg]), “Formation,” is the third world. Yetzirah is theworld of formation, where an idea gradually becomes a reality. Yetzirah is thevau ([image/60.png]) of the Tetragrammaton, the Son, and the element of air. Inthe tarot it is the suit of swords and the four kings. Yetzirah is the largestof the worlds, encompassing all the sephiroth from Chesed to Yesod. Tiphareth isits center. Yetzirah corresponds with the angels.Assiah ([image/61.jpg]), “Making” or “Action,” is the final world, the physicalworld. In Assiah, the ideal becomes manifested existence: the Shekhinah givesbirth to the original conception. Assiah is the final heh ([image/62.jpg]) ofthe Tetragrammaton, the Daughter, and the element of earth. In the tarot Assiahis the suit of pentacles and the four knaves (or princesses). Assiah isassociated with Malkuth and the intelligences.A simple example may explain this fourfold process of creation. Atziluth is themoment of waking, when a single thought—java—enters your mind. In that secondyou have conceptualized what you need to manifest, a cup of coffee. The passionof Beriah overrides all desire to stay under the covers, propelling you out ofbed. Nothing will keep you from manifesting that cup of java. Yetzirah is thebrewing process: step by step, your java takes form, engaging all your senses.Your morning is happening, you are awake, and the day is taking shape. At last,the fully manifested java pours from Yesod into the vessel of Assiah. Thefourfold act of creation is complete, and your inspiration is fulfilled. Youhave an actual cup of coffee.The Parts of the SoulThe Hebrew Bible uses five different words for “soul.” Qabalists believe eachword signifies a distinct part of a human being. The Bahir discusses the fivenames of the soul: nephesh, ruach, neshamah, chiah, and yechidah. However, theZohar mentions only three: the nephesh, ruach, and neshamah. Lurianic Qabalahrestored the other two: chiah and yechidah.In Hermetic Qabalah, four of these five parts of the soul correspond to the fourworlds. Therefore, a human birth replicates the fourfold process by which Godcreated the universe.Yechidah ([image/63.jpg]) means “individuality” or “oneness.” This part of thesoul is not associated with a part of the world, but rather the divine, theoneness of God and Man before man is created. It is also associated with AdamQadmon (see below).Chiah ([image/64.jpg]), “life,” is associated with Atziluth, Chokmah, fire, andthe yod. It is the life force, the spark of life. “It is the undilutedLife-Force itself, and it is our true identity.” 120[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-117]Neshamah ([image/65.jpg]), “spirit,” is associated with Beriah, Binah, water,and the heh. It is intuition, “that part of us that rises above the thinkingprocess and vibrates in greater harmony with the ultimate reality.” 121[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-116] It is the superior man ofthe I Ching, or Freud’s superego.Ruach ([image/66.jpg]), “breath” or “mind,” equates to Yetzirah, the lower sevensephiroth from Chesed to Yesod, and is vau. This is where the soul manifestsintelligence and reason. It is the ego and the inferior man of the I Ching.Nephesh ([image/67.jpg]), “soul,” equates to Assiah and Malkuth. This is thebirth of the soul into the material body. It is the basic instincts, the animalpart of the soul where survival and necessities drive actions. It is the id.Adam QadmonPlato teaches that man is a little model of the universe, a microcosm. The Bibleteaches that man is made in the image of God. The Tree of Life diagraminterweaves biblical and platonic themes. It represents simultaneously themacrocosmic universe, the Creator of the universe, and the microcosmic man.Adam Qadmon ([image/68.jpg] [image/69.jpg]), “Primeval Man,” is ananthropomorphized version of the Tree of Life and the sephiroth. It is thearchetypal human, the perfected person. Adam Qadmon is Adam before the fall fromthe Garden of Eden. Some Qabalists regard Adam Qadmon as a fifth world, aligningwith the Yechidah (the highest part of the soul).Adam Qadmon embodies the Tree of Life. The supernal triad is the head of thebody. Chesed and Geburah are the right and left arms. Tiphareth is the body ortrunk. Netzach and Hod are the right and left legs. Yesod is the phallus, thegenitals of Adam, and Malkuth is the feet.The viewer sees the backside of Adam Qadmon, not the front. As God said toMoses, “thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen” (Exodus33:23).122 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-115] The right handis on the Pillar of Mercy and the left hand is on the Pillar of Severity. Thispoint has caused considerable confusion in Hermetic Qabalah. The right hand ofGod is always the masculine side and the left hand is always the feminine side.An easy way to learn the Tree of Life is to practice drawing it. The geometry isbasic and requires only a compass and a ruler. One line plus three-and-a-halfcircles will pinpoint the locations of the sephiroth (see inset). Repeatedlydrawing the Tree renders every detail familiar. Labeling the Tree withcorrespondences also helps make the system of qabalistic symbolism familiar.Some Basics of Practical QabalahThe two branches of Qabalah complement and balance each other. TheoreticalQabalah takes a more contemplative, armchair approach to the mysteries.Practical Qabalah takes a more active, hands-on approach. As theoretical Qabalahspeculates on the ten sephiroth, practical Qabalah works with the twenty-twoHebrew letters.The AlphabetOf course, it is possible to study Qabalah without speaking Hebrew. There areenough books in English to occupy students of theoretical Qabalah for years.Practical Qabalah, however, demands at least a familiarity with the Hebrewalphabet.How to Draw the Tree of LifeStep 1: Using a ruler, draw a long vertical line. This is the Middle Pillar(Figure 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013]).Step 2: Choose a point at the top of the line. This is Kether.Step 3: Set a compass so that its radius is one-fourth the length of the line.Place the pivot of the compass on the Kether point. Draw a semicircle belowKether. The point where the semicircle intersects the line is Daath.[image/Book2_Fig6.png]Figure 5. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Steps 1–3Step 4: Place the pivot of the compass on the Daath point. Draw a circle aroundDaath. The points where the circle intersects the semicircle are Chokmah andBinah. The points where the circle intersects the line are Kether and Tiphareth(Figure 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014]).[image/Book2_Fig7.png]Figure 6. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 4Step 5: Place the pivot of the compass on the Tiphareth point. Draw a circlearound Tiphareth. The points where this circle intersects the previous circleare Chesed and Geburah. The points where the circle intersects the line areDaath and Yesod (Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015]).[image/Book2_Fig8.png]Figure 7. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 5Step 6: Place the pivot of the compass on the Yesod point. Draw a circle aroundYesod. The points where this circle intersects the previous circle are Netzachand Hod. The points where the circle intersects the line are Tiphareth andMalkuth (Figure 8 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016]).59[image/Book2_Fig9.png]Figure 8. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 6Step 7: Reset the compass so that its radius is one-fourth the distance betweenTiphareth and Yesod. Draw ten smaller circles around the focal points of thesephiroth (Figure 9 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017]).[image/Book2_Fig10.png]Figure 9. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 7Step 8: Using a ruler, connect the focal points of the sephiroth to delineatethe remaining paths (Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018]).[image/Book2_Fig11.png]Figure 10. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 8Step 9 (optional): Using a ruler, measure half the radius of a sephiroticcircle. Widen the paths to this measurement (Figure 11[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor019]). (Technically thewidth of the paths should equal 30° of the sephirotic circles, or one-twelfththe circumference; however, if the circles are fairly small, the differencebetween 2πr ÷ 12 and r ÷ 2 is imperceptible.)[image/Book2_Fig12.png]Figure 11. How to Draw the Tree of Life, Step 9Step 10 (optional): Label the paths and sephiroth with helpful information orfill them in with appropriate colors.At first sight, the Hebrew alphabet may seem outlandish (Table 1[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021]). Written from rightto left, it contains only consonants—some of them challenging to pronounce. Afull account of the Hebrew alphabet exceeds the scope of this book. The firstfew pages of any introductory book on Hebrew will answer many questions.123[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-114]An easy way to learn the Hebrew alphabet is to practice writing it. Beginnersshould practice the simple block style until the letters become easilyrecognizable. The Ashuri script calls for a calligraphic pen or brush. Numerousbooks and websites offer detailed instruction on how to form the letters.Writing Hebrew qabalistic terms also helps make the technical vocabulary ofQabalah familiar. Some students may profit from toys and games designed to teachchildren the alphabet.Qabalists consider the Hebrew language sacred. It is the language of the Bible,the language with which God created the universe. The letters of the Hebrewalphabet are tools of creation, repositories of divine power. Qabalists workwith the letters to reveal mystical insights or even to produce magical effects.Methods and Uses of Practical QabalahA fundamental premise of Qabalah is that every word of the Bible “holds supernaltruths and sublime secrets.” 124[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-113] Even when the literalsense appears unimportant or uninspiring, it is meaningful. So Qabalists seekdeeper truths concealed below the surface meaning of the text. They approach theBible as a divine code that the pious must decipher. Qabalists employtraditional methods or practices to reveal hidden biblical wisdom. The chiefmethods are notariqon, gematria, and temurah. The use of such practicesconstitutes “practical Qabalah.”Critics invariably object that anyone skilled in practical Qabalah can make atext say anything. It is true that Qabalists often use these methods quiteplayfully.125 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-112]Nonetheless, Jewish Qabalists take their play seriously: discoveries must followestablished rules of interpretation.126[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-111] Since God’s will isinfinite, however, Qabalists affirm that the Bible conceals infinite treasures.Letter and Final Form (Script Style)Name of Letter in English TransliterationNumerical ValueLetter and Final Form (Block Style)Simplified Pronunciation for Anglophones[image/70.jpg]aleph1[image/71.jpg]silent glottal stop[image/72.jpg]beth2[image/73.jpg]b or v[image/74.jpg]gimel3[image/75.jpg]g (as in go) or gh (as in German Tag)[image/76.jpg]daleth4[image/77.jpg]d or dh (as in smooth)[image/17.jpg]heh or hé5[image/79.jpg]h[image/32.jpg]vau6[image/81.jpg]w or u (as in due) or o (as in doe)[image/82.jpg]zayin7[image/83.jpg]z[image/84.jpg]cheth8[image/85.jpg]ch (as in German Bach, but whispered)[image/86.jpg]teth9[image/87.jpg]t (as in stake)[image/13.jpg]yod10[image/89.jpg]y or i (as in Lisa)[image/90.jpg]kaph20[image/91.jpg]k (as in cat) or kh (as in German Bach)[image/92.jpg]lamed30[image/93.jpg]l[image/94.jpg]mem40[image/95.jpg]m[image/96.jpg]nun50[image/97.jpg]n[image/98.jpg]samekh60[image/99.jpg]s[image/100.jpg]ayin70[image/101.jpg]glottal stop[image/102.jpg]peh or pé80[image/103.jpg]p or ph (as in graph)[image/104.jpg]tzaddi90[image/105.jpg]tz (as in quartz)[image/106.jpg]qoph100[image/107.jpg]q (as in kit)[image/108.jpg]resh200[image/109.jpg]r[image/110.jpg]shin300[image/111.jpg]sh or s[image/112.jpg]tau400[image/113.jpg]t (as in take) or th (as in both)Table 1. The Hebrew AlphabetAt its heart, practical Qabalah is a way of meditating on sacred words. Itsmethods are the flint and steel that spark intuition. Qabalists also usepractical methods to deepen their understanding of traditional prayers andcustoms. They may employ practical Qabalah to conceal secret knowledge,particularly when designing amulets. Qabalists sometimes use notariqon,gematria, and temurah to construct words of power or magical names. HermeticQabalists tend to dwell on the magical applications of these methods. Somewriters shun all practical Qabalah as tainted by magical practices.127[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-110]For a more balanced view, we have selected various (mostly Jewish) examples ofpractical Qabalah. They illustrate how practical Qabalah enriches Jewishtradition, magically and otherwise. We have also drawn a few examples fromceremonial magic.NotariqonNotariqon ([image/114.jpg]), “abbreviation,” uses acronyms in various ways. Jewsemploy notariqon in everyday language, as shorthand for Hebrew names. Forexample, Ari ([image/115.jpg]), “Lion,” stands for Ashkenazi Rabbi Isaac, therevered Qabalist Isaac Luria.Qabalists seek deeper meaning in words by considering them as acronyms. Forexample, they consider chen ([image/116.jpg]), “grace,” an acronym of chokmahnistarah, or “hidden wisdom.” Wherever “grace” occurs in scripture, Qabalistssee it as hinting at some concealed wisdom. Conversely, they perceive the hiddenwisdom of Qabalah as a pathway to divine grace.Likewise, amen ([image/117.jpg]) traditionally stands for El melekh neeman, “Godis a faithful king.” It affirms one’s trust in God at the end of everyprayer.128 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-109]Qabalists also create acronyms to abbreviate words, sentences, or whole psalms.Traditional Jewish amulets often use this form of notariqon, simultaneouslyconserving space and concealing secrets. For example, the letter[image/110.jpg], commonly seen on a mezuzah, stands for Shaddai([image/119.jpg]), “Almighty.” Jewish folklore further interprets Shaddai([image/120.jpg]) as “Guardian of the doors of Israel” ([image/121.jpg]).129[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-108] The abbreviation[image/110.jpg] also appears on protective amulets.130[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-107]Another example of notariqon often found on Hebrew amulets is the word argaman([image/123.jpg]), “purple.” This seemingly random word invokes the archangelsAuriel, Raphael, Gabriel, Michael, and Nuriel.131[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-106]Qabalists ordinarily form acronyms from the initial letters of words. Sometimes,however, they employ the final letters. For example, Tzamarkhad([image/124.jpg]), another name for the archangel Metatron, appears on manyamulets. It represents Genesis 1:1–5, being formed from the last letter of eachverse.132 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-105]Basic rituals of ceremonial magic include some familiar examples of notariqon.The divine name Agla occurs in the Golden Dawn’s Ritual of the Pentagram. Agla([image/125.jpg]) stands for Atoh gibor le-olam Adonai, or “Thou art mightyforever, my Lord.” This sentence comes from the central prayer of Jewishliturgy, the Amidah.133 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-104]Another divine name, Ararita, occurs in the Golden Dawn’s Ritual of theHexagram. Ararita([image/126.jpg]) conceals an affirmation of God’s unity: “One, the Beginning ofhis Unity, the Beginning of his Oneness, his Exchange is One.” 134[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-103] Notariqon condenses thismystical affirmation into one word.Ceremonial magicians do not restrict their use of practical Qabalah to Hebrew.For example, Israel Regardie disliked the divine name associated with Tiphareth,Tetragrammaton Eloah va-Daath. He found it inconveniently long for purposes ofintonation. Instead Regardie intoned Iao, the Greek name of a Gnostic deity withsolar associations.135 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-102] Atfirst glance, this substitution looks absurdly out of place. Transliterated toHebrew, however, the Greek letters [image/127.jpg] become [image/128.jpg], anacronym of [image/129.jpg]. Regardie cleverly solved his problem throughbilingual notariqon.GematriaGematria ([image/130.jpg]), “calculation,” utilizes the fact that Hebrew lettersalso function as numerals. Each letter has an inherent, perfectly ordinary,numerical value: [image/70.jpg] is 1, [image/72.jpg] is 2 (Table 1[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021]). Qabalists considerwords as the sums of their letters and seek meaning in those sums. For example,raz ([image/133.jpg]) means “mystery,” and its letters total 207. Aur([image/134.jpg]) means “light,” and it also adds to 207. The identity of theirnumerical values suggests a connection between the words. Qabalists may consider“light” mystically synonymous with “mystery,” or infer that mysteries can bringenlightenment. Qabalistic texts call the unknowable creator Ain Soph([image/135.jpg]), meaning “limitless” or “infinite.” Again, the numerical valueis 207. Qabalists may conclude that light—the first manifestation of Ain Soph(Genesis 1:3)—is an infinite mystery.Qabalists sometimes conceal a word by substituting another with the samenumerical value. For example, the angel Raziel revealed divine mysteries toAbraham Abulafia, who published them under the name Raziel.136[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-101] The pseudonym hinted atAbulafia’s identity because Raziel ([image/136.jpg]) equals Abraham([image/137.jpg]).By making similar numerical substitutions, pious Jews avoid writing theTetragrammaton unnecessarily. Some write [image/138.jpg] because those lettersequal 26, the sum of the Tetragrammaton. Others prefer [image/139.jpg] becausethe names of those letters, yod ([image/140.jpg]) and hé ([image/141.jpg]),equal 26.137 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-100] Another wayof writing (or speaking) the Tetragrammaton is to spell out the name: yod hehvau heh ([image/142.jpg] [image/143.jpg]) equals 52, or 2 × 26.138[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-099] Some even write[image/144.png] because the Tetragrammaton contains four letters.139[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-098] Such numericalparaphrases of sacred names often appear on Jewish amulets.Five Hebrew letters have “final forms,” used only at the end of words.Occasionally Qabalists assign alternate numerical values to these finalforms.140 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-097] For example,chen ([image/145.jpg]), “grace,” usually equals 58, as barukh ([image/146.jpg]),“blessed,” usually equals 228. But the alternate values make each word equal708.Basic rituals of ceremonial magic offer examples of gematria. The Lesser Ritualof the Pentagram contains four sacred names: the Tetragrammaton, Adonai([image/147.jpg]), Eheieh ([image/148.jpg]), and Agla ([image/149.jpg]).Notariqon turns these four divine names into י[image/150.png], which equals 13;13 equals echad ([image/151.jpg]), “one,” so these names, through theirdiversity, assert God’s unity.The name Ararita ([image/152.jpg]) equals 813, the sum of all of the letters inGenesis 1:3. So Ararita mystically signifies “And God said, Let there be light:and there was light.” Hence the Ritual of the Hexagram pairs Ararita withlux—Latin for “light.” 141[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-096]Gematria is the most popular method of practical Qabalah. Many Qabalists (Jewishand Hermetic) spend years cataloguing words with the same numerical value.142[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-095] Students interested ingematria should keep a notebook of their own findings.TemurahTemurah ([image/153.jpg]), “exchange,” comprises several techniques. Thesimplest of these utilizes anagrams. When the same letters spell differentwords, Qabalists use those words to explain each other. For example, “There isno good higher than joy ([image/154.jpg]), and there is no evil worse thanaffliction ([image/155.jpg]).” 143[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-094]Similarly, bread ([image/156.jpg]) and salt ([image/157.jpg]) symbolize thepolarity of Chesed and Geburah—mercy and judgment. Thus, the ancient Jewishcustom of dipping bread into salt at meals acquires deeper meaning. Dipping thebread expresses a silent prayer that mercy may prevail over judgment.144[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-093]Sometimes anagrams highlight affinities between words, as in Genesis 6:8, whereNoah ([image/158.jpg]) found grace ([image/159.jpg]). The word temurah itself([image/160.jpg]) is an anagram of terumah ([image/161.jpg]), “offering.”Qabalists may infer that temurah, rightly practiced, becomes a sort of mysticaloffering.More complex techniques of temurah utilize substitution ciphers or codes.Qabalists use these ciphers to reveal the Bible’s secrets and to conceal theirown. Qabalists frequently use ciphers to write the Tetragrammaton withoutimpiety. The numerous standard ciphers have names summarizing how they work. Forexample, Athbash ([image/162.jpg]) is one of the most popular ciphers:[image/70.jpg], the first letter of the alphabet, becomes [image/112.jpg], thelast, and [image/72.jpg], the second letter, becomes [image/166.png], thepenultimate—hence [image/167.jpg]. Athbash encrypts the Tetragrammaton as[image/168.jpg], often seen on Jewish amulets (Table 2[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor022]).The Athbash ([image/169.jpg]) CipherThe Avgad ([image/170.jpg]) Cipher[image/70.jpg] becomes [image/112.jpg][image/70.jpg] becomes [image/72.jpg][image/72.jpg] becomes [image/110.jpg][image/72.jpg] becomes [image/74.jpg][image/74.jpg] becomes [image/108.jpg][image/74.jpg] becomes [image/76.jpg][image/76.jpg] becomes [image/106.jpg][image/76.jpg] becomes [image/186.jpg][image/186.jpg] becomes [image/188.jpg][image/62.jpg] becomes [image/32.jpg]Table 2. Two Examples of Temurah Cipher (continued)The Athbash ([image/169.jpg]) CipherThe Avgad ([image/170.jpg]) Cipher[image/32.jpg] becomes [image/194.jpg][image/32.jpg] becomes [image/82.jpg][image/82.jpg] becomes [image/198.jpg][image/82.jpg] becomes [image/84.jpg][image/84.jpg] becomes [image/98.jpg][image/84.jpg] becomes [image/86.jpg][image/86.jpg] becomes [image/206.jpg][image/86.jpg] becomes [image/13.jpg][image/13.jpg] becomes [image/210.jpg][image/13.jpg] becomes [image/212.jpg][image/212.jpg] becomes [image/214.jpg][image/212.jpg] becomes [image/214.jpg][image/92.jpg] becomes [image/212.jpg][image/92.jpg] becomes [image/210.jpg][image/210.jpg] becomes [image/13.jpg][image/210.jpg] becomes [image/206.jpg][image/206.jpg] becomes [image/86.jpg][image/206.jpg] becomes [image/98.jpg][image/98.jpg] becomes [image/84.jpg][image/98.jpg] becomes [image/232.jpg][image/100.jpg] becomes [image/82.jpg][image/100.jpg] becomes [image/194.jpg][image/194.jpg] becomes [image/32.jpg][image/194.jpg] becomes [image/188.jpg][image/188.jpg] becomes [image/62.jpg][image/188.jpg] becomes [image/106.jpg][image/106.jpg] becomes [image/76.jpg][image/106.jpg] becomes [image/108.jpg][image/108.jpg] becomes [image/74.jpg][image/108.jpg] becomes [image/110.jpg][image/110.jpg] becomes [image/72.jpg][image/110.jpg] becomes [image/112.jpg][image/112.jpg] becomes [image/70.jpg][image/112.jpg] becomes [image/70.jpg]Table 2. Two Examples of Temurah Cipher (continued)In Avgad ([image/261.jpg]), another popular cipher, each letter becomes the nextletter in the alphabet: [image/70.jpg] becomes [image/72.jpg] and [image/74.jpg]becomes [image/76.jpg]—hence the name [image/266.jpg][image/144.png]. Avgadtransforms the Tetragrammaton into [image/268.jpg], an encrypted name found onmezuzah scrolls.145 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-092]Aiq BekarAnother technique of temurah, aiq bekar ([image/269.jpg]), warrants a separateexplanation. Qabalists use this technique less for decoding the Bible than forencoding names. Aiq bekar takes encryption to another level. This type oftemurah is also the key to understanding the planetary magic squares.146[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-091] Aiq bekar sorts thetwenty-two letters and the five final forms into nine triads or “chambers”(Figure 12 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023]). As thename indicates, the letters [image/270.jpg]—equivalent to 1, 10, 100—form thefirst triad. The letters [image/271.jpg], or 2, 20, 200, form the second. Aiqbekar allows Qabalists to exchange any letter with others from its chamber. Forexample, “mystery” ([image/272.jpg]) can become “son” ([image/273.jpg]) or“truthful” ([image/274.jpg]).3 [image/275.jpg]30 [image/276.jpg]300 [image/277.jpg]2 [image/278.jpg]20 [image/279.jpg]200 [image/280.jpg]1 [image/281.jpg]10 [image/282.jpg]100 [image/283.jpg]6 [image/284.jpg]60 [image/285.jpg]600 [image/286.jpg]5 [image/287.jpg]50 [image/288.jpg]500 [image/289.jpg]4 [image/290.jpg]40 [image/291.jpg]400 [image/292.jpg]9 [image/293.jpg]90 [image/294.jpg]900 [image/295.jpg]8 [image/296.jpg]80 [image/297.jpg]800 [image/298.jpg]7 [image/299.jpg]70 [image/300.jpg]700 [image/301.jpg]Figure 12. The Nine Chambers of Aiq BekarThe nine chambers also function as a substitution cipher. Freemasons andmagicians employ this code, which Agrippa’s Occult Philosophy popularized. Thecipher indicates letters by specifying their location in the nine-chamber gridusing rectilinear figures. It indicates [image/70.jpg] through [image/86.jpg](the units, 1–9) by adding one dot (Figure 13[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor024]). The cipherindicates [image/13.jpg] through [image/188.jpg] (tens, 10–90) with two dots. Itindicates [image/106.jpg] through [image/307.jpg] (hundreds, 100–900) with threedots.147 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-090][image/Book2_Fig14.png]Figure 13. The Nine Chambers Exploded as a Code-Matrix,Showing the Hebrew Alphabet Encrypted by the Aiq Bekar CipherAgrippa also taught how to form characters (sigils) from names encoded by aiqbekar.148 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-089] The procedureis simply to combine the separate rectilinear figures into one. Only themagician who created it can reconstruct the name from the finished character(Figure 14 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025]).[image/Book2_Fig15.png]Figure 14. The Name Abraham in the Aiq Bekar Cipher, and Some Sigils Formed fromItThe nine chambers facilitate a reductive technique of gematria, reducinghundreds or tens to units. Instead of 200, the numerical value of[image/108.jpg] becomes 2. Instead of 20, [image/212.jpg] also becomes 2.149[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-088] For example, “mystery”([image/108.jpg][image/311.png]), normally 200 + 7, becomes 2 + 7 by thistechnique. The numerical value of Ararita changes from 813 to 12. This techniqueof gematria, in turn, facilitates another application of the nine chambers.The use of “magic squares” for talismanic purposes is ancient. The simplestmagic square is a grid of nine compartments. The grid arranges the numbers 1through 9 so that each row adds to 15 (Figure 15[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026]). Qabalists see thissquare as concealing the divine name [image/312.jpg] through gematria. Qabalistsalso see this magic square as the aiq bekar chambers rearranged, so they use itfor encryption, alongside the reductive technique of gematria described above.They first reduce all letters in a word to units. Then they indicate the word,as a series of numbers, with lines on the grid.[image/313.jpg]Figure 15. The Nine Chambers of Aiq Bekar Rearranged as a Magic Square,with the Name Abraham Indicated by Lines Drawn on the SquareFor example, Abraham ([image/314.jpg]) is normally 1 + 2 + 200 + 5 + 40. Thealternate value of final mem makes it 1 + 2 + 200 + 5 + 600. Reduction turnsthese numbers into 1 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 6. On the grid, Abraham begins with a mark inbox 1 (for [image/70.jpg]). (See Figure 15[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026].) From that mark, aline extends to box 2 (for [image/72.jpg]). The next letter ([image/317.png]) isalso a 2, indicated by “a crook or wave in the line.” 150[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-087] The line continues to box5 (for [image/17.jpg]), then ends in box 6 (for [image/319.jpg]). Removed fromthe grid, the lineal figure becomes a mystifying sigil.The Golden Dawn taught the use of aiq bekar and the planetary magic squares. Italso taught a simpler device for generating sigils, the rose of twenty-twopetals (Figure 16 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027]).These petals represent the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, arranged in threeconcentric circles. The inner circle contains the three mother letters. Themiddle circle contains the seven double letters. The outer circle contains thetwelve single letters. Lines drawn from one petal to another form sigils on therose. The process is identical to that used on the magic square.151[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-086][image/Book2_Fig17.png]Figure 16. The Rose of Twenty-Two Petals, with the NameAbraham Indicated by Lines Drawn on the RoseTo summarize these methods, notariqon changes words into other words usingacronyms. Simple temurah does the same using anagrams, while complex temurahuses ciphers. Gematria turns words into numbers. Certain types of temurah—aiqbekar and related techniques—transform names into geometrical abstractions.Some Notes on Qabalah in Ceremonial MagicFrom a strictly qabalistic viewpoint, ceremonial magic comprises severaladvanced applications of temurah. Exchanging letters for symbols, ceremonialmagicians can change names into sequences of colors or stones.152[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-085] They can transform namesinto unique scents by compounding incenses.153[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-084] Magicians can deviseenvironments where every sight, sound, scent, taste, touch, and action invokesone name. The possibilities are numerous.Magical CorrespondencesCeremonial magicians produce these transformations through correspondences(Table 3 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028]). The systemof magical correspondences stems from the Sepher Yetzirah, the foundation bookof Qabalah. The Yetzirah sorts the Hebrew alphabet into three categories. Itspecifies some of the things God created using each letter.Letter and FinalForm (Block Style)Name of Letter in Hebrew (Script Style)Correspondence According to the Sepher YetzirahTarot Correspondence According to the Golden Dawn[image/71.jpg][image/321.jpg]AirThe Fool[image/73.jpg][image/323.jpg]MercuryThe Magician[image/324.jpg][image/325.jpg]MoonThe High Priestess[image/77.jpg][image/327.jpg]VenusThe Empress[image/79.jpg][image/329.jpg] or [image/141.jpg]AriesThe Emperor[image/81.jpg][image/332.jpg]TaurusThe Hierophant[image/333.jpg][image/334.jpg]GeminiThe Lovers[image/85.jpg][image/336.jpg]CancerThe Chariot[image/87.jpg][image/338.jpg]LeoStrength[image/339.jpg][image/340.jpg]VirgoThe Hermit[image/91.jpg][image/342.jpg]JupiterThe Wheel of Fortune[image/93.jpg][image/344.jpg]LibraJustice[image/95.jpg][image/346.jpg]WaterThe Hanged Man[image/97.jpg][image/348.jpg]ScorpioDeath[image/99.jpg][image/350.jpg]SagittariusTemperance[image/101.jpg][image/352.jpg]CapricornThe Devil[image/103.jpg][image/354.jpg] or [image/355.jpg]MarsThe Tower[image/105.jpg][image/357.jpg]AquariusThe Star[image/107.jpg][image/359.jpg]PiscesThe Moon[image/109.jpg][image/361.jpg]SunThe Sun[image/111.jpg][image/363.jpg]FireJudgment[image/113.jpg][image/365.jpg]SaturnThe WorldTable 3. Essential Correspondences of the Hebrew AlphabetEach of the three mother letters ([image/366.jpg]) is unlike any other.154[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-083] These unique letterssuggest the distinct elements. With each mother letter, God formed one of thethree elements that compose all matter.155[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-082]Each of the seven double letters ([image/367.jpg]) represents two sounds. Theletter’s position within a word determines its sound.156[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-081] These changeable letterssuggest the mobility of the planets, or “wandering stars.” With each doubleletter, God formed one of the seven planets of ancient astronomy.Each of the twelve single letters ([image/368.jpg]) represents just onesound.157 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-080] These unvaryingletters suggest the stability of the fixed stars. With each single letter, Godformed one of the twelve constellations in the zodiac.Thus, the Sepher Yetzirah makes the rich symbolism of astrology and alchemy partof qabalistic symbolism. From a magical viewpoint, these yetziraticcorrespondences integrate Qabalah into the Western esoteric tradition.The Golden Dawn adopted the letters’ traditional correspondences to elements,planets, and zodiacal signs. It also correlated the twenty-two letters with thetwenty-two major arcana of the tarot.158[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-079] These essentialcorrespondences are the basis of ceremonial magic.For example, a magician desiring a more balanced life would employ the letter[image/214.jpg]. Lamed corresponds to Libra in the zodiac and Justice in thetarot. An airy sign ruled by Venus, Libra signifies the due balance of intellectand emotion. Accordingly, [image/92.jpg] governs “Works of Justice andEquilibrium.” 159 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-078][image/Book2_Fig18.png]Figure 17. A Talisman Incorporating Correspondences of the Letter Lamed,Employing Notariqon, Gematria, and TemurahA magician could invoke balance with a talisman incorporating symbols thatcorrespond to [image/214.jpg]. The following example is one of many possibledesigns (Figure 17 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029]).The background is the emerald green of Libra.160[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-077] The design features apair of scales in equipoise atop the sword of Justice. The sword alludes to thetarot image and to Libra’s ruling element, air. Above the scales is the nameHagiel ([image/372.jpg]), the intelligence of Libra’s ruling planet, Venus. Thename appears as an aiq bekar sigil, bilaterally symmetrical to representbalance. Hagiel equals 49 (7 × 7), and Libra is the seventh zodiacal sign. Librais the Latin word for a pair of scales. The equivalent Hebrew word, moznayi([image/373.png]), equals 148, and 148 also equals Netzach ([image/374.jpg]),the sephirah of Libra’s ruling planet, Venus. Further, 148 is the sum of thedivine names associated with the supernal triad: Eheieh ([image/375.jpg]) isKether, Yah ([image/376.jpg]) is Chokmah, and Tetragrammaton Elohim([image/377.jpg] [image/378.jpg]) is Binah. These three sephiroth exist ineternal equilibrium. Their positions on the Tree of Life vaguely suggest a pairof scales. So these divine names, abbreviated as [image/379.jpg], empower thetalisman. [image/380.jpg] appears on the right, balanced by [image/381.jpg] onthe left. The palindrome [image/382.jpg] equals 22. Of the traditionalthirty-two paths of wisdom, the twenty-second path is [image/214.jpg]. Thisexample illustrates how easily the use of magical correspondences can mesh withpractical Qabalah.After designing this talisman, the magician would construct it under favorableastrological conditions.161[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-076] The magician would alsoconsecrate the talisman in a ceremony of carefully balanced actions. The altarcloth would be emerald green. The incense would be galbanum. The magician wouldrecite inspiring words about balance and conjure Hagiel to indwell thetalisman.162 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-075]Learning the Language of Magical CorrespondencesOnce the sephiroth and the letters are familiar, students should becomeconversant with the principal correspondences. The elaborate symbolism ofHermetic Qabalah resembles a second language. Students become fluent by using itfrequently. Immersion accelerates the process. Learning this language—likelearning other aspects of Qabalah—mostly requires patience and persistence.An easy way to learn correspondences is to use them playfully in everyday life.The Tree of Life functions as a filing cabinet for the universe. With a littleingenuity, everything will fit somewhere. For example, students may classifycars astrologically or assign cats to the sephiroth.This lighthearted way of assimilating qabalistic symbolism makes an entertaininggame for groups of students. Qabalistic theme parties are helpful too. Forexample, everyone could bring food or music representing Chesed. Groupactivities are always instructive because no two people see symbols quite thesame.Tarot decks incorporating Golden Dawn symbolism can serve as helpful qabalisticflashcards.163 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-074] Ordinarycard games, slightly modified, become surprisingly effective tools for learningtarot correspondences.164 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-073]An excellent method of study is physically interacting with tangible qabalisticsymbols. For example, memorizing that oak represents Geburah is good, butsearching the woods for five perfect oak leaves makes an enduring memory.Contemplating symbolic objects by arranging them on altars is an absorbing,tactile sort of meditation.165[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-072]Few people learn best from rote memorization. However, reviewing lists ofcorrespondences at bedtime is often helpful. It is encouraging (and indicatesreal progress) when qabalistic symbolism begins to appear in dreams.A System of SymbolsFor ceremonial magicians, Qabalah is first and foremost an immense system ofsymbols. The Sepher Yetzirah established the system; medieval Qabalists expandedit. Agrippa tabulated their system of correspondences; the Golden Dawn schoolembellished Agrippa’s work. Hermetic Qabalah encompasses the symbolism ofastrology, tarot, and other esoteric traditions. The result is not just ahodgepodge of symbols but an orderly system. This systematic structure is whatmakes qabalistic symbolism so powerful.The prosaic rational mind articulates systems; the poetic intuitive mind speaksin symbols. Only in conjunction can these opposite mentalities create—orunderstand—a system of symbols. The qabalistic symbol system unites opposites,resolves dichotomies, and bridges worlds. Qabalah provides a common languagebetween waking life and dream, between mundane and magical realms. Qabalah isnot the only such language, but it proffers the largest vocabulary of any.In other words, qabalistic symbolism is excellent for interpreting dreams andoracles. Qabalistic symbolism is equally useful for devising sigils, talismans,magical formulas, and rituals. For knowing oneself or for communicating one’swill to the universe, qabalistic symbolism is unsurpassed.It is no coincidence that the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is purelyqabalistic. Students of ceremonial magic begin their practice with this classic,paradigmatic ritual.166 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-071]They visualize the sephiroth, intone divine names while visualizing Hebrewletters, and internalize elemental correspondences. This simple ritualdemonstrates the essential unity of qabalistic symbolism and ceremonial magic.Similarly, it is no coincidence that the discipline of astral travel relies onQabalah. The Tree of Life serves as a map for the astral traveler. The methodsof practical Qabalah function as a traveler’s phrasebook for the astral realm.Qabalistic symbolism provides a systematic itinerary of astral exploration and alexicon for interpreting experiences.Magical FormulasQabalistically speaking, the construction of magical formulas combinescorrespondences with notariqon. Magicians transmute words (usually divine names)into symbolic structures or patterns of ritual action. This is less abstrusethan it sounds.For example, the Tetragrammaton—the preeminent magical formula—is the true nameof the Creator. The four letters yod heh vau heh therefore symbolize all ofcreation. Magicians identify the letters with the elements composing thematerial world—fire, water, air, earth. They assign the letters and elements tothe four directions—south, west, east, north. The result is a sort of qabalisticmandala representing the totality of existence. This mandala could be a circledivided into quarters or an altar displaying four symbols.167[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-070] This is the static aspectof a magical formula, functioning as a symbolic structure.The Tetragrammaton can also function as a pattern of ritual action. In thisdynamic aspect, the name of the Creator symbolizes the process of creation. Thefour letters traditionally correspond with the four worlds—Atziluth, Beriah,Yetzirah, Assiah. The letters yod heh vau heh likewise correspond with Father,Mother, Son, Daughter. (This universal formula embraces both macrocosmiccreation and microcosmic procreation.) The result is a ceremony symbolizing thedivine creative work. It could be a fourfold ritual summoning elemental forcesor a four-stage invocation.A previous example illustrates both aspects of the Tetragrammaton formula inuse. The talisman for a more balanced life suggests the Tetragrammaton by itscruciform arrangement (Figure 17[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#_idTextAnchor029]). The four Hebrewletters on the talisman allude to the Tetragrammaton through practicalQabalah.168 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-069] Theconsecration ritual would occur within a quartered circle, ideally in a squaretemple. On the altar would be the equal-armed Cross of Equilibrium. Theconsecration would culminate in a fourfold invocation of the powers of Netzach.The magician would invoke the deity, the archangel, the angelic choir, andfinally the intelligence.169[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-068] These four stages ofinvocation represent manifestation through the four worlds.The formula of Tetragrammaton is by no means the only magical formula. AleisterCrowley devoted several chapters of Magick in Theory and Practice to magicalformulas. He succinctly declared that “every true name of God gives the formulaof the invocation of that God.” 170[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-067]Magicians sometimes abbreviate complex sequences of symbols, even entire seriesof rituals, into magical formulas. For example, the Golden Dawn conferredinitiatory rituals corresponding to earth, air, water, fire, and spirit. Thefamiliar archangels Auriel, Raphael, Gabriel, and Michael rule the fourelements. Adding Nuriel (the ruler of the fifth element) produces the previouslymentioned acronym argaman ([image/384.jpg]), “purple.” This terse invocation ofarchangels is the formula of the Golden Dawn’s elemental initiations. A singleword encapsulates all five initiatory ceremonies and years of concomitant study.Further StudyQabalah does not appeal to everyone. Some readers may find it boring orbefuddling. We assure them it is possible to practice ceremonial magic withoutmastering Qabalah. On the other hand, some readers may already feel thefascination of this ancient tradition. We assure them Qabalah can deepen theirunderstanding, empower their magic, and enrich their lives.Qabalah is a huge field of study, steadily expanding. Students at any level willfind an overwhelming wealth of information.Lon Milo DuQuette’s Chicken Qabalah offers a painless, entertaining introductionto modern Hermetic Qabalah. Israel Regardie’s Garden of Pomegranates is moreserious in tone. Anita Kraft’s Qabalah Workbook for Magicians offers a hands-onapproach to learning about the sephiroth.A useful survey of Jewish mysticism is David Ariel’s Kabbalah. An updatededition of his Mystic Quest, it presents scholarly information for generalreaders.We suggest that beginning students study several secondary sources beforereading actual qabalistic texts. It helps to become familiar with theterminology and symbolism beforehand: medieval Qabalists generally wrote forinitiates, not for curious outsiders.The Sepher Yetzirah is available in many English translations, most of themannotated. Aryeh Kaplan’s Sefer Yetzirah is thorough. Kaplan also translated andannotated The Bahir. The Zohar is a substantial work. A few excerpts appear inGershom Scholem’s Zohar: The Book of Splendor. More excerpts appear in DanielMatt’s Zohar: The Book of Enlightenment. Considerably more excerpts appear inIsaiah Tishby’s three-volume Wisdom of the Zohar.Students seeking a more nuanced understanding of Qabalah should acquaintthemselves with Judaism in general. Helpful topics include the Bible and theTalmud, plus Jewish liturgy, customs, history, and folklore. Even the slightestacquaintance with Hebrew helps in studying Qabalah of any kind. A little Latinhelps in studying Hermetic Qabalah.Over time, the study of Qabalah instills mental habits, subtly shaping the waystudents think. Thus, Qabalah may have benefits extending beyond the esotericrealm into ordinary life. A few examples come readily to mind: not surprisingly,they fall into a familiar pattern. Students of Qabalah learn to believe inthemselves and trust their inspirations (Kether). Thus, they think creatively,disregarding convention (Chokmah) while knowing their personal limitations(Binah). Students work with joy and a certain playfulness (Chesed), balanced bydetermination and discipline (Geburah), so they learn to see harmoniousconnections between apparent opposites (Tiphareth). Students of Qabalahcultivate the complementary powers of unrestrained imagination (Netzach) andorganized memory (Hod). Combining these powers, they improve their skill increative visualization (Yesod). Ultimately, they learn to integrate disparateinformation into a unified body of knowledge (Malkuth). Note that the mentalhabits on the right-hand pillar pertain to liberty, while those on the leftpertain to discipline. The habits on the middle pillar complete the threetriads, and Malkuth integrates everything.A Note of CautionAnything powerful is dangerous. Intensive study of Qabalah involves realpsychological perils. For example, some students become obsessed with gematria,mistaking irrational notions for mathematical certainties. Students can reducetheir risk of obsession by maintaining balance and not revering gematria unduly.Furthermore, some students of Qabalah develop grandiose delusions, mistakingthemselves for Chosen Ones. (Self-proclaimed Messiahs are rife throughoutqabalistic history; sometimes their followers suffered greatly.) Students canreduce their risk of messianic ideation by staying humble and laughing atthemselves.A good defense against all such dangers is “hearty human companionship,” 171[LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-066] ideally within anesoteric fraternity. “Initiation is a preservative against the false lights ofmysticism.” 172 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-065] The earlyJewish mystics, understanding the dangers of their tradition, forbade solitarystudy.Rightly practiced, Qabalah itself can help students avoid its dangers. Qabalahteaches balance, extolling equilibrium as divine perfection. Qabalah alsoteaches humility, perpetually reminding students of how little they know.A Final ThoughtNo one can master all qabalistic lore in one lifetime. Ceremonial magicianscannot rival the depth of learning that initiates of Jewish Qabalah attain.Magicians can, however, cultivate a breadth of learning that the Orthodoxdisregard. Renaissance humanism still inspires Hermetic Qabalah; ceremonialmagic still seeks harmony, synthesis, and universal truth.So magicians can apply methods of practical Qabalah to sacred texts in Greek orEnglish. They can use structures of theoretical Qabalah to understand theSumerian pantheon or Ismaili cosmology. They can examine parallels betweenPalace texts and Masonic or Mithraic initiations. They can explore similaritiesbetween Hasidic prayer and Tantric or Thelemic ritual. They can employqabalistic symbolism to interpret their dreams or their initiatory experiences.They can adapt Abulafia’s teachings to invoke their Holy Guardian Angels or toseek divine union. Ceremonial magicians can do a lot with Qabalah.Bibliography of Works ConsultedAdler, Herbert M., and Arthur Davis, eds.

Scholars ofJudaism usually transliterate the word as Kabbalah, while scholars of theRenaissance often favor Cabala. Ceremonial magicians tend to prefer Qabalah.These are all valid ways of representing the word in our alphabet, althoughQabalah better approximates the Hebrew orthography. We have generallytransliterated Hebrew words as the Golden Dawn did: we assume most students ofceremonial magic will find sephiroth more recognizable than sfirot. Since ourcriterion was familiarity, our transliterations are not uniform and do notalways reflect Hebrew spelling.67 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-170-backlink]. Jewishmystics began calling their work Qabalah in the twelfth century. Therefore,academic usage defines Qabalah exclusively as Jewish mysticism from the MiddleAges onward. Yet medieval mysticism developed from ancient tradition. So, inpopular usage, Qabalah embraces the whole evolution of Jewish mysticism.68 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-169-backlink]. Fine, SafedSpirituality, 17. Gershom Scholem calls Qabalah “deeply conservative andintensely revolutionary,” Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 120. Scholemdiscusses this central paradox of mysticism in On the Kabbalah and ItsSymbolism, 7–11.69 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-168-backlink]. These briefsketches of qabalistic history summarize several historical surveys (whichsometimes disagree on details). We make no claim to original scholarship. Also,we gratefully acknowledge a substantial debt to Hava Tirosh-Rothschild, whoselectures on the history of Jewish mysticism (Indiana University, autumn 1993)inspired us to learn a little more.70 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-167-backlink]. Theapocalyptic books of Enoch, no longer canonical, include revelations ofastronomical and meteorological mysteries.71 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-166-backlink]. Several ofthese books survive. Some are mystical, others clearly magical. For example, thefourth-century Sepher ha-Razim (The Book of the Mysteries) resembles a grimoire:it lists the angels of the seven palaces and what powers each can confer.72 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-165-backlink] . God’s truename consists of the Hebrew letters yod heh vau heh. Tradition forbids speakingit, or even writing it unnecessarily. Tetragrammaton, “four-letter name,” is oneof several substitutes for this sacrosanct and powerful word. The ineffable nameis prominent throughout Jewish mysticism.73 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-164-backlink] . Anoften-repeated tale from the Babylonian Talmud (Chagigah 14b) names fourmystical companions. Only one returned unscathed from his experience. See Ariel,The Mystic Quest, 20, and Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 52–53.74 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-163-backlink] . The date ofthe Yetzirah is uncertain. Scholars place it anywhere from the first to thesixth century.75 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-162-backlink]. Friedman,The Book of Creation, 1.76 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-161-backlink]. The pluralending for feminine nouns in Hebrew is -oth (rhyming with English both). Hence,one sephirah ([image/385.jpg]) but ten sephiroth ([image/386.jpg]).77 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-160-backlink]. The numeroustranslations of the Sepher Yetzirah disagree on many points, large and small. Weadvise studying more than one translation.78 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-159-backlink]. Or perhapsmysticism died out in the West and Eastern masters reintroduced it. Lackingevidence, historians can only guess about Jewish mysticism in the Dark Ages.79 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-158-backlink].

Countingthe names of letters, instead of the letters themselves, is a specific techniqueof gematria. Qabalists call it mispar shemi, or “name number.” Our otherexamples of gematria are mispar hekhrechi, “essential number,” the simplest andcommonest form. Schochet lists a dozen different techniques of gematria in “ThePrinciple of Numerical Interpretation,” in Locks, The Spice of Torah, XXI–XXIV.138 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-099-backlink].

The Golden Dawn advisedspelling out the Tetragrammaton rather than speaking some approximation likeJehovah: see Regardie, The Golden Dawn, 53.

Using alternatevalues for final forms is another specific technique of gematria—mispar gadol,or “big number.” Hermetic Qabalists seem to use it more than Jewish Qabalists,presumably because of Reuchlin’s exposition of the alphabet: see On the Art ofthe Kabbalah, 317.141 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-096-backlink].

Thistechnique of gematria is mispar qatan, or “little number.” See Schochet, “ThePrinciple of Numerical Interpretation,” in Locks, The Spice of Torah, XXI–XXII.Aiq bekar relies on the alternate numerical values of the final forms, explainedpreviously. So in this context, mispar qatan works in conjunction with mispargadol, or “big number.”150 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-087-backlink].

This “rose” appeared onthe lamen of the Golden Dawn’s secret Second Order. Depictions of the Rose-CrossLamen sometimes scramble the correct arrangement of letters. The arrangementdepends on the King Scale colors corresponding to the letters. The middle circlegoes counterclockwise in standard rainbow sequence, from red to violet.152 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-085-backlink].

Magicalliterature usually mentions four elements—earth, water, air, fire—and often addsspirit, the fifth element. But there are only three mother letters, so theSepher Yetzirah mentions only three elements. The Golden Dawn circumvented thisdifficulty by assigning secondary correspondences to two letters. Thus,[image/409.jpg] represents the element of earth as well as the planet Saturn,and [image/405.jpg] represents spirit as well as fire.156 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-081-backlink]. Initialletters are always hard sounds: [image/411.jpg] is a hard b in binah([image/412.jpg]), “understanding.” Final letters are always soft sounds:[image/411.jpg] is a soft v in kokav ([image/414.jpg]), “star.” Either sound canoccur in the middle of words. Thus, [image/411.jpg] is a hard b in qabalah([image/416.jpg]), “tradition,” but a soft v in gevurah ([image/417.jpg]),“strength.” Although the fourth-century Yetzirah designated [image/418.jpg] adouble letter, [image/418.jpg] represents only one sound today. Aryeh Kaplandiscusses this puzzle in his Sefer Yetzirah, 160–161.157 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-080-backlink]. In fact,the consonants [image/420.jpg] and [image/421.jpg] sometimes represent vowelsounds.158 [LCBCeremonialMagick01_Book1and2-2.xhtml#footnote-079-backlink]. Manymanuscripts of the Sepher Yetzirah exist, with many variations. They commonlydisagree about which planets correspond to which double letters. The Golden Dawntherefore created its own arrangement, assigning planets based on theirastrological sympathy with the associated tarot cards. So Venus goes with theEmpress ([image/422.jpg]), while Mercury goes with the Magician([image/411.jpg]).

Lévi,Transcendental Magic, 93."},{"pageContent":"Book ThreePlanetary Magicby David RankineSince the astrologers of the first civilization in ancient Sumer identified theseven classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn), theinfluence of the wandering stars, or deathless powers, as they were known, haspermeated the Western Mystery Tradition for more than 5,000 years. The planetsrepresent the higher powers of the universe, their orbits the cycles ofenergetic currents that surround us and can be felt at times subtly or moreobviously in our lives. Humanity has looked to the heavens for guidance andmeaning, interpreting the celestial as divine and recognizing the interplay ofheaven and earth—As above, so below.The presence of the planetary energies is always all around us though, found inthe days of the week in various languages, the sevenfold symbolism appearingrepeatedly from rainbow to heptatonic scales in music. Across ancient cultures,the deities of the planets shared qualities that emphasized the qualities of theplanetary energies and have become the accepted perceptions across cultures,such as Venus with love, Mercury with communication, the Sun with wealth, etc.These qualities form the symbol sets of colours, scents, crystals, planets,animals, etc., for each planet.The deities associated with the planets have been perceived in basically thesame way for more than two millennia, resulting in a tremendous buildup of powerin their images and symbols as connecting gateways to them. They take theirnames from the Roman gods: Sol, Mercury, Venus, Luna, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.Most of these planetary gods were part of an extended family within the Romanpantheon, which also includes the gods of the trans-Saturnian planets (named inrecent centuries after those gods by astronomers for consistency).The family tree shows:• Uranus is the father of Saturn and Venus• Saturn is the father of Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto• Jupiter is the father of Mercury and MarsThe two luminaries of the Sun and Moon, or Sol and Luna, were brother andsister, and come from an earlier line, derived from the Greek Titans Hyperionand Theia, as opposed to the Olympians attributed to the other planets. Thisseparation of the seven into five “real” planets and two luminaries (Sun andMoon) occurs frequently in planetary attributions. The Romans equated their owndeities to those of the earlier Greeks, and in so doing they absorbed many ofthe qualities and myths of the Greek deities into their own. As a result, itwould be more accurate to say that the planetary gods in the Western MysteryTradition are Romano-Greek in nature.The attribution of deities to the seven classical planets began with theSumerians (who, through cultural shifts and conflicts, became the Babylonians),which may have provided the inspiration for the Greeks. When the Greeksconquered the ancient Babylonians, they named the planets after the deities intheir own pantheon with corresponding qualities. This sequence of attributionsis shown in Table 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor031].PlanetBabylonianGreekRomanCommon QualitiesSunShamashHeliosSolSolar godsMercuryNebuHermesMercuryMessengers of the godsVenusIshtarAphroditeVenusGoddesses of loveMoonSinSeleneLunaLunar deitiesMarsNergalAresMarsWar godsJupiterMardukZeusJupiterFather gods, bringers of orderSaturnNinibKronosSaturnPlanters of seedsTable 1. The Pantheons and Their Planetary Attributions“We are also to show forth, what Divine, gifts, powers & Virtues, man receivethfrom the celestial bodies (that is) the seven planets; called by the Astrologersthe seven erratic or wandering Stars.” 1[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-215]Working with planetary deities is beneficial through receiving energy from thedeity to assist your work or striving toward a greater purity and powerexpressed by the deity (theurgy). Both these approaches, like the gods, are notnew, and are seen in ancient Greek writings, with requests for divine aidpermeating practical magical work such as the Greek Magical Papyri (fourthcentury BCE—fifth century CE). It is also seen in more devotional writings likethe Orphic Hymns (third century CE), where offerings were made to the deitybeing praised with hymns to encourage a gift of divine energy.Theurgic practice was the core of Neoplatonism and was written about at lengthby philosophers such as Plotinus (205–270 CE), Iamblichus (c. 245–325 CE),Proclus (412–485 CE), and pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (sixth century CE).Pseudo-Dionysius is of particular significance, as he marks a conflation ofNeoplatonism with Christianity. This theme is also seen in the development ofsome grimoires where the influence of the planetary gods is visible, like thefifteenth-century Greek Hygromanteia, which is the precursor to the Key ofSolomon. This theme of Christian Neoplatonic style was revived by MarsilioFicino (1433–1499 CE) in the Renaissance, with his translation of the works ofthe aforementioned philosophers as well as the significant Corpus Hermeticum,which contributed to the development of the Hermetic tradition.Planetary SymbolsThe alchemical and hermetic writings of the Middle Ages and Renaissancecontained numerous symbols for the classical planets, with the symbols that havebecome standardised first reproduced in 1482 CE in Poeticon Astronomicon, theItalian publication of Hyginus. The planetary symbols are all made fromcombinations of three constituent parts: the circle, the crescent, and theequal-armed cross.Sun[image/427.png]The symbol of the Sun is a circle with a dot in the centre. The circlerepresents the life-giving energies of the infinite, the cycle of life, death,and rebirth. The central dot emphasises the primal nature of these energies, andthe vital nature of the sun for life on Earth. The absence of anything connectedto the circle indicates the way the solar energy emanates universally, sometimesshown by rays coming off the circle in all directions.Mercury[image/428.png]The symbol of Mercury is a circle atop an equal-armed cross, with a crescenthorns-up intersecting the top of the circle. Here the life essence of the circleis conjoined with the crescent of time, dominating the cross of matter. Theunion of time and life emphasises the quicksilver nature of Mercury, speedingover the elemental cross. As the crescent only slightly touches the circle, itcan be seen that Mercury’s influence is one of subtlety rather than directaction.Venus[image/429.png]The symbol of Venus depicts a circle atop an equal-armed cross. The life-givingenergies of the circle dominate the cross of matter. This form shows the powerof Venus as the force of generation and attraction, with the essence of lifedominating the physical world.Moon[image/430.png]The symbol of the Moon is a crescent usually facing to the left, or occasionallyto the right. The cyclic nature of the Moon is entirely indicated by its symbolof the crescent, which changes form through every part of the lunar cycle.Mars[image/431.png]The symbol of Mars is a circle with an arrow (originally an equal-armed cross)connected to it at the northeast point of the circle. It emphasises the energyand vitality of Mars, with the life-giving circle expressing its energy throughaction, indicated by the arrow being at a diagonal and to the upper right(corresponding to the right arm and hand, the dominant active force in mostpeople).Jupiter[image/432.png]The symbol of Jupiter is an equal-armed cross with a left-facing crescent joinedto the left-hand arm of the cross. The emphasis is on expansion rather thancontraction, with the crescent facing outward, expressing the balance of formoutward in time producing change, rather than limiting it inward to a staticstate.Saturn[image/433.png]The symbol of Saturn is an equal-armed cross with a left-facing crescentattached to the bottom of the cross by its upper tip. This symbolicallyexpresses the qualities of Saturn, with the equal-armed cross of matter and formdominating the crescent, which represents time in the context of the lunar cycleof ebb and flow. The Saturn symbol is thus one of solidity and its restriction.In the ancient world, rulership of different parts of the body was attributed tothe planets. This was known as melothesic (zodiacal) man, and it was believedthat by working with the appropriate planets, healing could be performed on thebody (Table 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor032]). Theseattributions developed into the astrological rulership of the body by the twelveastrological signs (which are of course ruled by the planets). The planets werealso attributed to human life, being known as the Seven Ages of Man. Shakespearereferred to this in his famous quote in As You Like It (act 2, scene 7), whichbegins, “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.”PlanetMelothesic ManPlanetary AgeVirtueMoonSense of taste, left-hand side, belly, stomach, wombFirst Age of Man—birth to 4 years oldGrowthMercurySpeech and thought, bile, buttocks, tongueSecond Age of Man—5 to 14 yearsEducationVenusSense of smell, liver, fleshThird Age of Man—15 to 22 yearsEmotionSunSense of sight, right-hand side, brain, heart, sinewsFourth Age of Man—23 to 41 yearsVirilityMarsGenitals, kidneys, left ear, veinsFifth Age of Man—42 to 56 yearsAmbitionJupiterSense of touch, arteries, lungs, semenSixth Age of Man—57 to 68 yearsReflectionSaturnBladder, bones, phlegm, right ear, spleenSeventh Age of Man—69 years to end of lifeResignationTable 2. The Planets, the Human Body, and the Ages of ManPlanetary Magic and KabbalahThe Hebrew attributions to the planets date back to the roots of the JewishKabbalah (first to second centuries CE). These were subsequently reinforced bythe synthesis of kabbalistic material into the grimoires with their largelyplanetary focus during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, feeding heavily into theWestern Mystery Tradition. At first glance the seven classical planets might notseem a good fit onto the ten sephiroth (“emanations”) of the Tree of Life, butthere is a long tradition and history of planetary associations with theKabbalah (Figure 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor033]).2[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-214]The planetary influence in Kabbalah can be seen in the two mystical schools thatcombined in the later practices: Maaseh Merkavah (Workings of the Chariot),which primarily emphasised the first chapter of the book of Ezekiel, and MaasehBereshith (Workings of the Beginning), which focused around the first chapter ofthe book of Genesis. The word merkavah (“chariot”) refers to the vision ofEzekiel’s chariot found in the book of Ezekiel in the Bible. The Merkavahmystic, or rider, sought to gain entry to the presence of God on his thronethrough fasting and repetitious use of hymns and prayers. When the rider was intrance, he would send his spirit up through the Seven Palaces, using acombination of magical amulets and long, memorized incantations to ensure thathe passed the guardian angels and demons of the palace gates.The Merkavah cosmology is specifically planetary, focusing on the sephiroth thatcorrespond to the seven classical planets, from Yesod, the sephira of the Moon,up to Binah, the sephira of Saturn, these being the seven planets he traversedleaving Malkuth (the earthly realm) to ascend to the divine presence. Echoes ofthe Merkavah tradition can be found in the grimoires, from the use of planetaryamulets and long invocations to fasting and prayers for purification.[image/Book3_Fig1.png]Figure 1. Image of the Tree of Life Showing Sephiroth with PlanetaryAttributionsIn the Maaseh Bereshith school of Kabbalah, the planetary influence is againsignificant. The earliest and arguably most significant kabbalistic text, theSepher Yetzirah (Book of Formation) was written in the first or second centuryCE. Chapter 4 of the six within it focuses on the sevenfold associations of theplanets and their connections.Seven doubles: ….And with them He formed,Seven planets in the Universe,Seven days in the Year,Seven gates in the Soul, male and female.3[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-213]The “seven doubles” refers to the seven double letters of the Hebrew alphabet,so-called as there are two ways of pronouncing each letter depending on theirposition in a word. The seven double letters correspond to the planetarysephiroth on the Tree of Life, which directly relate to the days of the week, asdescribed in creation (i.e., the book of Genesis). The six planetary sephirothof Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiphareth, Geburah, and Chesed correspond to the daysfrom Sunday to Friday and are known as Sephiroth ha-Benyin (the “Sephiroth ofConstruction”), with the sephira of Binah corresponding to the sabbath, whichtakes its name from the Hebrew word for Saturn, Shabbathai. From this sevenfoldsymbolism a whole range of other associated qualities are used in Kabbalah,including the concept of the Cube of Space, with the six directions and thecentre corresponding to the seven planets.Types of Planetary Magic and Spiritual CreaturesPlanetary magic usually falls into three main areas of work: talismanic,theurgic, and spirit work. The creation of amulets (for protective qualities)and talismans (for attractive qualities) occurred with great frequency in theancient world, and manifested strongly through the Renaissance grimoires,especially the planetary pentacles of the Key of Solomon. The planetary energiesare seen as being stronger on their day of the week and during the hours of theday that they govern. For this reason, planetary magic is always done on the dayof the planet where possible, and definitely during the hours of the planet.Planetary HoursPlanetary hours can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where the priestsattributed a different ruling god to each of the twenty-four hours of the day.The ancient Greeks adopted this idea and adapted it into the system that we arefamiliar with.Planetary hours are not the sixty-minute hours that we are accustomed to usingin normal timekeeping. The period of daylight that extends from sunrise tosunset is divided into the twelve “hours” of the day. The period of darknessextending from sunset to sunrise of the next day is divided into the twelve“hours” of night. As the duration of daylight and darkness varies, the planetaryhours are sometimes called the “unequal hours.”Almanacs, ephemerides, and the internet are all sources you can use to discoverthe sunrise and sunset times, enabling you to calculate the planetary hours inadvance and time your ceremonies appropriately.Table 3 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034] and Table 4[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor035] give attributions forplanetary hours of the day and night.HourSundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday1SunMoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenusSaturn2VenusSaturnSunMoonMarsMercuryJupiter3MercuryJupiterVenusSaturnSunMoonMars4MoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenusSaturnSun5SaturnSunMoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenus6JupiterVenusSaturnSunMoonMarsMercury7MarsMercuryJupiterVenusSaturnSunMoon8SunMoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenusSaturn9VenusSaturnSunMoonMarsMercuryJupiter10MercuryJupiterVenusSaturnSunMoonMars11MoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenusSaturnSun12SaturnSunMoonMarsMercuryJupiterVenusTable 3.

Attributions of Planetary Hours of the NightExample Calculation: Mercurial HoursWednesday is the day of Mercury. The process is then as follows.Consulting an almanac, you see the sun rises at 7:00 a.m. that day and sets at8:48 p.m. So the hours of daylight are from 07:00 to 20:48, giving 13 hours and48 minutes.13 × 60 + 48 = 828 minutes of daylight848 ÷ 12 = 69This means each of the 12 daylight “hours” will be 69 minutes long.Consulting Table 3 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034], yousee that the first and eighth daylight hours of Wednesday are ruled by Mercury.So for the first hour of the day, the ritual should be performed between 7:00a.m. and 8:09 a.m. (69 minutes).For the eighth hour, further calculation is needed:Add together the “hour” length for 7 “hours” (7 × 69 = 483 minutes, or 8 hoursand 3 minutes). Then add this to the sunrise time (7:00 a.m. + 8 hours and 3minutes = 3:03 p.m.).This means the eighth hour starts at 3:03 p.m. and finishes at 4:12 p.m. (3:03 +69 minutes).The Middle Ages and Renaissance also saw the clear codification of planetaryspiritual creatures into hierarchies, with the archangels ruling, each withtheir order of angels beneath them. Each planet also has a planetaryintelligence (or angel), which serves to control the planetary spirit (ordemon). Distinct from this hierarchy are the seven Olympic spirits, which differfrom most angels and demons in that they are said to be comprised of the fourelements rather than the more common, purest form of air (or occasionally fire),which is said to form their bodies.The planetary archangels can be seen as overseers, directing the energy of theplanets. You should call to the archangels to direct a particular planetaryenergy into your ceremony. In contrast, the angels can be seen as the workforceunder the archangels, who enact their will. The planetary intelligences embodythe positive qualities of their planets and act as the overseeing focus for theplanetary spirits, which are comprised of ungoverned, pure planetary energywithout focus. The planetary spirit should always be directed by the appropriateplanetary intelligence or archangel. The planetary intelligences and spirits aremainly worked with for making and empowering amulets and talismans.This is the influence of the seven planets,are principally drawn from the Superior Angelical powers,& Celestial intelligent Angels, as aforesaid,Disposing the soul of man, which is the seat of those Virtues. 4[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-212]This sequence of overseeing is best illustrated in the Hygromanteia, whichcontains a list of planetary demons for every hour of the day for the wholeweek, and their corresponding controlling angels. The process of conjurationbegins by calling on the planetary god first, then the angel, then the demon,who all have specific functions they are called for.The nine orders of angels were first listed by pseudo-Dionysus the Areopagite inThe Celestial Hierarchy around 500 CE, and this has been the accepted hierarchyof the angelic orders ever since (Table 5[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor036]). The planetaryintelligences (and spirits) first appear in Agrippa’s Three Books of OccultPhilosophy, published in 1531–1533 CE, though they were drafted around 1508–1509CE. It is very unlikely that Agrippa would have made them up, and he probablylearned about them from his teacher, the Abbot Trithemius. The source of theirorigin remains a mystery at this point.HeavenDivine NamePlanetNumberArchangelOrder of AngelsIntelligencesSpiritSuperior Hierarchy1MetatronSeraphim2RazielCherubim7Yahveh ElohimSaturn3TzaphkielThronesAgielZazelMiddle Hierarchy6ElJupiter4TzadkielDominationsJophielHismael5Elohim GiborMars5KhamaelPowersGraphielBartzabel4Eloa va-daathSun6MichaelVirtuesNakhielSorathInferior Hierarchy3Jahveh SabaothVenus7UrielPrincipalitiesHagielKedemel2Elohim SabaothMercury8RaphaelArchangelsTirielTaphthartharath1Shaddai El ChiMoon9GabrielAngelsMalka 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-211]SchadTable 5. Planetary HierarchyIn contrast to both talismanic and spirit work, which are external, the theurgicpractice of planetary magic is more internal. Theurgy seeks to refine thespiritual nature of the magician in a quest for the qualities of perfectionembodied by the planetary gods. As alchemy has the six inner white and six outerred steps (the zodiacal twelve, ruled by the planets), so too does planetarymagic encourage inner transformation and outer manifestation through these areasof practice. Devotional practices, including meditation, contemplation, and theuse of hymns (prose that praises the divine), are all theurgic practices.Use of the KameasThe names of the planetary spiritual creatures are converted into sigils onplanetary magic number squares known as kameas. Sigils may be a pictorialdepiction of a name (as here) or of an intent (discussed below). The kameas havea number of rows and columns equal to the planetary number (so 3 × 3 for Saturn,4 × 4 for Jupiter, etc.), and every row, column, and diagonal add up to the samenumber. As the names of all these spiritual creatures are Hebrew, and everyletter of the Hebrew alphabet has a numerical value, the name of the spiritualcreature can be converted to a series of numbers and mapped onto the appropriatekamea, creating its sigil. The possible problem of letters with numericalequivalents higher than the numerical range contained within the kamea is solvedby a process of numerical reduction called Aiq Beker, or the Qabalah of NineChambers (Table 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037]). Thename Aiq Beker comes from the attribution of the letters to the first twochambers, hence AIQ (Aleph, Yod, Qoph) BKR (Beth, Kaph, Resh).1Aleph (A: 1)Yod (I, Y: 10)Qoph (Q: 100)2Beth (B: 2)Kaph (K: 20)Resh (R: 200)3Gimel (G: 3)Lamed (L: 30)Shin (Sh: 300)4Daleth (D: 4)Mem (M: 40)Tav (Th: 400)5Heh (H, E: 5)Nun (N: 50)Final Kaph (K: 500)6Vav (V, O, U: 6)Samekh (S: 60)Final Mem (M: 600)7Zain (Z: 7)Ayin (Aa, O, Ngh: 70)Final Nun (N: 700)8Cheth (Ch: 8)Peh (P, Ph: 80)Final Peh (P, Ph: 800)9Teth (T: 9)Tzaddi (Tz: 90)Final Tzaddi (Tz: 900)Table 6. Aiq BekerIf the letter has a higher number than found in the kamea, the number is droppedto the highest number available in the appropriate square of the Aiq Beker table(e.g., 200 down to 20). The guidelines for drawing sigils in this manner are:• Work out the numerical sequence for the Hebrew letters of the name.• A circle is usually drawn in the square where the sigil begins and ends. A barcan also be drawn across the starting line in place of a circle to mark thebeginning or end of the name.• When a name starts and ends in the same square, the sigil can be “closed” byjoining the end of the final line to the beginning of the first line.• If a name begins with two letters with the same numerical value, a bifurcationlike a curvy m may be used, with the line to the next square drawn from thecentre of the bifurcation.• When two consecutive letters within a name have the same numerical value, asmall loop is drawn resembling a curvy u, with additional u’s for eachadditional consecutive repetition of the same numerical value.Example of Sigil ConstructionFollowing the guidelines described, here is the process for the Saturnianplanetary intelligence Agiel. The name Agiel is written in Hebrew as AGIAL,which converts to the numerical sequence of 1 (A), 3 (G), 10 (I), 1 (A), 30 (L).The Saturn kamea contains the numerical range 1–9, so by Aiq Beker the 10 isreduced to 1 and the 30 is reduced to 3. The sequence of numbers for drawing thesigil then becomes 1, 3, 1, 1, 3.492357816The first number is 1 (for A), so a circle is drawn in the centre of the squarecorresponding to 1 (Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038]). The second number is3 (for G), so a line is drawn from the circle to the square corresponding to 3.The third number is a 1 (for I, reduced from 10), so a u is drawn and a linedrawn to the square for the number 1. The next letter in the name is A, alsowith a numeration of 1, so a double u is drawn to show that there are twoconsecutive letters attributed to this number. Finally the line is drawn to thesquare with 3 again (for L, reduced from 30 to 3). As this is the last letter ofthe sigil, the end is marked with a small circle.The sigils for the Olympic spirits are not drawn using this principle, as theyare Greek in origin and their creation was not through this technique, whichuses Hebrew.The technique for creating sigils on kameas can also be used to create a sigilof your intent to use on an amulet or talisman. You can apply exactly the sametechniques but use English (or another language that is your primary one) forthe word or word sequence. It is best to keep the intent concise and precise orthe sigil may become complicated. The benefits of using this English alphabetform of kamea sigilisation is its simplicity, with the numbers always in the 1–9range (Table 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor036]).[image/Book3_Fig2.png]Figure 2. Example of Sigil Construction1A, J, S2B, K, T3C, L, U4D, M, V5E, N, W6F, O, X7G, P, Y8H, Q, Z9I, RTable 7. English-Language Table for Sigil MakingSo if you were to make a sigil for the intent “I will pass my exam,” it would beformed using this sequence:IWILLPASSMYEXAM151337111475614Looking at the table of types of planetary magic (listed in the “PlanetaryAmulets and Talismans” section later in this book), you would choose theMercurial kamea, which is 8 × 8. Note that with the two 3s and three 1stogether, there will be a double and a triple loop in the sigil.The Planetary KameasAlthough the use of the kameas for creating sigils was first mentioned inAgrippa’s work, the kameas themselves were used prior to this. A manuscriptcalled The Book of Angels, Rings, Characters, and Images of the Planets:Attributed to Osbern Bokenham (1441–1445) on planetary magic makes specificreference to the use of the kameas inscribed on thin metal sheets in talismanicmagic. So even when uninscribed, the basic kameas can be used to contribute to aplanetary matrix as a base image added to the shrine or altar.Kamea of Saturn“From Saturn man receiveth a sublime contemplation, profound understanding,solidity of Judgement, firm speculation, stability and an immovable Resolution.”6 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-210]492357816Table 8.

The Planetary Archangels and Their Sigils (continued)Planetary ArchangelsThe Saturnian archangel is Tzaphkiel (“Beholder of God”). He is known as theAngel of Paradise because of his role in the Garden of Eden, and in modern timesis the patron of all those who fight pollution and love and protect nature.Tzaphkiel is also the patron of artists, bringing illumination and inspirationto those who seek to create beauty in the world.Tzadkiel (“Righteousness of God”) is the Jupiterian archangel of benevolence,memory, and mercy. He is often depicted with a dagger in his hand, representingthe power of the intellect. Tzadkiel is a comforter, associated with invocationand prayer. He is the archangel to help overcome despondency and to forgiveothers for their negative deeds. Tzadkiel can also be appealed to for help withfinancial matters and for achieving justice in a situation.Khamael (“He who sees God”) is the Martial archangel, a warrior who representsdivine justice, is said to grant invisibility, and rules over martial qualitieslike power and invincibility. Khamael is the ideal angel to call upon to helpyou take personal responsibility and to develop self-confidence. He will helpyou deal with the consequences of your actions and to find justice, but only ifyou stick to the truth.Michael (“He who is like God”) was the first angel created and is often seen asthe leader of the angels, or the “first among equals.” He is usually shownwielding a sword or lance, and sometimes the scales of justice. Michael is theSolar archangel and helps those who call upon him to achieve goals anddestinies. Michael is particularly called on to achieve a legitimate goal or forprotection,Uriel (“Light of God), also known as Auriel or Oriel, is the archangel of Venusand of peace and salvation. He is often depicted with a flame or lamp in hishands. Uriel embodies the power of light as illumination and spiritual passion.Uriel is associated with magical power and the application of force, and canhelp cause a positive breaking of bonds when needed and overcome inertia. He isalso the patron of astrology and has been linked strongly with electricity.Raphael (“Healer of God”) is the Mercurial archangel charged with healinghumankind and the earth. Often depicted with a pilgrim’s staff, he is the patronof travelers, and he protects those on journeys, especially those involving airtravel. Raphael’s special charges are the young and innocent. Raphael is thearchangel of knowledge and communication and may be called upon to help with anyrelated areas, such as improving your memory, learning languages, exams, dealingwith bureaucracy, and business matters.Gabriel (“The Strength of God”) is the angel who usually delivers messages tohumanity, embodying the link between humans and the universe and the divine asexpressed by the Moon. As the Lunar archangel, Gabriel is the guide to the innertides of our unconscious. Gabriel can help with developing the imagination andpsychic abilities. He is also associated with domestic matters, especially thedevelopment of the home, or finding a new home.The IntelligencesSaturnAgiel[image/Book3_Fig13.png]Figure 10.

The Planetary Spirits and Their Sigils (continued)Planetary Amulets and TalismansPractical work with the planets may positively increase something in your lifeassociated with the planet, or alternatively remove or transform somethingnegative. Whichever of these it may be, you are acting to improve yourself andyour situation, to more effectively follow your path and achieve your goals. Theprocess of attraction, repulsion, or transformation will determine the best wayto achieve your goal, such as using an amulet or talisman.An amulet is a protective charm and works through repulsion to protect thebearer from specific forces or events. A talisman is a charm of attraction usedto attract specific energies to enhance a specific aspect of the bearer’ssituation. For example, you might make a lunar amulet for protection if you weregoing on a cruise, or a talisman if you were working on developing your psychicabilities.Amulets and talismans may be carried on you to receive the benefits on anongoing basis (particularly for amulets) or may be placed in a suitable safeplace. So a Mercurial amulet to protect your car would stay in the car, whereasa Mercurial talisman for better communication might be located near yourtelephone or computer.PlanetType of MagickSunCareer success and progression, establishing harmony, healing and improvinghealth, leadership skills, acquiring money and resources, promotion,strengthening willpowerMercuryBusiness success, improving communication skills, developing knowledge andmemory, diplomacy, exam success, divination, developing influence, protectionwhen traveling by air and land, learning musicVenusIncreasing attractiveness and self-confidence, beauty and passion, enhancingcreativity, improving fertility, developing friendships, obtaining loveMoonDeveloping clairvoyance and other psychic skills, ensuring safe childbirth,divination, glamour and illusions, lucid dreaming, protection when traveling byseaMarsControlling anger, increasing courage, enhancing energy and passion, increasingvigour and sex driveJupiterCareer success, developing ambition and enthusiasm, improving fortune and luck,general health, acquiring honour, improving sense of humour, legal matters anddealing with the establishment, developing leadership skillsSaturnPerforming duty, establishing balance and equilibrium, dispelling illusions,protecting the home, legal matters, developing patience and self-disciplineTable 18. The Planets and Their Associated Types of MagickThe process of talismanic magic may be summed up in four stages: preparation,creation, purification and consecration. This process is equally valid for bothamulets and talismans.Preparation involves determining the intent and the components to be used in thetalisman, i.e., the material you will make the talisman out of and the words andsigils used. Once you have decided on your talisman base (card, metal disc,crystal), you need to acquire it. Preparation also involves calculating theappropriate planetary hours during which you will perform the creation,purification, and consecration. You may also choose to include meditation on theplanet if you feel you need to develop your understanding of the energies of theplanet.Creation is the construction of the talisman. Draw, etch, or engrave the sigilsonto your talisman, indicating your intent and the names of the spiritualcreatures or forces you will draw upon to empower your talisman. Appropriatelycoloured card is easiest. Metal discs can be expensive and difficult to source,though they are more durable, as are crystal discs. (Those listed in Table 19[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073] are easier to obtain ina disc form.)PlanetNo.MetalColourCrystalSaturn3LeadBlackObsidianJupiter4TinBlueLapis lazuliMars5Brass14 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-202]RedBloodstoneSun6GoldGold/yellowAmberVenus7CopperGreenMalachiteMercury8Aluminium 15 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-201]OrangeAgateMoon9SilverSilver/purpleSeleniteTable 19. The Planets and Their Metals, Colours, and Crystals“The Talismans, Pentacles, Mystical Images, Sigils, Characters and othersuchlike Talismans, which are the main tools for working with Occult Science,can be created with different materials. You can make them on virgin parchment,on metal plates, on magnetic stones, on jasper, agate and on other preciousstones.” 16 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-200]In the grimoires, the amulets and talismans were usually made on circular disksof metal. However, when using card, it works well to use a number of sides equalto the planetary number (e.g., triangle for Saturn, square for Jupiter, etc). Ifyou choose to use white card, the ink colour for all the appropriate seals orsigils you decide on should be of the relevant planetary colour.Hence a Jupiterian talisman would be on a square piece of blue card. Glyphsusually included on talismans are the astrological sigil of the planet, thedivine name, the name and/or sigil of the archangel, the name and/or sigil ofthe planetary spirit and intelligence, and any other appropriate symbolsdesired.Purification is the precursor to the final step of consecration. Purificationmakes sure there are no unwanted influences attached to your talisman,effectively making it completely neutral and ready to act as a receptacle andlens for the forces you attract through its action. Purification can alsoinclude ritual bathing in a bath fragranced with the appropriate planetaryessential oil so that you too are pure.Consecration is the activation of the talisman as a focus for the desiredplanetary energy. Hymns may be included in the consecration ceremony to requestassistance, to enhance the effectiveness of both amulets and talismans.Ceremony for Talismanic PreparationPlace the following items on the altar:• The talisman• An appropriately coloured piece of natural material big enough to wrap thetalisman in• Bowl of spring water• Bowl of sea salt• Censer of incense• Red candlePlace your talisman on the piece of coloured fabric on the altar.Perform your preferred space clearing/banishing ritual.Purify your talisman to remove all influences—pass it through the incense smoke,saying:I purify you with the element of air.Now pass the talisman (carefully and quickly) through the candle flame, saying:I purify you with the element of fire.Sprinkle the talisman with a drop of water from the bowl and say:I purify you with the element of water.Sprinkle a few grains of salt over the talisman and say:I purify you with the element of earth.The talisman is purified and ready to be consecrated.State the intent of the talisman in a single concise sentence (preparedbeforehand). As you do so, draw the sigil of the planet in the air over thetalisman, visualising it in its planetary colour. See the sigil shining with aninner brilliance, then visualise a taut line of force in the planetary colourfrom your dominant hand to the sigil. Lower your hand so the sigil descends withit, into the talisman.Intone in sequence the hierarchy of planetary spiritual creatures for theplanet, a number of times equal to the planetary number. Start with the divinename, then the archangel, then the order of angels, the name of the heaven(i.e., the planet), the planetary intelligence, and finally the planetaryspirit.Now raise your arms upward so they make a V, and declare:I will take of the divine spirit [divine name], emanating from the heavens,Focused through the archangel [name], who directs the [order of angels],Manifesting through the power of the heaven of [planet], expressed through[planetary intelligence] and [planetary spirit].I have created this talisman for my glory.I have formed it and I have made it.As you make this declaration, feel the planetary force descending from theheavens and collecting in your hands. See the energy there as a glow of theplanetary colour surrounding your hands. Bring your hands down simultaneouslyand place them on the talisman, saying:I join this talisman to my life, that the (repeat intent).As above, so below.This is my will, it is so.Wrap the talisman in the fabric and put it in a safe place.Here is an example sequence of the calling of the hierarchy of spiritualcreatures for a talisman of Mars:Elohim Gibor, Khamael, Seraphim, Mars, Graphiel, Bartzabel (× 5)Now raise your arms upward so they make a V, and declare:I will take of the divine spirit Elohim Gibor, emanating from the heavens,Focused through the archangel Khamael, who directs the Seraphim,Manifesting through the power of the heaven of Mars, expressed throughGraphiel and Bartzabel.I have created this talisman for my glory.I have formed it and I have made it.Planetary Magic CircleYou may prefer to use a magic circle that is created specifically for thepurpose when doing planetary workings. The one given here is for solitary work,and the size can be increased appropriately for group workings. First preparethe space by removing any distractions and cleaning it. The circle is a suitablyplanetary seven foot in diameter.Requirements:• Spirit light (may be a lamp with a wick or a candle)• Incense (optional)• Small bowl of sea salt• Small bowl of spring waterFor the creation of the circle, you may use a wand or dagger, or your preferredhand (i.e., right hand if right-handed, left if left-handed), whichever is yourchoice. If using your hand, the gesture of benediction works very well. This ismade by extending the forefinger and middle finger, and curling the ring fingerand little finger into the palm, with the thumb curled over so it rests on thering and little fingers.Light the spirit light and the incense (if you are using any). Declare:Hekas o hekas este bibeloi. 17[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-199]Add the salt to the bowl of water, proclaiming:Be pure.See the water glowing with a brilliant white glow. Pick up the bowl ofconsecrated water and walk from the east, in a clockwise circle, sprinkling theconsecrated water. When you have returned to the east, go back to the altar,replace the bowl on the altar, and pick up your preferred tool, or make thegesture of benediction. Again go to the east and walk clockwise with your armoutstretched downward toward the floor, and see a circle of white flames beingformed at the tip of the weapon or the fingers of your preferred hand, and say:United the seven deathless powers form the greater unity.That unity is my circle, bound in time and space.Within is my universe illuminated by the magic of the wandering stars.As above, so below.When you have returned to the east, return to the centre and place your weaponon the altar, and continue with your ceremony.At the end of the ceremony, pick up the weapon or make the gesture again, andwalk counterclockwise from the north, again with arm pointed at the floor andseeing the white flames die away as you complete the circuit back to the north.Sympathetic MagicWhen working planetary magic, one of the most powerful tools you have is theprinciple of contagion, also known as the law of attraction. Each planetaryenergy has a symbol set that has been powered by centuries or millennia ofpractice. By working with the symbol set, you draw the energies of the desiredplanet into your life, by creating a focus of harmonic influences that magnifyyour intent toward the desired result. As an example, if you were nervous aboutpassing an exam, you would work with Mercury, and might wear some orangeclothing and anoint yourself with lavender oil, carry a citrine quartz or agate,have orange candles in your study, burn a stimulating Mercurial oil such aslemon, etc. Of course any magic for results requires avenues to manifestthrough, and you would still need to study for the exam! Magic works to enhance,not to create out of nothing.When considering additional symbolism for attraction, it is important toremember that the planets also represent the higher aspects of the four elementsand rule the zodiacal signs, so their influence and symbols may be relevant toconsider and include those listed in Table 20[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074].PlanetHigher Aspect ofRulesSunFireLeoMoonWaterCancerMarsFireAries, ScorpioMercuryAirGemini, VirgoJupiterWater/airSagittarius, PiscesVenusEarthTaurus, LibraSaturnEarthCapricorn, AquariusTable 20. Planets, Elements, and RulershipsTheurgic WorkMagic is not just about ritual practice, and it is important to remember themore “passive” side of magic—the being and becoming through inner work. Forthis, meditational and contemplative practices that help you focus on developingyour positive qualities and transforming any negative ones are extremelyimportant. Ultimately magic is the journey to achieving your own genius andradiating it, and theurgy is the heart of this.In 1987 I coined the phrase “magic takes on the religion of the age,”18[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-198] and now over thirty yearslater, I would add that “magic takes on the technology of the age.” Magic hasbeen called the technology of the sacred, and there is no reason why technologyshould not be used to enhance magical practice. A great example of this is theSymphonies of the Planets—recordings made by the Voyager space probe of thesounds emanating from the planets it passed. Whilst only Jupiter and Saturn areincluded from the classical planets, the recordings are amazing to use asbackground for planetary meditations and rituals.19[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-197] Music that inspires, suchas Holst’s The Planets, may be used, though ambient instrumental music that isnot intrusive works best as a background for meditation and contemplation.Devotional practices are not simply a matter of worship; they are aspirational,seeking to develop the link between you and the divine to strengthen or refinequalities in yourself that they represent. This is the essence of devotion,which is a personal, private practice, best treated as such and not dilutedthrough broadcasting it on social media for attention. A shrine to a deity actsas a gateway between you and that deity, and should be treated as a sacredspace, not a photo opportunity. If you do feel a desire to engage in discussionor publication of current practices, remember the virtue of silence is not onlyto maintain the undiluted integrity of your work but also to encourage humilityand keep the ego controlled.It is better to concentrate on one planetary deity and the associated qualitiesat a time, so you can keep the focus pure. A shrine that you attend daily isstrongly recommended for theurgic work. Shrines do not have to be complex orcluttered with statues and paraphernalia. The essentials for a shrine are asuitably coloured cloth as the base (usually on a small table or similar item),coloured candles (preferably of the planetary colour and number), arepresentation of the deity (statue or image) that you find pleasing to look at,and a censer or holder to burn incense or joss on. Beyond this, a few items thatare particularly symbolic of the deity, such as a crystal, may be added, andfresh flowers are a nice touch. Of course a shrine should be kept clean andpreferably be in a private space where it is not accessible to others. Thefollowing example of devotional practice may be adapted for any of the otherplanetary deities using their symbols, hymns, etc.Example of Planetary Devotion for MercuryThe shrine is set with an orange cloth, with a statue of Mercury at the rear inthe centre and eight orange candles, four on either side of the statue in a linealong the back of the shrine. In front of the statue is a small censer withcharcoal for burning galbanum or frankincense.20[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-196] A piece of agate is placedin front of the censer, so a T-shape is formed by the items, with the image of acaduceus (symbol of Mercury and healing) placed on the left of the censer andagate, and a pen on the right (symbolic of writing, said to have been created byMercury) and a bottle of lavender essential oil. On the wall behind the shrine,place a good-sized (say A4) picture of the Mercury sigil. You might also put theOrphic hymn in a large font on the wall next to the sigil for ease of reading,keeping your hands free. As this devotion is to Mercury, ideally perform itduring a Mercurial planetary hour of the day.First have a purification bath, allowing your body and mind to relax and let goof any stresses of the day. You can add appropriate essential oils or herbs tothe bath. (If you place the herbs in a muslin bag, you will still get thebenefits of their qualities without making a mess.) Dry yourself and put on asimple robe. (White or black are good neutral colours if you do not have a wholeset of planetary colours!) Approach the shrine with a sense of joy andanticipation.Light the candles and the charcoal (or joss), and recite the Orphic Hymn toHermes 21 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-195] (Mercury) whilstoffering frankincense, censing the statue and the rest of the shrine:Hermes, draw near, and to my pray’r incline, angel of Jove [Zeus], and Maia’sson divine;Studious of contests, ruler of mankind, with heart almighty, and a prudent mind.Celestial messenger, of various skill, whose pow’rful arts could watchful Arguskill:With winged feet, ‘tis thine thro’ air to course, O friend of man, and prophetof discourse:Great life-supporter, to rejoice is thine, in arts gymnastic, and in frauddivine:With pow’r endu’d all language to explain, of care the loos’ner, and the sourceof gain.Whose hand contains of blameless peace the rod, Corucian, blessed, profitableGod;Of various speech, whose aid in works we find, and in necessities to mortalskind:Dire weapon of the tongue, which men revere, be present, Hermes, and thysuppliant hear;Assist my works, conclude my life with peace, give graceful speech, and memory’sincrease.Sit in front of the shrine, cross-legged or on a chair as works best for you.Take the agate off the altar and hold it between your hands in your lap,connecting you to the shrine energetically and also putting a Mercurial item inconnection to your body.Relax, close your eyes, and still your breathing, taking time to enter ameditative state. See the Mercury symbol in orange on a blue background. As youvisualise the symbol, contemplate the qualities associated with Mercury, such ascommunication, deception, flexibility, healing, and memory. Consider how strongeach of these forces is in your life, and which of them you are actively tryingto cultivate or transform. Allow your inner vision to be inspired by yourthoughts, and see what images and events it brings up.After you have spent some time (5–15 minutes) contemplating the qualities ofMercury, decide which quality you feel you should focus on. Place some morefrankincense on the charcoal, and as the lemony fragrance surrounds you, allowit to give you a singular clarity so you consider only the chosen quality. Seethe sigil of Mercury again flowing in front of you the same size as you, glowingorange. Feel the power of that quality emanating from the orange Mercury, thensee it moving forward to be absorbed into your body. As you absorb that quality,anoint yourself with lavender oil,22[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-194] making the Mercury sigil onyour heart, and state:As above, so below.This is my will, it is so.Take time to write up your impressions and thoughts, then blow out the candlesand move away from the shrine, walking backward so you continue to look at theshrine as you step away, showing your respect for the planetary deity.Obviously change does not happen overnight, and such a practice should beperformed daily for a period of time, such as a month. If you can perform itduring the appropriate planetary hour every day, it quickly builds up power andhelps accelerate the process of change as your self-discipline and determinationdrive your unconscious to manifest the changes in your conscious self. Dailypractice greatly strengthens the willpower essential for successful magic andtransformation.Planetary WaterPlanetary water may be easily made for use in planetary magic. To make it, placea planetary crystal (e.g., citrine quartz for Mercury) in a clean glass bottleor jar with spring water, and seal it. Place it in a dark, cool space for aperiod of days equal to the planetary number (so eight for this Mercurialexample) to charge. If you are making solar water, it can be placed on a shelfwhere it receives direct sunlight during the day, and conversely moonlight forlunar water. The other planetary waters should all be left in a dark space(equating to the darkness of space) without the light of the sun or mooninfluencing the planetary energy.Planetary water can be used for a variety of purposes, such as anointing, and isparticularly useful when added to enhance the planetary influence. Examples ofthis are adding some to a ritual purification bath, adding a few drops to acoloured magical ink, and using some during the consecration of magical items(including statues on devotional shrines).23[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-193]Trans-Saturnian PlanetsAlthough planetary magic traditionally focuses on the seven classical “planets,”mention should be made of the more recently discovered Uranus (1789) and Neptune(1846). Following its discovery in 1930, Pluto was also incorporated intoplanetary magic, though with its reclassification in 2006 as a dwarf planet,some people have chosen to stop considering it a planet, whilst others includeother dwarf planets such as Ceres and Eris.Uranus (“sky” or “heaven”) is the Roman god who fathered Saturn, who castratedUranus with a diamond sickle and threw his genitals into the sea. Some versionsof the myth state that Venus was born from his blood and the foam of the sea.Uranus was equated to the Greek Ouranos and his associated myth. Uranus isassociated with the element of air and the day Wednesday, and rules the sign ofAquarius in the zodiac. The colour is purple, and associated materials aretitanium, amethyst, labradorite, and tourmaline. Uranus is associated withchange and technology, especially electricity, and the archangel Uriel has beenassociated with Uranus. In modern Qabalah, Uranus is often attributed to thenon-sephira of Daath on the Tree of Life.Neptune (the etymology of his name is uncertain) is the Roman god of the sea,horses, and earthquakes, who was son of Saturn and brother to Jupiter and Pluto.He was originally associated with springs and streams prior to hisidentification with the Greek sea god Poseidon, so all water can be associatedwith him. Neptune is associated with the element of water and the day Monday,and rules the sign of Pisces. The attributed colour is gray (or sea-green), andthe associated materials are tungsten, pearl, rutile, rutile quartz, and shell.The magic of Neptune is that of the sea, tidal and subject to sudden changes. Asthe archangel of water, Gabriel can be worked with for Neptune. Neptune is oftenattributed to the supernal sephira of Chokmah in modern Qabalah, in which casethe archangel Raziel is appropriate.Pluto is the Roman god of the underworld and wealth. His name comes from theLatin pluton, which is derived from the Greek word ploutos, meaning “wealth.”Pluto was another son of Saturn, and thus brother to Jupiter and Neptune. Inlater times he was equated with the Greek underworld god Hades and the whole“abduction of Persephone” myth associated with him, with Persephone becomingProserpina. Pluto is associated with the element of earth and the day Saturday,and rules Scorpio. The attributed colour is white (which is the reflection ofthe entire spectrum, and hence the quality of invisibility), and associatedmaterials are diamond, ebony, fluorite, platinum, and zircon. The magic of Plutois that of invisibility, treasure, and the underworld. Some people attributePluto to the sephira of Kether on the Tree of Life in modern Qabalah, as markingan edge of our universe whilst also embodying the concept of the hidden(invisible). With this attribution, the archangel Metatron is considered asuitable archangel to work with for Pluto.Planetary FragrancesFragrance plays an important role in magic. Not only does it stimulate memory,but it also enhances mood and has traditionally been used to attract theattention of spiritual creatures, through burning incense and wearing suitableoils. Fragmentary writings from Mesopotamia mention seven planetary fragrancesassociated with the classical planets and their gods (Table 21[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075]). The fragrances arecalamus, cedar, cypress, galbanum, labdanum, myrtle, and storax, but the onlyspecific associations known for certain amongst these are cedar as being sacredto Marduk (Jupiter) and myrtle as being sacred to Shamash (the Sun). A referencein the Greek Magical Papyri gives us a complete set of planetary attributions,listing the seven Greek gods who were associated with the classical planets andtheir scents:“The proper incense of Kronos is storax, for it is heavy and fragrant; of Zeus,malabathron; of Ares, kostos; of Helios, frankincense; of Aphrodite, Indiannard; of Hermes, cassia; of Selene, myrrh.” 24[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-192]PlanetIncense PlantLatin NameSunFrankincenseBoswellia carteriiMercuryCassiaCinnamomum cassiaVenusSpikenardNardostachys jatamansiMoonMyrrhCommiphora myrrhaMarsKostosSassurea lappaJupiterMalabathron (Indian bay leaf)Cinnamomum tamalaSaturnStoraxLiquidambar styraciflua L.Table 21. Planets with Their Associated Incense Plants and Latin NamesCenturies later, the grimoires give different sets of fragrances and a wholerange of incenses, based on availability and a very different culturalsituation. Some of these ingredients include animal parts and toxic metals, andthe use of these faded away as perceptions of magic and the world changed. Theplanets were no longer worshiped as gods, but were seen as part of the ChristianCreation. Looking at Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy (1531–1533) andthe Heptameron (1485) against modern attributions, we see the attributions givenin Table 22 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076].PlanetHeptameronAgrippaModernSunRed sandalwoodMasticAmber, cinnamon, frankincense, orange, sandalwood (red)MercuryMasticCinnamonGalbanum, lavender, lemon, mastic, rosemary, storaxVenusPepperwortSaffronBenzoin, lilac, lily, rose, sandalwood (white)MoonAloesMyrtleCamphor, jasmine, vanilla, ylang-ylangMarsPepperLignum aloesBlack pepper, dragon’s blood, ginger, opoponaxJupiterSaffronNutmegCedar, copal, hyssop, juniper, saffronSaturnSulphurPepperwortMyrrh, patchouli, pine, vetivertTable 22. Attributions of Planetary Incenses across TimeFor modern rites, unless you are using a blended incense, it is better to use aresin (at least one is given for each planet in Table 20[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074]), as it will burn sweetthe whole time. If you burn herbs, the smell quickly resembles a bonfire and isnot conducive to concentration.25[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-191] If you choose to make yourown planetary incense using appropriate ingredients, remember it should alwaysbe at least two-thirds resin base for the same reason.Building the Planetary MatrixIn addition to wearing an item of the appropriate planetary colour and a scentof the planet, carrying a consecrated crystal can also add strength to theplanetary matrix you create about yourself when performing planetary magic.Using all of these symbols not only helps to send a continuous passive messageto your unconscious but also actively forms a matrix of the desired planetaryenergy around you, to act as a magnet for drawing the appropriate energy to youand to your actions, both magical and mundane. For this reason, more examples ofplanetary crystals are given in Table 23[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077]. Both loose crystalsand crystals in jewelry are equally good to have on your person, as long as theyhave been consecrated. For jewelry, it should also be mentioned that certainparts of the body correspond more strongly to planetary influences, which isrelevant for the wearing of items such as rings. On the hand there is Venus(thumb), Jupiter (index finger), Saturn (big finger), the Sun (ring finger), andMercury (little finger). Other relevant areas for jewelry include the throat(Venus, e.g., strings of crystals), heart (Sun, pendant), and brow (Moon,circlet or crown).PlanetCrystalsSunAmber, cat’s-eye, diamond, sunstone, tiger’s-eye, topaz, zirconMercuryAgate, aventurine, citrine quartz, labradorite, opalVenusAmazonite, emerald, jade, malachite, peridot, rose quartz, zoisiteMoonAquamarine, beryl, chalcedony, moonstone, pearl, quartz, seleniteMarsBloodstone, carnelian, garnet, hematite, magnetite, pyrite, rubyJupiterAmethyst, ammonite, azurite, lapis lazuli, sapphire, sodalite, turquoiseSaturnJet, obsidian, onyx, serpentine, smoky quartzTable 23. Planets and Their Crystal AttributionsThe more you add to the planetary matrix, the stronger you can make it. So youmight anoint yourself with a planetary number of drops of an oil for the planet,like eight drops of lavender, each day. One key to the planetary matrix issubtlety. You are working with unseen energies, and if you suddenly makeyourself more noticeable, that is not unseen! Fortunately the items of theplanetary matrix can all be discreet, such as planetary coloured underwear, thecrystal in jewelry or in a pocket, the fragrance subtle and not overpowering,etc.The planetary matrix can also be added to in non-ritual circumstances throughthe use of an oil burner, using candles, playing suitable music, or even eatingfoods associated with the planets. The more you put in, the stronger thecritical mass of your planetary matrix will be to attract the divine force.The energies of the planets were not all perceived as having positiverelationships.

Planetary Relationships According to AgrippaThese relationships should be considered when working out days and times ofrituals. Although the planetary hour and day should always be used wherepossible, sometimes this is not practical for any number of reasons. Refer thento Table 24 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor078] and look atthe days of planets that have a “friend” or “love”’ relationship with the planetyou are working with as alternative options.Dreaming with the PlanetsUsing the dreaming mind to seek answers to questions is a practice that goesback to the dream incubation temples of the ancient world. In the grimoiresthere is a planetary version of this practice,26[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-190] where a seal is createdduring the appropriate planetary hour and placed under the dreamer’s pillow.After a purificatory bath and before going to sleep, a prayer is said and theangel of the day named, with the question being voiced out loud (e.g., “Gabriel,am I being deceived by my friend N?”). The angel may then appear or speak to youin your dream to offer guidance or an answer to your question.There are different individual prayers for each of the seven named angels;however, the prayer given below in Table 25[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079] (Psalm 4:6–10) is forall of them and may be used accordingly on any day of the week. It may be spokenin Latin or English according to preference.6sacrificate sacrificium iustitiae et fidite in Domino multi dicunt quis ostenditnobis bonumOffer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who showethus good things?7leva super nos lucem vultus tui Domine dedisti laetitiam in corde meoThe light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast givengladness in my heart.8in tempore frumentum et vinum eorum multiplicata suntBy the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:9in pace simul requiescam et dormiamIn peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:10quia tu Domine specialiter securum habitare fecisti meFor thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.Table 25. Prayers from Psalm 4:6–10Some of the angels listed in Table 26[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor088] are not the classicalarchangels. They are specifically angels of the night though, so it may besupposed they were considered appropriate emissaries for dream interpretation.Raphael is here given as Solar and Michael as Martial. For centuries bothMichael and Raphael were attributed to the Sun at different times. Michael asMartial is less common in his warrior aspect. Uriel also is more commonlyVenusian but has also been attributed to the other earthy planet of Saturn.Monday—Gabriel[image/Book3_Fig271.png]Figure 25.

Planets and Their Night Angels (continued)Planetary LamensFor conjuration the magician would normally wear a lamen pinned to their robe ontheir chest over their heart. A lamen can be a piece of cloth or paper and wouldinclude the seal of the creature being called. Bearing the mark of the spiritualcreature can facilitate communication as well as provide protection. It couldalso be seen as a beacon on the physical plane, which combined with theconjuration to provide a clear location. If working with the planetaryintelligences and spirits, the seal of the spirit would be on the outside andthe intelligence would be on the inside, facing the heart, as an additionalprotection. The same principle is found when conjuring demons, with the seal ofthe controlling angel or archangel on the underside facing the heart.For planetary work that is talismanic or theurgic, a general-purpose planetarylamen can be created with the seven-rayed planetary heptagram on it to add tothe planetary matrix. The sigil of the planet can be added in the centre of theheptagram and, if desired, the seal of the archangel drawn on the undersidefacing the heart. Either type of heptagram is suitable, and you should choosethe type which appeals to you more.The Heptagram, or Seven-Rayed StarThe heptagram (or septagram) is the seven-pointed planetary star that is used bya number of magical traditions, including in the grimoires, the Golden Dawn,Thelema (the Astrum Argenteum and the Babalon star), and the Fairy tradition(the Faery or Elven star). It has two forms, known as the 7/2 heptagram (Figure32 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor089]) and the 7/3heptagram (Figure 34 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092]),the latter numbers referring to the number of points you move around the star todraw the next line of the heptagram in the single continuous stroke that createsit.[image/Book3_Fig11.png]Figure 32. The 7/3 Heptagram[image/Book3_Fig33.png]Figure 33. Sigillum Dei AemethThe 7/2 heptagram is perhaps best known in the famous Sigillum Dei Aemeth(“Sigil of God’s Truth”) in the thirteenth-century grimoire Liber Juratus(Figure 33 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor090]). This imagewas adopted by Dr. John Dee in the sixteenth century and became a central partof Enochian magic. The seven points are also associated with the seven vowels ofancient Greek, which are attributed to the planets, and used in some ancientspells. The sequence of the seven vowels from alpha to omega was sometimeswritten as shorthand to represent all the planets, and it was seen as being apowerful spoken or sung charm in its own right (Table 27[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091]). Use of the sevenvowels as a repeated mantra is a good practice for developing the power of yourtone for ritual use.VowelSoundPlanetColourPositionAlphaAMoonSilverMiddle rightEpsilonEMercuryOrangeBottom leftEta[image/434.jpg] (EE)VenusGreenUpper leftIotaISunGoldUpper rightOmicronOMarsRedBottom rightUpsilonUJupiterBlueMiddle leftOmega([image/435.jpg]) OOSaturnBlackTopTable 27.

The 7/2 Heptagram Showing the Days of the WeekConclusionThe power of the planets is immense, accessible, and all-permeating in ourlives. Working planetary magic is arguably the most efficient way to optimizeand harmonize the swirling of forces we are all surrounded by. Appreciating thenature of these energies and being able to direct their flows and ride theircurrents not only helps improve quality of life, but more importantly helpsdevelop quality of soul. At its core, planetary magic is the union of a greaterwhole (our solar system), and by practicing it we embody the axiom of “As above,so below,” becoming a harmonious microcosm that consummates the Great Work,i.e., the work of making humanity great.Suggested Reading ListAgrippa von Nettesheim, Heinrich Cornelius.

Thus, alchemybecame known as the “Black Art,” which also evokes the dark, secretive practicesof the alchemists.Scholars consider the era of Egyptian alchemy to span the centuries from 5000BCE to 350 BCE. That was followed by a period of Greek alchemy in Egypt from thearrival of Alexander the Great (332 BCE) to the Arabian invasion (642 CE).Arabian alchemy flourished for another five hundred years before the heyday ofalchemy began in Europe around 1200 CE.According to ancient Egyptian texts, the first alchemist was Thoth. He arrivedduring a period known as Zep Tepi (around 10,000 BCE), when godlike beingsroamed the earth. The Egyptians considered Thoth the primordial source of allthought—the inventor of writing, philosophy, theology, law, literature, magic,alchemy, mathematics, and all the sciences.Thoth represents the archetypal concept of mind, the wellspring for all humaninsight and inspiration. An Egyptian motto says, “May Thoth speak to you daily.”According to the Ebers Papyrus (1550 BCE), a 68-foot-long scroll on medicalalchemy that is the oldest book in the world, “Man’s guide is Thoth, who bestowson him the gifts of his speech, who makes the books, and illumines those who arelearned therein, and the physicians who follow him, that they may work theircures.” 27 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-189]Thoth is the Greek word for the Egyptian Djehuty, which means “like an ibis.”Djehuty was an ancient lunar god associated with the ibis because of the bird’sunique crescent-shaped beak. He performed magical acts of manifestation andsymbolized the transformative power of the eternally changing moon. His magicholds the universe together. Without his words, the gods themselves would notexist and nothing in the cosmos would ever change or evolve.The Greek god Hermes and Egyptian god Thoth were worshiped as a single entity inthe Hellenistic city of Hermopolis, and the Hermetic writings were associatedwith an ancient Egyptian priest known as Hermes Trismegistus (“Thrice GreatestHermes”). The teachings attributed to him inspired an explosion of interpretivetexts in philosophy, religion, alchemy, and magic that were housed in the GreatLibrary of Alexandria (305 BCE).Eventually, the library grew to over 400,000 scrolls and became a center oflearning that attracted scholars from all over the world. In that fertileenvironment, alchemy evolved from a disorganized collection of smeltingprocedures and tincturing recipes into a Hermetic science focused onunderstanding the universal principles of transformation. From Alexandria, theteachings spread to the Arabian lands, Mesopotamia, India, and China.In a tragic loss to humankind, the Great Library of Alexandria caught fireduring a power struggle between Ptolemy XIII and his sister Cleopatra in 48 BCE.The library was engulfed in a firestorm that ignited from soldiers fighting onthe city’s docks. The surviving scrolls were moved to two nearby temples thatserved as a library for another three centuries.Then, in 290 CE, Roman Emperor Diocletian decreed the destruction of all alchemymanuscripts in Egypt, which resulted in a significant loss of precious texts. In391 CE, Christian zealots attacked one of the temples, destroyed all thescrolls, and turned the building into a Christian church. Finally, in 415 CE,Christian mobs destroyed the remaining temple library. They dragged Hypatia, thelast librarian, into the street and accused her of teaching Greek philosophy.Using abalone shells, they scraped the flesh from her body while she was stillalive.The extinguishing of the light of Alexandria and the suppression of Greekphilosophy were the results of the dogmatic control of knowledge and fear of newideas that was gripping the world. Known as the Dark Ages, it was a period ofstagnant intellectual growth and lack of innovation that lasted from the fall ofthe Roman Empire (476 CE) to the beginning of the second millennium (1000 CE).Fortunately, alchemy and the Hermetic teachings survived in the Arabian landsand were rekindled in Europe with the infusion of copied Alexandrian manuscriptsbrought to Spain by Arabian invaders. The Arabs crossed over from Morocco in 711CE and occupied Spain for more than seven centuries. The Islamic rulers provedvery tolerant, and Spain soon became a haven for philosophers, alchemists,magicians, and freethinkers of all persuasions. By 1100, Latin translations ofalchemy and Hermetic manuscripts were spreading throughout Europe. Alchemy wouldthrive in Europe for the next seven hundred years.Hermetic Philosophy in Alchemy and TheurgyOne of the copied Alexandrian scrolls brought by the Arabs to Spain was theEmerald Tablet, a short but profound document in which Hermes summarized theesoteric principles of creation (Figure 1[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor094]). The Tablet became thecore document in European alchemy, and nearly every alchemist had a copy of ithanging on the wall or tucked away in a revered spot in their library. Theybelieved it contained a secret formula that showed how to transform anything.[image/Book4_Fig1.jpg]Figure 1. Emerald TabletSee if you can sense the universal formula hidden in the words of the EmeraldTablet as you read the following translation.28[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-188] Note that when the tabletrefers to the “Universe,” it is talking about the material universe in which welive. When it speaks of the “Whole Universe,” it is referencing both thematerial universe (“Below”) and the spiritual universe (“Above”).The Emerald TabletIn truth, without deceit, certain, and most veritable.That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Abovecorresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracles of the One Thing.And just as all things have come from this One Thing, through the meditation ofOne Mind, so do all created things originate from this One Thing, throughTransformation.Its father is the Sun; its mother the Moon. The Wind carries it in its belly;its nurse is the Earth. It is the origin of All, the consecration of theUniverse; its inherent Strength is perfected, if it is turned into Earth.Separate the Earth from Fire, the Subtle from the Gross, gently and with greatIngenuity. It rises from Earth to Heaven and descends again to Earth, therebycombining within Itself the powers of both the Above and the Below.Thus, will you obtain the Glory of the Whole Universe. All Obscurity will beclear to you. This is the greatest Force of all powers, because it overcomesevery Subtle thing and penetrates every Solid thing.In this way was the Universe created. From this comes many wondrousApplications, because this is the Pattern.Therefore, am I called Thrice Greatest Hermes, having all three parts of thewisdom of the Whole Universe. Herein have I completely explained the Operationof the Sun.The first principle presented in the Emerald Tablet is known as the Doctrine ofCorrespondences, which describes a vertical relationship between spirit orenergy in the realm Above and matter or manifestation in the realm Below. Apenetrating examination of this vertical axis of reality can be found in a workin the Corpus Hermeticum called the Divine Pymander (or “Divine Mind”).Attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, the text describes his meeting with the OneMind and what it revealed to him about the nature of reality.29[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-187]The Tablet goes on to elaborate on the nature of the One Thing, which alchemistsinterpret as the First Matter, or primordial stuff of creation. The first twosentences of this paragraph present the Four Elements in the order of Fire,Water, Air, and Earth. Associated with each of the elements are alchemicaloperations: Calcination (Fire), Dissolution (Water), Separation (Air), andConjunction (Earth).The fourth paragraph is the most mystical part of the Emerald Tablet and revealshow to enter the spiritual realm using the alchemical operations of Fermentation(spiritizing matter) and Distillation (a purifying circulation of rising vaporsand falling condensate).The fifth paragraph describes the powerful Quintessence (Fifth Element) that iscreated by following these instructions. In the next section, we learn thisprocess is a universal Pattern that governs transformation on all levels. It isnot only the secret pattern embedded in Nature but is also the formula that thealchemists follow in the Great Work.The final paragraph identifies the author as Hermes Trismegistus, which is Latinfor “Thrice Greatest Hermes.” The oldest reference to his name is in a papyrusof notes from a meeting of the Ibis cult near Memphis in 172 BCE.30[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-186] He is said to bethrice-great because he exists on all three levels of reality: the physical, themental, and the spiritual. Free of the cycle of rebirth and existing outside oftime, he has grasped the “Operation of the Sun,” or the inner workings of theuniverse.The unique spiritual technology developed in Alexandria was based on a deeplyintuitive understanding of the intimate connection between mind and matter. Bornof a union of laboratory observations with the spiritual practices of priestsand magicians, the new Art of Transformation sought to understand how things canbe perfected by working simultaneously with both physical and spiritualtechniques.The Birth of Cosmogonic MagicIn a parallel development in Alexandria, the ancient Egyptian cult of Hekaevolved into an organized collection of beliefs and practices that became thebasis for modern magic. Heka magic consisted of spells and rituals intended tocommunicate directly with the gods to ask for assistance and good fortune. Whileevery god had their own heka spells, the central focus of the cult was the godHeka, who took on human form. Often depicted as a boy, he was considered asource of creativity and provided the energy for transformation. Written spellsand amulets from the Heka cult dating back to 4500 BCE have been discovered, andit was actively practiced until around 500 CE.In Alexandria, there was a merging of Heka practices and the Neoplatonistphilosophy of Plotinus (204–270 CE) and Porphyry (234–305 CE) that gave birth toa spiritualized magic known as theurgy, or “divine working.” The Neoplatonistsdescribed reality as a series of emanations from the One, an ineffable presenceoutside the universe that was sometimes referred to as “The Good.” From the One(called To Hen by the Greeks) emanates the Divine Mind (Nous, or consciousness).From the Divine Mind proceeds Soul (Psyche), which includes both individual andworld soul. Finally, Soul is the seed of Nature (Physis, or physicalmanifestation).Theurgy is based on the idea that one can follow the divine emanations back totheir source. In other words, a person can evoke and even direct the divineenergies by a purifying initiation that includes active meditation, rigorousprayer, fasting, or devotional rituals. The beneficent energies (or spirits)released could then be influenced to disclose mysteries, accomplish tasks,animate objects, or even inhabit a human being as a medium.Plotinus called the union of the inner divinity of the Soul with the DivineSource henosis, and he created a school where methods of meditation were taughtto help his pupils achieve that state. Porphyry was a student at his school.The Syrian philosopher Iamblichus (250–325 CE), who was a pupil of Porphyry,expanded the methods of theurgy to include the practice of invocations andrituals to evoke the presence or action of a deity.31[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-185] He envisioned magic as apsychospiritual discipline whose goal was to bring divine energies into theeveryday world through the purified consciousness of the magician. Ceremonialmagic was the tool that connected the higher or astral identity of the magicianwith the divine presence.Iamblichus further modified the Neoplatonic teachings by reaffirming theoriginal Platonic idea of the soul’s descent or embodiment in matter. ToIamblichus, all matter was as divine as any other part of the cosmos, for it wasall within One Mind. In Theurgia: De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Theurgy: On theMysteries of Egypt), Iamblichus wrote:After the theurgic discipline has conjoined the individual Soul with the severaldepartments of the universe and all the divine powers that pervade it,” hewrote, “it leads the Soul to the Creator of the world, places it in his charge,and frees it of everything pertaining to the realm of matter—uniting it with theSole Eternal Reason (Logos). What I am saying is that it unites the Soulindividually with the One—Father of himself, self-moving, who sustains theuniverse. Thus, it establishes the theurgic soul in the creative energies, inthe conceptions and qualities of those powers. Finally, the Soul becomes part ofthe entire demiurgic mind. This, according to the Egyptian sages, is the final“Return” as taught in the Sacred Records. 32[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-184]Iamblichus traced the origin of theurgy to ancient Egypt and said it was Hermeshimself who revealed the divine plan in the minds of philosophers: “Hermes, thegod who presides over learning from ancient times,” he wrote, “is rightlyconsidered the common patron of all priests and presides over true knowledgeabout the gods. Our ancestors dedicated the fruits of their wisdom to him byattributing all their own writings to Hermes.” 33[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-183]For Iamblichus, theurgy was a series of operations aimed at recovering thetranscendent essence of reality by following divine signatures on both materialand spiritual levels of being. The work was with the Soul and not the mind.Ultimate reality could not be grasped with the human mind, because the One Mindis supra-rational and outside of space and time. By working “like with like”between levels, powerful symbols and deep intimations develop that embodytranscendent energy beyond the reach of words.The Sacred Goal of the Great WorkUnder the Neoplatonist influence in Alexandria, alchemy and theurgy evolved intospiritual disciplines that shared the same goals of the Great Work. Isolatingand purifying the Soul, or spiritual essence of plants and minerals, was alwayspart of practical laboratory work in alchemy. But now the emphasis was on thehuman soul and the evolution and perfection of the whole universe.The powerful Science of Soul that developed in Alexandria was a unique blend ofpractical chemistry, psychology, spirituality, and magic. Both alchemists andtheurgists believed all matter was alive with the divine signatures of itscreator, which caused substances to slowly evolve into a perfect expression ofdivine intent. Their goal was to speed up this natural process of perfection—toresurrect the spiritual essences trapped in matter and cause that which alreadyexists in a latent state to become active and grow.“The Great Work is, above all things, the creation of man by himself,” notedFrench magician Eliphas Levi. “That is to say, the full and entire conquest ofhis faculties and his future; it is especially the perfect emancipation of hiswill, assuring full power over the Universal Magical Agent. This Agent,disguised by the ancient philosophers under the name of the First Matter,determines the forms of modifiable substance, and we can really arrive by meansof it at metallic transmutation and the Universal Medicine.” 34[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-182]The First Matter in Alchemy and MagicThe concept of the First Matter (Materia Prima) was central to both theurgy andalchemy and united their practitioners in the Great Work (Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095]). The First Matter isthe primordial chaos that contains all possibilities. It is an unorganized stateof energy or proto-matter that is the same for all substances and exists in aninvisible state between energy and matter. According to the Hermetic viewpoint,the First Matter emerged from Chaos and is controlled by the light ofconsciousness from the One Mind.Alchemists believed the First Matter was a real substance that could beextracted from matter and made visible and tangible, and they even listed it asan ingredient in their experiments. The primary tool for manipulating it was thespiritual connection they made with the First Matter, in which theirconsciousness identified with it and changed it. Meditation, prayer, and ritualwere tools used by both alchemists and magicians in their pursuit of the FirstMatter.[image/Book4_Fig2.png]Figure 2. First MatterThe work with the First Matter is clearly demonstrated in the alchemists’ workwith the metals. It was thought the metals matured naturally underground, slowlychanging from base metals like lead into noble metals like silver and gold. Thisprocess could be speeded up by accessing the First Matter responsible for it,which in the case of the metals was mercury.Mercury was considered the First Matter of the metals because it has the powerto dissolve and balance the other metals. To transform metals, it is necessaryto melt them in fire, but mercury is naturally in a liquid state, able to takethe shape of any container and reflect a clear image of anything near it. Asquicksilver, it seemed alive and always changing. As a heavenly body, it wasalways closest to the sun and appeared to follow its own path in theheavens—sometimes even going backward.Swiss Renaissance alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541) elevated mercury to auniversal power in a triad of primordial forces known as the Tria Prima, or“Three Essentials.” Fiery Sulfur (brimstone) was equated with energy; Salt(cubic sodium compounds) represented matter; and shiny, reflective Mercury wasassociated with light. The Tria Prima became the prevalent working theory ofmedieval alchemists and is still represented in modern scientific theory asenergy, matter, and light (E = mc 2 ).In magical work, Sulfur is the anima, or the transformative Soul that burnsthrough time. Salt is the corpus, or physical effect to be manifested. Mercuryis the spiritus, or transformative power of consciousness. In terms ofapplication, Sulfur is the expansive force or binding agent between thespiritual realm above and the manifested world below. Salt is the contractiveforce or substantiating agent. Mercury is the force of conscious will ortransforming agent (Levi’s Universal Magical Agent).Hermetic alchemy and the Three Essentials became part of the doctrine of manyesoteric groups, including the Freemasons, Theosophists, Ordo Templi Orientis,Aurum Solis, Golden Dawn, and various Rosicrucian orders and Templar groups.35[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-181] According to Eliphas Levi,the Hermetic doctrines are a perennial philosophy that keeps resurfacing indifferent forms, no matter how much it is suppressed.Levi observed, “Behind the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories ofancient doctrines, behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations,under the seal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of Thebes, on the crumblingstones of old temples and on the blackened visage of the Sphinx, in themarvelous paintings of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of old books onalchemy, in the ceremonies practiced by all secret societies, there are foundindications of a Hermetic doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywherecarefully concealed.” 36 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-180]Practices and Techniques of Hermetic AlchemyConcealment and secrecy are fundamental characteristics of Hermetic practice.The term “Hermetically sealed” means making a container perfectly sealed andairtight. That kind of closed-off, uncontaminated spiritual environment is whereHermetic meditation, rituals, and initiations take place.In practice, the real path of Hermetic enlightenment is not theoretical verbiagebut the cultivation of silence. In the Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth, Hermestells his son Tat to become “a pure receptacle, a womb that understands insilence.” 37 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-179] He instructshim to “sing while you are silent” and let the cosmic hymn flow through him byremaining quietly receptive. Disciples of Hermes, still known as “Sons ofHermes,” reach the primal presence of the One only by passively receiving—andthen actively uniting with—its creative energies. At that point their ownconsciousness becomes divinely inspired.Rosicrucian AlchemyAlchemy was an essential part of the teachings of the Rosicrucian Order from itsinception. The mystical fellowship was allegedly founded in 1407 by ChristianRosenkreuz (literally, “Rosy Cross”). The original Order of the Rosy Crossconsisted of eight bachelor doctors who dedicated themselves to the “highergood” and started healing the sick without payment. For them, the Rosy Cross wasa symbol of higher love and understanding.Over the years, the original group grew into a secret brotherhood of alchemistsand sages whose goal was to transform the arts, sciences, religion, and politicsof Europe into a more enlightened view of the world. In the early seventeenthcentury, the brotherhood went public with the release of three manifestos: theFama Fraternitatis (Fame of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, 1614), theConfessio Fraternitatis (Confession of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, 1615),and, in 1617, an alchemical text called the Chymical Wedding of ChristianRosicross, which opened with Dee’s Monad symbol.Between 1614 and 1620, over four hundred books were published that discussed theRosicrucian manuscripts. By 1700, the Rosicrucians had grown into an influentialmovement of alchemists, magicians, scientists, and philosophers, who sought toapply alchemical operations to perfect both individuals and society. Prominentalchemists who were adherents of the group included John Dee (1527–1608),Heinrich Khunrath (1560–1605), Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Robert Fludd(1574–1637), Elias Ashmole (1617–1692), Thomas Vaughan (1621–1666), Robert Boyle(1627–1691), Isaac Newton (1643–1727), Count St. Germain (1691–1784), and CountCagliostro (1743–1795).Rosicrucian alchemy is a melding of practical and spiritual techniques based onthe universal principles of transformation. Thus, the operations of alchemyapply not only to lab work but also to the psychological and spiritualtransformation. The path to initiation in the Rosicrucian system involves ninestages of inner and outer transmutation of the threefold human soul, thethreefold human spirit, and the threefold human body.Rosicrucian philosophy gave birth to nearly fifty new Rose Cross organizations.The influential Fraternity of the Gold and Rosy Cross was founded by alchemistSamuel Richter (1690–1760?) in Germany in 1740, and new Rose Cross degrees andrites were added to the Masonic orders in the 1770s. The Societas Rosicruciana(Rosicrucian Society) was formed in Scotland and limited its membership toChristian Master Masons. The Rosicrucians heavily influenced many other groups,including the Martinists, Knights Templar, Golden Dawn, AnthroposophicalSociety, and the Theosophical Society.Modern Rosicrucian organizations include the Rosicrucian Fellowship, founded byDanish mystic Max Heindel (1865–1919) in California in 1909, and the LectoriumRosicrucianum, founded in Holland by Jan van Rijckenborgh (1896–1968) in 1924.The largest organization, the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), wasfounded by Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883–1939) after he was initiated into theRosicrucian mysteries in France. In 1915, he opened the headquarters in New Yorkand then moved it to San Jose, California, in 1927.The Sons of Hermes in EuropeThe rising influence of Hermeticism in Europe spread into the Church andblossomed in several Christian mysticism movements. One of the most popular wasthe Quietist Movement, born in Spain in the writings of Catholic nun Teresa ofAvila (1515–1582) and priest Miguel de Molinos (1640–1696).Like the Sons of Hermes, the Quietists believed it possible to have an innerexperience of the divine within the human soul, which can achieve divine unionwhile still on earth. We know from their journals and diaries that manyRenaissance alchemists practiced Quietist techniques in the privacy of theirchambers. The four stages of this powerful method are given in the followingsection.The Quietist Method 38 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-178]Step 1—QuietingTo begin the Quieting process, sit comfortably with your spine upright and closeyour eyes. Do not perform Quieting while lying down. The best time to practiceis early morning, after a nap, on a day off, or other time of solitude withoutinterruptions.This basic process of Quieting takes place on all levels of body, mind, andsoul. Beginning on the level of your body, slowly withdraw your attention fromphysical sensations and sensory inputs. Start “softening” the body by relaxingthe muscles and releasing tension.On the level of mind, Quieting requires stilling the constant chatter ofthoughts and the swirling chaos of emotional energy. During this initial stage,the mental faculties are not yet completely purified, and one tends to bedistracted by lingering thoughts, emotions, memories, fantasies, planning,worrying, and other lingering impressions in the mind. Simply ignore thesewithout deliberately trying to control them in any way. Try not to invest anyenergy pushing them away or attempting to bury them. Let them dissolve by notany paying attention to them.Other distractions that arise during this kind of activity are insights,breakthroughs, and self-reflected comments such as “Am I doing this right?,” “Ifeel so peaceful,” etc. All these attachments—even the positive ones—will causethe mind to descend into worldly concerns.The mind should be clear, without any ideas or impressions. It may take sometime to achieve this state, but it will manifest eventually if you maintain anattitude of dissolution and surrender and keep reducing everything to a state ofsimple awareness. When mental quieting has been attained, the attention shouldbe rested behind the eyes or forehead.On the level of soul, the Quieting process is one of release from earthlydesires. It is a way of soothing our inner being by letting go of naggingfeelings of guilt, greed, pride—intrusive desires of any kind. It is alsonecessary to overcome feelings of deficiency, sinfulness, or inferiority and torealize the Soul is infinite and not tied to this world or to the acts of anytemporal ego that emerged from it. Successful quieting of the Soul results in afeeling of loving innocence and transcendent peacefulness.Once body, mind, and soul are quieted, the work focuses on the Cultivation ofSilence. The primary work here is on the individual will, which becomes lost orabsorbed into the divine presence within the sacred Stillness. Remember, it isthe Stillness itself that dissolves you.Do not set a time limit or use an alarm to end the Quieting phase. Do it as longas you can, and when you feel it is time, gently withdraw from this InnerLaboratory and end the session. Clarity of intent is what makes this work. Oncethat is lost, it is time to stop.Step 2—ReversionOnce Quieting is mastered, move directly from that phase to the second step,which is Reversion. During Reversion, the focus is on surrendering yourselfcompletely to the divine will and seeking higher guidance to replace your ownpersonal will. Ironically, this occurs most easily when a person is at the endof their rope—frustrated and disappointed in their efforts to change themselves.It can happen to anyone trying to do something extraordinary with their livesand being thwarted by peers, family, careers, social expectations, dogma, orother cultural restrictions.To really understand Reversion, you need to understand the ways in which youhave rejected the divine in your life. Some people throw themselves into dailychores, busy work, obligations, and jobs and never acknowledge the spirituallevel of their lives. They do not believe in mystical experiences, or they thinkaccepting such ideas would somehow interfere with their practical goals. Othersare consumed by soul-robbing careers that demand all their time and energy, andthey do not have the luxury of experimenting with spirituality. Still others arehardened into a materialistic approach to the world through greed, rejection,abuse or painful experiences, or just lack of love in their lives.The practice during this stage is to reflect on your failures to acceptspiritual realities. Reflect on how that has robbed your life of depth andmeaning. Acknowledge the ways in which your soul has been damaged because of it.All that should remain is the sincere urge to be healed and made whole again.Step 3—RecollectionThe third step in the Quietist method is Recollection, which is a process oftranscending duality and affirming the divine Source of all things. The work ofRecollection begins with intense mental focus in which one concentrates on thewithdrawal of the Soul from worldly temptations and enters devout contemplationon the power of spiritual passion. The two previous steps must be masteredbefore proceeding to the Recollection stage.The primary tool of Recollection is deep contemplation, which must be practicedinside the heart and not intellectually. A deep piety will develop in your heartthat is beyond any that can be achieved through religious dogma or ceremonialperformances. This pureness in the heart becomes a steadfast guide, as the Souldesires to be led by the divine Will only.From the Hermetic viewpoint, this emerging spirit is Thoth/Hermes, the innerguide that is born within the purified heart. In practice, one must agree to thenecessity of divine assistance—something totally separate from one’s being—thatwill provide the confidence and actualized faith to proceed to the final stagein this process.It is very important to persevere in a state of deep contemplation and continueresiding in the heart until your personal ego dissolves. In terms of spiritualchemistry, the vessel of the soul must be hermetically sealed so nothing fromthe mundane world contaminates it. Suddenly, you feel “refreshed and renewed” bythe unmistakable presence of divine grace.At that point, contemplation must cease immediately without discursive thinkingof any kind, and the methods by which you achieved this state must be abandoned.Your soul must allow the divine to work within it—and through it. The Soul mustbloom naturally without hindrance and allow the influx of grace to continue ifpossible.Step 4—Infused ContemplationThe final step of the Quietist method may take some time to achieve, because theflowering of the Soul depends on maintaining an open gateway to divine grace.Proceeding directly from the previous step, one now enters a state of passivecontemplation in which one witnesses the infusion of divine energy. It isexperienced as an expansive fascination and profound humbling in the presence ofsomething greater. One feels completely fulfilled and fully alive and requiresnothing else. The frenzied search for truth ends and one exists in a state ofgnostic bliss. It is a rare and wonderful state that human beings can—andhave—achieved.Each individual soul is also part of the greater Soul of the universe.Therefore, one’s soul is also the center of the universe, because a person canbecome one with the divine Mind by cohabitating the same sacred space.To stay in this holy place, continuous self-denial and mortification arerequired. Pride and self-love on any level must be banished, so that all thatremains is the simple and pure desire to remain in the presence of the divine,which is the Soul’s desire and true home.Grounding Divine EnergyThe initiate’s role during Infused Contemplation is to become the perfect vesselfor divine energy. Thinking this or trying to visualize it is not enough. Onemust continue in this final phase in a wholly passive state. Physical sensationswill eventually disappear. Memory and imagination will now be absorbed in thedivine, and a feeling of ecstasy will permeate one’s being as the energycondenses into a new incarnation.Iamblichus named this new body the Augoeides, from the Greek term meaning“luminous body.” It is also known as the “Cloak of Hermes,” the tangible body oflight or transformed spiritual body worn by the initiate who has overcome thelimitations of physical consciousness. In the Golden Dawn tradition, AleisterCrowley taught that the Augoeides is born within the initiate as a separateidentity—a higher spirit or guardian angel.But the Augoeides is just one form that can be taken by the grounding of divineenergy. Alchemists refer to the conscious projection or manifestation of desiresin the physical world as chemicalization, although it has nothing to do withlaboratory chemicals. The term refers to the use of certain methods to condenseone’s spiritual powers into etheric “chemicals” that can react and have aneffect in the real world. The steps in this psychospiritual process are outlinedbelow in the following section.ChemicalizationStep 1—SealingThe first step is to get a clear image of what it is you want to accomplish.Then try to isolate the relevant essences and primal forces associated with yourgoal. Next, seal these raw ideas and emotions in the Vessel of Transformation.The vessel could be a ritual space or your own mind, but it must be hermeticallysealed and purified of outside influences. The work is in the Inner Laboratory,and it may take some effort to connect with the archetypal essences of thesituation or desire. Each must be identified as separate “chemicals,” with theirown identities and properties.Step 2—AgitationThis is a process of stirring up the energies or bringing them to life in thesealed vessel. It involves active imagination—visualizations and guided imagerydesigned to encourage the trapped essences to express and release theirarchetypal energies.Step 3—CombustionHaving released the volatile “inner vapors,” you now set them afire withforceful, focused intention. You need to turn up the fire to gain control anddirect the energy toward completion of your goal. It begins with a period ofpurposeful chaos and inflammation. In this tumultuous state, you will find thetruth you are looking for not in the mind but in the blood—in your feelings anddesires.Next is a courageous and unrelenting intrusion of your intention into the innercauldron. It is the aggressive application of your will over the seething powerstrapped inside. Finally, as you gain control, the energy changes. It becomesmore coalesced and starts flowing on its own—like lava.Step 4—WithdrawalThe willful fires are abruptly withdrawn and the aggressive focusing of theflame of consciousness turned off. Total silence—without any thoughts oremotions—must prevail. The essences in the vessel are now cooking in their ownheat, digesting in their own juices. There may be a black period of doubt ordepression within you, but this is part of the process. To succeed, you must letgo without losing interest.Step 5—ManifestationAfter the ritual ends, the original desire or goal gradually begins to reappearin your life. But you must not rush it or want it too badly. Never talk about itor share the experience with others at this point. Enthusiasm must becontained—let the desire gain power slowly. Allow the energy to congeal on itsown and flow at its own pace toward the target. The pregnancy of your intentionmust have time to mature in the darkness. Soon, perhaps unexpectedly, yourdesire will manifest into reality.The process of projection and manifestation requires a lot of inner work anddiscipline. You must learn to sacrifice yourself, for you are an ingredient inthis process. The purification and concentration of your desire, willpower, andimagination reignite your Secret Fire on a higher level that fuels thecontinuing transformation as an independent force or servitor.The Operations of AlchemyThe names of laboratory operations can vary in alchemical manuscripts, and eventhe number of operations can exceed seventy. For instance, in the astrologicalarrangement, there are twelve operations that work through the zodiac.* TheGreat Work in this system follows the houses of astrology: Aries (Calcination),Taurus (Congelation), Gemini (Fixation), Cancer (Dissolution), Leo (Digestion),Virgo (Distillation), Libra (Sublimation),Scorpio (Separation), Sagittarius (Ceration), Capricorn(Putrefaction/Fermentation), Aquarius (Multiplication), and Pisces (Projection).Generally, most procedures in alchemy reduce to six or seven basic operations.This is because there are different names for the same processes. Calcinationand incineration, coagulation and congelation, separation and purgation,cibation (adding water at the right time) and solution (or dissolution), are allnames for similar operations. Sometimes the operations are part of each other.For example, putrefaction (or digestion) is part of the fermentation process,and sublimation is a form of distillation.In the planetary/metals sequence, which we will see at the end of this book inthe Azoth drawing (Figure 16[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109]), there are sevenoperations corresponding to the planets and their metals, beginning withSaturn/Lead and working up to the Sun/Gold. However, there are two arrangementsof this drawing. In the Ptolemaic system (140–1600 CE), the Earth is at thecenter of the universe, and the Sun, Moon, and planets circle around it. In thisscheme, the Sun is at ray four (conjunction) and the Moon at ray five(fermentation) in the Azoth drawing. The Copernican system (1543–present)reflects the true arrangement, with the Sun at the center of our solar system.This modern Ladder of the Planets pattern (Figure 16[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109]), which is favored bypsychologists and contemporary magicians, has the Moon at ray six (distillation)and the Sun at ray seven (coagulation).To confuse matters more, the alchemists liked to scramble the order of theoperations, and very few drawings depict the operations in their proper order.Yet one thing that does seem to stay the same are the four phases oftransformation. The first is the Black phase, which involves the destruction ofexisting structures or habits. The second White Phase is a period ofpurification of the surviving essences. The third, very brief Yellow phaserepresents the hint of gold or dawning of inner light that is taking place. Thefinal Red Phase of empowerment is the ultimate fusion of spirit and matter.In the esoteric alchemy of the Golden Dawn and Rosicrucian orders, the White andRed are the dominant phases of the Great Work. In these traditions, the WhitePhase of inner purity and the Red Phase of outer projection each consists ofthree to six alchemical operations.The White and Red phases come together in the adept (on earth) during the finaloperation of Conjunction. This is ancient Egyptian or Ptolemaic alchemy with theearth at the center, and it represents an important distinction from otherspiritual or religious movements. It implies the final stage of perfection isnot on high in some ethereal heaven but right here on earth in matter. In thisview, the spiritization of matter (and the human body) is the true goal of theGreat Work.* Pernety, Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermétique (Mytho-Hermetic Dictionary), 99.Ritual and Prayer in the LaboratoryThe alchemist’s laboratory was a sacred space in which the spiritual powersabove merged with the physical work below (Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor096]). Alchemicalexperiments became rituals in which the alchemist identified with the substanceat hand and suffered with it through its transformations. The practical work ofchemistry was done simultaneously with prayer and meditation.[image/Book4_Fig3.png]Figure 3. LaboratoryThere was usually a special chamber or tabernacle in the lab called theOratorium where the alchemist could find privacy to meditate or pray. Ora etLabora (“Pray and Work”) was the guiding dictum of alchemists. In the followingtwo experimental procedures—making tinctures and elixirs—we will see how themerging of physical and spiritual took place.Making a Spiritized Tincture 39[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-177]Step 1—Preparing the MenstruumMenstruum is the alchemist’s word for the alcohol, acid, glycerin, oil, or othersolvent used to extract essences from a substance. For herbal tinctures orelixirs, the preferred menstruum is high-proof grape alcohol. However, it isdifficult to make and expensive to procure. Most modern practitioners usetaste-free Everclear (190 proof), Spirytus (192 proof), Balkan Vodka (179proof), or popular vodkas (80 proof).You will also need a clean jelly jar or small Mason jar with a volume of around100–200 ml (3.4–6.8 ounces). If the jar has a metal lid, you will have to coverit in plastic wrap. Metal spoons or other utensils should also never come incontact with the menstruum or tincture. Metal grounds and changes the spiritualenergy you are trying to capture and control. Remember, the vessels of thealchemists were treated like ritual items and not everyday bottles, flasks, andglasses.Step 2—Signatures and TimingBefore you begin working with the herb, get to know its signatures by handlingit and paying attention to its color, odor, and physical structure. Make aninfusion (tea) from the herb and taste it. Research the folklore and propertiesof the herb. The more you know about it, the better. Apply your knowledge andfamiliarity with the herb to try to connect with the soul of the herb inmeditation. This will release and capture the herb’s archetypal power.All major operations on the herb, such as picking, drying, crushing, mixing, andextraction, should ideally be begun during the correct planetary hour on theplanetary day ruling the herb. (Planetary charts can be downloaded fromAlchemystudy.com/download/Planetary_Charts.pdf.)Wash and clean the herb whose tincture will be made. The favorite healing herbof the alchemists was the jupiterian plant Melissa (lemon balm), but any edibleherb can be used. Start by drying the herb in an open oven at low heat (lessthan 180°F or 82°C) for 2–3 hours. Pre-dried herbs and bulk teas can also beused if you do not have access to fresh plants.Step 3—Begin the ExtractionBegin the extraction process in the planetary hour of the ruling planet of theherb. Begin with meditation and prayer to create a sacred space within thevessel. Then take the dried herb and crush it by hand into small pieces. You canalso use a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder to grind it to a coarse powder.You can use metal utensils with the dried herb but not with the menstruum ortincture. Place about 40 ml (1.4 ounces) of the powder per 100 ml (3.4 ounces)of volume in your jar. With focused intent, pour the menstruum over the herbuntil it is saturated but not over two-thirds full. Hermetically seal the jarwith a tight lid.Step 4—IncubationStart the incubation process by wrapping the jar in cloth or foil. It should notbe exposed to light during the initial incubation period. Then place the jar ina warm location, near (not on) a radiator, furnace, or water heater. Shake thejar vigorously once or twice a day. While shaking it, visualize the herbwillingly giving up its essences or soul.Step 5—DistillationThe fluid inside will evaporate as it warms up and then condense again. As thisnatural inner distillation repeats, the soul of the herb is regenerated byminute degrees closer to perfection. This circulation and maceration (“chewing”)is responsible for the tincturing process. The fluid will become darker witheach passing day. Alchemically, the coloration (or tincturing) is the extractionof the Sulfur (soul essence) from the Salt (plant matter) by the Mercury (spiritof alcohol).Continue this process for two to three weeks, until the color of the tincture isdark. This is your “Philosophical Child” and must be treated with a caringattitude. Let no one else handle the jar or even view its contents. Each timeyou handle it, visualize the sulfurous soul being born in the murky herbal massin the darkness of the Hermetic womb of the jar.Step 6—Animating the MercuryAfter the color of the liquid is sufficiently darkened, let the jar cool to roomtemperature before opening. Opening the jar is considered the moment of birthfor the resurrected soul of the herb. Like the birth of a child, the firstmoments of breath are crucial to survival.In a process known as “Animating the Mercury,” the alchemist brings the tinctureto life outside the womb of the sealed jar. While carefully opening the jar,visualize the forces that animate the living world. As the Emerald Tablet tellsus, “Its father is the Sun; Its mother the Moon. The Wind carries it in itsbelly; Its nurse is the Earth.” 40[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-176] The enlivening solar spiritof Celestial Fire from above is carried by the air and enters the body throughbreathing. From below, the nurturing lunar spirit of Manifestation grounds theenergy in a living soul.Allow the tincture to breathe while warming the jar in your hands and meditatingon this divine process. The soul of the herb is now resurrected and enlivened bythe intervention of spirit.Step 7—Retrieving the Living TinctureNow the tincture is a living thing and can survive on its own. Press out anyremaining liquid from the mass of plant matter. Then filter the solution (usingmedium filter paper or coffee filters) until it is clear of particles or debris.The resulting tinctured liquid contains the Sulfur or soul of the herb (itsessential oils) united with its Mercury or spirit (the alcohol).Making the Elixir 41 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-175]Step 1—Incinerating the DregsIf you wish to go on and make the Elixir, save all the dregs or waste productsfrom the tincturing process. These consist of phlegm (liquid scum, foam, andgoo) and feces (solid waste and residue) removed by filtering. The solids arethe depleted salts or dead body of the herb—what the alchemists called the caputmortum (“dead head”).The word elixir is from the Arabic Al-iksir, which literally means “from theashes.” The elixir process is all about purifying and resurrecting the immortalessences within the cremated remains of the herb.Place the dregs in a heatproof bowl, pot, or frying pan and cover with a wirescreen. Ignite the alcohol-soaked material and let it burn. The mass will beginto incinerate and roast. Let the dead plant matter burn itself out and cool.Step 2—Purifying the AshesTake the ashes from the initial combustion and grind to a fine powder with amortar and pestle. Then place the ashes in a covered crucible or heatproof dish.Heat in an oven, at the highest temperature possible, until the ashes haveturned grayish white. Continued heating at higher temperatures will turn theashes pure white. Heating for several days at 3000°F (1650°C) would turn themred. Store the purified ashes in a clean and clearly labeled flask. You may haveto repeat this process many times to get enough ashes to work with. Alchemistssometimes refer to these ashes as the “new body,” or resurrected Salt.Step 3—Tincturing the AshesMix the tincture from the previous work with the purified ashes at the correctplanetary hour on the planetary day ruling the herb. Pour the entire tinctureover the ashes in the flask. If the tincture is still living, there should be aslight fizzing sound. Shake vigorously, then hermetically seal the flask.Step 4—Incubating the Tinctured AshesPut the flask in an incubator or by a heat source to digest. Shake three timesdaily. During this time, much of the purified ashes (or resurrected Salt) willbe absorbed into the tincture. After three weeks, pour off any remaining liquid,leaving the new Salt residue in the flask. Now seal the flask and let it sit foranother few weeks in an incubator or in a warm spot out of direct light.Step 5—Animating the ElixirOpen the jar and let the material breathe for the first time in the birthingprocess described in step 6 of the tincturing operation (Animating the Mercury).Leave the flask open and let the material dry up and granulate. Scrape thisregenerated Salt out of the jar after it has dried, then grind it to a finepowder in a warm mortar. Store the reanimated elixir in a clean dark-glass flaskor jar.The elixir powder at this stage, known as the Powder of Projection, representsthe resurrection of the soul of the herb into a new higher or spiritized body.The combination of the alchemist’s grounding spirit and the Celestial spiritfrom above makes the elixir magically healing. Depending on the characteristics(or “signatures”) of the herb, the elixir can be used to cure a variety ofspecific conditions.In general, the process of projection is used to transmute a lesser substance orsituation into a higher or more perfect form. Projection opens a channel betweenthe alchemist below and the divine energies above. It requires intense focusingand deliberate direction of etheric energies on the part of the alchemist. Thismysterious marriage of mind and matter is when the alchemist becomes themagician.Alchemist-Magician John DeeDr. John Dee (1527–1608) was a true Renaissance man who achieved world renown asa mathematician, alchemist, magician, mapmaker, cryptographer, astrologer, andphilosopher. His library was one of the largest in England, with nearly fourthousand rare texts and manuscripts, and his alchemical laboratory rivaled anyin the world at the time.When he entered Cambridge College at the age of fifteen, Dee began a five-yearregimen of sleeping only four hours a day, so he could devote more time tostudying Hermetic philosophy and alchemy. “I was so vehemently bent to study,”said Dee of his time at Cambridge, “that for those years I did inviolably keepthis order: only to sleep four hours every night; to allow to meet, eat, anddrink two hours every day; and of the other eighteen hours all were spent in mystudies and learning.”Dee grew into an imposing figure with a commanding presence. Biographer JohnAubrey described his physical appearance in his manuscript Brief Lives (1693):“He had a very fair, clear, rosy complexion and a long beard as white as milk.He was tall and slender—a very handsome man. He wore a gown like an artist’sfrock, with hanging sleeves, and a slit. A mighty good man was he.” *Dee was a close confidant of Queen Elizabeth I, who issued him a license topractice alchemy and make gold. As a favor to the Queen, it is said, he“controlled the Elements” and cast a spell on the Spanish Armada by causing badweather to thwart the invasion of England. He is said to have been theinspiration for Prospero in Shakespeare’s The Tempest (1610) and also the modelfor Goethe’s Faust (1587).While most alchemists of his time sought the Philosopher’s Stone for its allegedability to transmute base metals into gold, Dee viewed it as much as aphilosophy as a physical object. He described it as a state of magicalconsciousness that could transmute the human soul into a more perfect state.“The Philosopher’s Stone,” he stated, “is the force behind the evolution of lifeand the universal binding power which unites minds and souls in a higher humanoneness.” *** Clark, Aubrey’s Brief Lives, 255.** Halliwell, The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee, 87.Dr. John Dee—Alchemist and MagicianPerhaps the greatest European master of projection and chemicalization wasBritish alchemist-magician Dr. John Dee (1527–1608). He invented a system ofceremonial magic based on the evocation and commanding of heavenly spirits andrevealed the Enochian language in which they communicated.42[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-174] He was given a license topractice alchemy by Queen Elizabeth I and was considered a master occultist andastrologer.In addition, Dee was one of the leading mathematicians in the world. Convincedthat Euclidean geometry was sacred and originated from the One Mind, just asPythagoras taught, he constructed a multilayered symbol that incorporated allthe planetary energies and their angelic correspondences. He used the ancientciphers of alchemy as geometric figures and applied Euclidean geometry tocapture their deeper meaning and relationships.[image/Book4_Fig4.png]Figure 4. MonadHe called his sigil the Monad, from the Greek word meaning the “ultimateOne”—the singular entity from which all properties are derived (Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor097]). Dee said hisgeometric proof would revolutionize all areas of knowledge and urged astronomersto stop peering through their telescopes trying to understand the heavens andinstead spend their time meditating on his Monad. If one could drop the Monadcipher into a great sea of First Matter, he noted, then the universe as we knowit would emerge.The Monad ritual described below is a geometric meditation using a square andcompass, the classic tools of sacred geometry used in Freemasonry. Take a momentbetween each step to reflect on the esoteric properties of the construction.The Monad Ritual1. At the center of a white piece of unlined paper, make a single dot. This isthe Monad, the dimensionless One or Hermetic source outside creation that modernscience views as the inexplicable singularity of the Big Bang.2. Using the Monad point as center, draw a circle with a 1-inch (2.5 cm) radius(Figure 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098]). The circledelineates the manifested universe. Now look at what you have drawn. It is thecipher for the Sun, and what is about to unfold is the Operation of the Sun.This is also the cipher for the perfected metal gold.[image/Book4_Fig5.png]Figure 5. Sun3. Now draw a semicircle of the same radius intersecting the top of the cipherfor the Sun (Figure 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099]).This crescent represents the Moon facing the Sun and reflecting its light. Thisunion of Fire (Sun) and Water (Moon) is the Sacred Marriage of the King andQueen in alchemy. The overall figure you have created also represents the Hornsof Taurus or the Cornucopia of creation.[image/Book4_Fig6.png]Figure 6. Moon4. At the very bottom of the circle, draw a vertical line downward for 3 inches(7.5 cm). This is the vertical axis of reality, or Axis Mundi, that connects thespiritual or energetic realm above with the material or manifested world below.5. At 1 inch (2.5 cm) down the vertical axis, draw a horizontal line 2 inches (5cm) wide centered at right angles to the vertical line (Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100]). This is thehorizontal axis of reality, and it symbolizes the fundamental duality ofcreation. It represents the polarities of male-female, King-Queen,light-darkness, good-evil, right-left, and positive-negative that make the worldgo round.[image/Book4_Fig7.png]Figure 7. Construction6. The cross we constructed provides deep insight into reality. Known as theCross of the Elements, it is where the Soul is crucified, torn betweenopposites. Dee calls the point where the lines meet the “Copulative Center,”meaning a fertile inner point of balance and repose. It represents humanconsciousness, just as the center point above in the Sun represents the DivineMind.7. The two lines and their crossing point make up a Tria Prima of forcesrepresenting Body or Salt (the horizontal line), Soul or Sulfur (the verticalline), and Spirit or Mercury (the crossing point). The Tria Prima plus the FourElements constitute the Septenary, or sevenfold pattern of creation.8. A Quaternary, or Cubic Space, is created by the four intersecting lines,which stand for the Four Elements. The Quintessence, or Fifth Element, isindicated by their shared crossing point that represents mind or consciousness.9. Here Dee reveals the Octad, which is concealed “in a most secret manner” inthe geometric relationship of the four lines plus the four right angles. Headvises the initiate to study this relationship “with great attention.” Thehidden Octad refers to an unseen or etheric reality all around us. In Discourseon the Eighth and Ninth, Hermes Trismegistus calls it “the realm beyond words”behind physical reality.43 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-173]10. At the bottom of the vertical line, draw two 1-inch-radius (2.5 cm)semicircles—one touching the bottom of the line on the left side and the otheron the right side. The two semicircles form the astrological sign of Aries,which is the first sign of the zodiac and traditionally when the Great Workbegins. It is also associated with the Fire Element and the burst of life in thespring. “To begin the work of this Monad,” notes Dee, “the aid of Fire isrequired.” The point at the bottom where the two semicircles meet representsanother kind of consciousness—the instinctive life force or Mind of Nature.11. The construction is complete, but the ritual continues as its deepermeanings are revealed. Take a minute to study the entire Monad, paying attentionto the overall relationship between the lines.12. Within the body of the Monad, Dee has concealed all the glyphs of the sevenplanets and their associated metals. By tracing the connecting lines and arcs indifferent ways, one can locate all seven heavenly spheres and thereby reveal howthe archetypal forces relate in Nature. See if you can find the correspondingalchemical ciphers in Dee’s Monad symbol.13. The merged planetary ciphers are arranged from left to right and top tobottom around the Cross of the Elements (Figure 8[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101]). According to Dee, byplacing the planetary ciphers in their proper relationship, the symbols comealive. In this arrangement, the Sun at the top of the Monad is the only symbolthat is always the same and, in that sense, incorruptible like gold. No matterwhich way the Monad is turned—upside down, left to right, right to left, or itsmirror image—the cipher of the Sun and gold is always the same. The shape orphase of the Moon, however, is tied to the position of the Sun.[image/Book4_Fig8.png]Figure 8. Ciphers14. The heart of the Monad and the one cipher that embodies all the others isMercury (Figure 9 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102]).Mercury is the key to transformation and is considered the First Matter of themetals. Just as is depicted in the Monad, Mercury is the source of all themetals and amalgamates them together as one.[image/Book4_Fig9.png]Figure 9. Mercury15. The planetary metals are arranged around the Cross of the Elements. Theprimal duality of Saturn/Lead is represented in the left-right mirror image ofits cipher, each of which is composed of one of the Aries semicircles and thevertical axis (Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor103] and Figure 11[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104]). The duality ofJupiter/Tin is revealed in the 90-degree mirror image of its ciphers along thehorizontal axis (Figure 12[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105] and Figure 13[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106]). Each cipher iscomposed of the lower quadrant of the Cross of Elements and its correspondingAries semicircle.[image/Book4_Fig10.png][image/Book4_Fig11.png]Figure 10. Saturn Left Figure 11. Saturn Right[image/Book4_Fig12.png][image/Book4_Fig13.png]Figure 12. Jupiter Left Figure 13. Jupiter Right16. The ciphers for Mars/Iron and Venus/Copper form their own male-femaleduality on the vertical axis, where they lie in conjunction on top of each other(Figure 14 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor107] and Figure15 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108]).[image/Book4_Fig14.png]Figure 14. Venus Top[image/Book4_Fig15.png]Figure 15. Mars Bottom17. The ritual is now complete. For additional insights into the Monad, reviewthe twenty-four theorems of John Dee’s treatise The Hieroglyphic Monad publishedin 1564.44 [LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#footnote-172]Mystery of the AzothAnother powerful drawing that incorporates the occult symbology of alchemy is ameditative mandala known as the Azoth of the Philosophers (Figure 16[LCBCeremonialMagick02_Book3and4.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109]), by German alchemistBasil Valentine (1394–1450). Azoth is from the Arabic word for mercury, in thesense of a Universal Solvent (also known as the Alkahest). The letters A and Zin the word convey the idea of unlimited application to everything from A to Zor from alpha to omega.[image/Book4_Fig16.jpg]Figure 16. AzothThis drawing was considered blasphemous by the Church, and it was circulatedsecretly in several different forms during the late Middle Ages. The followingritual is a step-by-step working of the mandala, which reflects the corrected orCopernican order of the planets preferred by most modern alchemists andmagicians.The Azoth RitualStep 1—The AlchemistThe ritual begins in the circle at the very center of the mandala. Fix yourattention on the face of the bearded alchemist for a few minutes and try toidentify with him—like you are looking into a mirror. The downward-pointingtriangle superimposed over his face is the cipher for the Water Element, and itsuggests divine grace pouring down from above like rain. So within the triangleat the center of the drawing is the face of God, and the drawing clearly impliesthat the face of God and the face of the alchemist are the same.Now broaden your attention to include the schematic body of the alchemist, whichis shown in perfect balance with the Four Elements as depicted in hisoutstretched arms and legs. His right foot is firmly planted on Earth and hisleft is in Water. In his right hand is a torch of Fire and in his left hand anostrich feather symbolizing Air.Step 2—Suspended in DualityThe alchemist stands balanced between the masculine and feminine powers. Try tounderstand the differences between these opposing forces as you explore thesymbols that surround them. Sol, the archetypal Sun King, is seated on a lion tohis right, and Luna, the archetypal Moon Queen, is seated on a great fish in theocean to his left. Above the King is the torch of Fire; below him is Earth.Above the Queen is the feather of Air; below her is Water.Sol holds a scepter and a shield indicating his strength and authority over thevisible world, but the fiery dragon of his rejected unconscious waits patientlyin a cave beneath him. Luna holds the reins to a great fish, symbolizing hergentle taming of nature, and behind her is a chaff of wheat, which stands forher connection to fertility and growth. The bow and arrow she cradles in herleft arm symbolize the wounds of the heart and body she accepts as part of herexistence.Step 3—The Three EssentialsMove your attention to the large inverted triangle that stands behind thecircular emblem of the alchemist. Again, this is the cipher for Water, but nowit carries the Tria Prima, or three primordial forces, pouring down. Sulfur asenergy is depicted in the left corner as the Sun. It is labeled Anima, or Soul.On top of it, a salamander plays in fire—the classic alchemical symbol forenergy.In the right corner, Mercury as light is depicted as the reflecting Moon. It islabeled Spiritus, or Spirit. On top perches the Bird of Spirit ready to takeflight. Finally, Salt as matter is depicted at the bottom as the Cube ofElements. It is labeled Corpus, or body. The five stars hovering around itsuggest it also contains a hidden Fifth Element, the invisible Quintessence, orlife force.Step 4—The Ray of SaturnIn a circular pattern around the body of the alchemist are seven rays oremanations indicating a progressive level of transformation. These operationsare numbered from one to seven and contain the cipher of the correspondingplanet and metal. Following each ray is a circle (called a roundel) containing ascene that elaborates on the work to be performed at that stage.The first ray is the downward-pointing black ray labeled number one. Itrepresents the beginning of the Ladder of the Planets and is marked by thecipher that stands for both the metal lead and the planet Saturn. The squaresymbol for Salt is also shown, which indicates our work begins in the unredeemedmatter of the physical realm.This heavy oppressive darkness—whether in the laboratory or in the mind—is wherethe Great Work begins. Symbols of the Black Phase of alchemy are the Crow, theRaven, the Toad, and the Massa Confusa, or First Matter.The first roundel (between rays one and two) shows a black crow perching on topof a skull. Next to it on the outer ring is the Latin word Visita, which means“to visit or start a journey.” This is the initial Black Phase of alchemy,during which the subject is purified by breaking it down during mortificationand calcination. Calcination is the heating of a substance in a crucible or overan open flame until it is reduced to ashes. Psychologically, this is thedestruction of ego and its attachments to possessions and material reality.Reflect on what this ray says about your own situation.Step 5—The Ray of JupiterThe second ray is marked with the cipher that stands for both the metal tin andthe planet Jupiter. The corresponding second roundel depicts the black crowwatching itself being dissolved. The word on the outer ring near this roundel isInteriora, which means “the interior or innermost parts.”This is the beginning of the White Phase of purification. Symbols include awhite Skull or Skeleton, the White Swan, and Two Fish (Soul and Spirit) swimmingin opposite directions. The operation at this stage is a further process ofmortification known as dissolution. Dissolution is dissolving the ashes fromcalcination in water or acids. This represents a further breaking down of theartificial structures of the psyche. Again, reflect on how this operation wouldtake place in your own personality.Step 6—The Ray of MarsThe third ray is marked with the cipher signifying both the metal iron and theplanet Mars. It is also marked with a smaller cipher for Sulfur, one of the TriaPrima forces. Iron and sulfur come together chemically in vitriol, or sulfuricacid, the aggressive liquid fire of the alchemists.The third roundel depicts the alchemical operation of separation. The remains ofthe black, earthbound crow are being picked apart by two white soul-birds, whoretrieve any viable parts. Separation is the isolation of the components ofdissolution by filtration and discarding any unworthy material. What valuableessences would such an operation reveal in you?This step is the first coming together of the birds of Soul and Spirit andrepresents the conclusion of the White Phase of purification. In the ring abovethis roundel is written Terrae, which means “from the earth.” It refers to thegenuine material being separated out from the dregs of matter at this stage.Continue this operation on the inner level by trying to recognize and preservethe genuine parts of your personality as you remember your origin state ofinnocence.Step 7—The Ray of VenusThe fourth ray is marked with the cipher that stands for both copper and Venus.The fourth roundel depicts the birds of Soul and Spirit leaving the earthtogether, lifting a five-spiked crown representing the Fifth Element, orQuintessence, recovered from the preceding operations.In the ring above the roundel is inscribed the word Rectificando, which means“by rectification” or “setting things right.” This is the turning point inalchemy, when the matter undergoes spiritization. Known as the Green Phase, itis symbolized by the Green Lion, the Cockerel and Hen, the King and Queenholding hands, and scenes of marriage and copulation.Here begins the sacred work of conjunction, which is the recombination of thesaved essences from separation into a new incarnation. On the personal level,this is the Integration of the Personality—a return to wholeness and renewedconfidence. Reflect on what the empowerment of your true self would look like.Step 8—The Ray of MercuryThe fifth ray is marked with the cipher for the metal mercury (quicksilver) andthe planet Mercury, as well as an identical smaller symbol indicating Mercury ofthe Three Essentials. The fifth roundel has the inscription Invenies, whichmeans “you will discover.” The scene in the roundel shows the birds of Soul andSpirit nesting in a tree, brooding over the alchemical egg.The operation here is fermentation, in which the essences of Soul and Spiritgive birth to a new life. It begins with the putrefaction or decay of theproduct from the earthly conjunction. In a sense, it dies and is resurrected ona higher level as a new embodiment known as the Child of the Philosophers. Thismarks the beginning of the Red Phase of empowerment.Fermentation is a subtle process best understood as a rebirth on a new level ofspiritual reality—like the crushing of grapes to make the spirit of wine. It isinitiated by the crushing of the ego or the utter destruction of worldlyconnections, including physical death. Some of the tools of fermentation aredeep reflection and meditation, spiritual fasting, and psychoactive drugs. Thisphase is often associated with the rainbow or Peacock’s Tail, which depict arapid cycling through brilliant colors. In shamanic initiations, fermentation isachieved by using “plant allies” containing psychedelic substances.Step 9—The Ray of the MoonThe sixth ray contains the cipher that stands for both the metal silver and theMoon. Distillation is the operation at this stage, and it involves the boilingand condensing of vapors from the fermented solution. The circulatory processgradually increases the purity and potency of the product of fermentation. Thisis the second or higher working with the element Water in the Great Work. Itresults in the production of the extremely pure White Stone, which representsthe resurrected Soul or living essence of a substance.Distillation is represented in the fifth roundel by a unicorn lying on theground in front of a rose bush. According to legend, the unicorn runs tirelesslyfrom pursuers but lies down meekly when approached by a virgin. The virginsymbolizes the purified matter at this stage, which has returned to a state ofinnocence and potential. The five blooms on the rose bush symbolize theQuintessence, or life force, that has been elevated and purged of contaminatingforces.Above the roundel is the word Occultum, meaning “secret or hidden,” since theessences at this stage are carried invisibly by vapors. This is the level ofhidden spiritual manifestation in the Azoth. Often unnoticed by others, thesublimation of psychic forces within us creates a new spiritual level of being.Step 10—The Ray of the SunThe seventh ray displays the cipher that stands for both gold and the Sun, andthe corresponding roundel shows an androgynous youth emerging from an opengrave. It is marked with the Latin word Lapidem, meaning “the Stone.”This is the conclusion of the Red Phase and the final operation of the Azoth.Known as coagulation, it begins in the concentrated solution resulting fromdistillation. Often referred to as the “Mother of the Stone,” this solutionproduces an extremely pure precipitate or solid body (the White Stone). This newbody, which represents the resurrected essence or Soul, is then infused withSpirit, or energy from above.Coagulation is seen as a sacrificial act. In other words, Soul surrenders toSpirit and is assimilated into it. The sacrifice is often depicted as a pelicanfeeding its young with its own blood. It is also shown by brief appearances ofthe White Lion (Soul) in sequences with the Red Lion (Spirit). We see it againin drawings showing the White Queen in marriage ceremonies giving up her name oridentity to the Red King.The purified essences of Soul and Spirit coagulate into a perfected body knownas the Philosopher’s Stone. Existing simultaneously on all levels of reality, itrepresents the ultimate perfection of matter and is said to be the same for allsubstances. The Philosopher’s Stone is sometimes depicted as a shining redcrystal or symbolized by the immortal Phoenix bird rising in fire from its ownashes.Step 11—The Ascended EssenceIf we take an overview of the entire drawing, we notice a mysterious wingedcaricature that resembles a winged disk or Egyptian Aureus. Located where thehead of the alchemist should be, its wings are touched on the left by the fireof the salamander and on the right by the Bird of Spirit. These symbols point tothe Hermetic concept of the Augoeides, or Ascended Essence. We see it here,poised to rise up out of this drawing into the new realm of being.Step 12—The Hidden KeyThere is one last message hidden in the Azoth drawing. All the Latin wordscontained in the outer ring compose a summary of what has taken place: VisitaInteriora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem. It says, “Visit theinnermost parts of the earth; and by setting things right (rectifying), you willfind the hidden Stone.”Furthermore, the first letters of these seven Latin words spell out the wordVITRIOL. Vitriol is sulfuric acid, the highly corrosive liquid fire that drivesthe whole wheel of transformation. It is both the fundamental acid behindchemical change in the alchemist’s laboratory and the inner or Secret Fire thatbrings about the spiritual transformation of the alchemist.Golden Dawn AlchemyThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a magical order devoted to the studyand practice of theurgy. Rooted in the Rosicrucian movement, the Golden Dawn wasfounded in 1888 by three Scottish Rite Freemasons: William Westcott, WilliamWoodman, and Samuel Mathers. Golden Dawn teachings are at the heart of manycontemporary movements, including Thelemic groups like Aleister Crowley’sA[image/436.jpg]A[image/437.jpg], Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Aurum Solis,and the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, as well as independent magical orders suchas Wicca, the Brotherhood of Light, Builders of the Adytum, and FraternitasSaturni.Alchemy was an advanced practice of the Golden Dawn that was viewed as a way oflinking the powers of the divine above and the physical below. William Westcottwrote a “flying roll” on alchemy called The Science of Alchymy: Spiritual andMaterial. The group also had a practicing alchemist on staff by the name ofWilliam Alexander Ayton (1816–1909). An Anglican vicar, Ayton had awell-equipped laboratory where he produced magical elixirs and stones. He spentmost of his time studying alchemy but lived in constant fear that his bishopwould find out what he was doing. Ayton’s translation of The Life of John Dee byThomas Smith was essential reading for members.A large library of other alchemical texts, which included all the classicalworks, was available to higher grade members. Alchemy was introduced at thesecond level and continued into advanced instruction at the third level. Bothpractical and spiritual alchemical operations and rituals were taught. In fact,member Israel Regardie (1907–1985) once noted that a secret alchemical processwas at work behind all Golden Dawn rituals.Conclusion: The Black ArtThe practices and techniques of Hermetic alchemy we have discussed all share acommon source of their power. As we noted at the beginning, the Black Artpracticed by Egyptian priests originated from the land of Khem—from themiraculously fertile black dirt of the Nile Delta. That kind of inexplicable,chaotic, and infinitely powerful darkness is the source of all true magic. Itcan be found in the dark matter/energy at the ends of the universe and in thedarkest recesses of the human mind. It is a source of unlimited power.The alchemists called that secret blackness the First Matter, and they believedit was the ineffable source of both consciousness and physical reality. Thehidden connection between mind and matter is what makes the Great Work ofalchemy and theurgy possible. The roots of both alchemy and magic are planted inthe same black soil of the First Matter.Sources (Bibliography)Ayton, W. A. The Alchemist of the Golden Dawn: The Letters of the Revd W. A.Ayton to F.

Dee, TheHieroglyphic Monad, 1975."},{"pageContent":"Book FiveDemonology & Spirit Evocationby Dr. Stephen SkinnerDemonology could be defined as the study of demons and their names, hierarchy,and abilities. As such, it is an integral part of the practice of magic.Whenever I am asked if I believe in demons or spirits, I usually reply no,because my knowledge of these entities does not spring from my belief in thembut from my observation, evocation, and interaction with them over an extendedperiod of time, in my case, more than fifty years.Belief is secondhand knowledge, repeated from what you have heard or been told.Knowledge is the result of experience, of testing and repeating the sameprocedures, and getting the same results. Belief requires only faith, butknowledge requires method, observation, and repeated experiment—in short, theapplication of the scientific method. The usual dichotomy between religion andscience would be much better expressed as the difference between belief andknowledge. When it comes to spirits, demons, and demonology, knowledge is a muchfirmer footing than belief.The popular view of demons and demonology has changed a lot over the last threecenturies. In the seventeenth century in the Western world, the belief in theexistence of spirits and demons was as strong as (if not stronger than) it hadbeen in the ancient world. But with the coming of the Enlightenment and thewaning of strongly held Christian beliefs (especially Catholicism), a morematerialistic view of the world took over. With the founding of the RoyalSociety in London in 1660, the emphasis fell on what was measurable andtestable, rather than on Church dogma. Even though Isaac Newton was asinterested in magic and alchemy as he was in mathematics and physics, thepopular view ignored that and ceased to believe in spirits and demons.1[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-379]Running parallel to that in the eighteenth century was a strong undercurrent ofpractitioners who still used grimoires to call spirits. In fact, some of themost prominent people in England—such as Lord Somers, Solicitor General forEngland and Wales, and Sir Joseph Jekyll, the Master of the Rolls (the supremelegal functionary in England) and the Lord High Admiral—continued to collectgrimoires, practice magic, and call both angels and demons.In the nineteenth century, materialism probably reached its peak when man hadspanned long distances with rail networks, built canals, and invented all sortsof machines. Strangely, at the end of the nineteenth century, in 1888, theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was founded to teach magic, and members stillunderstood what demons and spirits were. But in the early twentieth century, thenew “science” of psychology began to beguile even the advocates of magic such asAleister Crowley and Dion Fortune. Crowley even went as far as to say that“Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of courseempirical, physiological experiments,” and that “the spirits of the Goetia areportions of the human brain.” 2[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-378] Dion Fortune was not farbehind in her psychologising of magic. Spirits and demons had been discarded asthe active agents of magic and magicians, and “New Thought” and psychologyreigned supreme.The latter half of the twentieth century saw a lot of self-help gurus promisingmagical results from positive thinking, visualisation, and affirmations, theseedbed of the New Age movement.These are all useful psychological techniques that can certainly help in one’sday-to-day life, but they are not magic in the sense that would have beenunderstood by John Dee, Eleazar, or King Solomon, or indeed by any of thehundreds of practitioners of magic since their time. Magic depends on the helpof disembodied spirits or demons, without which no amount of visualisation orstraining of the brain can effect the changes that spirits or demons canproduce.Increasingly, people looked to psychology to explain magic, or simply discardedit as an outmoded form of thinking. For a while the theories of anthropologistsheld sway as science looked to “primitive” societies to explain magic. However,with the hippie revolution of the 1960s, materialistic explanations began tofall away. During the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, thepublication of many grimoires (magician’s handbooks) brought back the so-called“spirit model” of magic, confirming that magicians dealt with spirits not withpsychological complexes. With this greater availability of information, theworld at large has begun again to understand what magic really is. The New Agevisualising and manifesting model, and the psychological model that says it’s“all in the head,” began to fade away. With the old verities coming back intofocus, people are realising that magic cannot be done by just straining your ownmental faculties, but needs the assistance of gods, angels, daemons, or spirits,or “spiritual creatures,” as Dr. John Dee used to refer to them. Onlycooperation with such spiritual creatures can produce results that can truly bedescribed as magic or miracles.The GoetiaThe Goetia is the first part of the grimoire the Lemegeton. It is effectively aregister of seventy-two spirits or demons, with their seals and qualities plus amethod of evoking them. It dates back to the mid-seventeenth century or maybe abit earlier. The title of this book was chosen with reference to the chapter “OfGoetia and Necromancy” in H. C. Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy, andsimply meant that form of magic dealing with demons. However, Agrippa’s view ofgoetia does not really map onto the ancient Greek meaning of goetia, or theconcept of the goes, despite modern attempts to link the two. Goetia is oftenmistakenly explained as a derivation of the Greek for “howling.” In thetwentieth century, the Goetia was edited by S. L. MacGregor Mathers frommanuscripts in what was then the British Museum but is now the British Library,and was later published without permission by Aleister Crowley in 1904.DemonsIt is well known that the word demon comes from the Greek daemon, but it is notso well known what other changes took place with the meaning of the word overtime. Before the ascendancy of Christianity, around 400 CE, there was no doubtthat a daemon occupied the middle ground between men (and women) and the gods.There were good daemons and evil daemons (caco-daemones), and they sometimesperformed the function of spiritual intermediaries, carrying messages betweengods and man, and vice versa.The ancient hierarchy of “spiritual creatures,” 3[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-377] of spirits, angels,archangels, daemons, demigods, and gods, was extensive. But with the coming ofChristianity, these were all (except for angels) swept into the dustpan ofhistory and demoted to being demons and banished beneath the earth. There was nolonger any room in the heavens or on Earth for them. According to Christiandoctrine, their function as mediators between man and god was assumed by JesusChrist, the Virgin Mary, and the Holy Ghost. Christianity also added in thedoctrine of the “fallen angels,” and these demoted angels also became demons.Demonology then became the study of these demons, just as angelology was thestudy of the remaining angels who did not “fall.”EgyptIn Egypt in the first centuries of the Christian era, Graeco-Egyptian magicianscalled upon the aid of all of these “spiritual creatures,” because it waslogically thought by them that man alone cannot produce magical results or“miracles,” no matter how hard he wishes, meditates, or prays, as magic is notdone by either meditation or prayer. But with the help of one or another ofthese entities, various types of miraculous outcomes could be arrived at. Toevoke and coerce one of these spiritual creatures to carry out the magician’swill, however, it was necessary to do certain very specific things. In broadoutline, these were:a. To provide a conducive atmosphere, by using the correct incense;b. To perform the ritual on the correct day and in the correct hour;c. To perform the ritual in a clean and pure place, away from “the haunts ofmen,” where there was little chance of disturbance or interruption;d. To use the correct conjurations, which had to be pronounced clearly andcorrectly, preferably from memory;e. To establish the magician’s credibility by him claiming to be a god, or apart of a magical lineage, or reciting the names of other magicians;f. Pronouncing the words of power, which would typically be the names of thespirit’s superiors, or a god, to compel the spirit to action (most words ofpower were in fact names);g. To bind the spirit with an oath before requesting or demanding the desiredboon;h. To provide protection for the magician in the form of a protective floorcircle and/or a consecrated lamen to wear on his chest. For the Graeco-Egyptianmagicians, even the gods and demigods were dangerous and had to be handledcarefully.Belief was not required, and magic was seen as a technique. These techniques arerecorded in detail in many pages of the Papyri Graecae Magicae (the GreekMagical Papyri), of which more than 13,600 lines have survived.4[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-376]The amazing thing about these techniques is that they are almost exactly thesame procedure as was found a thousand years later in Mediaeval grimoires, or innineteenth-century Solomonic magic texts. Of course, the language and some ofthe names have changed, but the method has remained the same. If magic was justsome kind of made-up nonsense, as many twenty-first-century sceptics mightbelieve, then the method would have been reinvented with each generation … butit hasn’t.At about the same time, just north of Egypt in Palestine, Jesus Christ wasregarded as a wonder-worker, if not actually a magician.5[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-375] No particular censure wasattached to this view of Jesus by his contemporaries, as he was obviously awonder-worker, and therefore this was expected of him, even he was not immunefrom the suspicion that he might have used a spirit or demon to help him performhis miracles. In fact, for the early Christians, explaining the differencebetween his miracles and the magic performed by other contemporary magicianssuch as Eleazar was a real problem. At that time, and subsequently, daemons orspirits were considered a necessary part of magic without which it simply wouldnot work.In the Bible, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of driving out demons by the power of avery specific spirit: Beelzebub, a prince of demons.6[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-374] In Matthew 12:24–25, 27,Jesus speaks of using this demon’s name for that purpose, and asks thePharisees, in a very matter-of-fact way, which name they use:But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This fellow doth not cast outdevils, but [except] by Beelzebub the prince of devils.”And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them …“And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom [in what name] do your childrencast them out?”Of course, the heavy irony would not have been lost on the Pharisees. The keything is that the technique of using a senior demon’s name to control lesserones was accepted as commonplace by both Jesus and the Pharisees. It does notmatter who used the name of Beelzebub. The important point is that it was seenas an acceptable procedure, used by magicians, rabbis, and holy men. Thisprocedure has definitely always been a part of Solomonic magic as it has beenpracticed over the last two millennia.It was only with the advent of Christianity that magic began to be seen assomething derived from the Devil rather than an art used to control demons forthe benefit of the magician.DemonologyDemonology may be defined as “the study of demons or beliefs about demons, theirhierarchy and qualities, especially the methods used to summon and controlthem.” The original Greek word daimon indicated an intermediary between man andthe gods, carrying prayers from man to the gods, and their responses and help inthe opposite direction, with no particular implication of evil. The sense of“demon,” from the time of Homer onward, was a benevolent being, but with thecoming of Christianity, all such pagan entities were “demonized,” and so demonsbegan to be looked upon as inherently evil. In English, the name now holdsconnotations of malevolence.The problem is that the objects of its study (demons) cannot be seen and felt bythe ordinary man. In fact, the problem is exactly the same as that faced byEdward Jenner in 1796 when he discovered how to protect against smallpox byinoculation with cowpox. How was he going to explain that taking the pus from acow and inserting it into a cut made in a child’s arm would protect them forlife from the horrors of smallpox? Without an electron microscope he could noteven show them a smallpox virus. His patients, who formed a long queue aroundhis garden, had to take it on faith.The situation is the same for demonology. Demons cannot be shown to the averageman, and even the effects of their behaviour cannot be shown without sometimesattracting scorn and derision. At least Jenner had a “new” field, and hisexplanation of viruses and their behaviour was not clouded by more than 1,700years of obfuscation and deliberate distortion. Up until 400 CE, most citizensof the Roman Empire would have known what a daemon was, and been wary of it. Butwith the coming of institutional Christianity, supported by the full force ofRome, all of the detailed knowledge of magic and the behaviour of daemons wasswept into a dusty corner and given just one label: demon.So there are many difficulties in the way of a complete description ofdemonology in a materialistic world where the existence of the subject underdiscussion is not even recognised. Demons cannot be shown in the normal courseof things, but their presence can be detected by their effects, just as virusescannot be shown under an optical microscope (as they are too small), yet theirexistence is accepted by everyone in the modern world. Viruses are taken as amatter of faith, as are radio waves, which cannot be seen except for thepatterns they produce on an oscilloscope. In the ancient world, daemons werethought of in the same way.Spirit EvocationDemons can, however, be observed under very limited circumstances that requireas much preparation as the most stringently prepared scientific experiment. Thisprocess is spirit evocation. Evocation is quite different from invocation.Evocation deals with spirits and demons, but invocation deals with the gods.Both processes come from the pre-Christian pagan world. Exorcism is nowadaysused by Christian priests to drive demons out of possessed humans, but in pasttimes it was used by magicians.7[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-373] The modern trend is topaint possession as some kind of extreme mental disorder, but this is clearlynot the case, as several examples of the reality of spirit possession will show.One clear example of exorcism from the ancient world was the driving out ofdemons by Jesus Christ from the possessed man he met in Gadara, on the banks ofthe Sea of Galilee. This unfortunate man had been bound in chains but had brokenthem by applying “superhuman” strength, the first hint of the objectivity of thedemons possessing him. When Jesus drove out the demons, he knew that they had togo somewhere and would not just evaporate into thin air (as they might if theywere just a symptom of mental disease). Jesus selected a herd of swine grazingon an adjoining hill in which to implant them. The enraged swine ran down theslope and drowned themselves in the adjoining sea.8[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-372] This, in anyone’s language,is proof of both the effectiveness of the exorcism and the reality of thedemons. Otherwise, what might be the logical explanation for the simultaneousinsane self-destructive actions of a nearby herd of pigs?A more calculated description of exorcism by the magician Eleazar appears in theworks of Josephus, and it took place in front of a large number of witnesses,including an emperor. Eleazar, having been asked to exorcise a possessed man,proceeded with the exorcism and the application of his consecrated ring to theman’s nose. At the same time, he commanded the demon to prove it had exited byoverturning a cup of water set at some distance from the exorcism. In duecourse, as the unfortunate victim collapsed, the water in the cup was spilledand the person recovered. Now it is easy to explain this might have happened bytrickery, but what I am trying to show here is the physicality of phenomenaproduced by the fleeing demons. Josephus’s account was written within livingmemory of the event.So much for driving out demons. But what about calling up demons or spirits thatare not lodged in an unfortunate human? This is done by the process ofevocation.The earliest accounts of evocation centre around King Solomon and are containedin the Tanakh (the Old Testament). Solomon is reputed to have called up demons(or jinn, if you prefer) to help him with the tasks of building his famousTemple around 950 BCE. Many stories of these events have become the stuff oflegends, recorded both in the Jewish and Christian worlds and later in theIslamic world, for Solomon’s actions were part of the background of all threemonotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. A more detailed andtechnical description of Solomon’s interaction with demons and their building ofthe Temple appear in the second-century-CE book The Testament of Solomon, whichalso gives more information on the method used. Whatever the truth of theseaccounts, the style of ritual magic that involves calling up demons or spirits(using very specific techniques) has come to be called Solomonic magic.Evocation from Constantinople to EnglandThese methods were adopted by Greek-speaking magicians living in Egypt, andtraveled with them to the then centre of the Greek-speaking world,Constantinople, in the fifth and sixth centuries, where they were refined. TheHygromanteia is one of the few surviving Greek texts of Solomonic magic fromthat time. When Constantinople was sacked in 1453 by Muslim invaders, themanuscripts containing these methods traveled with fleeing monks to Italy, wherethey were translated into Latin as the Key of Solomon. The Key was thentranslated into other European languages, including English, in the fifteenthand sixteenth centuries.During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a lot of experimentation inevocation took place in England. One of the best-known examples of this was theexperimentation with invoking angels and spirits into a crystal done by Dr. JohnDee in the late sixteenth century. Dee was well aware that his basic methods andequipment were drawn from the grimoires that he owned. (It is well known thathis main Sigillum Dei Aemeth comes from the grimoire Liber Juratus, and hisTable of Practice from the Summa Sacre Magice, and he undoubtedly knew this.) Hewas cautious and so did not refer to them as magic in a time when this mighthave led to his death. Magic was practiced by the upper levels of society, frommanuals of magic called grimoires, by those who could read Latin and Greek, suchas Dee, and who also had the space and time to carry out full ceremonial ritual.But it was also practiced in a rather abbreviated form by village cunning-men,who also provided medical and sometimes midwife services. These cunning-men,such as Old Cornelius or Moses Long in Oxford, also used grimoires, divination,astrology, and herbal medicine from Thomas Culpeper’s Complete Herbal ratherthan full-scale ritual evocation.9[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-371]Although there were many magicians and demonologists before him, Reginald Scot,who published The Discovery of Witchcraft in 1584 and took a very rationalapproach to magic and witchcraft, has come to be called “England’s firstDemonologist.” 10 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-370] Scotattempted to explain that many of the accusations brought against witches werejust motivated by village spite directed against quarrelsome old women, but hedid not condemn the more learned practitioners of evocation. History, however—orhis printers—played a nasty trick on Scot, for when his book was reprinted longafter his death in 1665, new sections were added that included practicalgrimoire and cunning-man material that directly contradicted his contentions.Instead of showing the supposed fatuousness of magic, it supplied a usablecompendium of its methods.That, in a nutshell, is how the Solomonic method of spirit/demon evocationreached England from its inception in Egypt two thousand years ago.Soon after, the Bible was translated into English in 1611, at the command ofKing James I. Across both the Greek (New Testament) and the Latin (OldTestament), 11 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-369] there are noless than thirty-four different terms describing daemons, spirits, wood nymphs,and other “spiritual creatures.” The translators of the King James version ofthe Bible reduced all of these to just one prejudicial term: demon.Demons were assumed to reside in Hell, a convenient repository of all thingsevil, which barely existed before the coming of Christianity, unless youconsider the Greek Hades or the Jewish Gehenna as its theological ancestor.Just as Hell developed a hierarchical structure,12[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-368] so did both demonology andangelology. In the case of angelology, the heavy lifting was done in the fifthto sixth centuries by pseudo-Dionysus the Areopagite. He started with the Jewishangel categories of Seraphim and Cherubim, but, running out of names, he pickedall sorts of words out of the New Testament such as Thrones Principalities, andPowers and made them into the names of different categories of angels.Demonologists took longer to arrange their hierarchy, but during and after theMiddle Ages a structure was devised that paralleled human affairs, and this isthe structure found in most grimoires.GrimoiresGrimoires, or “grammars,” of sorcery were the working manuals of magicians. Inalmost all cases these grimoires were for the personal use of the magician andnot for publication. They were not designed, as a modern book might be, toexplain or justify a particular practice, but were for the use of the magicianwho wrote them. Of course, one disadvantage of these manuscripts (as theyusually are) is that the writer had no need to explain everything for thebeginner, but simply wrote the important things he needed to remember or that heneeded to pass on to his apprentice. Magic has seldom been taught in aclassroom, but has always been part of a chain of master-apprenticetransmission.Magic, and specifically Solomonic magic, is a complex process and involves avery precise technology. How can it be referred to as a “‘technology”? It is atechnology because it uses clearly defined methods and equipment—methods thatproduce repeatable results.13[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-367]Strange as it may seem, purity is always an important part of Solomonic magic,and this first requirement is often overlooked by beginners who wish to rushinto the more dramatic part. But magic requires a precise accumulation ofequipment that is pure, preferably new, and free of the contamination of otherinfluences or a previous owner. The grimoires always stress this, but it isoften the first thing to be overlooked by the novice.Solomonic magic is not the easy route to anything, but once mastered, itprovides repeatable operations. The objective of science is to documentobservations and then draw conclusions from them that will enable repeatableexperiments to be made. In this sense magic is quite scientific. AleisterCrowley’s slogan “The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion” is a reflection ofthis, as the Aim of Religion is to deal with spiritual creatures such as god(s)and angels, while the Method of Science is the derivation of rules that can beused to repeat the experiment successfully.The CircleThe protective circle dates back at least 2,500 years. Classical Indian textssuch as the Ramayana (dating from the fourth to the fifth century BCE) recordLakshman drawing such a circle on the ground to protect Sita, his wife, from ademon. Unfortunately, Sita stepped over this boundary and was captured by thedemon Ravana, an indication of the fate of any magician who similarly steppedover the boundary of the magic circle.Assyrian texts tell of protective circles called u[image/438.png]urtu, drawnwith a mixture of flour and water and then consecrated. Hebrew examples includeHoni the Circle Drawer, who used such a circle to invoke rain. In Egypt, theboundary often took the form of the ouroboros, a circle designed as a snakeswallowing its own tail. This could be drawn with chalk (as were Mediaevalmagicians’ circles) or even made of real snakeskin. On one papyrus we even havethe exact words and symbols that need to be inscribed.* These are just some ofthe examples of the use of the magic circle in ancient times.At least one modern edition of the Goetia replicated the ouroboros theme (seeFigure 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112]). Moresophisticated versions of this form of protection, like a magnetised iron chain,were used in the Middle Ages.There are many tales of the fate that befell the unwary who stepped out of thecircle, such as a priest who was attacked so ferociously by the demons he hadcalled that he later died of his wounds.**The shape of the circle has an effect on the spirit, who will circle around afew times but not find an easy entrance. The effect is the same as if we wereconfronted by a razor-sharp wall in a completely alien environment. We mightwell refrain from trying to walk through it.* Papyri Graecae Magicae (PGM) III. 291–306.** Recorded by Caesarius of Heisterbach.The practical manuals of magicians from the Middle Ages until the present arecalled grimoires, and these detail the times, tools, and talismans needed forsuch experiments. They are not history, theory, or theology, but a recording ofthe methods used. Every grimoire stresses the dangers of evocation. Solomonicgrimoires explain that the magician needs to be surrounded by a properlyconsecrated circle and protected by a lamen worn on the breast.Protection from spirits, demons, and even gods was necessary. Despite New Agepractitioners visualising angels and gods as uniformly good and even treatingthem like helpers or pets, the ancients knew better and were never socomplacent. There are a number of instances recorded in the Bible of the Ark ofthe Covenant (belonging to the Jewish god Yahweh) striking down dead even itsown worshipers. This theme was even expanded upon in its later appearances inIndiana Jones films.Method and Equipment for Dealing with DemonsProtection in Solomonic magic is quite detailed and specific but always containsthree main ingredients: a protective floor circle to mark the limits beyondwhich the spirit/demon may not step, several pieces of magical equipment such asa sword, sceptre, or wand, and personal protection for the magician in the formof a properly constructed phylactery (this is not simply a talisman or commonamulet).The primary protection is the circle drawn on the ground before any operation ofevocation. The rationale is that the practitioner needs to be protected from thespirit or demon by a line they cannot cross. The Heptameron, one of the mostwidely respected grimoires, says of these circles that “they are certainfortresses to defend the operators safe from the evil Spirits.” 14[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-366] There have always beenstories of spirits harming magicians who evoked them without taking thisprecaution. Even in the twenty-first century, I often hear accounts of peoplewho have not bothered to draw and consecrate the circle but attempted aninvocation sitting in an armchair in their front room. Fortunately, carelessamateurs are usually protected from their folly by their inability to carry outthe complex and demanding procedures of evocation. If they do the methodcorrectly, they will get results, and they will need protection.Circles vary, from the simplest, containing one or two godnames, to complexcircles containing all ten godnames, archangelic names, and angel names of theKabbalistic Tree of Life (Figure 1[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111] and Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112]).[image/Book5_Fig1.png]Figure 1. A Very Simple Protective Circle:The circle’s corners are marked with AGLA,an acronym of [image/439.jpg], Atah Gibor le-Olam Adonai,meaning “You, O Lord, are mighty forever.”This phrase forms part of a daily Jewish prayer.Between the circles is the Hebrew word for Lord, Adonai. 15[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-365][image/Book5_Fig2.png]Figure 2. A Complex Circle:Containing ten godnames, archangel names, and angel names. 16[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-364]The boundary is always circular (or more correctly annular) but is sometimes setwithin a square. Between the circles are usually written protective names,ranging from godnames, through archangels and angels, to the names of demonprinces or even the secret names of the seasons or of the sun, moon, and earth(Figure 3 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor113]). Those names(according to the Heptameron and those grimoires that follow its pattern) changeevery season.[image/Book5_Fig3.png]Figure 3. A Heptameron-Style Circle:Showing varying god and angel names as well as seasonal names. 17[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-363]There are many more complicated versions of the circle.18[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-362] One of the commoningredients in constructing such a circle is that after painting or drawing thecircle, the operator must go over it with a sharp, consecrated sword or knife.Spirits appear to be quite afraid of sharp iron instruments, and thecircle-drawer uses that knowledge to make an effective barrier.Greek magicians using the Hygromanteia were instructed to leave the dagger orblack-handled knife on the floor at the circle entrance with its tip pointingoutward. The magician was enjoined by the grimoire not to step out or even leanover the circle perimeter.If the circle was outdoors, then it would be cut in the turf using the sameknife. An example of this kind of woodland circle appears in the evocation ofthe spirit Oberion (Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114]).19[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-361] Note that in this circle,the names are still Hebrew godnames, plus some Greek Christian names like[image/440.jpg].[image/Book5_CircleRaisingOberion.jpg]Figure 4. Circle for Evoking the Spirit Oberion, Set Outside in the Woods 20[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-360]Triangle of ArtAs already described, the basic protection for the magician included a floorcircle painted or inscribed with chalk that protects the magician from anyattacking spirit. The magician aims to constrain the spirit, on the other hand,within a triangle outside of the circle. Drawn at floor level and called theTriangle of Art, its history is less clear, but it has been certainly used formore than three centuries. It is a locus for the spirit’s manifestation, not somuch as a portal but more as a temporary constraint that is also designed toforce the spirit to tell the truth in response to the magician’s questions.Theoretically the circle is used because it was considered a perfect geometricshape, but in practice it confuses the spirit, which will continue to circlearound looking for an entrance until it is confined to the Triangle of Art.There are other forms of protection that complement the circle, such as thewearing of a phylactery, the splashing of holy water, and so on, but there is nospace to consider these here.Key of SolomonAlthough there are many manuscript grimoires numbering in the many hundredsspread round the libraries and private collections of the world, only a dozen orso have been published. Of these perhaps the best known is the Key of Solomon,or Clavicula Salomonis. There are approximately 150 known manuscripts of thiswork, but only two volumes have ever been published.21[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-359]The Key outlines the preparation needed before an evocation and gives theinvocations needed to call the spirits and the design of the circle to be used.It also contains a large number of planetary talismans, which, if consecrated atthe right time with the right incense and right invocations, can be used for awide range of purposes, including the acquisition of honour and riches, successin gambling and love, and so on. The Key of Solomon, despite its attribution toSolomon, actually comes from a Greek source called the Hygromanteia, or MagicalTreatise of Solomon.22 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-358]A necessary part of any manual of demonic evocation is a Register of Spirits,which gives a list of the names and describes what each spirit is able to do.Each spirit is limited to a particular sphere of action, which is called its“Office,” and cannot deal with anything outside that limit. So, for example, aspirit that will aid the magician in matters of the heart will be unable tobring money to the magician. Spirits are specialists, and so before calling aspirit, you have to ensure that the thing you want, the boon you want granted,falls into their area of expertise; otherwise any effort expended in calling itwill be wasted. For this you need a Register of Spirits containing the names ofspirits and their Offices. But this is not present in the Key of Solomon.Office of SpiritsThe first such Register of Spirits extant in a European language is to be foundin the Greek Hygromanteia. In Latin one of the first was recorded in 1508 by theAbbott Trithemius. He called the text De Officio Spirituum (On the Office of theSpirits). There is no record of its current whereabouts, but there was agrimoire called A Book of the Offices of Spirits by John Porter (a contemporarywith Dr. John Dee) dated 1583, which is probably an English translation of thattext.23 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-357] The word Officeshere means the function of the spirit, the range of things the spirit is capableof doing, or allowed to do. In the Offices of Spirits the hierarchical structureis clear. This book gives the title and function of each of 4 + 3 +75 + (4 × 12)= 130 spirits. These numbers show the structure and hierarchical nature of thisgrimoire. It actually begins with its very first sentence by outlining the four“Kings of the Air” (or sublunary spirits):Urience/Uriens/Uraeus, King of the East.24[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-356]Paymon, King of the West.Amaymon, King of the South.Egine/Egyn, King of the North.These four are also called the four Demon Kings, and they are very important inthe practice of magic. The Office of Spirits continues, by saying that abovethem are three supreme demons, “Lucipher [sic], Beelzebub and Satan.” The originof these names is fascinating, but suffice it to say that Lucifer was Greek for“the light bringer”; Beelzebub, [image/441.jpg] ,or in Greek, [image/442.jpg],“Lord of the Flying Ones,” was a Philistine/Palestinian god; 25[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-355] and Satan was simply theOpposer, or “Counsel for the Prosecution,” in the biblical book of Job.There are a number of other lists of the Princes of Hell. One such demonclassification was based on a Christian list of the seven deadly sins—Lucifer:pride; Mammon: greed; Asmodeus: lust; Leviathan: envy; Beelzebub: gluttony;Satan: wrath; and Belphegor: sloth 26[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-354]—but this list is ratherarbitrary. Another is the more standard Jewish list of Princes of the Qliphoth:Satan and Moloch, Beelzebub, Lucifuge (“flee from the light”), Ashtaroth,Asmodeus, Belphegor, Baal, Adrammelech, Lilith, and Nahemah.27[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-353]However, here we are more concerned with the ways that magicians perceived thehierarchy, rather than either Christian theologians or Jewish rabbis. After the3 Supreme Rulers and 4 Demon Princes of the four quarters come a further 75demons of various ranks. This is very numerically close to the 72 demons of theGoetia.28 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-352] They are dividedinto ranks that reflected Mediaeval society. Their divisional distribution is abit difficult to count, as many are given two ranks. For example, Darbas (number15) is both a Prince and a King. However, if you take the highest rank each time(as in human terms Princes often became Kings), you get the followingdistribution—King: 11; Prince: 14; Duke: 11; Earl: 7; Marquise: 5; Viscount: 2;Lord and Governor: 6; Ruler: 6; Prelate: 1; Sundry: 29[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-351] 12—making a total of 75.30[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-350]Why was a hierarchy so important? It is because the magician needs to know atwhat level to ask for a boon, and what name of a more senior demon or god mustbe used in order to compel the lesser demon. For example, it was quite common tothreaten a recalcitrant lesser spirit with the wrath of its King, despite thatfact that the magician might not have been able to actually honour this threat.The same sort of structure appears in the Goetia where the relevant figures are:Kings: 12; 31 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-349] Dukes: 23;Presidents: 12; Marquises: 12; Earls, Counts, Princes and Prelates: 12; Knights:1, making a Total of 72.32 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-348]However in the Goetia the three supreme demons are omitted, and in otherseventeenth-century grimoires they are sometimes just reduced to their initials,L:B:S, perhaps through fear of ecclesiastical persecution of anyone found inpossession of a text featuring names as inflammatory as Lucifer, Beelzebub, andSatan.The most extensive Register of Spirits extant is the Lemegeton, also known asClavicula Salomonis Regis or the Lesser Key of Solomon. After the Key ofSolomon, it is the next most well-known grimoire.A Regal SpiritAttested in a number of manuscripts, the spirit Birto was allegedly conjured upin front of King Edward IV of England and his wife, Elizabeth Woodville.* Themethod is unique and consists of two circles of the same size, one for thespirit (marked “Birto”) and one for the magician (marked “Magister”). However,in between these two circles there must be a drawing or a model of a wyvern (atwo-legged dragon with a very sharp tail). It is thought that the wyvern isreminiscent of Melusine, the ancestress of Elizabeth Woodville. In addition, themagician carries a sceptre proclaiming the name of the Demon King (in this case,Egyn, King of the North). Taken together, the sceptre and the wyvern give themagician the credibility he needs to call up Birto. This is probably the onlyspirit that needs the magician to create a viable wyvern in order to succeedwith his evocation.* Skinner and Clark, The Clavis or Key to the Mysteries of Magic, 398–399.The LemegetonThe Lemegeton was the title given to a collection of five grimoires, four ofwhich were designed as a Register of Spirits. These five constituent grimoiresare:I. Goetia, or Liber Malorum Spirituum seu Goetia, which deals with 72 evilspiritsII. Theurgia-Goetia, which deals with spirits of mixed natureIII. Ars Paulina (parts I and II), which deals with good spiritsIV. Ars Almadel, which deals with angelsV. The Notory Art (or Ars Notoria), which also utilises angelsAll five books were extant and well known to Trithemius in 1508, but some underdifferent names. Four of these were mentioned separately by Agrippa in 1531 atthe end of book 3 of his Three Books of Occult Philosophy 33[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-347] in the chapters “Of Goetiaand Necromancy” and “Of Theurgia.” In those chapters Agrippa speaksdisapprovingly of the Goetia in order not to attract the attention of the Churchor the Inquisition. This was a technique initially adopted by Trithemius, whoheavily criticised every grimoire he ever mentioned but with his tongue firmlyin his cheek. Further on, Agrippa lists “Apponius” (Peter de Abano) as theauthor of a book “on the Goetia,” without specifically noting that de Abano’sHeptameron was the actual source of the conjurations in the Goetia.In the chapter “Of Theurgia,” Agrippa quotes “the Ars Almadel, the Notory Art,the Ars Paulina, the Art of Revelations, and many suchlike.” The first three areall constituent books of the Lemegeton. Hence, Agrippa mentions three of thefive books of the Lemegeton by name and two by subject matter.Taken together, these five books are surprisingly complementary andinterrelated, each having a good claim to belong to the Solomonic cycle (exceptthe last one) and each having contents that date back at least to 1500. Toolsmentioned in one are often used in another.There are two main published versions of the Lemegeton, one edited by JosephPeterson 34 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-346] and one bymyself and David Rankine.35 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-345]The latter is taken from a manuscript copy of the papers of Dr. Thomas Rudd. 36[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-344]Although Peterson’s edition is the standard version of the Lemegeton, theedition produced by Rudd incorporates extra material, such as complementarythwarting angel sigils, circles from the Heptameron, and also a rather uniquemethod of controlling the spirits using a model of the metal container thatSolomon reputedly imprisoned the spirits in. Let us look at each of these booksof the Lemegeton in turn.The Lemegeton copied by Rudd can probably be dated to 1641, as one of theexamples given in the Ars Paulina (book 2) is dated March 10, 1641.Part I. Goetia, or Liber Malorum Spirituum seu Goetia 37[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-343]As we have seen, the Goetia contains a list of 72 demons, with descriptions oftheir appearance and their Office, as well as the number of legions theycommanded, and sometimes what King they reported to. The latter is incomplete,and it can be seen that although originally the names were grouped by theirKing, this has been somewhat lost during multiple redactions. Each of the demonshas its sigil, and in the Rudd edition, each demon also has the name and seal ofthe angel who controls and thwarts it.The Goetia has become rather infamous of late, having the sigils of its 72spirits spread around the internet over the last few decades so that they evenappear on a range of t-shirts, which is something I am sure the original authorwould be far from happy about. In addition to its functions as a Register ofSpirits, the Goetia has a set of evocations of increasing intensity that havebeen drawn from the Heptameron of Peter de Abano.38[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-342] They culminate with aninvocation of the spirit’s King designed to force his attendance.The grimoire continues with tables of the planetary hours, and secret seasonalnames; construction of the circle and details of incense and spirit/angel namesfor each day of the week; consecration of the tools of evocation; andinstructions concerning timing and practice.Part II. Theurgia-GoetiaThe Theurgia-Goetia is concerned with spirits of a mixed nature, i.e., good andevil. Perhaps the most obvious feature of this grimoire is its insistence uponorientation. In fact, it embodies yet another rule of evocation, which is thatthe magician must know, and should face, the direction from which the spirit isdue to come. To that end, the first illustration in the text is an elaboratecompass rose, showing the direction in which all of its spirits are located. Itis not polite, nor does it reflect well on the competency of the magician, if heis showing his back to the spirit when it arrives (see Figure 5[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115]).Originally these directions were (as with a mariner’s compass) meant to be winddirections, but the confusion between “wind” and “spirit” in the Latin wordspiritum, which means both “spirit” and “breath,” made the transition in meaningeasy.The directional rules of the Goetia by comparison are simpler, but even itsuggests that you must face the Triangle of Art, which should then be placed onthe side of the circle from which the spirit is expected to arrive.Unfortunately, the Goetia is a bit vague about directions. In contrast, theTheurgia-Goetia gives very precise compass points for each spirit. For example,Rasiel should be expected from due North whereas Dorochiel will come from “Westby North,” but Usiel should come from exactly NW—a total of 32 differentdirections are delineated in detail.The title Theurgia-Goetia is a bit strange, as Graeco-Egyptian magicians went tosome lengths to separate these two types of procedures. Accordingly, I do notthink that the magician who adopted the name for this grimoire really understoodthat theurgia was a practice reserved for the gods, and he used these two wordsto simply indicate mixed good and evil spirits.This grimoire is effectively a ritual version of the first book of Trithemius’s,Steganographia, which was compiled by 1500.39[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-341] The Steganographia hasalways been a mysterious book: some critics have claimed it was a book ofcryptography, some a book of magic. On the face of it, it claims to teach how touse angels to carry secret messages between two widely separated persons (afunction that would have been most useful in a pre-email world). Dr. John Deewas very excited when he first saw it, for both these reasons. I suspect thatthe carriage of secret messages via angelic aid may have been the prime purpose,followed by the inevitable addition of cryptography to keep the messages secreteven if accidentally revealed.[image/Book5_Fig5.png]Figure 5. The Compass Rose in the Theurgia-Goetia:Showing the exact direction from which each spirit can be expected to arrive.At least one manuscript of the Steganographia, 40[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-340] which shows sixteen compasssegments corresponding with the names of the sixteen Dukes, is more completethan the printed edition, which shows just three of the sixteen Dukes. AlthoughTrithemius died in 1516, the Steganographia was not published until 1621 atDarmstadt and again in 1635, but only partially.As in the Goetia, there is a strict hierarchy in the Theurgia-Goetia that isheaded by four Emperors (Caspiel, Carnesial, Amenadiel, and Demoriel)corresponding with the four cardinal directions, while the sixteen Dukes areallocated the inter-cardinal points, plus other directions. The eleven so-calledWandering Princes fill in the remaining points of the compass.The manuscript has obviously been redacted a number of times, with somescrambling and reordering of the folios, because the folios covering the actualmethod of invocation have moved away from the beginning of the manuscript andbeen placed just after the details relating to Pamersiel. The procedure to callforth any of the spirits of the Theurgia-Goetia (not just Parmersiel) is asfollows: 41 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-339]1. Choose a place in some island, wood, or grove that is well hidden,2. or in a private room in your house set aside for such operations, preferablyan upper room (as the spirits of the Theurgia-Goetia are specifically airyspirits).3. The magician should wear the seal of the Spirit on his breast and a girdle oflion skin about his waist, as mentioned in the Goetia.4. Make a Circle in the form as shown in the previous book Goetia.5. Call the spirits into a Crystal stone four Inches in diameter, set on a Tableof Practice, “with the secret Table of Solomon” or the Seal of Solomon inscribedon it. 42 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-338]6. Declaim the conjuration a number of times in order to give the spirit time toarrive.43 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-337]7. An unspoken instruction is to face the correct direction, as indicated by thespirit compass rose (see Figure 5[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#_idTextAnchor115]), and burn the correctincense, or frankincense.Although this text suggests that this method is a sort of “spirit telegraph” tocommunicate with distant friends, it is in fact really a method of angelinvocation. The magician faces the quarter of the angel, invokes the angel, andsubmits his request (what he wants the spirit to accomplish), cryptographicallyencoded on a piece of paper. The mental effort involved in encrypting it is partof the magical procedure, a little like Austin Osman Spare encoding his requestin a sigil. There is thus no human recipient. This method is more sophisticated,as it addresses the direction to face and a particular named spirit rather thanjust “the Universe,” as with Spare. Timing is, as always, also important.44[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-336]Part III. Ars PaulinaThe Ars Paulina is divided into two parts that are sufficiently different forthem to be thought of as distinct books.Located at the beginning of the grimoire is the Table of Practice, which issimilar to all such Tables of Practice, including Dr. Dee’s Tabula Sancta. TheTable of Practice is designed to support the skrying crystal or glass receptaclefilled with water. Its design was typically a hexagram. On the Table (or etchedinto it) should be seven planetary seals, located at the vertices of thehexagram, with the Sun seal located in the centre.Ars Paulina (Part 1)The Theurgia-Goetia is focussed on direction, but the Ars Paulina is focussed ontime, and planetary rulership. Planetary hours are of prime importance inWestern magic and are mentioned in almost every grimoire. The first book of theArs Paulina is a Spirit Register, which lists spirits according to the specificplanetary hours of the night and day. These are different from the planetaryrulerships of the hours in that they are the same pattern of rulers for everyday.The Ars Paulina was reputedly delivered to the Apostle Paul at Corinth. In hisEpistles, Paul speaks about himself in the third person 45[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-335] ascending to the ThirdHeaven, where he “heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man toutter.” The Apocalypse of Paul goes on to speak about the Fourth Heaven, wherehe is said to have seen a soul being prepared for reincarnation, and then on tothe other Heavens up to the Tenth.46[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-334] These passages gave somecredibility to the attribution of the Ars Paulina to that Apostle, but beyondthat there is no significance in the title.Each of the twelve hours of the day (which run from sunrise to sunset) andtwelve hours of the night (which run from sunset to the next sunrise) has a nameand is allocated a ruling angel. The angel in turn rules a varying number ofDukes, who have in their train an army of servants. Not all are listed, but justa selection are named. A very basic seal featuring planetary and zodiacalsymbols is provided for each hour. Only one simple conjuration is provided foruse with all hours, with the angel name changed.TimingOften, the correct time to call a spirit is limited to what planet the spirit isallied with. A solar spirit, for example, should be called only on a Sunday,whilst a spirit of Jupiter should be called only on a Thursday. In addition tothis, a spirit is much easier to call within its own planetary hour. These hoursare outlined in most grimoires, including the Key of Solomon. For example, thebest time to call a Jupiterian spirit on a Thursday (the day of Jupiter) is inan hour of Jupiter, which is the first hour of Thursday (just after sunrise) orthe eighth hour or the fifteenth hour after sunrise, etc. These hours are allmeasured from sunrise, but are not measured by the clock. Instead, the timebetween sunrise and sunset in minutes is taken and divided by twelve. This givesthe length of one planetary hour (this may be longer than sixty minutes insummer, but shorter than sixty minutes in winter). Use this “planetary hour”count from sunrise, one hour at a time.** See the Planetary Hours box in Book Three: Planetary Magic.[image/Book5_Fig6.png]Figure 6. Table of Practice for the Ars Paulina 47[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-333]Ars Paulina (Part 2)The second part of the Ars Paulina is derived from book 2 of Trithemius’sSteganographia. This grimoire has a close connection with astrology and has anumber of different uses. This part of the Ars Paulina gives the angels rulingeach of the 360 degrees of the twelve signs of the zodiac, which combines bothtime and direction. It is interesting that Peter de Abano also gives magicalimages for each of these 360 degrees, which again connects the author of theHeptameron with the sources of the Lemegeton.This is helpful if you know the exact sign and degree of your birth time. Thenyou can determine the angel ruling your birth, or the “Lord or Lady of yourGeniture.” This idea connects with the idea of a personal genius that conveysthe influences of heaven (be they good or bad) to the person born under theirrulership, or even with a guardian angel. For example, Latrael is attributed tothe third degree of Libra, and Tzamiel is attributed to the tenth degree ofAquarius. For those who do not know the exact degree of their birth, an angel isalso attributed to each whole sign.These 360 angels (or spirits) are sometimes referred to as the monomoiria. Atleast two Gnostic sects revered the monomoirai: the Phibionites (a sect infamousfor its use of sex and lewd practices in its rites) and the Marcosians. However,there is no certainty that the practices in the Ars Paulina had anything to dowith either of these sects. Interestingly, these spirits are referred to here asdaemones, which is suggestive of their Gnostic origins. Two seals are given foreach sign, and these are the same as those that appear in Paracelsus’s Of theSupreme Mysteries of Nature, first published in 1656. Their inscriptions aremostly in Greek, but also in Latin.A prayer is provided for these angels, but the magician is also encouraged touse “prayers to God, they being composed to your fancy but suitable to thematter in hand.” 48 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-332] Furtheron, it is noted that “this prayer may be altered to the mind of the worker, forit is here set for an Example.” Acceptable requests include to “illuminate yourmind taking away all that is obscure and dark in thy memory, and make youknowing in all Sciences sacred and divine in an instant.” This anticipates thepurpose of the Ars Notoria, which is to enable you to comprehend all sciences inan instant. Again, the facing direction is stressed as being most important, anda “Crystal Stone” is to be used for the manifestation of the angel, in which youwill “at last see strange sights and passages in the stone, and at last you willsee your Genius.” This method is suggestive of communication with your HolyGuardian Angel.Part IV. Ars AlmadelThe Ars Almadel deals solely with the conjuration of angels. These angels aredivided into four choras, which are usually translated as “Altitudes” and areusually compared to the skrying practice in the 1580s of Dr. John Dee and EdwardKelley, who received the Calls of the 30 Ayres (or Aethyrs). But chora does notequate with Ayre. The original Greek word for chora, as it was used inAlexandria, referred to the suburbs surrounding that city and their directions,so chora is an indication of the cardinal directions, as is later confirmed inthe text, where they are described as “the four Corners of the world East, West,North and South, the which are divided into twelve parts, that is every part[contains] three [zodiacal signs].” So in this book, direction and time(zodiacal signs) are again united.The Ars Almadel dates back at least to the late fifteenth century, as it wasmentioned by Agrippa. According to Turner,49[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-331] a copy of it can also befound in a fifteenth-century manuscript in Florence.50[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-330] Its techniques may derivefrom the techniques of Jewish angel magic as shown in manuscripts like theTemunoth ha-Almadel, [image/443.jpg]. 51[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-329]A manuscript in the British Library credits Christofer Cattan, a Genovese, withbeing the inventor of the Almadel (the wax tablet used in conjuring the angels),or “l’inventore de detti Almadel Arabico.” 52[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-328] Cattan was famous for hisvery influential geomancy published in French in 1558 and in English in 1591,but the mention of “Arabico” suggests that he may have translated it but did notinvent it.It is tempting to think that the name of this book came from the Arabical-Mandal, meaning “magic circle,” but strangely the particular procedure usedin this grimoire is not one that utilises a circle. Of course the Circle of Artmight simply have been taken for granted by the author, who here simplyconcentrates mainly on the equipment on the Table of Practice.The method consists of assembling a six-inch-square wax tablet, whichincorporates four candles at the corners, with strategically placed holes thatallow the smoke from an incense burner placed below it to curl up and around thescrying crystal placed on the tablet, supported by a golden seal. The tablet hasthe usual godnames 53 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-327]engraved upon it within four squares, with a hexagram located at the centre,acting as a Table of Practice.The colouring of the wax differs from one chora to another. Only one invocationis used, but with a change of angel names. Each chora has special qualitiesattributed to it. For example, the first chora improves fertility in women,animals, and crops. Specific angels, like Borachiel and Hellison, belong to thischora. There is just one invocation that is effective for all four choras. Inrecent times, magicians such as Frater Ashen Chassan have explored the choras indetail.54 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-326]Part V. The Notory Art (or Ars Notoria)The last book is often missing from manuscripts of the Lemegeton. It is veryinteresting in its own right, but it is very different from the other fourbooks. Because its method is so different, I suspect that it was not originallypart of the Lemegeton.What this grimoire promises is to teach the main subjects of the Mediaevalcurriculum very rapidly, or at the least enable these subjects to be absorbedvery rapidly. Although some subjects like logic, rhetoric, and grammar aremainly ignored today, being able to argue a topic logically and both speak aboutit persuasively and write about it are in fact very useful skills. Likewise, theArs Notoria promised to teach languages such as Latin rapidly, as well asgeometry and philosophy.This book was definitely written before 1236, as it was mentioned by MichaelScot on that date. The earliest manuscript I am aware of is a parchment in theMellon Collection, Yale University Library, MS 1, which is dated circa 1225.The text of the English translation of Ars Notoria by Robert Turner was actuallyprinted at around the same time as most of the manuscripts of the Lemegeton werewritten (1657). In fact, the manuscript versions of the Ars Notoria were usuallycopied directly from the printed translation of Robert Turner, rather than theother way around. But even the printed book is unworkably incomplete, as themethod cannot be used without the elaborate illustrations, or notae, which arecompletely missing from the printed version and all seventeenth-centurymanuscripts.The Ars Notoria is not, as many people think, the “notorious art,” but is namedafter the magical diagrams, or notae, which are a key part of its method. Theaim of the Ars Notoria was to use these notae both to prompt memory and toprovide a scheme that would induce a rapid understanding in the operator of anyparticular art or science. It is easy to imagine eager students using this artas an aid to cramming or absorbing the essence of a subject. In a time of fewbooks, the ability to understand the ground plan of a subject or memorise wholechunks of material was highly prized and indeed a necessary skill of thescholar. Knowledge was literally defined as how much you knew or could remember.By about the seventeenth century, and certainly in the twentieth century,knowledge was redefined as the ability to find specific information from thehuge range of available books. In the twenty-first century, knowledge may beredefined again as the art of using the internet most effectively to find thatsame information. But in the Middle Ages, the ability to memorise, absorb, andorganise material was paramount. It is precisely for that purpose that the ArsNotoria was devised. Its methods promised the student that, with thememorisation of certain very elaborate diagrams accompanied by the correctprayers, whole subjects could be rapidly absorbed.The method of this book, which was originally independent but after theseventeenth century was included amongst the magical procedures of theLemegeton, relied upon the aid of spirits or angels in achieving these scholarlyends more rapidly. As Robert Turner so aptly explains: 55[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-325]The Ars Notoria, the magical art of memory, flourished during the Middle Ages,although its origins are attributed to Solomon and Apollonius of Tyana. It is aprocess by which the magician could instantly gain knowledge or memory of allthe arts and sciences. … To set the process into operation, the appropriatenotae were contemplated whilst reciting angelic names and magical orisons[prayers].56 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-324]The attribution of the Ars Notoria to Solomon gives it a reason for beingincluded in the Lemegeton. There was some question about the morality of usingangels rather than the labour of honest study, but in practice most studentswould use this art as an aid rather than an end in itself. If you like, it wasthe more technically advanced equivalent of a prayer to help you pass exams.Nowadays prayers are seen as free-form supplications and request lists, but theArs Notoria, like the other grimoires in the Lemegeton, made a much more precisetechnology out of it. The Ars Notoria had such procedures taped almost eighthundred years ago, but only for worthy and studious objectives, not the cars,money, love, and career dreams of the present century.The beautiful notae were the key to the procedure. Sadly, all printed editionsexcept the most recent, and many manuscript versions of the Ars Notoria, aremissing these essential ingredients.57[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-323] Some of the notae wereabstract, but some were like summary sheets for the subject. For example, thenotae for grammar show the nine parts of speech in circles, and the notae forgeometry show the line, triangle, square, pentagram, six-pointed star, andcircle in order. However, those notae that appear in some manuscripts 58[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-322] are much more like largedisordered sigils than organised subject outlines.Many copies are known to exist, and John Dee had at least two manuscript copiesof the Ars Notoria in his library, as did Robert Fludd and Simon Forman, whomade three copies. Ben Jonson, the Elizabethan playwright, also owned a copy ofthe Ars Notoria.The Ars Notoria was also mentioned by Trithemius, who also makes a claim that“he had written a book giving an occult method by which a person totallyignorant of Latin could learn in an hour’s time to write anything he wished inthat language,” a book with very similar objectives to the Ars Notoria.59[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-321] Going back even further,the Ars Notoria was also mentioned by Peter de Abano,60[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-320] whose contribution to theinvocations of the Goetia has already been noted.William Lilly (1602–1681), the astrologer, had two copies of the Ars Notoria:One whole year [1633–1634] and more I continued a widower, and followed mystudies [in astrology and magic] very hard; during which time a scholar pawnedunto me, for forty shillings, Ars Notoria, a large volume wrote in parchment [bySimon Forman], with the names of those angels, and their pictures, which arethought and believed by wise men, to teach and instruct in all the severalliberal sciences, and is attained by observing elected times, and those prayersappropriated unto the several angels.61[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-319]It is interesting that Lilly mentions “their pictures,” by which he probablymeant the notae.The rationale for the Ars Notoria being “Solomonic” comes from the introductionto the whole Lemegeton, which is found in several manuscripts, including SloaneMS 3648, in which it is said that Solomon learned all his knowledge using theArs Notoria:The fifth part is a Booke of orations and prayers that wise Solomon used uponthe alter in the Temple [in Jerusalem] which is called Artem Novam [another namefor the Ars Notoria]. The which was revealed to Salomon by the holy angel of Godcalled Michael, and he also received many breef Notes [hence Notae] written bythe finger of God which was declared to him by the said Angel, with Thunderclaps, without which Notes [King] Salomon had never obtained to his greatknowledge, for by them in [a] short time he knew all arts and sciences both goodand bad which from these Notes [Notae] is called Ars Notoria.In this Book is contained the whole art of Salomon although there be many otherBooks that is said to be his yet none is to be compared with this, for thiscontaineth them all, although they be titled with several other names, [such] asthe Book Helisol which is the very same as this last is, which [is] called ArtemNovam & Ars Notoria, &c.In the Middle Ages generally, but especially in the Ars Notoria, imagination andmagic were made to serve memory and scholasticism. In the magical literaturethat circulated between the fifth and ninth centuries, there are many tales ofancient rabbis conjuring an angel called Sar-Torah, the “Prince of the Torah.”This angel functioned like the angels of the Ars Notoria, and may have even beenthe model upon which it was based. Sar-Torah endowed the rabbis with thespectacular memory skills necessary for memorising vast swathes of the Torah.The angel then taught the rabbis a formula for giving others the same gift.62[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-318]This literature has been made available by Michael Swartz,63[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-317] who gives us rare glimpsesof how ancient and medieval Jews viewed this process of rapid learning aided byangelic conjuration. He examines many of the magical rituals for conjuringangels and ascending to heaven in the Merkabah chariot, a magical practice thatis still very much a part of the practical Kabbalah today. So here you have thereason why the Ars Notoria became part of the Lemegeton, as it was yet anothertechnique of Solomonic angel conjuration.Part VI. The PicatrixThe Picatrix comes from a completely different magical lineage. Just asSolomonic magic comes from Greek sources (and possibly Hebrew sources beforethat), so the Picatrix is part of a magical lineage that came from Arabicsources, via the court of Alphonso X of Castile to Europe. This style of magicdid not evoke spirits but utilised complex astrology to determine the precisetime to create a talisman that would take its energy from the images inscribedupon it at the precise time that stellar influences were aligned and at theirstrongest.Accordingly, the Picatrix is not associated with Solomonic magic nor even in asense ritual magic. Originally written in Arabic, this book was first translatedinto Spanish and then into Latin in 1256. It was not until the mid-twentiethcentury that it was translated into German. Two limited translations were madefrom the Arabic text after that. A translation of the full Arabic text of TheGoal of the Sage: An English Translation of Maslama al-[image/444.jpg](Picatrix) by Liana Saif is expected soon, and this will answer many questionsabout this text.Suggested Reading ListKiesel, William.

Heauthored The Search for Abraxas in 1972, and migrated to London the same year,where he wrote the Techniques of High Magic in 1976. Soon after, he producedTerrestrial Astrology (aka Geomancy in Theory and Practice), which is still themost complete work in English on Western divinatory geomancy. He collaboratedwith Dr. Donald Laycock on a dictionary of the angelic language discovered/usedby Dr. John Dee, and edited Crowley’s Astrology and the Magical Diaries ofAleister Crowley: Tunisia 1923.Highly illustrated coffee-table books on Nostradamus, Millennium Prophecies:Apocalypse 2000 followed. In 2003 he wrote Sacred Geometry, and soon after heedited Agrippa’s Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy. From 2004 till 2010 hecollaborated with David Rankine to produce the Sourceworks of Ceremonial Magicseries, producing The Veritable Key of Solomon, Lemegeton (including theGoetia), Janua Reserata, Sepher Raziel: Liber Salomonis, and Clavis Inferni.Skinner’s Complete Magician’s Tables is a tabular summary of the correspondencesof the Kabbalah; angels and demons; the gods of many cultures; the constituentsof magic in Latin, Greek, Babylonian, and Egyptian sources; and gemstones,plants, perfumes, and incenses—a total of over 840 comparative tables.He was awarded a PhD in Classics by the University of Newcastle for his researchinto the Greek text of the magical papyri (PGM) and its connection with theLatin grimoires. The first part of this thesis has been published as Techniquesof Graeco-Egyptian Magic, and the second part as Techniques of Solomonic Magic.Skinner’s most recent books are a full-colour version of Sibley’s Mysteries ofMagic, and the Ars Notoria, with full sets of notae never before published.

The authorshipis given as “Abraham of Worms,” a possible—albeit, disputed—pseudonym of RabbiJacob ben Moses ha Levi Möllin (c. 1365–1427), also known as Maharil.64[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-316]I will review the Abramelin to provide a summary of the practice and revisit myown experience of completing the ritual during 177 days of work in 2004. Anywriting on the Abramelin cannot help but be personal. All is purposed in thisuniverse and seen as such, following the knowledge and conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel. I was given the circumstances to perform the Abramelin Operationexactly seven years following my initiation into the grade of Adeptus Minor. Ifound myself writing After the Angel (my journal of the experience) exactlyseven years following the completion of the Abramelin. I was requested—out ofthe blue—to write this section in this present book exactly seven years since Ipublished After the Angel. These cycles of seven years rippled out in time—intoboth the past and the future—from the moment of completion of the ritual.The Book of Abramelin is similar in many senses to other occult grimoires, beinga collection of autobiographical material, magic squares, folklore, and a seriesof instructions that present an extended ritual whose aim is to bring about theknowledge and conversation of one’s personal Guardian Angel. However, it hasbeen seen by many, including notorious occultist Aleister Crowley, as somethingof another order:The majority of old magical rituals are either purposely unintelligible oractually puerile nonsense. Those which are straightforward and workable are, asa rule, better adapted to the ambitions of love-sick agricultural labourers thaneducated people with a serious purpose. But there is one startling exception tothis rule. It is The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage.65[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-315]This ritual is presented as six or eighteen months in length and comprises anincreasingly rigorous set of spiritual practices culminating in an invocation ofthe Angel and subsequent calling and controlling of the unredeemed spirits.The book—hereafter referred to as Abramelin—exists in several translations,originally French, German, and Hebrew, and was introduced into the WesternEsoteric Initiatory System in 1897 through the translation from the French intoEnglish by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918). The French version hasthe Operation lasting six months and the German version gives eighteen monthsfor the whole Operation.66 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-314]It was then promulgated as an essential component of initiatory progress byAleister Crowley (1875–1947) and assigned to the work of the Adeptus Minor gradein the initiatory system.67 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-313]The Abramelin stands in the medieval grimoire tradition in its format andcontent, with the notable exception of its ambition: a direct and ongoingrelationship with the Guardian Angel, which is unique in this grimoire. However,the statement of authority through the autobiography, the anonymous teacher, themagic squares, and the rituals of purification, confession, and invocation areall firmly rooted in the Western occult tradition.68[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-312]These grimoires were a rich seam for Mathers and the founders of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn. Mathers translated several such works, including theKey of Solomon the King and the Grimoire of Armadel.69[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-311] The Abramelin can betreated as a classical work alongside these titles and the Three Books of OccultPhilosophy by Henry Cornelius Agrippa.70[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-310]Whilst the other grimoires tend toward evocations of the spirits, talismans, andplanetary magic, there are echoes of the aim of the Abramelin. As one example,we find the mention of the Holy “daimon” in Agrippa:Every man hath a three-fold good demon as a proper keeper or preserver, the onewhereof is holy, another of the nativity and the other of profession. The holydemon is one, according to the doctrine of the Egyptians, assigned to therational soul, not from the stars or planets, but from a supernatural cause fromGod himself, the president of demons, being universal and above nature.71[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-309]We will first look at the nature of the ritual as given in the most uniquesection of the Abramelin and without which the other sections of the book remaininert.The Abramelin OperationThe ritual and contemplative practices described in the Abramelin, hereaftercalled the Operation, are divided into three periods of demanding preparation,each of two lunar months, which build in intensity—in daily practice and incumulative effect. At the conclusion of these preparatory six months, there isan intense seven-day period of which the first three days consist of callingupon the good spirits and the grace of knowledge and conversation with the HolyGuardian Angel. If this is successful, the final three days involve thesummoning of the evil spirits, under the instruction of the Angel, and obtainingtheir “oath” to obey the Operator and their Angel.There is no banishing ritual necessary to conclude the Operation, as the Angelremains with the Operator and the evil spirits are only too glad to depart andget as far away from the Operator as possible. In this, the Operation is verydifferent from other forms of magical ceremony, invocation and summoning.The three preparatory two-month periods of the ritual might be summarised as:• Removal—of the Psyche of the Operator through confession and constant prayer• Relocation—of the Awareness of the Operator through ritualised activity• Remembrance—of the Angel of the Operator through banishing and invocation200Who Wrote the Book of Abramelin?Abraham of Worms, “Son of Simon,” given as the author of the Abramelin, statesthat he was born in 1362 C, and that he wrote the manuscript for his own son,Lamech, in 1458, when he would have been age 96.In the autobiographical section of the work, he writes at length about his lifeand thoughts about both the occult practices and major events of the time. Aftera series of exhaustive travels, during which he met “Abra-melin” the Mage andlearnt from him the method described in the book, he appears by his owndescription to have settled in Würzburg, Germany, where he married and raised afamily. The true identity of the author remains in debate, with Georg Dehnproposing that the author was Rabbi Jacob ben Moses ha Levi Möllin (1375—1427),who was a noted student of the Talmud and survived the persecution described inthe book.Unfortunately, there are no references that confirm the details given in theautobiography section, such as court documents that would have named the figureif he had indeed been a court advisor, as claimed in the text. The reference toa son, Lamech, also cannot be verified to any possible author of the time.Similarly, the identity of Abramelin himself remains a mystery, as the figuremay have been a fictional character used as a literary device to provide thebook a magical authority. A pseudonymous or blended author in a magical book isa common device in other esoteric literature, such as Hermes Trismegistus, thepurported author of the Hermetic texts, or Christian Rosenkreutz, the eponymoushero of the Rosicrucian writings.As is so often the case, it may be that the only true magical tradition is theinvention of a magical tradition.The first two-moon period is filled with prayer and study. Every day withoutfail, at fifteen minutes before sunrise, the practitioner must enter theOratory, having bathed fully and properly, wearing fresh clothing. It was thefresh clothing that turned out to be one of the demanding parts of the ritual inactual practice rather than the early awakening each day. The practitioner thenengages in fervent prayer and oration, kneeling before the window, which isopen.A lamp is lit whilst this practice is performed. Whilst the nature of thisoration varies, it is at heart a constant prayer of thanks, confession, andsupplication to divine will. The most important aspect of the practice here isthat it seeks to earnestly connect to the divine will and opens the heart of thepractitioner.Later in the day, at least two hours must be set aside for study, usually afterdining. The study is of holy books, religious texts, mystical treatises, andother inspirational works. As the practice intensifies, the amount of timenaturally increases as the practitioner finds themselves refocusing theirattention on spiritual matters.The oration is repeated in the evening, and any ashes from the lamp or incensethat is used are taken out and emptied. Whilst this appears a minor detail inthe text, in practice the burning and emptying of the resultant ash has aprofound spiritual significance once the Operation is being conducted—itsymbolises the burning of the soul to meet the Angel.This practice is repeated every day, taking up several hours. At least onecontemporary book suggests that the process is reduced to just one time ofprayer each day:But just once a day will probably be sufficient in the beginning. You could, ofcourse, go for two times if you’re a trooper, but this is hard to doimmediately, and you don’t want to fail right at the outset.72[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-308]However, it is my recommendation that the ritual is followed to the letter tobuild the intensity of the Work, rather than it be diluted to gain a sense ofaccomplishment. The feeling of failure to meet the standards of the ritual is anessential component of the first two months. It brings a sense of humilityrather than achievement, which might aggrandize the ego of the practitioner.73[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-307]On the Saturday of the week, the sheets of the bedroom chamber are changed andthe chamber perfumed. Again, whilst this seems an inconsequential instruction,in practice the weekly cleansing of the sleeping area is an essential responseto much of the Operation continuing throughout the sleep of the practitioner.During the nights of the practice, there are intense dreams, visions, and othersignificant changes in the state of consciousness of the practitioner,particularly in the second period.After two months of this daily practice, which would have to be totallyabandoned should more than one performance be missed—for whatever reason—thesecond period of two moons commences.In the second period, the prayers are increased in length, depth, and intensity,and one seeks as much retreat from the world as possible. The hands and face arenow ritually bathed in fresh water before any oration, and every Saturdayincense is burned whilst the orations are continued day and night.In addition to this intensification and withdrawal, the practitioner now fastsevery Saturday in preparation for the final ritual. As ever, making substantialchanges to diet as well as the other factors at play during the Operation is nota matter to take lightly.During the third and final two months, the withdrawal continues, and a third setof prayers is added into the regime, at noon. In effect, the days now become aconstant prayer only interrupted briefly by moments of everyday life.Perfume and anointing are added into the ritual, preparing the practitioner andthe tools for the final working. Incense is now almost continually burned. Thiscontinues for two months without ceasing and stretches the individual beyondanything they may have ever experienced.The final days of the Operation concentrate on preparing the place ofinvocation, the use of specific psalms, a stripping of the last vestiges ofindividual self from the practitioner, and a complete day of absolute silencewhilst the Oratory is left in its working state. Many hours of prayer thenfollow, and after further fasting, on the third day, with the grace of thedivine, is attained the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.One is told to then leave the Oratory for an hour, then return and remain in theOratory with the Angel for the rest of the day.The next three days are concerned with calling and binding to obedience thechief evil spirits and the sub-princes of evil. These include Lucifer,Leviathan, Belial, and even Satan. Once these are bound, one can then commandthem to marshal their sub-princes, including Beelzebub and Asmodeus. Under thecommand of these eight sub-princes are entire ranks of Servitors, for example,Kemal, Sarisel, Roffles, and Rukum, in a vast array of names and roles.One is also granted four personal servant spirits for the tides of the day—alesser-noted aspect of the Operation, yet one that in practice is extremelyprofound and important to the magical work of the Adept after the Angel.A final day is then taken up to call and bind to oath the lesser spirits andthen, at last, a day of rest and celebration is allowed for the successfulpractitioner to conclude the entire working.The book notes that perhaps only one person in one hundred will be able tosuccessfully complete the working, and even that is given to grace as well asthe correct performance of the ritual:I swear by the True God that out of an hundred persons who might undertake thisoperation, there would be only two or three who would actually attain to it.74[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-306]It is a demanding Operation unlike any other in the Western corpus, and focusesentirely on the individual’s relationship with the divine, rather than gainingpower to control spirits or some other ancillary purpose:It is absolutely necessary to perform this Operation unto the praise, honour,and glory of God; unto the use, health and well-being of your neighbour, whetherfriend or enemy; and generally for that of the whole earth.75[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-305]203Concerning the Selection of the PlaceIf one were to undertake this Operation, there are many practicalconsiderations, most of which are dealt with very well and in detail throughoutthe Abramelin. Whilst Abramelin gives an account of the ideal place for theritual, he also points out “in this point as in all the others, we should ruleand govern ourselves according to the means at our disposal.” 76[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-304]The ideal situation is to have a lodge and terrace, with an uncovered balcony,and a window that looks out from the apartment to the terrace. There should alsoideally be an oratory in which the main work of prayer is conducted. A slidingdoor allows one to open and close access to the divine realm.In some cases the layout has been created within an otherwise unsuitableapartment, in other cases it has been built out from an existing home, and in mycase it was simply provided to specification by the Angel, including two bags ofriver sand.77 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-303]It is also possible to prepare an outdoor space for the Operation, instructionsabout which are included in the book. However, there are many issues inmaintaining an outdoor space unless it is within your own property, is nearby,and has ease of access.The Ritual ImplementsThe oratory should have a lamp, a censer for incense, and an altar.The LampThe lamp should ideally be an oil lamp, which can be lit and extinguished atease throughout the periods of the Operation. At one point during the finalseven days of the ritual, it must be left lit overnight with an open window inthe room, so care must be taken to ensure this can be done in a safe manner.The River SandThe Operation requires sand in which the evil spirits may make their appearanceknown, in the same manner that the Angel signs the silver plate (see below).This river sand is used in the final stage of the Operation and can be pouredonto a plate or bowl.The Silver PlateA silver plate is used in the final stage of the Operation in which the Angelmakes itself known. This can be a small square of silver or a silver-coveredplate. The Angel will make a visible mark upon the silver as the firstindication of the successful conclusion of the Operation.The Robe, Crown, Wand, and IncenseThe practitioner requires a white linen robe and a girdle of silk, as well as acrown. The crown can be a simple gold circlet. Various oils, perfumes, andincense are required, plus a wand—ideally constructed of almond wood:You should also have a Wand of Almond-tree wood, smooth and straight, of thelength of about from half an ell to six feet.78[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-302]The Oil of AbramelinThe anointing oil specified and used throughout the Operation is based on abiblical recipe comprising five ingredients: myrrh, cinnamon, cassia, olive oil,and “kaneh bosem,” which is most often identified as calamus, or “cane balsam”(Exodus: 30:22–24). The Abramelin instructions follow the biblical quote in thephrasing that “thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compoundafter the art of the apothecary” (Exodus: 30:25).The ingredients and measures differ in translations, but those in the originalbiblical version are:• Myrrh, 1 part• Cinnamon, ½ part• Cassia, same as myrrh in weight• Olive oil, ¼ of the combined weight of the other ingredients• Calamus, same amount as cinnamonIn the Mathers translation, he used galangal instead of calamus, and did notinclude cassia. Another alternative version was created by Aleister Crowley,using oils:• 8 parts cinnamon• 4 parts myrrh• 2 parts galangal• 7 parts olive oilHowever, the increased amount of cinnamon, particularly as an essential oil,leads to a more caustic liquid that can burn the skin.205The Requirement of VegetarianismThe instructions of the Abramelin are explicit regarding the adoption of avegetarian diet. During the ritual you are advised, “You shall eat during thiswhole period neither the flesh nor the blood of any dead animal.” 79[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-301] Further, for the ritual andthe following year, “You shall touch no dead body of any description soever.” 80[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-300]There is a further specific in this regard, during the Operation, with relationto one’s own body: Take well heed during the Six Moons or Months to lose noblood from your body, except that which the expulsive Virtue in you may expelnaturally of its own accord.81[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-299]At specific points, the dietary regime is tighter. During the three days ofworking with the unredeemed spirits at the conclusion of the ritual, “You shallfast, for this is essential, so that when you are working you may find yourselffreer and more tranquil both in body and mind.” 82[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-298] There are several furtherspecifics, and the general instruction that “your only object during your wholelife should be to shun as far as possible an ill-regulated life, and especiallythe vices of debauchery, gluttony, and drunkenness.” 83[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-297]One hundred and forty days into the ritual, I noted in my journal that I hadrealised something about blood and the ritual, although it was not clearlystated in the whole.84 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-296]There was a similar insight later about “all that lives, lives.”The realisation was that the ritual is not only a spiritual event but also aphysical event—every component of the body is aligned to the Angel through thekneeling, breathing, and repetition of the sensory anchors. This is coupled withdietary and sleeping regimes, all of which place the body in a peculiar andspecific state.As a result, any wound to the body would trigger an automatic survivalmechanism, which in turn would draw away from the intent of the ritual. Thiscould happen even with the smallest loss of blood or injury, such is the intensebut delicate state into which the physical body has been placed. There are manysuch requirements in the Operation that further unpack their meaning only duringthe performance and over time.SeclusionWhilst the book recommends seclusion, this is a purely practical consideration,for it reduces the responsibilities on the practitioner during the Operation. Itis advised that for “servants,” the problem will be balancing your work and theduties of the Operation, whereas for those who are “indentured,” it would beimpossible because one could be called for work in the middle of a waiting phasein the Operation. In contemporary terms, a job with regular hours might workwith the Operation, but as with all things, once the working is commenced, alllife becomes subservient to the demands of the ritual. A job with irregularhours or call-outs would not be practical to even commence the Operation. Theimportant factor is that even if one should conduct business, it should be“modest and patient” and not the cause of anger or anxiety.85[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-295]In the present author’s case, I had been given what appeared to be aonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity of a six-month period during which I would nothave to work and would receive income to support myself and family. I took thisas a definite sign to commence the work. I did not expect that within a fewweeks of commencing the Operation, my situation would radically change, and Iwould find myself having to again find employment whilst not giving up theOperation. This utterly unexpected twist was almost certainly part of theritual, as the employment turned out to be abusive and contributed to the“winnowing of the soul” during the first two phases of the Abramelin.86[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-294]Age, Gender, and Marital StatusThe specifications for the age and qualities needed for the Operation areobviously dated to the time of writing, when the average age expectancy, stateof health, etc., would have been very different from today, as would be thesocial and religious views. Abramelin states that the age needed for theOperation is between twenty-five to fifty, and this seems to be given in contextof health; it is also stated that one should be free of “inherited diseases”such as “virulent leprosy.” 87[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-293] I would consider that aminimum age of twenty-five is about right, possibly older, and so long as one’shealth is reasonable and sufficient to conduct the Operation as given, there isno maximum age. I can only postulate that conducting the Operation toward thelatter part of life may have a different focus for the Operator and a differentcommunication from the Angel.Whilst the Abramelin states that “whether he be free or married importethlittle,” it is recommended that you are single or commence in the first year ofmarriage.88 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-292] If one were toconduct the Operation in the first year of marriage, or at any time in amarriage, this would need to be discussed between both partners. There will bean immediate and long-term impact of the working in any relationship.In terms of gender, it is clearly stated that whilst “there be only Virgins whoare suitable” (amongst women), the advice is “that so important a matter shouldnot be communicated to them, because of the accidents that they may cause bytheir curiosity and love of talk.” 89[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-291] It should be highlightedthat Mathers states in a footnote to this portion, “Here comes another touch ofprejudice. In the present day many of the profoundest students of the Qabalahare women, both married and single.” 90[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-290] Again, my counsel would bethat the gender of the Operator is certainly something to be taken into account,but the Operation is available for all. There was nothing in my own experiencethat seemed as if it would be gender-specific.I believe that the “qualities” given in chapter 3 of book 3 of the Abramelin areof far more import than specific age or gender, these being tranquillity,temperance, and not given to “avarice or usury.” 91[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-289]Varying the InstructionsAs one practitioner of the Abramelin, “Ishariyah,” writes: “Practice is whatcounts in this matter. This Operation is not a theory. It is the real thing. Youhave to do it. If you merely contemplate it, or change it, you will never reallyknow it.” 92 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-288]However, there are several cases where a practitioner has written about the HolyGuardian Angel, or other mystical experience, and then revealed that they didnot perform the Abramelin but rather devised a four-week version of the ritual,underwent a single significant experience they took as the Angel, or indeedcrossed the Abyss in a vision.These are not in any way comparable to the performance and result of theAbramelin any more than spending a year travelling abroad compares with watchingan episode of a travel show.One is advised only to follow the instructions of the book, with the assistanceof the Angel, whether the practitioner is aware of it or not. If thepractitioner is not sure whether they have achieved the knowledge andconversation, then it is not the Angel. One must have faith and stick to theinstructions:Ye have here to do with the Lord, Who not only beholdeth the outer man, but Whoalso penetrateth the inmost recesses of the heart. But having taken a true,firm, and determined resolution, relying upon the Will of the Lord, ye shallarrive at your desired end, and encounter no difficulty.93[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-287]208Superstitions about the BookThe most common superstition about the Abramelin is that the magic squares cansomehow come to life and cause evil effects merely by their presence. Thisderives in part from Mathers, who originally lost his manuscripts for thepublication of the Abramelin in Paris and had to delay his publishers whilstputting up posters for the return of his briefcase. He went on to write in hisintroduction:If left carelessly about, they [the squares] are very liable to obsess sensitivepersons, children, or even animals.94[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-286]There is indeed a potential for obsession with magical work, which could beprojected onto ritual or symbolic items such as the squares. However, there are“occult guards” that protect both the Operant and the squares—and theirspirits—from misuse.95 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-285]The Requirements to Begin the OperationI believe that the profound impact of the Abramelin is enough to overcome theusual notion of linear time and space. In ritual work, we often find that oursense of time is challenged, and ultimately we come to see it as “the movinglikeness of eternity.” 96 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-284]The principle and only requirement to perform the Abramelin is that you havealready done so in the future. As such, a ripple has promulgated—apparentlybackward in time from our perspective—to the present moment when you commencethe Operation. If you do not feel this, it is unlikely that you have succeededin the Operation, nor will you succeed if you attempt it.There also may be a particularly significant event that offers an invitation toattempt the ritual. In my case it was a six-month payment package that came at atime when I had exhausted all other distractions. It seemed unlikely that suchan opportunity would ever again present itself.Useful Preparation for the OperationThe structure of the Western Esoteric Initiatory System holds the AbramelinOperation as a fundamental transition point between the status of student andadept. It is a test of all prior work, a self-evident award, and a graduationceremony rolled into one. The manifestation of the results may vary, but I holdthat there is essential preparation for the Operation that corresponds to thelikelihood of success.One of the most significant preparations is one of philosophy rather thanpracticality. I suggest that the practitioner apply radical analysis of theirbelief structure and the notion of duality. This might be accomplished through acombination of psychotherapeutic work, NLP (neuro-linguistic programming), andthe Western Esoteric Initiatory System.97[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-283]I observe that some who have completed the Abramelin remain locked in asimplistic framework of “inner and outer,” or “good and evil,” which becomesfurther locked by their practice of the Operation. I do not believe that theAngel is truly apparent when viewing the world in these limited models.An overhaul—through magical work or spiritual contemplation—of one’s ideas oftime and space is also essential to avoid the Abramelin consolidating animbalanced view.Prepare to DieThe Abramelin is a ritual of exhaustion, and as such the practitioner should beprepared to lose everything rather than gain anything in particular—even theirAngel. Preliminary practice for this aspect of the Operation can includeinitiatory rituals, death and rebirth practices, and contemporary works such asA Year to Live by Stephen Levine.Practice Constant ConfessionThe practice of unceasing prayer, also known as the Prayer of the Heart or theJesus Prayer, is found in several branches of Christianity. It is a usefulexercise prior to the Abramelin in that it foreshadows the constant attentionplaced on the contemplations during the Operation. The classic manual for thispractice is On the Prayer of Jesus by Ignatius Brianchaninov.Practice DevotionIt is uncommon to find the practice of devotion in magical work, yet this is aprinciple feature of the Abramelin. We may find it in Liber Astarte by AleisterCrowley, a six-month practice in which the practitioner devotes themselves to achosen deity, practised at a lower grade than the Abramelin.98[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-282] An alternative approach,within the Christian tradition, is The Imitation of Christ by Thomas A. Kempis,which can be used as a contemplative manual, taking each of the 118contemplations as a daily prompt over three to four months.Practice Divine ReadingTo encourage a deeper and engaged reading of the spiritual material chosenthroughout the Operation, the practice of Divine Reading is paramount. ThisBenedictine tradition works with scriptural reading in four phases: reading,meditating, praying, and contemplating. It is similar in essence to the fourlevels of Kabbalistic analysis: literal, symbolic, extended, and secret. Afamiliarity with active reading of spiritual texts will allow the practitioneran accelerated entry into this aspect of the Abramelin. However, there issomething to be said for floundering with the spiritual reading in thebeginning, which brings home a certain humility.Practice RitualThe Abramelin Operation is comprised of a series of interlocked ritualactivities that in themselves are simple in practice, although the final phaseis at the higher end of complexity in terms of ceremony and skill. A modicum ofexperience in Western ceremonial magic would likely benefit the practitioner.However, there have been workings performed by those not approaching it from abackground in ceremonial magic. The practitioner Ishariyah had “activelyfollowed a spiritual path for 30 years” but “had never been particularlyinterested in the common perception of magical working, as I considered much ofit to be lower astral work.” 99[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-281] Similarly, the authorWilliam Bloom, who conducted the Operation in 1973 and published his diary underthe pseudonym Georges Chevalier, had no deep practice in ceremonial ritual.100[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-280]Practice Mystical ContemplationThose who discuss their experience of the Abramelin appear to fall into threedistinct groups, based on their stated concerns, ongoing questions, and focusthat follows the ritual. I believe that as the ritual fundamentally shifts therelationship between the practitioner and the universe, the manner in which thatrelationship is manifest is entirely dependent on the preexisting relationship.One group attains some type of mystical or spiritual experience, where theoutcome is described as a form of union with the universe; another groupdescribes it as a connection to a new type of higher self; and a third groupdescribes it as not an outcome but a command over the spirits.These might be characterised as a mystical outcome, a psychological one, and amagical one. There is a fourth group, who successfully complete the ritual asgiven and gain the knowledge and conversation of their Holy Guardian Angel.Choosing the Prayers and Reading MaterialThe Abramelin counsels that much time be spent in reading—andcontemplating—spiritual works: “You shall set apart two hours each day afterhaving dined, during the which you shall read with care the Holy Scripture andother Holy Books, because they will teach you to be good at praying, and how tofear the Lord.” 101 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-279]The recommended literature would include Christian mystical works or other worksfound to be inspiring to the practitioner within their own tradition. Theultimate aim of this reading, in retrospect, is to “better know your Creator”and become increasingly open to one’s own position relative to a vast andmysterious universe, in addition to learning new skills for prayer.102[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-278]The Abandoning of the OperationIf performed correctly, the Abramelin is a demanding work of magic that at thevery least has a significant impact on the psychological state of the Operant.The repetitive ritual activity, adherence to a tight time schedule, andself-examination, coupled with the self-involved nature of the work, allcontribute to a rapid and intense erosion of the psyche.As the Operation progresses, further repetitions, intensification, andadditional practises lead to an uncoupling of the usual sense of reality. TheOperant may find themselves needing some form of escape, but this must becarefully considered—simple games might be one solution. Mathers notes that hetranslated the rule against jeu in the Abramelin as gambling rather than generalgames because he felt that recreation would be “almost a necessity during thisperiod, to prevent the brain giving way from the intense nervous strain.” 103[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-277]The Abramelin does factor in ill health as a reason to adapt or abandon theOperation:And in the case that during this period you should be attacked with someillness, which would not permit you to go unto the Oratory, this need not obligeyou to abandon your enterprise at once; but you should govern yourself to thebest of your ability. 104 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-276]The book suggests praying in bed, studying as you can, but should the sicknesscontinue for the second period (or third six-month period in the eighteen-monthversion), then you should take this as a sign that you must await a more“fitting time.” 105 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-275]Crowley himself abandoned his first attempt at the Operation, for theperformance of which he had moved to Scotland in 1899, in favour of visiting S.L. MacGregor Mathers in Paris during the midst of a crisis in the Hermetic Orderof the Golden Dawn.106 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-274] Hewrote that as Mathers was a link to “Secret Chiefs,” “if that meant giving upthe Abra-Melin Operation for the present, all right.” 107[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-273] He then remained ambivalentabout the Operation, returning to England “with a sort of feeling at the back ofmy mind that I might as well resume the Abra-Melin operation.” 108[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-272]It was not until he was travelling across China that he again resumed theOperation, writing, “I could construct my own temple about me and perform theOperation in my physical body,” rather than astrally travelling to BoleskineHouse in Scotland, where he had set up for the Operation.109[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-271]However, following his eventual return to England, a bereavement, and anillness, he began to consider that he might be failing at the Operation.110[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-270] In July 1906 he conferredwith Cecil Jones, a magical colleague, and resumed regular invocations,culminating a few months later in a spiritual experience at Ashdown Park Hotel,Coulsdon, Surrey:On the ninth [October], having prepared a full invocation and ritual, Iperformed it. I had no expectation, I think, of attaining any special success;but it came. I had performed the Operation of the Sacred magick of Abra-Melinthe Mage.111 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-269]The nature of the result, which Crowley tested further, and its relationship tothe Augoeides, which we will discuss in the next section, is given more detailby a brief diary entry for the same date:Oct 9. I did get rid of everything but the Holy Exalted One, and must have heldHim for a minute or two. I did. I am sure I did.112[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-268]Crowley took seven years to complete the Operation, attacking it with intensityand full focus on each attempt, through his own methodology. In the end, it isyour Angel who will stand before you in accomplishment of this Operation. Thequestion is simple: can you withstand the work? 113[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-267]The Angel, Higher Self, and the AugoeidesThere is often a conflation of terms when we read about the Holy Guardian Angeland Abramelin work, commencing with Crowley, who changed his view on the subjectseveral times during his life. This may be a matter of terminology, in anattempt to avoid the purely Christian notion of an Angel, but it can confusestudents of the Work.The Angel is not a form of self any more than a relationship with another personis a form of self. It is neither an unconscious self nor a higher self.The Neoplatonic term Augoeides was featured and introduced into the Westernesoteric tradition through the 1842 novel Zanoni by Edward Bulwer-Lytton(1803–1873). In the novel, which was influential for both Aleister Crowley andA. E. Waite, the mysterious Adept Zanoni speaks of the Augoeides as the“luminous soul.” 114 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-266]There is a principle of the soul, superior to all nature, through which we arecapable of surpassing the order and systems of the world. When the soul iselevated to natures better than itself, THEN it is entirely separated fromsubordinate natures, exchanges this for another life, and, deserting the orderof things with which it was connected, links and mingles itself with another.—Iamblichus.115 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-265]The Augoeides was also referenced by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831–1891)within theosophical teachings as “the luminous body of the spiritual soul, oncerid of its (physical and psychical) vestures, or bodies.” 116[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-264]The Augoeides is seen as the “subtle vehicle” of the soul, and a “divine body.”117 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-263] This body can also bepurged and energised by living according to the virtues. It can also besummoned. In Zanoni, the titular Adept calls upon “Adon-Ai,” the “Son of EternalLight,” in a cave, which first appears as “a luminous and gigantic column,glittering and shifting.” 118[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-262] Then out of that columnemerges an angelic figure:A shape of unimaginable glory. Its face was that of a man in its first youth,but solemn, as with the consciousness of eternity and the tranquillity ofwisdom; light, like starbeams, flowed through its transparent veins; light madeits limbs themselves, and undulated, in restless sparkles, through the waves ofits dazzling hair.119 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-261]In this description, there is similarity to the Guardian Angel, and it is likelythe seed of the concept that grew in Crowley’s vision. As such, it is areflection of the soul lit from its own light, finding a response in theuniverse—and not merely another version of self-identity.The Cult of the Guardian AngelThe Church still maintains several movements dedicated to the angels, in muchthe same way as the cult of Mary or the cult of saints. One such movement is the“Opus Sanctorum Angelorum,” sanctioned by Pope Paul VI in 1968.120[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-260]There are three stages in conjoining with the angels within this movement. Thereis a spiritual “promise” first made to the guardian angels, followed by aconsecration ritual to the Guardian Angel, certifying oneself as a “spiritualwarrior.” 121 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-259] This iseventually followed by a third stage in which the candidate is consecrated toall angels.Abramelin DiariesThere are few published full accounts of the Operation itself—the first beingThe Sacred Magician by William Bloom, which was originally published under apseudonym, Georges Chevalier.122[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-258] Bloom was twenty-five whenin 1973 he set off to Morocco with his wife to practice the ritual in ruralisolation. There is also a lesser-known account by Ishariyah (I. Golden), whowas fifty-four when he undertook the ritual in 2003 in Australia. I discoveredand purchased that book, The Abra-Melin Experience, during my own practice in2004, when I was thirty-nine.Author and researcher Aaron Leitch has also written on the Abramelin from hisexperience of the working in 1997, 123[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-257] and the Thelemic magicianBill Heidrick provides a lengthy “Abramelin Ramble” written between1994–1995.124 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-256] Athena W.completed the working in 2003–2004, and her notes are available online.125[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-255] At the time of thiswriting, The Abramelin Diaries by Ramsey Dukes (Lionel Snell) is the mostrecently published account, following YouTube videos where he discusses hisexperience of the ritual in 1977. 126[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-254]215The Appearance of the Holy Guardian AngelThe question most asked by those who have not attempted the Abramelin is aboutthe appearance of the Angel, namely, whether it is a physical appearance. In thepresent author’s case, it was a physical appearance, and I would propose that asuccessful Operation would likely involve such a manifestation. This is becausethe world is literally turned inside out during the culmination of the ritual,and as such, a physical presence is well within the parameters of this profoundevent.To the practitioner who has been successful in the Operation, there is noastonishment at the physical manifestation, due to the other revelations thatoverwhelm the awareness at that time.The Angel will always be unique to the individual. The fourth-century bishopGregory Thaumaturgus suggested that angels are assigned by a “momentousdecision.” 127 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-253] Thetheologian Origen of Alexandria (c. 184–c. 253) speculated that angels are giventheir position through their own unique qualities, leading to contemporaryauthors suggesting that “we are paired with an angel individually suited to ourpersonal pursuit of salvation.” 128[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-252]Israel Regardie (1907–1985) suggests, following Iamblichus, that “the outcome ofthe invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel does not result identically withvarious people” and “to whatsoever conception of his Angel he aspired, so willthe outcome of the mystical marriage be.” 129[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-251]The Four Servant SpiritsOn the calls for the second and third days of the final phase of the Operation,the practitioner calls upon the Dukes and Kings of the infernal hierarchies toprovide four servant spirits unique to the practitioner. These may come from thelists provided in the Abramelin but may also be given individually, according tothe whims of the Kings. The servant spirits are allotted times of the day whenthey are attendant and may also be “loaned” to other people for magical work.130[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-250]The Use of the Magic SquaresIn the tradition of the grimoires, the Abramelin contains a significant sectionthat provides a range of magic squares. These are grids of various sizescontaining letters or numbers that create acrostic patterns of apparentlynonsensical words such as SEGOR. In some cases, the letters and words may betranslated from Hebrew, such as MAIAM, the Hebrew word for “water” in the magicsquare “to walk upon, and operate under, Water.” 131[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-249]216A Diary EntryThe Operation is not without significant impact on those around the Operator,which is difficult to communicate. Some forty days into the Operation, Irecorded the first signs of influence on my wife and son, who managed to bearwith me throughout the whole ritual. I provide these diary entries (published inAfter the Angel) as brief example of the importance of full consideration priorto attempting the working.Day 39: 1st May 2004 (Saturday)My oratories were performed this night with incense, after which I felt that thetop of my head had been lifted off, and a wide empty plane had opened all aroundme, in which “presences” gathered—neither good nor bad, merely of a differentorder. It was very strange—I recall blinking, staring, and my stomach turningover. It was very visceral.B [my wife] reported a nightmare where she was surrounded by threatening maskedfigures, and in the nightmare, I appeared and told her, “Everything changes intoeverything else.”Day 40: 2nd May 2004 (Sunday)Orations performed.My personality is beginning to revolt against the strain. I can feel every partof me screaming for either attention or to be withdrawn from the process. It islike a dark therapy.Day 41: 3rd May 2004 (Monday)Orations performed. R [my son] is reporting strong and meaningful dreams—thismorning about an evil pure-white cat that he wanted to get rid of from thehouse, but B [my wife] and I wouldn’t let him.The wide open “headless” plane is still open. And I am starting to receiveinstruction. Really. And it is not at all like anything I imagined. But all toobrief, I am too full for much to take within.A plant pot crashed to the floor tonight in the hallway, making us all jump. Itreally could not have simply lifted itself off the stand and launched itselfonto the floor. It feels as if everything is alive around us, and there arepresences in the day, in the night, and in our dreams.These squares are to provide magical results of varying plausibility if takenliterally: “to prevent Caves from falling in” or “to cause a body to revive.”132 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-248] Others are to heal orcause sickness, find lost items, and other relatively common concerns such as tohave as much money as one might need in times of trouble.In the French version and Mathers’s subsequent translation, the squares areincomplete—in one German version they are presented in full. There are specificinstructions regarding the use of these squares, the main of which is “you willnever demand of your Guardian Angel any Symbol wherewith to operate for an Evilend, seeing that you would grieve him.” 133[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-247]It is further indicated that “it is not necessary (in all cases) to use writtensymbols [the squares]” in favour of merely speaking or concentrating upon thesquare.134 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-246] However, thebook does present instructions for using the squares in ritual, and evenencourages the operator that “the Evil spirits be exceedingly prompt andexceedingly obedient in the working of Evil.” 135[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-245]A general practice is also given for accessing the squares and spirits should anaim not be covered by the list of squares included in the book.Preparation1. Fast on the preceding day.2. On the day, wash, enter the oratory dressed in white, and light the lamp andincense.3. Place a drop of the anointing oil on a seven-sided tablet of gold, silver, orwax and place it upon the altar in front of the incense.4. Kneel and call to Adonai for assistance.5. Call upon the Guardian Angel for advice and to bless you with his appearance.6. Await the presence of the Angel.7. Once the Angel has appeared, concentrate your attention on your Angel.8. You will then find that the name and square of the spirit required for thetask—and his Duke—has appeared “written as it were in drops of dew, like a sweatexuding therefrom” upon the silver tablet.136[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-244]9. Copy the sign, leaving the tablet upon the altar, and return in the evening,when the name and square will have disappeared from the silver tablet.10. Perform your regular prayer regime and wrap the tablet in a silk cloth.It is suggested that if the Angel does not appear, then the aim of the ritual isnot to be allowed by the divine, and that it is best to prepare the ritual onthe eve of the Sabbath (Sunday) so as to conduct it on the Sabbath withoutmaking it unholy.Use of the Given SquarePrepare the oratory with incense and the tools of the Abramelin ritual,including the bowl or plate of sand.1. Light the incense and pray to the Angel with humility.2. Stand fully robed with the girdle and headband, holding the wand and facingthe arbor/door.3. Call the Twelve Dukes as was done in the Operation. They will appear insight.4. Command the Dukes that they may not leave until the relevant Duke make appearin the sand the square and the name of the spirit that was received on theprevious day upon the silver tablet.5. At this point it will be evident that the spirit is present but invisible tosight.6. Make the Duke and the spirit take the oath as was done in the Operation.7. Dismiss the Dukes and spirit, first making a note of the square, because itwill vanish as soon as the spirits are dismissed.8. Close the ritual with the incense.Success of the Magic SquaresThere have been several occasions when the present author has successfully usedthe squares, subject to either necessity or experiment—and the grace of theAngel. The first was the 15th square, “That the Spirits bring all sorts ofthings to eat and drink.” 137[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-243]Our family was going through a time of hardship that had been made worse bymyself falling foul of a short-term debilitating illness. I was unable to gointo work and our money had completely run out, with no income for a furtherweek. We worked with the spirits as a family with no clear hope of success.The following day, there was a knock on the door. Even though I was very sick, Iwas able to get downstairs and open the door. I was surprised to see the humanresources manager of my place of work. She told me that the company had beenworried about my situation and knew that I had been unable to leave the house.As a gesture, they had asked the catering staff to put together a meal. In fact,as it was a place with many catering students, they had all worked on the taskand provided enough meals and food for a week.I still have a photograph of our kitchen that day, full of trays and platters,bottles and dishes, brimming with food and drink—“all sorts of things to eat anddrink.”The second notable occasion was more of an experiment than a necessity, with amagic square from another grimoire. I had been discussing with a friend theridiculous aims of some of the squares. I chose a random square and performed asimple rite to activate it. I then forgot about it. Within a week, I foundmyself at a theatre in another city, reclining on floor cushions, listening toArabic music and watching a raqs sharqi dance performance—all unexpectedly andwithout any intent on my part.The oddest and most difficult aspect to explain was that I had totally forgottenthe ridiculous aim of the magic square: “to summon thirteen dancing girls on aWednesday.” It was indeed a Wednesday.The third example was in the searching of the magic squares to derive a name fora divination-related project. I had intended to search the squares for acombination of letters that would not be in general use. I also felt that therewould be a trick in using a magical name for a whole project. As I vainlysearched the squares for a workable combination of letters, I suddenly had theword Tarosophy spring into my mind, which became the guiding name and trademarkof an entire lifetime project. It was only after I wrote it down and returned toclose the Book of Abramelin that I saw fully the square that I had last beenviewing: “To Know the Secrets of Words.” 138[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-242]A final example was created for this current writing, to demonstrate the use ofthe squares. I selected the 16.10 square, ORION, “To find and take possession ofall kinds of Treasures,” namely “Coins.” 139[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-241] This is also a square torecover lost money. I chose this square as it has such a definite purpose andoutcome.I created the square and activated it at 2:00 p.m. that afternoon. At 5:00 thefollowing morning, I found myself suddenly awake and unable to sleep. I glancedat the emails on my phone and saw a notification that I had won a prize in theUK lottery.I checked on the computer and the site was down for overnight repair. I made acup of tea and refreshed the screen, only to discover, at 5:20 a.m., that I hadindeed won 4.81 pounds on the lottery. I can only imagine that this preciseamount is likely the total of coins lost from my pockets, fallen out at thecinema, and other losses of coins over the last few years.220Aleister Crowley and the AbramelinWe have seen that Crowley held the knowledge and conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel as a central stage in the Great Work and his attempts atperforming the Abramelin Operation.We have also noted how Crowley compared the term Holy Guardian Angel to that ofthe higher self, Khu, Augoeides, etc., in his later writings only in the senseof deriding them as versions of Higher Self or God within us, which he deemedmeaningless. He implored his student to abhor and abominate these terms—and muchmore—and instead “get on with your practice.” 140[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-240]We may readily concur that the Augoeides, the “Genius” of Socrates, and the“Holy Guardian Angel” of Abramelin the Mage, are identical. But we cannotinclude this “Higher Self”; for the Angel is an actual Individual with his ownUniverse, exactly as man is; or, for the matter of that, a bluebottle. He is nota mere abstraction, a selection from, and exaltation of, one’s own favouritequalities, as the “Higher Self” seems to be.141[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-239]Crowley repeats several times that the Holy Guardian Angel is not an abstractionor a higher self—otherwise, “there would be no point” in the Abramelin.142[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-238]He is not to be found by any exploration of oneself. It is true that the processof analysis leads finally to the realization of oneself as no more than a pointof view indistinguishable in itself from any other point of view; but the HolyGuardian Angel is in precisely the same position.143[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-237]Contemporary practitioners have, in general, concentrated on the process ofevocation and the commanding of the spirits in the Abramelin, after Crowley:Therefore we can infer that every ritual we perform to attain this Knowledge andConversation not only brings us closer to the Holy Guardian Angel, but alsoincreases our power over external circumstances and, why not, over theSpirits.144 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-236]The rejection of the Operation as a mystical experience—sometimes insteadconflated with a “new age” gloss of self-development—in favour of seeing it as againing of implicit power and influence is also a common trend:The real goal of the Abramelin Rite is to attain a Supernatural Assistant whowill grant you the power to bind the spirits who would cause you harm and setthem to working for you instead.145[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-235]The notion of power—an implicit statement of duality—is anathema to thespiritual experience of unification that attends the knowledge and conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel.A Dark SongA contemporary direct reference to the Abramelin is found in the 2016 film ADark Song. The director, Liam Gavin, stated in an interview that the bookappealed to him as it meant both the simplicity and the challenge of a singlelocation shooting with a small cast. However, the film also captures theintensity, magical discipline, and spiritual development that are bound to theOperation.There is one understated yet extremely relevant moment where the two characters(the woman performing it and the man assisting her) are sat quietly talking inthe kitchen of the isolated house that has been hired for the duration of theritual. They are talking about the weather, and in passing one mentions themonth, to which the other quietly muses that they thought it was another month.In this reflective moment, we see that they have been entirely “de-coupled” fromreality, which occurs in the actual Operation.The ritual performed in the film bears little similarity to the Abramelin otherthan the relative isolation of the working and the length of it. However, someconstraints such as sexual relations and diet are mentioned. There are alsocomponents that are subtly utilised, such as the increasing study of holywritings and the facing of demons prior to the climatic Operation. A particularpoint when the dynamic shifts between the characters is marked by a wound andblood, which is repeated as a motif at the conclusion of the film, and this istrue to one of the instructions in the book with regard to blood.The final sacrifice is also true to the Operation, as it involves a completenegation of the most important attachment of the main character—and a redemption(of sorts) for the other character. Despite the director having no significantinvolvement in esotericism, the theme of the work has been powerfully portrayedin the film.It could be said that whilst the film is not about the Operation in function, itis about the Operation in purpose: the knowledge and conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel as an act of forgiveness, sacrifice, and grace.222A. E. Waite and the AbramelinA. E. Waite references the Abramelin in a short chapter within The Book ofCeremonial Magic, writing:The amateurs of occult science in the more dubious of its practical branchesbecame possessed of this pearl of tradition in 1898, and I suppose that it isfamiliar enough in certain circles.146[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-234]Waite points out that the text differs in several ways from the usual run ofgrimoires, notably when it derides “all observations of times and seasons alongthe usual and accepted lines.” 147[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-233]He holds some contempt for the author:An exponent of Art Magic in the utmost simplification thereof, but that which hesaves in ritual he expends in the dramatic elaboration of general mise enscène.148 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-232]Waite concludes by dismissing Mathers’s statement of the importance and benefitof the book.The DropA common experience following the conclusion of the Operation is the drop orcomedown that attends the cessation of daily practice. One practitioner wrotethat it is “like I have lost a friend.” 149[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-231] After I completed theAbramelin, I was unable to write in my journal for thirty days. I then wrote asingle page, of which the content still remains mysterious to me, mentioningspecific terms such as “Black Tuesday” and “Interstate 5,” which have noconscious meaning to me even now.150[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-230] There is then no entry inmy journal for another three months. During that time, I had an overwhelmingfeeling that I had fractured into two states, one where I had actually concludedthe Operation with success and another where I had failed and was either trappedin an endless loop of performance or trapped in a fictional world created by thedemonic entities.Ishariyah notes the requirement to “re-integrate” himself with his family,“without losing the changes that have occurred in me.” 151[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-229]223After the AngelThe Abramelin Operation is both the culmination of the life of the Adept and thecommencement of a new life. Ishariyah writes of the “great blessing” of thework, but also of the “next phase,” which begins several months following theAbramelin.152 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-228]A successful conclusion of the Operation brings about several common and relatedexperiences:• A change of personality• A change of life• A change of prioritiesThe personality becomes more withdrawn from personal engagement, calmer and lessattached to daily concerns. However, this is not a passive change—it can bringabout a great release of energy and purpose, particularly should the Angeldirect the person to a particular task. A single-mindedness is evident in theperson, which can cause issues with the more mundane roles and responsibilitiesof life.As such, life itself will change for the person as they adjust to the changes.In several cases, including my own, life will take itself along the line ofleast resistance, for better or worse. The person may remove themselves from thebusiness of life, particularly to make themselves their own master. Thepractitioner may find themselves gravitating toward a more rural lifestyle: “Forhumans, for angels, for all planetary life, wilderness areas are necessary.” 153[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-227]This is a prime characteristic of the successful knowledge and conversation ofthe Holy Guardian Angel. As the Abramelin puts it:Now, at this point I commence to restrict myself in my writing, seeing that bythe Grace of the Lord I have submitted and consigned you unto a MASTER so greatthat he will never let you err. 154[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-226]There is no doubt—when in contact with the Angel—as to one’s purpose, errors,and path following the conclusion of this Operation. There is no place left forfear, insecurity, or anxiety. There is no distraction nor doubt, for there is noone left to experience such things. The Angel is a coherent light of the soul incontact with itself, radiating outward. The trick is to maintain the knowledgeand the conversation after the Operation.Thomas Aquinas writes, “The Guardian Angels … teach us by lighting up oursense-images, and strengthen the light of our intelligence. Leading us to seeeverything more clearly, and like a skilled teacher, an Angel strives to composeand arrange sense-images in such a way as to give the mind better information towork on.” 155 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-225]In layman’s terms, the world is turned inside out by this experience. We realisein every part of our awareness that the external world is actually our internalone, projected onto a vastly complex interactive screen. There are no people,places, time, or space—just the screen. And then something punches through thescreen that is so real, so present, that either it is an experience of the selfso insanely projected it appears as totally other, or it is indeed other, and weare relegated to the realisation of ourself as part of the screen. It is we whobecome the fiction, the other, and the Angel is held as the reality.The priorities of life will be shifted to an increasingly spiritual oreducational and developmental focus. The immediate concerns are lessened, andpersonal life comes to be experienced as a brief yet critical part of thespecies as a whole. It may not be possible to act upon the totality of these newpriorities, but the Angel guides one to opportunities where they may be at leastpartly realised.In making these adjustments, the overarching factor becomes the knowledge andconversation of the Angel. The task is then to forget everything other than thisexperience, a practice that recapitulates the work of earlier grades in theinitiatory system. The zeal and recall exercises of the Zelator and Theoricusare essential foundational work for what follows after the Angel.Aaron Leitch suggests that whilst it is unlikely that the practitioner will beable to maintain their oratory following the Operation, a “next best-casescenario is to maintain some form of oratory somewhere in your home.” 156[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-224]Crowley notes that the “discarded elements of the Adept” are neither wasted norleft “to become vehicles for obsession.” 157[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-223] As they have built up intoan adequate albeit artificial personality through the Adeptus Exemptus work,having been previously “sanctified and glorified” by the knowledge andconversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, they are put to work for theirappointed purpose, now no longer impeded by the false personality—theattachment.Every Guardian Angel comes with not only a message but a mission. It thenremains to the practitioner whether they take on that mission or not.225The Abramelin in the Initiatory SystemThe knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is assigned to thesephirah of Malkuth, the “Kingdom,” on the Tree of Life. Initially, this mayseem odd, as this is the location of a relative beginner grade in the initiatorysystem—the Zelator. However, it conceals a deeper truth. The awareness of theAngel is an experiential shift in the relationship between the practitioner andthe universe; it is a fundamental shift in identity and apprehension of reality.It is the third of such shifts in the initiatory system and precedes the fourthshift across the Abyss:It should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essentialwork of the Magicians is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be leftentirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably reliedupon to lead him to the further great step—crossing of the abyss and theattainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.158[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-222]As such, it is a perfect correspondence to Malkuth—the Kingdom. Thecorresponding tarot card of the Universe is assigned to the path between Malkuthand Yesod, representing not only our inner model of the world but also ourexperience of that model. Yesod appropriately means “foundation,” the veryfoundation of our identity—our “self.” We commence our Great Work in Malkuthbecause it is literally and simply exactly where we are.The encounter with the Angel in Tiphareth is not experienced “in” Tiphareth—our“awareness” or consciousness—because we no longer possess an individualself-awareness. There is no real “Tree” after the Adept grade; it becomes merelya language spoken in a boundless place. So the vision of the Angel isexperienced as the relationship between identity and the unknowable universe—itis this relationship that requires the language of mysticism rather thanscience, psychology, or magic.Crowley himself refers to this experience and difficulty of expression in hisfinal writings to a student, published as Magick Without Tears. He suggests thatthere are levels beyond the experience of the Holy Guardian Angel, furtherconsolidating this mystical progression:Beyond that yet loftier vision which corresponds to our “Knowledge andConversation of the Holy Guardian Angel”, is that called Atmadarshana, thevision (or apprehension, a much better word) of the Universe as a singlephenomenon, outside all limitations, whether of time, space, causality or whatnot.159 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-221]226Abramelin and PsychologyWhilst esoteric matters may be esoteric, they have fundamental effects oneveryday life. As perspective is shifted through practice, crisis points arereached between one state of identity and another:The “dimension change” is inevitably a traumatic experience involving apsychological upheaval of some description.160[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-220]The Abramelin process also releases a significant amount of psychologicalmaterial, namely that which belongs to projection and the shadow of the psyche.In this it is important to adhere to the instructions of the book, readspiritual material in a focused manner, and develop a clarity in confessions. AsRobert Bly points out, “I’ll mention the use of careful language, by which Imean language that is accurate and has a physical base. Using languageconsciously seems to be the most fruitful method of retrieving shadow substancescattered out on the world.” 161[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-219]We can also consider the parapsychology of the Angel in that, for example, “itlets us drop the controls of the ego and this surrender to the dynamics ofhigher consciousness.” 162 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-218]Contemporary Cultural ReferencesThe latest use of the Abramelin in popular culture is in the 2016 horror film ADark Song, directed by Liam Gavin (see previous box). The film references theAbramelin by name at least twice and takes its theme as the invocation of theHoly Guardian Angel—in this case, to grant one specific favour. It has led toseveral social media site discussions as to the Abramelin and in particularAleister Crowley’s attempts at the ritual.163[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-217] Whilst the ritual presentedin the film is a mixed compendium of several other practices, grimoires, andtraditions, it is ultimately true to the spirit of the Abramelin in terms of theredemptive nature of the Operation and the mental duress of its practice.Several other films recall the relationship of the Adept and the Holy GuardianAngel, particularly in terms of the ascent narrative, without making directreference to the ritual:1. Kontroll (dir. Nimród Antal, 2003)2. Jacob’s Ladder (dir. Adrian Lyne, 1990)3. Last Year in Marienbad (dir. Alain Resnais, 1961)4. Inception (dir. Christopher Nolan, 2010)ConclusionThe Book of Abramelin provides a comprehensive ritual for practitioners toradically engineer their experience of the universe. It provides a unique bridgebetween the methodology of medieval magic and contemporary self-developmentwork. The experience at the very least tests the faith of the practitioner,develops their spiritual practice, and forces a radical reevaluation of theirbelief system. Should it prove successful—for it is the most real ofexperiences, not merely a study—then it commences an utterly new life based onan entirely different experience of reality:When the entire system of the Universe is conterminous with your comprehension,“inward” and “outward” become identical.164[LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-216]Suggested Reading ListIn addition to those books listed in the bibliography and main text, I suggestthe following titles as supplemental to the Abramelin Operation.Auster, Paul. In the Country of Last Things. London: Faber & Faber, 1988.An account of one who refuses to speak the “language of ghosts” and goes insearch of her lost brother in the unnamed City. It is as harrowing an account ofthe futile nature of hope in the material world as some parts of the Abramelinexperience.Henderson, Joseph L. Thresholds of Initiation. Wilmette, IL: Chiron, 1995.Henderson takes the account of growing into manhood in tribal societies andapplies it to self-development. Of particular interest is the seven-stagegrading system in which the experience of the personal Guardian Spirit isplaced.Katz, Marcus. The Magister, Vol. 0: The Order of Revelation. Keswick, Cumbria:Forge Press, 2016.A further and comprehensive guide to essential reading on the Western EsotericInitiatory System and the place of the Abramelin in the initiatory system may befound in this book.Parisen, Maria, ed. Angels & Mortals: Their Co-Creative Power. Wheaton, IL:Philosophical Publishing House, 1990.An indispensible collection of essays ranging from Israel Regardie’s “TheMagician and the Holy Guardian Angel” to Matthew Fox’s “Illuminations ofHildegard.” It also contains papers from Marie-Louise von Franz, GeoffreyHodson, and work on Rudolph Steiner.Peake, Anthony. The Daemon: A Guide to Your Extraordinary Secret Self. London:Arcturus, 2008.Peake presents a fascinating model of the human being having two distinctcomponents, the Eidolon and the Daemon. We generally identify ourselves with theEidolon, yet the Daemon exists in real time, slightly ahead of our laggingperception of ourself and the universe. Peake details numerous cases that hesees as the Daemon breaking through our usual sense of reality. Toward the endof the book he has a fascinating comparison of his work to that of Philip K.Dick and “Gnostic” theology.Reed, Bika. Rebel in the Soul. London: Wildwood House, 1978.A poetic presentation of Berlin Papyrus 3024, which provides a dialogue betweena man and his soul as they despair of the world. It is estimated to be at least4,000 years old, and the book provides several rituals or text that can inspireritual. In a general sense, it provides a precursor for the Abramelin, separatedfrom it by some several thousand years.Underhill, Evelyn. Mysticism. London: Methuen & Co., Ltd., 1942.Originally published in 1911, this book provides a comprehensive overview of thespiritual quest expressed in Christian mysticism and is an invaluable treasuretrove to those undertaking the Abramelin experience. It covers areas such asvisions, introversion, ecstasy and rapture, the unitive life, and the dark nightof the soul.Wolff-Salin, Mary. Journey into Depth. Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999.This book covers the experience of initiation within the Monastic tradition andcompared to the training of a Jungian psychoanalyst. A timely work on the lossof the initiatory journey in contemporary society outside of these two specificareas and, of course, the whole of the Western esoteric corpus.BibliographyAbraham of Worms.

This King isoften called Oriens, but this is a longstanding confusion with the Latin wordfor east. Oriens was on some grimoire diagram placed next to the actual name ofthe King, and at some point the name and direction were confused, and Oriens wasmistaken for the name of the King in the East. From manuscripts such as theClavis Inferni (Skinner and Rankine, The Grimoire of St. Cyprian: ClavisInferni) it is clear that the name was originally Urieus. Not only does Urieussound like Uraeus, the serpent headdress of ancient Egypt, but its symbol wasthe winged Ouroboros, one of the clearest indications of the origin of thisKing’s name in ancient Egypt. Its orientation in the east, at the place of therising sun, also accords well with an Egyptian origin.25 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-355-backlink].

Waite in his book Ceremonial Magic, it is oftensaid that Dr. Rudd was a fictional creation of Peter Smart, and not a realperson. This is a mistake as there is ample evidence of Rudd’s existence (seebox on Dr. Rudd in Book Seven). Furthermore, Peter Smart very clearly marks thebeginning of each sheet in Rudd’s manuscript (just as we might mark folionumbers), a procedure which would be ridiculous if Smart was not copying anexisting manuscript but just making it up. In addition, there are a number ofreferences to “T.R.” providing the source material for Weyer’s PseudomonarchiaDaemonorum. It cannot be proved that this T.R was Thomas Rudd but it seems to bequite possible.37 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-343-backlink]. “The Book ofEvil Spirits or Goetia.”38 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-342-backlink]. This grimoirewas one of the components of Agrippa’s Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy. Infact, only two parts of that book were by Agrippa, with the other parts by deAbano, Villanganus, etc. Because of this, many writers have said the obvious:that the whole book is not by Agrippa; but then they have mistakenly taken tocalling it a book by “pseudo-Agrippa.” It would more correctly be referred to asa book “by Agrippa and others.” See Abano, Heptameron.39 [LCBCeremonialMagick03_Book5and6.xhtml#footnote-341-backlink].

Crowley,Magick Without Tears, 204."},{"pageContent":"Book SevenEnochian Magick & Mysticismby Aaron LeitchEnochian magick is a system of angelic skrying (or crystal gazing) that arose inEngland during the early modern era (the time of Shakespeare and King James),between 1581 and about 1583. As a skrying system, it draws much from the largeralmadel (or armandel) tradition, as found in texts such as the Lemegeton(especially the Almadel of Solomon and Pauline Arts), the Grimoire of Armadel,the Book of Abramelin, the Art of Drawing Spirits into Crystals, and manyothers. Meanwhile, it takes much of its form and procedure from earlier systemsof Renaissance angel magick, as found in texts such as Agrippa’s Three Books ofOccult Philosophy, Trithemius’s De Septum Secundeis and Steganographia, the Bookof Soyga, the Arbatel of Magic, the Sworn Book of Honorius, the Key of Solomon,the Heptameron, and many related texts of Western magick and mysticism.Enochian magick focuses upon some of the most exalted angels in theuniverse—those called the Holy Hayyot, who attend directly upon the Throne ofGod. It promises access to the very angels who participated in the creation ofthe universe, including the royal angels of the planets, the zodiac, thealchemical elements, and even the four corners of the earth itself. Perhaps mostfamously, it utilizes a specialized sacred language that the angels proclaimedis their very own native tongue, often erroneously termed Enochian today butoriginally called Angelical. (It was also referred to as the first language ofGod-Christ and even Adamical because it was supposed to be the language Adamused to speak with the angels in Eden.) Because of this, the system hasdeveloped a reputation for being extremely powerful—and dangerous.Since the late 1500s, Enochian magick has been shrouded in deep mystery (and nota little misunderstanding!), yet it has simultaneously had a massive impact onthe entire Western Mystery Tradition. The complex magic squares (wherein areencrypted the names of most of the angels and spirits of the system) havefascinated scholars and intimidated students for centuries. The history ofEnglish and European political intrigue and cloak-and-daggery associated withits reception and development has attracted many historians. And adept magicianshave long attempted to make sense of the material, incorporating aspects of themagick into their own systems.Foremost among these adepts were the founders of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn (1888–1903), especially William Westcott and Samuel Mathers, whoadapted several aspects of Enochian magick into their advancedcurriculum—reserved strictly for “inner order” students. It was then adoptedfrom the Golden Dawn by Aleister Crowley during his brief time in the Order, andsubsequently became part of his Thelemic system. From these sources, portions ofit made their way into Neopaganism as well as most modern systems of Westernoccultism. (If you have ever called the “guardians of the Watchtowers” to open asacred circle, you have experienced the influence of Enochian magick.)_____The Enochian system was first recorded in the journals of Dr. John Dee, adviserand unofficial court-philosopher to Queen Elizabeth I. An accomplished scholarand extremely influential in his political sphere, Dee was consulted by traders,navigators, military leaders, scientists, scholars, spies, and royalty fromwithin England and across Europe. Dee helped form the future British Empire(even coining that term), helping to establish new trade routes and treaties,urging the Queen to capitalize upon the New World and to build her navy,furthering the advancement of science and education in his country, and evensometimes acting secretly on behalf of the Queen while traveling abroad. Laterin his life, he felt he had exhausted all avenues of human knowledge, anddecided to follow in the footsteps of the biblical prophets by seeking celestialwisdom directly from angelic beings.Dee pursued this objective with the help of skryers, as he did not feel he had anatural ability for mediumship. The most successful of them was Edward Kelley, aman of some mystery who had an incredible skrying talent, an excitable temper,and a mysterious past. Kelley would work with Dee for several years, he theskryer and Dee the conjurer, and it was through his crystal gazing that the bulkof what we call Enochian magick and mysticism was transmitted.Dee recorded the sessions in a series of journals that have come to us underseveral titles: A True & Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Years BetweenDr. John Dee … and Some Spirits (published with a preface by Meric Casaubon in1659), The Five Books of the Mysteries (found today as John Dee’s Five Books ofMystery, edited by Joseph Peterson), and Dee’s personal grimoire including theHeptarchia Mystica and the 48 Claves Angelicae (found today as The EnochianMagick of Dr. John Dee by Geoffrey James). More recently, the entirety of thesejournals has been published in two separate updated editions: Dr. John Dee’sSpiritual Diaries by Stephen Skinner and the comprehensive The Mystical Recordsof Dr. John Dee by Kevin Klein.Queen Elizabeth IQueen Elizabeth I (September 7, 1553–March 24, 1603) was the daughter of KingHenry VIII, the monarch who separated from the Catholic Church and founded hisown Protestant Church in England. After his passing, and the closely-followedpassing of his son (Edward VI), then-Princess Elizabeth’s sister Mary came intopossession of the throne. She remained a staunch Catholic, and her reign wasmarked by political and religious turmoil as she attempted to convert the nationback to papal authority. This earned her the title “Bloody Mary,” a name stillfeared today by young people who dread to say her name in dark rooms, lest itevoke her vengeful spirit.During Mary’s reign, John Dee found himself in prison for his offense of castinga horoscope that indicated Elizabeth would make a more fitting queen than Mary.Elizabeth was also imprisoned by her sister, and for much the same reason. Intime, of course, Mary would pass away and Elizabeth would ascend to the throne.She desired to preserve her father’s church, and it was she (more than eitherHenry or Edward) who founded the Church of England as we know it today.Elizabeth was a progressive queen who sought to establish her (then ratherbackwater) kingdom as a true world power, and she enlisted Dr. JohnDee—England’s most renowned astrologer, navigator, scientist, cryptographer, andscholar—as an advisor to this end. Together, Elizabeth and Dee created the“Elizabethan Era” of English history, known for its major cultural andtechnological strides and the colonialist English Empire that would develop toglobal prominence in the generations to come. In countless ways, the modernworld we know today can be traced directly back to the court of Queen ElizabethI and the calculated choices she made.These journals were so complex and densely written (not to mention the fact theywere written in “Shakespearean” English) that, they would remain largelyunexplored for almost four hundred years. What material was adopted from themoften came either from incomplete readings of the journals or from secondarysources entirely. (For example, the Golden Dawn were unaware of much of theHeptarchia Mystica when they formed their version of the Enochian system.) Itwould not be until the turn of the millennium (aided greatly by the advent ofthe internet) that Enochian students would come together and decipher theentirety of Dee’s original system. I have presented my own efforts in thisregard in my books The Angelical Language, Volumes I and II, and The EssentialEnochian Grimoire.Enochian Magick, from Dee to the Golden DawnThere are two primary areas of study in modern Enochiana, which have been termedDee purist and neo-Enochian. Dee purism is defined by the study of Dee’soriginal skrying records, along with the Renaissance source material from whichthe man himself drew information (such as the Solomonic grimoires).When the Golden Dawn formulated their recension of the system in the latenineteenth century, they had access to very limited resources. Either they hadto work from secondhand sources, such as the sensationalized A True & FaithfulRelation and a later document called Book H (which we will discuss later), orthey had to sit alone in a British Library reading room and pore over Dee’shandwritten journals with no help from other scholars. This would have beenoverwhelming for any researcher.The result of these limitations meant that Mathers and Westcott did nottranscribe the Enochian material exactly as Dee had recorded it. Instead, theymerely drew the elements from Dee’s material that most appealed to them, andapplied those elements to the systems of magick they were already developing.What they created bears little relationship to Dee’s magick—it has a differentintent and exists within an entirely different (i.e., Victorian) context.Students of the modern Hermetic traditions have assumed Dee left behind littlemore than the skeletal framework of a system, which the Golden Dawn “fleshedout” into a comprehensive magical practice. However, the truth is that Dee didindeed record a complete system of Renaissance-style angel magick in hisjournals.Meanwhile, the Golden Dawn adaptation of Enochiana is just as valid as what wefind in Dee’s original journals. Even if Mathers and Westcott adopted someincorrect information into the Order’s system, that information has now had thebetter part of 150 years of practical application to become legitimate in itsown right.In this chapter we will discuss the evolution of Enochian magick from Dee’sjournals to the early Golden Dawn. We will see how the G. D. system was foundedupon a mysterious Enochian document that predates the Order. And, with any luck,you will come away from this with a firm grasp of the differences between Deepurism and neo-Enochiana.The Enochian TraditionBefore we can understand Dee’s system of angel magick, it is first necessary toplace it in its proper context. And to do that, I will need to demystify twopoints in particular: (1) the proper meaning of the term Enochian itself, and(2) the true identity of the so-called “Enochian” angels.First, the term Enochian is not the proper name of Dee’s magical system. It isnot “Enochian magick,” nor does it incorporate an “Enochian language.” Nowherein Dee’s journals does he ever use these terms for the system he was recording.In fact, the term Enochian is properly defined as “of or pertaining to thebiblical prophet Enoch.”The true Enochian tradition dates back to at least 600 BCE, during the HebrewCaptivity in Babylon. Scholars consider this the likely time and place where theoldest apocryphal text was written: the “Ethiopic” Book of Enoch (aka 1 Enoch).In Dee’s lifetime, this was known as a long-lost biblical text, but it wasrediscovered in an Ethiopic Orthodox Christian Bible in the early seventeenthcentury. This is the book that contains the famous myth of the Watchers andtheir fall from God’s grace, and the rise of the Nephilim (against whom theGreat Deluge of the Old Testament was sent), and also records the spiritualjourneys of the prophet Enoch himself through the seven Heavens.As part of his celestial tour, Enoch was shown the famous Tablets of Heaven:celestial records of all things in the universe. Hebrew tradition has oftencalled these tablets the Sepher Raziel (Book of the Secrets of God—not to beconfused with the Jewish grimoires that borrow its name), and Christiantradition has called them the Book of Life or Book of the Lamb, wherein arerecorded the names of all the saved. (We encounter this book in the Revelationof St. John, chapter 5, where it is sealed with seven seals that cannot bebroken by anyone but Christ.)Enoch himself was allowed to transcribe 366 books worth of the informationcontained in the Celestial Tablets. These Enochian books were then passed downthrough his family until they reached Noah. Noah supposedly found theinstructions for the Ark within them, but then the books were lost during theDeluge.In the earliest days of Christianity, the Book of Enoch (that is, 1 Enoch) wasextremely influential. The text seems to have had a direct impact on severalbooks of the New Testament itself, not to mention the writings of many of theChurch Fathers. (For a wonderful discussion of this subject, see theintroduction to The Book of Enoch the Prophet, translated by Richard Laurence.)In fact, before Christianity became the official Roman religion, the Book ofEnoch was included in the canon of many local churches’ Bibles. And to this dayit remains part of the canon of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox TewahedoChurches.Unfortunately, in the rest of the Western world, 1 Enoch was driven literallyunderground by Church authorities who classified it as apocryphal at best andheretical at worst, and thus it was excluded from the Bible. It effectivelyvanished from the world for several hundred years. However, the story containedin the book was much harder to destroy, and the Enochian legend continued tospread throughout the world, capturing the interest of both Jewish and Christianscholars and mystics for centuries. There were even two attempts to write newversions of the text, called the Hebrew Book of Enoch (or 2 Enoch) and theSlavonic Book of Enoch (or 3 Enoch). Yet it is the story first told in 1 Enochthat has always defined the Enochian tradition.During the lifetimes of Dee and Kelley, the Book of Enoch was still lost, andits legend was still popular among European mystics. According to his journals,Dee asked an angel if he could be allowed to read the famous scripture. Theangels eventually obliged him in this regard, but not as he likely expected.What the angels brought to Dee was not 1 Enoch or one of the otherapocrypha—instead they brought the Celestial Tablets that Enoch had transcribed,the Book of the Lamb itself, which Dee’s angels referred to as the Book of theSpeech from God. It was the arrival of these tablets, and everything thatfollowed after them, that make Dee’s journals part of the true—ancient—Enochiantradition.The Enochian AngelsSo who were these entities Dee and Kelley were speaking with? If you have doneany research into the subject, you have undoubtedly encountered the assertionthat Dee had discovered an entirely unique host of entities. And while there isa small kernel of truth to this, the statement is vastly misleading. Some haveeven gone so far as to insist they were not angels at all, but beings of adifferent sort who simply lied to Dee and Kelley about their true nature. Not afew students have begun to refer to them as “the Enochians,” dropping the termangels entirely. And just a few, thankfully small in number, have gone so far asto suggest Dee was in contact with aliens from another planet or dimension!Dee’s angelic journals begin on December 22, 1581, somewhat before he met EdwardKelley and while he still employed a medium by the name of Barnabas Saul. Saulsat before a shewstone (aka a crystal ball) and gazed into its depths while Deerecited prayers in a nearby prayer room. After a while, an angelic entityappeared in the stone and began to speak with the men. When asked to identifyitself, the angel gave its name as Annael.Annael (sometimes spelled with a single n) is an archangel well known ingrimoiric literature as the angel of Venus. She appears as such in theHeptameron with her fellow planetary archangels (Figure 1[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119]).Cassiel (Saturn)Sachiel (Jupiter)Samael (Mars)Michael (Sol)An(n)ael (Venus)Raphael (Mercury)Gabriel (Luna)Figure 1. Archangels of the Seven PlanetsThese seven archangels are the chief governors of the entire universe, and theyhave appeared under different names and in different forms throughout biblicaland biblio-mystical literature. In nearly all cases they are considered thearchangels of the seven ancient planets, the seven days of the week, and theseven circles of Heaven.The next question we must ask is why this particular angel chose to appear inthe shewstone. Annael was not merely a random member of the seven highestarchangels but is described by Dee as the “Chief Governor General of this greatperiod.” The meaning behind this obscure phrase is not found in the Heptameronbut within another popular mystical text of the time,: the Arbatel of Magic.The Arbatel is a very simple and eloquent grimoire from the late 1500s,outlining an occult philosophy based upon the sacred number seven. The SevenSpirits of God appear here as well, after a fashion—called in this case theseven “Olympian Spirits.” Just like the archangels of the Heptameron, theOlympian Spirits are planetary in nature, so that each holds power over aspecific astrological category of life.Most importantly, these “spirits” are described as successive governors of theworld. All of them hold the same authority, but each of them assumes the role ofchief of the group for an “age” of 490 years (or 7 times 70). According to thetext, the spirit of Saturn began his rule in 60 BCE, giving way to the spiritsof Jupiter, Mars, and Sol in their turn. Beginning in 1411 CE, the spirit ofVenus (named Hagith) took control and would rule until 1900 CE. Therefore,Hagith was in charge when the Arbatel was written, as well as when Dee performedhis séances.Thus, it is hardly surprising that Dee’s very first angelic contact was not onlyone of the seven archangels but specifically the “Chief Governor General of thisgreat period” as set forth in the Arbatel—the angel of Venus. Dee had merelyapplied the philosophy of the Arbatel to the seven archangels of the Heptameron,preferring beings more familiar to a devout Christian. Not only were theOlympian Spirits more obscure and lacking in biblical justification, but thevery term Olympian lent them a dangerously Pagan connotation. Thus, Deeencountered Annael rather than Hagith. (Today, since 1900, the ruling archangelshould be that of Mercury: Raphael.)At this point, we are still discussing the first entry of Dee’s Five Books, onDecember 22, 1581. Annael tells Dee and Saul how to proceed in further séances,and describes herself as the current governor set over the four principalarchangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. These four are considered equal(or even greater) in power to the seven planetary archangels, being set over thefour classical elements, the four zodiacal triplicities, and the four quartersof the world. Three of the four (Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael) are justified bydirect mention in the canonical Bible, and legend holds that Michael and Gabrielactually sit at the right and left hands of God. Annael promises that Dee willreceive audience with these angels, particularly Michael, and then swears neverto appear again.The journals do not pick up again until the following March (1582), when a SirEdward Talbot (aka Kelley) first appears as Dee’s medium. As a test of Kelley’sabilities, Dee set out to have him skry the angel Anchor—one of a group of threeangels (Anchor, Anachor, and Anilos) mentioned in some obscure occult literatureof the time. Dee used the same methods of invocation he had employed with Saul,which soon resulted in the appearance of an angel. However, this angel was notAnchor. When asked to identify itself, the being in the shewstone claimed to benone other than the archangel Uriel.Sir Edward KelleySir Edward Kelley (or Kelly, August 1, 1555–1598) is a mysterious figure in thediaries of Dr. John Dee. While legend has often held him to be a con artist orcriminal, the historical record is not so clear. He was first introduced to JohnDee as “Edward Talbot,” and much speculation on his origins or true identity hasbeen explored. (It has even been suggested, not unconvincingly, that he may havebeen a spy sent into Dee’s household by the Catholic Church.)Most of what we actually know of Kelley comes from Dee’s journals, but recentyears have seen the translation of several documents, originally in the Czechlanguage, that not only continue Kelley’s story where Dee left off but alsocontradict the more popular legends. We know for certain that Kelley wasintroduced to Dee as a professional skryer, an occupation more common then thanit is today. Indeed, the journals prove Kelley was an excellent skryer, perhapsone of the best in history. He skryed the angels for Dee (who did not himselfpossess the Sight) for several hours a day, every single day, for several years.During this time, he traveled across Europe with Dee, stopping in severalcountries along the way to engage in prophecy via the angels as well asalchemical experiments.Kelley claimed to possess the secret of transmuting lead into gold, and duringtheir time in Prague, he left Dee’s employ to take the position of CourtAlchemist to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II. Years later, Dee would reportKelley had died from a broken leg after an attempt to escape imprisonment byRudolph. However, the recently translated Czech documents have presented adifferent story: wherein Kelley—having obtained a baronship (from which Englishauthors have not quite accurately entitled him “Sir”) and several mines from theemperor—actually lived a respectable life, had children, and passed away indignity.In classical magical literature, Uriel often plays the role of intermediaryspirit—evoked not only for divination purposes but also to bring other spiritsto the circle for questioning. This is exactly the role he takes in Dee’sjournals: introducing the men to the other three principal archangels, each ofwhom would be in charge of transmitting some specific aspect of the magicalsystem. Over the hundreds of pages that follow, it is Uriel who appears to bemaster of the séances. He would open and close the sessions and bring otherbeings into the stone, and, if the men failed in some way, upsetting the angels,it was most often Uriel who halted the sessions to chastise them.The first archangel Uriel brought to the stone was Michael (as promised byAnnael), whose primary job seems to have been to reveal the magical furnitureand equipment needed for the remainder of the work. Later came Raphael, whotransmitted the entire text of the Book of the Speech from God in the form offorty-nine tables, and was therefore the first to reveal some form of the famousAngelical language. After him came Gabriel, who was in charge of thetransmission of the forty-eight Angelical Keys that promised to unlock themysteries of Raphael’s holy book.So now that we have established that Dee and Kelley were indeed talking totraditional Western angels, and that they were in fact receiving a system ofangel magick, let’s take a look at the system itself.Dee’s Enochian System—An OverviewDee and Kelley’s angelic magick came in three interrelated phases:1. The first phase was concerned primarily with the magical furniture and toolsthat should be used when summoning angels, as well as methods for summoning ahost of angels (called the Heptarchia—rulership of seven) under the charge ofthe seven planetary archangels.2. The second phase centered on the Book of the Speech from God and the magickthat could be worked through it.3. The third and final phase centered on the Great Table of the Earth and itshierarchy of angels that could be contacted to influence the physical world.Unfortunately, many Enochian scholars have presented these three phases ascompletely unrelated. However, Dee’s journals do not present the material inthat fashion. Each phase was given by the angels as the primer for the nextphase, and the older information was always the basis for what would come later.Thus, what we find in the records is a single comprehensive system of angelmagick. And even though Dee certainly had a penchant for cryptography andcomplex magic squares, the system he recorded is not so far removed from otherexamples of Medieval and Renaissance angel magick.Phase One: The HeptarchiaAfter Annael gave Dee and Kelley over to the four archangels, Michael assumedthe role of primary instructor. He delivered the designs for the Holy Table(Figure 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor120]), the Seal ofthe True God (often shortened to Seal of Truth—Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121]), the seven Ensigns ofCreation (Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128]–Figure 16[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134]), the Holy Lamen(Figure 4 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor122]), and theRing of Solomon (Figure 5[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123]).[image/Book7_Fig2.png]Figure 2. The Holy Table:The top of the Holy Table of Practice. Made ofsweetwood, three-feet square, painted with consecrated goldor yellow paint. It has to be elevated off the floor byfour wax tablets bearing the Seal of the True God upon them.[image/Book7_Fig3.png]Figure 3. The Seal of the True God:The Seal of the True God (aka the Seal of Truth).Made of pure beeswax. A larger one was placed uponthe Holy Table, and four smaller versions were placedbeneath the table’s legs.[image/Book7_Fig4.png]Figure 4. The Holy Lamen:The Holy Lamen is made on plain paperand carried hidden away in a cloth.[image/Book7_Fig5.png]Figure 5. The Ring of Solomon:The Ring of Solomon, delivered by the Archangel Michael.It must be made of pure gold.[image/HolyTable-Redraw.png]Figure 6. The Holy Table Set Up:The Holy Table set up, with the Seal of the True Godand Ensigns of Creation. This table would have stood upona red silk cloth, with four smaller Seals of the True Godbeneath its legs, and the whole covered with multicolored silk.In recent years, it has been established that several of these tools areadaptations of tools already found in older grimoires. For example, the designof the Seal of the True God can be found in several sources, the primary onebeing Liber Juratus (Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor125]).[image/Book7_Fig7.png]Figure 7. Liber Juratus Seal:An early form of the Seal of the True God, appearing in Liber Juratus.Even the construction of the seal appears to be derived from older sources. Itis fashioned from beeswax and is the central focal-point where the angels willappear. (If you happen to use a crystal or other object for skrying, it would beplaced upon the seal.) Compare this to descriptions in the Book of Abramelin ofa “seven-sided tablet of wax,” and of the Almadel of Solomon (found in theLemegeton), which is also a beeswax tablet carved with magical names—both ofwhich are used to skry angelic entities (Figure 8[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126]).Plus, as you can see, the design found on the top of Dee’s Holy Table is alsoheavily influenced by the Almadel. One might go so far as to suggest the Seal ofthe True God and Holy Table, together, form an Enochian version of the Almadelitself.[image/Book7_Fig8.png]Figure 8. Almadel of Solomon:The Almadel of Solomon, found in the Lemegeton.Its design is similar to the Holy Table,and it is made of beeswax, like the Seal of Truth.At the same time, we can also see similarities between the Holy Table and theTable of Practice from the Lemegeton’s Pauline Arts (Figure 9[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127]).[image/Book7_Fig9.png]Figure 9. The Pauline Arts Table of Practice:Note its similarity to the Holy Table design.Of course, some of the Enochian tools are unique to Dee’s system. The designs ofthe Ring of Solomon and the Holy Lamen have no obvious precursors, though bothof them (with very different designs) have their origins in Solomonic magick.The Seven Ensigns of Creation (Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128]–Figure 16[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134]), associated directlywith the planetary archangels listed in the Heptameron, are also original to theEnochian system:[image/Book7_Fig10.png]Figure 10: The Ensign of Venus and Annael[image/Book7_Fig11.png]Figure 11. The Ensign of Sol and Michael[image/Book7_Fig12.png]Figure 12. The Ensign of Mars and Samael[image/Book7_Fig13.png]Figure 13. The Ensign of Jupiter and Sachiel[image/Book7_Fig14.png]Figure 14. The Ensign of Mercury and Raphael[image/Book7_Fig15.png]Figure 15. The Ensign of Saturn and Cassiel[image/Book7_Fig16.png]Figure 16. The Ensign of Luna and GabrielDee’s records contain no indication the Enochian tools and furniture arerestricted for use with the angels described in his journals. In fact, they areintended for use in the summoning of absolutely any angelic entity. However, thetools draw their symbolism primarily from the Heptarchic angels. They embody allmystical considerations of the holy number seven, including the seven planets,the seven days of the week, and—most importantly—the seven biblical days ofCreation.There are forty-nine principal angels in this hierarchy, divided into sevengroups of seven—a King, Prince, and five Governors for each planet/day of theweek. All of the Angelical letters inscribed on the Enochian tools are from thenames of these Heptarchic angels, with the exception of the Seal of the TrueGod, which uses two sets of Qabalistic names that are related to the Heptarchia,but does not utilize Angelical characters. We will discuss these other namesshortly.The Heptarchic angels are unique to Dee’s system. Their names are decrypted froma set of seven 7 × 7 tables revealed by Michael, called the Tabula Collecta(Figure 17 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135]).[image/Book7_Fig17.png]Figure 17. Tabula Collecta:The seven tables of the bonorum (good) angels.Though it is never elaborated on in the journals, these seven tables wereassigned certain virtues:Table 1: Wit and WisdomTable 2: Exaltation and Government of PrincesTable 3: Prevailing in Council and over NobilityTable 4: Trade and Merchandise, and WaterTable 5: Qualities of EarthTable 6: Knowledge of Air and all who move in itTable 7: Governance of FirePresumably, any one of these tables can be used as a talisman to learn about orinvoke the virtues embodied in the table. There are also angels named in eachone, such as Murifri (see Table 3 in the Tabula Collecta, sixth line down), whoappeared to counsel Dee and Kelley during their own skrying sessions.Dee was next instructed to decrypt these seven tables into the round TabulaBonorum, which illustrates the names of forty-nine Heptarchic angels divided bytheir planetary attributions (Figure 18[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor143]).[image/Book7_Fig18.png]Figure 18. Tabula Bonorum:The round table of the Heptarchia.Each planet is subdivided into seven sub-planets, so that (for example) the Kingof Friday (Baligon) is the angel of Venus of Venus. His Prince (Bagenol) is theangel of Luna of Venus. The five Governors, then, are the angels of Saturn,Mercury, Jupiter, Mars, and Sol of Venus, respectively.Beyond this, Dee and Kelley were also taught how to decrypt from the TabulaBonorum the names of forty-two Ministers for each planet. They are divided intosix groups of seven Ministers, and each group is active for four hours of theday ruled by their planet. In a series of visions, Dee and Kelley were given thevarious functions of these Ministers, most of them having power of variousforces of nature, such as weather, metals, and the elements, as well as commandover evil spirits, the rise and fall of kings, etc. Their names are alsoimportant in the creation of the talismans used to summon the King or Prince (orpresumably one of the five Governors) of a given planet.The entire Heptarchy, at least in Dee’s time, was governed by the King andPrince of Venus (Baligon and Bagenol). When acting in this capacity, the Kingtakes the name/title of King Carmara, and the Prince that of Hagonel. Though itis never mentioned in the journals, I suspect the ruling King and Prince shouldchange when the ruling archangel changes over. In Dee’s time the rulingarchangel was Annael. If we follow the 490-year rule from the Arbatel, thenRaphael should be in charge now, making the King and Prince of Mercury (Bnaspoland Blisdon) the rulers of the Heptarchia. Unfortunately, we are not told ifthey should take on the same titles as the previous rulers or if they have theirown unique titles.Finally, we must return to the Seal of the True God once more, in order todiscuss the hierarchy of angels found upon it. The seal (pictured in Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121]) is covered in namesthat appear to be from the Angelical language, but they are, in fact, encryptedversions of Hebrew Qabalistic names.Seven Secret Names of GodFirst, consider the seven Names of God written upon the outermost heptagon ofthe Seal of the True God. The names were given to Dee via the table shown inFigure 19 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144].While these Names of God appear quite alien, they are not from the Angelical.They are actually compiled from the Hebrew names of the seven archangels of theTree of Life from Binah to Yesod—traditionally known as the “seven spirits whostand before God” (Revelation 4:5). Starting in the upper-left corner of thetable and reading downward, we find: Zaphkiel, Zedekiel, Cumael (a form ofKamael), Raphael, Haniel, Michael, and Gabriel. The final cell is occupied by anequal-armed cross, representing the earth. (The same cross appears in the verycenter of the seal.)Seven Unpronounceable Names of GodJust within the outer heptagon of the Seal of the True God are seven furtherNames of God, which the angels said were “unpronounceable.” They were also givento Dee via a table, as seen in Figure 20[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145].We can clearly see why these names are unpronounceable, because several of thecharacters are actually numbers with dots beneath them. However, these oddcharacters do in fact represent letters taken from the outer circumference ofthe seal: 21/8 = El; 8, 26, and 30 = L—which is a Name of God both in Hebrew(El) and Angelical (L).[image/Book7_Fig19.png]Figure 19. Table of the Seven Sephirothic Archangels:These names appear in the outermost heptagonof the Seal of the True God.Meanwhile, pronounceable Hebrew angel names can be decrypted from this table.These are simply the Hebrew names of the seven planets with “-el” appended.Beginning again at the upper left corner of the table, but this time reading theletters in downward-left diagonal lines, we find the names of the sevenplanetary angels: Sabathiel, Zedekieil (a corruption of Zedekiel), Madimiel,Semeliel (a corruption of Semeshiel), Nogahel, Corabiel (a corruption ofKokabiel), and Levanael. These angels directly govern the planetary spheres inthe realm of Assiah (the physical world). Their names appear decrypted at thevery center of the Seal of the True God, surrounding the cross of the Earth.Figure 20. Table of the Seven Planetary Archangels:[image/Book7_Fig20.png]These names appear just inside the outermost heptagonof the Seal of the True God.The rest of the angelic names that fill the seal are derived from the same tableof planetary ruling angels, each name found by reading the table diagonally in adifferent direction. These angels are known today as the Family of Light—theSons, Daughters, Sons of Sons, and Daughters of Daughters of Light. The exactplace of these angels in the Heptarchic hierarchy is not entirely clear, exceptthey are mentioned once in Dee’s journals as ministering directly to theHeptarchic royalty. It also happens that some of the most famous of Dee’sangels—who were of primary importance in the transmission of later phases of themagick—are found here, such as Ave, Madimi, and Illemese.The Heptarchic system is not overly complex. If it has a reputation for beingdifficult to understand, it is only due to the magic squares and the methodsused to decipher the angel’s names from them. However, those decryption methodsare not necessary in the practice of the magick—since all the names are alreadydecrypted for us.The actual practice of the system is also very straightforward, and not at allunlike other systems of Renaissance angel magick. It has a relationship to theHeptameron via the seven archangels, and the entire system has a strongrelationship to the Arbatel of Magic. Not only do the archangels successivelygovern the cosmos as the Arbatel describes for the Olympian Spirits, but theoccult philosophy described in the Arbatel’s “49 Aphorisms” can be considered anecessary primer for Dee’s Heptarchic magick.To summon a Heptarchic angel, you need the tools and furniture alreadydescribed. The Holy Table and five copies of the Seal of Truth must becreated—four small seals beneath the legs of the table, and a larger seal on itstop, all covered with a multicolored silk cloth. (The multicolor representsMercury, the planet associated with evocation and communication.) The SevenEnsigns of Creation can be fashioned of purified tin and arrayed upon the HolyTable, or painted upon it with consecrated gold or yellow oil paint.You must also make talismans for the King and Prince you wish to contact, aswell as one displaying the names of the forty-two Ministers who serve underthem. As you sit at the Holy Table, the talisman of the royal angel is held inyour hand and the talisman of the Ministers is placed beneath your feet.Invocations for the Kings and Princes are provided in Dee’s journals, and as yourecite them, the requested angel should appear over the Seal of Truth.Missing Pieces?It has been stated in many Enochian studies that information vital to Dee’ssystem is missing from the records (often blamed on a maid who found Dee’sjournals many years after his passing and, ignorant of their importance, usedseveral pages to drain pies). However, much less information is missing that youmight assume, and while there are some bits missing or simply passed overwithout comment in Dee’s journals, none of it strikes me as vital to working themagick.If there is a major piece of the system missing, it would be a peculiar “globe”that is mentioned once or twice by Dee but is never illustrated in the survivingjournals. (The references suggest it was originally in the record.) According toDee, the globe is a diagram from which letters can be drawn for Heptarchictalismans. Atop the globe was the figure of King Carmara. Within the globe werethe names of the seven Heptarchic Kings, along with certain characters that werelikely the sigils of the Family of Light angels. (Thankfully, these sigils arenot missing, as Dee preserved them elsewhere in his journals.) There were alsofurther letters and numbers attached in some way to the names of the Kings—someof them written forward and some backward. Those letters, sadly, have indeedbeen lost.[image/Book7_Fig21.png]Figure 21. Dee’s Heptarchia TalismanFigure 21 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor146] is an exampleof a Heptarchic talisman as drawn by Dee for one of the Kings. In the center isthe sigil of the Family of Light angel that directly serves the King. The nameof the King is written around the sigil, and further letters (some forward, somebackward) are written in the outermost circumference.Personally, I would love to have that globe diagram so that the talismans forthe remaining Kings and Princes could be properly fashioned. However, I alsofirmly believe that if that information was vital to the system, the angelswould have made sure it survived for us. At the very least, Dee would haveprovided it in his personal grimoire (which still survives), but there is nomention of it there. As it stands, we have the necessary sigils for the Familyof Light angels associated with the Kings. All we are truly missing are thepeculiar letters that should go into the outer circumferences of theirtalismans. However, I see no reason why the talismans should not work withoutthem.Phase Two: The Book of the Speech from God and GebofalOnce Dee had received the Heptarchia Mystica, the archangel Michael gave way toRaphael, who revealed the true heart and soul of the system: the holy Book ofthe Speech from God. In Angelical, its title is Loagaeth (pronounced “logah”).Emperor RudolphRudolph II (July 18, 1552–January 20, 1612) was the king of Croatia, Hungary,and Bohemia and the archduke of Austria who ascended to the position of HolyRoman Emperor in 1576. However, he was unique among emperors for his generallack of interest in politics or asserting the power of his position. He is oftenregarded as being disinterested in his imperial role and duties. Instead, hechose to keep largely to himself, and turned most of his attention to art,mysticism, alchemy, and occultism.As Dee and Kelley received the angelic communications during their travelsacross Europe, including a prolonged stay in Krakow with would-be benefactorLord or Prince Albert Lasky, the angels urged them to go to Rudolph’s court inPrague in order to present their work to him. Lasky, however, never funded theirtravel, so the two men journeyed to Prague on their own. Sadly, when Dee finallyreceived an audience with the illusive emperor, the monarch seemed to beunimpressed with Dee’s journals— and even less impressed with Dee’s prophetic“messages from God.” He seems to have mostly ignored the two men during theirstay in Prague, that is, until Kelley reportedly had some success with hisalchemical formulas for transmuting base metals into gold.Dee returned to England, but Kelley remained and became an alchemist inRudolph’s court. Whether or not Kelley was very successful in this role isunknown, though we do know that Rudolph appointed him a baronship and gave himseveral silver mines, and Kelley lived out the rest of his life in Prague as arespected member of society. While Rudolph’s disinterest in politics led many tosee him as an ineffectual ruler, today we know his chosen focus on the arts andhumanities not only led to a mini-Renaissance in his own kingdom, but in factsparked the Scientific Revolution that would spread across the globe in thecenturies after his passing.Now, you already know what the Book of Loagaeth was supposed to be—the CelestialTablets of Enoch, the seven-sealed Book of Life, the true Sepher Raziel. Itconsists of forty-nine individual tables (that is, 7 × 7), most of which have a49 × 49 grid on the front and back. The grids are filled with letters thatpurport to be a new biblical doctrine: just as the New Testament was to the OldTestament, and the Quran was to the New Testament, so was the Book of Loagaeth abrand new Testament, which the angels promised would rectify all current faithsand reconcile them with one another. The angels promised that the redelivery ofthis new doctrine into the world (remember, it was once given to Enoch, but thenrevoked at the time of the Deluge) signaled the initiation of the End Timesdescribed in the Revelation of St. John. The new doctrine was supposed to spreadaround the earth for a time, and then the final Armageddon would take place.The only problem was the book was written entirely in the Angelical tongue, andthe angels provided no translation for the text. This new doctrine was neverintended to be preached from pulpits to the ignorant masses—instead, it was onlyto be understood by those mystics who learned how to unlock the mysteries of thebook and receive the teachings directly from the angels.To this end, forty-eight of the tables (numbers 2–49) were given keys with whichto open them. Dee was told the first table belonged to the Christos (that is,the Logos) and could not be opened by human or angel. (Again, reference theRevelation of St. John, chapter 5, and the opening of the Seals of the Book.)As for the keys that open the remaining forty-eight tables of Loagaeth, they arecalled the forty-eight Angelical Callings. These are a series of poeticinvocations written entirely in Angelical, which serve to summon the angelsassociated with their assigned tables.The system given by the angels for the proper use of both Loagaeth and its Keyswas called Gebofal (a word that was never translated), as revealed by angelsdirectly subservient to the archangel Gabriel. Gebofal appears to be aChristianized version of a Jewish practice called “counting the Omer,” whichinvolves the Qabalistic fifty Gates of Binah (Understanding). Therefore, I willtake just a moment to explain the Jewish tradition first.An Omer is a measurement of wheat. Counting the Omer is a fifty-day mysticalobservance prescribed in the Torah, in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, and isassociated with the festival of Passover. It gets its name from a passage inLeviticus 23:15–16:You shall count for yourselves—from the day after the Sabbath, from the daywhen you bring the Omer of the waving—seven Sabbaths, they shall becomplete. Until the day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count, fifty day.We find the instruction again in Deuteronomy 16:9–10:You shall count for yourselves seven weeks, from when the sickle is first put tothe standing crop shall you begin counting seven weeks. Then you will observethe Festival of Shavu’ot for the Lord, your God.The meaning behind this seven-week observance is found in the story of theExodus. After the Passover event in Egypt, the Hebrew people began their journeyinto the wilderness. The next fifty days were not easy for them—they werepursued by the Pharaoh’s army, nearly trapped on the shores of the Red Sea, andstill had to endure weeks of travel through the hostile desert with little cluewhere they were supposed to go or how they were expected to survive. On thefiftieth day they arrived at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the TenCommandments and formalized their Covenant with God.Counting the Omer is both a religious observance of the Exodus and a mysticalpractice that recreates the event on a spiritual level. On the day afterPassover, the mystic must remove himself from the world of man (symbolized byEgypt). As you may know, when you attempt to do this, the “Egyptians” tend topursue you and attempt to drag you back. You also face inner obstacles to yourprogress—you must pass through the sea of your own subconscious habits andendure a frightening spiritual wilderness of the unknown.Over the fifty-day process, the mystic must perform meditations aimed atremoving himself from the earthly fifty Gates of Impurity, thereby entering thecorresponding celestial Gates of Understanding. These celestial Gates aredefined by the Tree of Life (Figure 22[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor147]): each of the lowerseven sephiroth are divided into seven Gates—so we have (for example) the Gateof Chesed of Chesed, Gevurah of Chesed, Tiphareth of Chesed, Netzach of Chesed,Yesod of Chesed, and Malkuth of Chesed. Each Gate represents one aspect of God,specifically as illustrated in the Old Testament by some event involving one ofthe biblical prophets. To continue with Chesed as an example, its seven Gatescorrespond to Abraham, who was shown Mercy when the angel stopped him fromsacrificing his son Isaac. Each of the seven Gates within Chesed is entered bymeditating on the lessons taught by one biblical story or another involvingAbraham.The Jewish mystic begins the counting of the Omer by meditating on Chesed ofChesed and moving downward through the Gates, one per day, until reachingMalkuth of Malkuth on the forty-ninth day. By opening the forty-nine Gates ofthe lower seven sephiroth, the mystic has opened all of the Gates that leaddirectly to Binah. However, he is not permitted to open the final Gate becauseit lies within the pure divinity of the Supernals. That Gate can only be openedfrom the other side—it was opened once to let Moses pass through, and it willnot open again until the Messiah does so during the End Times. (Later Christianvariations on this system insist that the Gate also opened once to let Jesusascend into Heaven.) Therefore, counting the Omer is not about entering thesphere of Binah. It is about opening all the Gates between us and the Supernalsso that divine revelations and insight can filter down to us—symbolized inExodus by reaching Mount Sinai and receiving the Ten Commandments.Now, in this light, let us consider the practice of Gebofal. The Book ofLoagaeth begins with the table of the Christos/Logos, which embodies the initialcreative impulse of the universe. As we read in the first chapter of the Book ofJohn:In the Beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos wasGod. […] All things were made by him.[image/Book7_Fig22.png]Figure 22. Tree of Life with the Fifty GatesThe next eighteen tables (that is, tables 2–19) embody the first six days ofCreation, as evidenced by the poetry of the Angelical Callings used to openthem. Each Call describes the creation of some aspect of the universe and God’sestablishment of angels to govern each one. There is also much apocalypticimagery in the poetry, which seems to highlight the part that all of theseruling angels will play in the End Times.Finally, the remaining thirty tables, which are all opened by the same Call usedover and over, appear to represent the Seventh Day of Creation—meaning theyembody the completed universe in the here and now. The angels explained thatthese represent thirty heavenly spheres—called Aethyrs (or Ethers)—that reachfrom God to Earth. The angels that reside within each Aethyr are the spiritualgovernors of specific geographical regions, called “Parts of the Earth,” whichwe will return to shortly.Taken as a set, the forty-nine tables of Loagaeth appear to represent thevarious astrological and elemental forces of the cosmos, beginning with thehighest divine principal in the first table, and progressing downward until thephysical Earth is reached in the forty-ninth table. Dee’s angels often referredto the tables as the Gates of Understanding, or the Gates of Wisdom—both ofwhich are references to the Supernal Realm where we find Binah (Understanding)and Chokmah (Wisdom).Gebofal is a forty-nine-day process by which the aspirant moves downward fromthe highest point attainable by humans (table 2) until reaching the physicalworld once again (table 49). All of the Enochian skrying tools and furniturefrom the Heptarchia must be used, because the recitation of the AngelicalCallings should result in the appearance of spiritual teachers who will expoundupon the mysteries within the untranslated text of each table. The angels alsosuggested to Dee that he might enter the Gates of Understanding to make astralvisits to the angelic cities within them, much as Enoch himself had done.On each day, three times a day, the aspirant must open the Holy Book to theproper table, recite the Prayer of Enoch (as provided in Dee’s records), andfollow that with the Angelical Call associated with the table. What happens fromthat point would be strictly between the aspirant and the angels who arrive atthe Call. The final table will be opened on the forty-eighth day, and upon theforty-ninth day the aspirant should receive direct revelations from God.The Parts of the Earth are not addressed in the Gebofal practice, but insteadappear to represent the kind of occult wisdom that can be obtained through thepractice. And so, for that matter, is the Great Table of the Earth that Deewould receive in the next phase of the angels’ teachings. In fact, the Parts ofthe Earth and the Great Table are directly connected.Phase Three: The Great Table of the Earth or WatchtowersWhen the Parts of the Earth system was revealed, it also began to reveal Dee’strue motivation for wanting the magick in the first place. Everything up to thatpoint had been very lofty and spiritual. However, Dee was absolutely dedicatedto the notion that England was God’s Kingdom here on Earth and that an EnglishEmpire should rightfully arise and rule the world. Remember that Dee is famousas England’s first spy—because he regularly operated covertly on behalf of theQueen while visiting other countries. His reputation as a doddering old wizard,traveling around with a shady alchemist, was the perfect cover.The Parts of the Earth system promised to give Dee direct influence over thetutelary zodiacal angels who governed every country in the known world. It alsopromised to allow his skryer to remotely view what was going on in thosecountries, and any secrets they were hiding. All he had to do was recite the Keyof the Aethyrs, inserting the name of the particular Aethyr he wished to invoke,and the corresponding Gate would be open to him.Each Aethyr encompasses three Parts of the Earth—except for the lowest one,which encompasses four, plus there is an extra “hidden” Part—making for a totalof ninety-two Parts of the Earth. Each of these were given a name exactly sevenletters long (Figure 23[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor148]).[image/Book7_Fig23.png]Figure 23. The Great Table of the Earth Showing the Ninety-Two Parts:The names of the ninety-two Parts of the Earth are arrangedaccording to this diagram, to create a massive tabletwenty-five cells across and twenty-seven cells downward.And this is the origin of the famous Great Table of the Earth (Figure 24[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor149]). The names of theninety-two Parts are all arranged into a magical table in the peculiar fashionyou see here. The resulting Great Table is, itself, divided into four quarterscalled the Watchtowers.[image/Book7_Fig24.png]Figure 24. The Great Table of the EarthThis is the Great Table of the Earth as Dee received it. The angels explainedthis diagram to Dee and Kelley as follows: where the Parts of the Earth, takenindividually, will grant you influence over specific areas of the world—namely,over nations—the Great Table gives you influence over entire quarters of theplanet.From the descriptions in the journals, it would appear that these “quarters” aremore geopolitical than directional. From Dee’s time to this very day, thedivision of the world into eastern, western, northern, and southerncivilizations has been figured with Europe as the centerpoint. Thus, the WesternWatchtower governs Western nations such as Britain, Greece, Rome, Spain, France,etc. (Today we would include North America as well.) The Eastern Watchtowergoverns the East Asian nations like China, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, India, andthe so-called Middle East. The Northern Watchtower governs northern nations suchas Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Finally, the SouthernWatchtower governs southern nations like Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Ethiopia,and most of Africa. (And, of course, South America would be included in thattoday.)When the Parts of the Earth are arranged into the Great Table as we see here,their letters make up various names of God and an entire host of angelsassociated (not with the four elements!, but) with the four directions and thegeopolitical regions encompassed by them (Figure 25[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150]).The angels in each Watchtower are given exactly the same powers as those in theother three. Thus, for example, if you need to call upon the angels of medicine,you would call upon those who reside in the area of the world where your patientlives. If they happen to live in China, you would call the angels of the EasternWatchtower. To heal someone here in the US, you would call the angels ofmedicine from the Western Watchtower. In Africa you would call them from theSouthern Watchtower, and in Norway you would call the angels from the NorthernWatchtower.[image/Book7_Fig25.png]Figure 25. Powers of the Angels in the Great Table1. Human Knowledge and Counsel6. The Four Elements2. Medicine7. Discovery of Secrets3. Mixture of Substances8. Transformation4. Metals and Stones9. Mechanical Crafts5. TransportationThis blank Watchtower could be any of the four. We can see here that eachWatchtower is itself divided into four subquadrants. Further, this diagramillustrates the Divine Names and angelic powers found in each section. First andforemost are three Names of God found upon the horizontal arm of the Great Crossin the center. These three Names govern the hierarchy of the entire Watchtower.All together there are twelve such names in the Great Table (possiblycorresponding to the zodiac).Also arrayed upon the Great Cross we find the names of six of the twenty-fourElders of the Apocalypse, representing the twelve Tribes of Israel in pairs.They impart knowledge and judgment in human affairs (as tribal Elders aresupposed to do). To summon them, you must use a Name of God found in the verycenter of the Great Cross in a swirl pattern. In Dee’s time, the twenty-fourElders of the Apocalypse were associated with the zodiac—two Elders for eachconstellation. It is most likely Dee would have viewed them in this way, thoughhe appears to have left it as a “given” in his records.Within the four subquadrants of the Watchtower we have four Calvary Crosses.These Crosses each bear two Names of God that are used to summon the four angelsfound beneath the Cross’s arms.In the upper-left quadrant we find the angels of medicine, along with the namesof several demons who can cause sickness.In the upper-right quadrant we have the angels of precious stones, who actuallyhave knowledge of the finding, collection, uses, and virtues of both metals andjewels. The powers attributed to the demons here are not recorded.In the lower-left quadrant are the angels (and demons) of transformation. Deedoes not tell us exactly what is meant by “transformation.” However, most of theWatchtower angels seem to have powers related in some way to the practice ofalchemy (metals, stones, medicines, etc.), and thus we might assume the powersof these entities concern alchemical transmutations.In the lower-right quadrant are the angels (and demons) of the four elements.Note that the only angels in the Great Table who are, in fact, elemental innature are the four listed in the lower-right subquadrant of each Watchtower. InDee’s lifetime, the four elements were mainly alchemical considerations—thanksin part to the famous doctor and occultist Paracelsus—and were secondarilyastrological attributes for the four triplicities. It is from alchemy that wederive the four mixed virtues that form the elements: heat, coldness, moisture,and dryness. This would have likely been Dee’s understanding of the elements aswell.Above the arms of the Cavalry Crosses we find the names of four further angelsin each subquadrant. Of course, there is only one row of letters here, but eachangel is found by anagramming the name of the angel before him. In theupper-left quadrant we have four angels who are skilled in the mixing of naturalsubstances. In the upper-right quadrant are four angels who can transport things(or perhaps people) from place to place. In the lower left are four angels ofthe mechanical arts (indicating any work done with the hands, from painting andsculpture to carpentry and masonry, and even the building/repair of machines).Finally, in the lower-right quadrant are four angels who can reveal the secretsof all men. There are no demonic names associated with these angels at all.To summon these four groups of angels, you must use a Name of God derived bytaking the four letters above the arms of the Cross and prefixing it with aletter from the large Cross that binds all four Watchtowers together. Dee calledthis the Black Cross, very likely because it represents the alchemical BlackDragon, or decaying matter. Most of the letters from the Black Cross are used inthe formation of demonic names found below the arms of the Calvary Crosses. Onlya few letters are borrowed to make the Divine Names that govern the angels abovethe arms.It may seem contradictory that both demonic and Divine Names should be drawnfrom something called the Black Cross. However, I feel this is also part of thealchemical symbolism of the Great Table. The Divine Names represent the immortalspirit (or Mercury) that can be extracted from decaying matter. The demons, ofcourse, represent the decay.[image/Book7_Fig26.png]Figure 26. The Tablet of UnionStudents of the Golden Dawn will recognize the Black Cross under a differentguise: the Tablet of Union (Figure 26[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151]). There is no “Tabletof Union” in Dee’s system; however, this diagram does appear in his journals. Itwas only used by the angels to show Dee how to divide the letters of three ofthe Parts of the Earth—Lexarph, Comanan, and Tabitom—onto the Black Cross.Therefore, Dee-purism ignores the Tablet of Union entirely. Personally, I findit valid in its own way, because where the Black Cross represents the inherentspirit within material dross, so does the Tablet of Union represent the inherentspirit within the four elements. (Just keep in mind that the Golden Dawn’smethod of using the Tablet of Union has no parallel in Dee’s system whatsoever.)Now using the Great Table is not just a matter of setting up the furniture andsummoning the angels. Instead, a nineteen-day initiation process was outlined bywhich the aspirant establishes permanent contact with the entire hierarchy ofGreat Table angels at once. After that, the angels can be summoned and workedwith at his leisure.No invocations were provided for these angels, because Dee was instructed towrite his own. As an angel famously told Dee, “Invocation proceedeth of the goodwill of man.” Therefore, Dee was to create a Book of Supplication wherein herecorded invocations to each and every group of angels found in the Great Table.There were four invocations for each group—directed toward each of the fourWatchtowers—for a total of thirty-six individual prayers, plus one prayerdirected toward the God of Hosts (YHVH Zabaoth) and the twelve principal DivineNames of the Great Table. Dee did indeed write his own Book of Supplication, andit has been preserved in Geoffrey James’s Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee.As for the nineteen-day initiation that Dee was to follow, I will outline ithere as briefly as possible:1) On the first four days, three times a day, Dee was to recite only the prayerto the God of Hosts through the twelve Divine Names of the Great Table. He wasto ask God, in those Names, to send the angels of the Watchtowers to him andgrant him their patronage.2) Over the next fourteen days, the same prayer was to be recited three times aday, and the supplications of the Watchtower angels were added to it. Enochianscholars have debated for years how to divide thirty-six invocations betweenfourteen days. However, there is simply no way to evenly divide them in thatfashion, and Dee’s angels never suggested they should be divided at all. Ibelieve all thirty-six invocations were to be recited each and every time—threetimes a day for fourteen straight days.3) On the nineteenth day, the invocations will have taken effect. Dee was toclothe himself in a white linen robe and enter his oratory once more, to enjoyopen conversation with the angels of the Great Table. Those angels, then, wouldhave instructed him from there, and he should have had ready access to them fromthat time forward. He was told never to use the Book of Supplication nor thewhite robe again.And that is John Dee’s Watchtower system in a nutshell. It is a direct extensionof the Parts of the Earth system, which is itself a direct extension of theLoagaeth system. At this point we have only one more brief point from Dee’srecords to cover: the so-called Reformed Table of Raphael, which bears directlyupon the Golden Dawn’s version of Enochian.The Reformed Table of RaphaelDee and Kelley stuck together for a few years after receiving the Enochianmaterial, continuing to consult the angels on a regular basis about politics andother events in their lives. The two men would eventually drift apart, but notbefore—in April of 1587—it appears a last-ditch effort was made by the angels tokeep the two men together.First, we learn that the Family of Light angel Madimi had visited Kelley duringthe night and told him to share wives in common with Dee. Kelley appeared to beupset by this request, as were Dee and the two women.[image/Book7_Fig27.png]Figure 27. The Reformed Great Table of RaphaelIt was during this episode that Kelley reported having received instructions onhis own concerning the Great Table of the Earth. He was told by a voice to “joinEnoch his Tables” (meaning the Watchtowers, not the tables of Loagaeth). Inother words, he was told to consider the entire Great Table rather than just oneWatchtower. Then he was to number every square, starting in the upper left-handcorner and running rightward (for a total of 624). This came along with amessage written in a number code that could be decrypted by replacing themessage’s numbers with letters from the numbered Great Table.This, however, presented some problems, as translating the numbers of themessage into letters from the Great Table produced no readable text. Then Kelleywas visited in the night again, whereupon he was shown the Reformed Great Table.This was simply a rearrangement of the Watchtowers within the Great Table.Arranging it in this way, and numbering the squares, finally revealed a messagein Latin from the coded text. (Even still, it wasn’t perfect. See Laycock’sComplete Enochian Dictionary, 49–50.) Decoded, the message was from God himself,granting special permission for the wife-sharing to take place. Because of this,Dee “rejoices greatly” and consents to the sharing.Next in the journals we see the message given to Kelley as he received the“Reformed” Great Table alone in his bedroom—and the messenger reveals himself tobe the angel Raphael—hence the name of this version of the Great Table as usedby the Golden Dawn: the Reformed Great Table of Raphael (Figure 27[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152]). Over the next pages,the wife-sharing takes place, and Dee and Kelley have their last angelicsessions together. Nothing of further interest to us takes place, and thejournals eventually come to an end.Enochian Magick and the Early Golden DawnAfter Dee’s passing, his system of Enochian magick fell mostly into obscurity.Many of his manuscripts and belongings were destroyed or stolen from his homewhile he was away in Europe. (Thankfully he had his angelic journals with him atthe time.) And later, most of his Enochian material was hidden away in the falsebottom of a chest, where it lay hidden for many years. (Once found, severalpages of this material were lost when the previously mentioned maid used them todrain pies.)In 1659, many of Dee’s recovered angelic journals were published with a prefaceby Meric Casaubon under the title A True & Faithful Relation of What Passed forMany Years Between Dr. John Dee … and Some Spirits. Casaubon’s motives werepolitical—hoping to prove that Dee, a famous and well-respected Anglican, had infact been in contact with devils who wished to replace the New Testament withthe Book of Loagaeth.A True & Faithful Relation would go on to be the primary source for mostEnochian researchers and practitioners who followed. One of these was Dr. ThomasRudd, who has become famous for adding astrological and geomanticcorrespondences to Dee’s system. (He also, inexplicably, added material from theGoetia to the seven Ensigns of Creation, for which there is no support in Dee’srecords.) See A Treatise of Angel Magic by Adam McClean for Rudd’sEnochian-influenced system of angel magick.Dr. Thomas RuddDr. Thomas Rudd (c. 1583–1656) was a military engineer and mathematician workingin the Low Countries (aka the Netherlands). King Charles I of England appointedhim in 1627 to the position of chief engineer of all castles and fortificationswithin Wales, and later granted him the rank of the king’s principal engineer.Historical records confirm that Rudd’s advice was in demand across the UnitedKingdom in the building, refurbishing, and removal of several militarycomplexes. His expertise in mathematics led him to publish two mathematicaltexts: Practical Geometry, in Two Parts and an edition of Euclid’s Elements ofGeometry. The latter had an attached introduction by Dr. John Dee, and Rudd wasknown to have taken an interest in Dee’s writings, particularly his text onsacred geometry entitled The Hieroglyphic Monad.It is perhaps because of this that Rudd gained a reputation as an occultist inhis own right who was well versed in Hermeticism. Legend has placed him as theleader of a group of English magicians, though this is unverified. In time, amanuscript on angel magick would be attributed to him (published today as ATreatise on Angel Magic, edited by Adam McClean), though there is no way toverify if Rudd himself actually wrote it. Similarly, a version of the grimoireentitled Goetia was also attributed to him and is published today as The Goetiaof Dr. Rudd (edited by Dr. Stephen Skinner and David Rankine). Whether theseworks were truly written by Rudd or simply attributed to him, they would go onto influence the development of Western occultism for generations to come,giving us the first steps into what is called Neo-Enochiana and providing amajor influence on the early Golden Dawn.Eventually the rest of Dee’s journals were also published—this time withoutpolitical motivation—and they have been available for the world to study eversince. I listed the best and easiest-to-obtain sources at the beginning of thischapter.______I have already described the activities of the founders of the Golden Dawnduring the earliest days of the Order. They had to study Dee’s journals at theBritish Library a little at a time. However, Dee’s records are so prolific thatthey would not be fully vetted until the 1990s, when the internet allowed Deeenthusiasts and occultists from around the world to access his journals at willand to share and debate their findings with one another.Meanwhile, members of the early Golden Dawn did not rely entirely upon Dee’sjournals for their information. They also drew material from the very obscureEnochian tradition that had evolved since the time of Dee, such as the writingsof Dr. Rudd, and (most importantly) from a document of unknown origin calledBook H (cataloged in the British Library as Sloane MS 307).[image/Book7_Fig28.png]Figure 28. The Frontispiece of Book H:Displaying the Reformed Table of Raphael,with the Tablet of Union in the center, written in black and red inks.The best source I have found for Book H and its history is a book called ThePractical Angel Magic of Dr. John Dee’s Enochian Tables by Stephen Skinner andDavid Rankine. While the authors present some theories that are not generallysupported today (such as the idea that Dee himself might have written Book H,which is very unlikely), it is not their speculative theories that make theirbook important. Instead, it is the history of Book H and its influence on theGolden Dawn that makes the book required reading for any student of theneo-Enochian system.Book H consists of a series of lengthy invocations for all the angels of theGreat Table. It assigns the same powers to the angels as we find in Dee’sjournals but uses an entirely different method of generating the angels’ namesfrom the Watchtowers, and a different method of summoning them. The prayers aresimilar, in essence, to those in Dee’s Book of Supplication, though there is noevidence (based on the content of the prayers) that they were adapted fromDee’s. In fact, the invocations in Book H are nearly ten times the length ofthose written by Dee! (And there is no mention of a nineteen-day ritual beingnecessary to use them.)The unknown author also added a frontispiece to it, as pictured in Figure 28[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153]. What you see here is aslightly modified version of Kelley’s Reformed Table of Raphael. The originalappears near the end of A True & Faithful Relation. It is only different fromwhat you see here in that red ink has been used to denote the names of theangels, while black ink denotes the names on the Great and Calvary Crosses.Otherwise, it is the same as the Reformed Table that appears in Dee’s journals:the ordering has been changed from the original Great Table, and the numbers yousee running down the right-hand side are those added by Dee, as he numbered allthe squares from 1 to 624 in order to decipher the message from God.It would appear that the author of Book H studied A True & Faithful Relation anddiscovered the Reformed Table near the end—along with Dee’s notation that he was“rejoicing” because this arrangement of the Great Table had “solved asignificant problem.” Naturally, our unknown author assumed the Reformed Tablewas a corrected version of the Great Table, and thus adopted it for Book H.What he failed to do was carefully read the entries made by Dee over the daysleading up to the Reformed Table, or else he would have known that it wasspecifically linked to the wife-swapping episode, and the “significant problem”that the Reformed Table solved was merely the decryption of the message from Godgiving Dee, Kelley, and their wives permission to co-mingle. Sadly, the momentthe author made the choice to use the Reformed Table, he created a permanentschism between the two camps of Enochian study that would come to exist nearlytwo hundred years later.The reason for this schism is that Book H was the primary authoritative text onEnochian magick used by the early Golden Dawn. What you see here is exactly howthe Great Table looked to the first Adepts of the Order, including the black andred colors, as well as the Tablet of Union in the center. A more elaborate colorscheme was applied to the Watchtowers in the Inner Order, but was never shown tomembers of the Outer. Meanwhile, Book H was used in the Inner Order as agrimoire for summoning the angels from this Reformed Great Table.Unfortunately, Book H did not provide much context for itself. The onlyinformation it gave about the angels was found in the invocations, whichmentioned their powers (basically the same as Dee had recorded them) and inwhich compass direction they governed. It did not explain anything that I haveexplained to you about the Great Table here, nor did it associate the angelswithin it with any specific choirs or give them any occult correspondences.Thus, as far as we know, it was Mathers and/or Westcott who first applied thefour classical elements to the individual Watchtowers, and the sub-elements(fire of water, air of earth, water of air, etc.) to each of the sixteensubquadrants. They were also the first to assign the Elders (or, as they calledthem, Seniors) to the planets rather than the older zodiacal attributions, andadapt the Divine Name in the center as the name of a solar angel who governs theSeniors. Each group of Seniors and their “King” were considered to embody theplanetary forces when operating within a specific element—such as when Jupiterresides in a sign of the water triplicity (Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces).The Golden Dawn were also the first to attribute the Tetragrammaton (orfour-lettered Name of God: YHVH) to the Tablet of Union and the squares of thesubquadrants, as well as all of the geomantic, tarot, elemental, and otheroccult correspondences they apply to the individual squares. (I should alsomention that the versions of the Watchtowers with multiple letters in many ofthe squares was also the invention of the Golden Dawn. They were the result ofstudents being unsure about which letter should go in a square, such as a uversus a v, or an e versus an a. We have Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero to thankfor laying those monsters to rest forever in the modern Golden Dawn.)Book H also makes no mention of the forty-eight Angelical Keys. Therefore wemight assume that Mathers or Westcott were the first to apply them to the GreatTable instead. Their likely source for the Keys was Dee’s personal grimoire,which survives in the Sloane collection at the British Library (and has beenpublished in our time as The Enochian Magick of Dr. John Dee). In that grimoire,the forty-eight Keys are given with absolutely no explanation or instruction onhow to use them, and no mention of the Book of Loagaeth is made. Dee had merelywritten them out so he could use them, and nothing more. Therefore, it is nothard to imagine why the early Golden Dawn adepts would have naturally appliedthose angelic Callings to the angels described in Book H.As for how the words of the forty-eight Keys were to be pronounced, Dee’sgrimoire did in fact give pronunciation cues for the words. However, theearliest Adepts developed their own system of pronunciation, which has beenaffectionately called “Golden Dawn Liturgical Enochian” by some modernpractitioners. The basic rule was to pronounce every letter in the name and toapply vowels where they were missing according to the rules of Hebrew. Inpractice, they would often allow letters to combine their sounds when theyseemed to do so naturally (that is, to an English speaker), but there were nohard-and-fast rules on when to do so.Over the years since, these rules have been greatly relaxed, and now each Adeptseems to have their own pronunciations for the words. However, you can stillhear echoes of Golden Dawn Liturgical Enochian in most of the Angelical used inmodern Hermetic systems that have descended from the Golden Dawn or itsinfluence.Meanwhile, a vast amount of work has been done to decipher Dee’s ownpronunciation notes in both his journals and his personal grimoire, and we havea fairly good idea how the language might have sounded to him and Kelley. My ownwork on that particular subject can be found in the two volumes of The AngelicalLanguage.In ConclusionThis brief chapter has barely scratched the surface of the mysteries andpractice of Enochian magick, both Dee-purist and neo-Enochian. I have also onlyhinted at the massive impact Dee and Kelley’s contributions have had on ourmodern systems of magick. It would go on to influence Rosicrucianism, Thelema,Neopaganism, and Wicca, and a host of other traditions that have come down to ustoday. However, until relatively recently, most of the Enochian source materialwas left obscure and unexamined, wrapping what little was known in a shroud ofmystery and misunderstanding. Since the dawn of the Information Age, much morehas come to light, giving us a much better view into Dee’s life, the time andplace in which he lived, and what the motivations behind his Enochian magick mayhave been. I hope I have given you a solid glimpse into the origins of thetradition and its structure and intent, as well as how it survived to become ashining jewel of the Western Mystery Tradition.Zorge,Aaron Leitch, 2019SourcesAgrippa, Henry Cornelius.

Beyond gaining skill in the art ofmagic, and the increase in psychic faculties that such performance brings withit, the aim of all rituals and practical magical work of the Golden Dawn is tocreate a spiritual bond between the magician and the Eternal, Immortal Self.The Golden Dawn’s impact on contemporary ceremonial magic cannot be overstated.While we as Golden Dawn magicians are naturally predisposed to favor our owntradition, we are certainly not the only authors to make this claim. The GoldenDawn has often been called “the most famous and influential occult order ofmodern times.” 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-395] In hisexcellent book on The Rosicrucians, author Christopher McIntosh describes theOrder as “the most impressive fruit to grow from the Rosicrucian tree.” 2[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-394] And in his foreword toEllic Howe’s important text on the Order’s history, Gerald Yorke writes: “TheHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.D.) with its Inner Order of the Rose ofRuby and the Cross of Gold (R.R. et A.C.) was the crowning glory of the occultrevival in the nineteenth century. It synthesized into a coherent whole a vastbody of disconnected and widely scattered material and welded it into apractical and effective system, which cannot be said of any other occult Orderof which we know at that time or since.” 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-393] It is a simple fact thatwithout the Golden Dawn the esoteric and magical world of the twenty-firstcentury would be very different from what it is today.There are many schools of magic in existence today, but many of them ultimatelyderive from the same source (…) The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was themost important single source of the modern magical tradition.4[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-392]What is it about the Golden Dawn that makes it so significant? And what is itabout the system that continues to attract aspiring magicians today, long afterthe passing of the Victorian age into which it was born?It is easy to see how the Order was miles ahead of any esoteric fraternity ofits era. It opened its doors to women as well as men, on a completely equalfooting. And at a time when similar organizations were content with the meretheoretical study of magic and various occult topics, the Golden Dawn wascreated to be a society whose members learned and practiced magic.Much of the magic contained within the teachings of the Order was not original.Its many component parts were drawn from several sources that would have beenfamiliar to Hermeticists, alchemists, astrologers, natural philosophers, mages,and occultists from previous ages, comprising the various threads of what isknown as the Western Esoteric Tradition. The range of studies undertaken byGolden Dawn magicians was impressive: ancient Egyptian religion and magic,classical Greek philosophy, the Greco-Egyptian Mystery religions, Hellenisticphilosophy, Gnosticism, Neo-Platonism, Hermetism and Hermeticism, JewishKabbalah and Christian Hermetic Qabalah, Rosicrucian philosophy and Christianmysticism, astrology and planetary magic, tarot and other forms of divination,the principles of alchemy, evocation and spirit vision work, the creation ofmagical implements and sacred space, healing, aura control, godform assumption,the projection and movement of energy, dramatic invocation, consecration oftalismans, and Enochian magic.But what made the Golden Dawn truly unique was the genius of its founders tocraft a single, organized framework from these diverse teachings, creating acomprehensive course for magical study, training, and practice. The design ofthe Golden Dawn system was balanced, logical, and practicable. Its structureincludes several levels of initiation ceremonies accompanied by instruction andgradework, rituals, meditations, exercises, and examinations. The Order wascreated to be a school and a repository of esoteric knowledge, which was givento members in a gradual, step-by-step manner. Beginning students learned theprinciples of occult science and committed the rudiments of magical knowledge tomemory, while more advanced initiates explored these various esoteric avenues ingreater depth and combined them with ritual techniques of practical magic.Structural Roots and Direct InfluencesBy the nineteenth century, there was huge interest in Western esotericism inFrance and England. This movement, dubbed the Occult Revival, was led byindividuals such as former Catholic clergyman Alphonse Louis Constant, betterknown as Eliphas Levi (1810–1875), an astute Qabalist and prolific author. Hisbook on The Dogma and Ritual of High Magic (1854) would become a cornerstone ofWestern magic. Levi advanced the theory that the twenty-two Major Arcana cardsof the tarot corresponded to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet—aview that would later become an important part of the Golden Dawn’s teachings.In addition, his writings on the Qabalah, the creation of talismans, and theidea of the Astral Light were largely embraced by the founders of the GoldenDawn. Another significant contributor to the Occult Revival was FrederickHockley (1809–1885), a Spiritualist, Freemason, Rosicrucian, and profusetranscriber of unpublished works on Qabalah, alchemy, and magic. Hockley’sexperiments with spirit communications and clairvoyance using magic mirrors andcrystals were carried out and meticulously recorded over a sixty-year span.As England continued to explore the farthest reaches of the world, there was agreat deal of interest in the ethnic and religious traditions of cultures bothpast and contemporary. The archaic Celtic civilization and the mysticism of theFar East attracted much attention. There was also considerable enthusiasm foranything having to do with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, fueled in no smallpart by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, curator for the British Museum’s Department ofEgyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. In 1883 Budge began work for the museum, andthrough the 1880s he was able to secure numerous valuable manuscripts, cuneiformtablets, and Egyptian papyri for the British Museum, including a remarkablywell-preserved version of the Book of the Dead. Such resources were rocket fuelfor Victorian-era students of the occult.The mid-1880s also witnessed a sizable growth in Masonry and quasi-Masonicorganizations of all kinds. Freemasonry was a worldwide fraternity of men who,according to legend, traced their origins to the building of King Solomon’sTemple and even earlier. However, the real roots of Freemasonry are to be foundin the late medieval stonemasons’ guilds of England and Scotland. Freemasonswere taught basic morality and principled development of the human conditionthrough symbols. Admission into Freemasonry required a belief in God as theDivine Architect of the Universe.Although Freemasonry was not an occult society in and of itself, it nonethelesshad considerable historical ties to occultism. Freemasonry was, and still is,the West’s most influential fraternal order. Because of this, a huge percentageof Masonic ideas concerning the organization and arrangement of lodges wasadopted by occult societies and magical lodges. Initiation into the variousdegrees of Masonry involved an elaborate system of symbolic ritual. Masonicrites included secret passwords, signs, cryptic diagrams, knocks, oaths,blindfolds, and grips or handshakes. All of these features would directlyinfluence the structure of the Golden Dawn’s initiation ceremonies. Even thephrase “So mote it be” entered the vernacular of the Golden Dawn fromFreemasonry.The final and perhaps most important influence on the Golden Dawn wasRosicrucianism, a mystical and philosophical movement that first emerged inseventeenth-century Germany. The legendary Rosicrucians were said to be a secretorder of Christian mystics who worked for the good of mankind and studied theart of alchemy and Hermetic philosophy. The Rosicrucians were first described ina series of cryptic manuscripts that started showing up in 1614, beginning withthe Fama Fraternitatis, or “Announcement of the Fraternity.” Not long after, twomore manuscripts appeared: Confessio Fraternitatis, or “Confession of theFraternity,” and the Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. The Famaproclaimed the existence of a shadowy society of skilled mystics united underthe symbol of the Rose Cross. It went on to describe the life of thefraternity’s founder, Christian Rosenkreutz (or C.R.C.), and the discovery ofthe hidden vault wherein the founder and all the secrets of the Order wereburied. The manuscript suggested that like-minded seekers contact the fraternityto share in its esoteric knowledge—a task made impossible by the lack of anyinstruction on how to contact the Fratres, combined with the admonition thatanyone who called himself a Rosicrucian was an imposter! Whether real orimagined, no one actually found them. And in his later years, Lutheran clergymanJohann Valentin Andreae admitted to writing the Chemical Wedding as a joke andprobably had a hand in writing the other manifestos as well.Anna KingsfordAnna Bonus Kingsford (1846–1888) is known today as a leading Englishanti-vivisectionist, proponent of vegetarianism, campaigner for women’s rights,and one of the first English women to have earned a degree in medicine. She wasalso a profound mystic and an important influence on the founders of the GoldenDawn.Much of what we know about Kingsford’s life comes from the work of her friendand biographer, Edward Maitland. Their relationship was a very deep yet platonicfriendship. When Kingsford began to receive a series of propheticdream-visions—her “illuminations”—it was Maitland who made sure they werewritten down and preserved. These became the basis for The Perfect Way, or theFinding of Christ and Clothed with the Sun.The two preached what they called the New Gospel of Interpretation, intended torestore lost esoteric truths of Christianity, especially truths that include thedivine feminine. Kingsford’s most potent formulation of this is the “Day of theWoman” prophecy: “And now I show you a mystery and a new thing […] The wordwhich shall come to save the world, shall be uttered by a woman. A woman shallconceive, and shall bring forth the tidings of salvation.” *In the early 1880s, Kingsford and Maitland became involved with the LondonTheosophical Society (TS). Eventually, they would split with the TS to go theirown way, forming the Hermetic Society. It was at this time that Wynn Westcottand S. L. MacGregor Mathers, two of the soon-to-be founders of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, met Kingsford. Both would go on to lecture atKingsford’s Hermetic Society.Kingsford was now at the height of her career. Highly charismatic, an entrancingspeaker, beautiful, and ethereal, Anna riveted the attention of everyone nearher. Mathers dedicated his important translation of The Kabbalah Unveiled (1887)to her and Maitland. His preface called Kingsford and Maitland’s The Perfect Waythe most occult book written in centuries. Kingsford’s influence convincedMathers that the magical order he and Westcott were forming should includewomen. Maitland later wrote that “in the course of the summer of this year,1886, a proposal to study occultism was made to her by a notable expert.” ** The“notable expert” could be no one but Mathers.In addition to adopting Kingsford’s feminism, Mathers assisted in heranti-vivisection campaign and became a vegetarian. The official GD HistoryLecture praised Kingsford as one of the great Hermetists of the day. With itsblending of Christianity and polytheism, its use of the term Genius for theHigher Self, and its valorization of the divine feminine, The Perfect Wayclearly had a substantial influence on the GD curriculum. So much so thatperhaps we can consider Anna Kingsford, as does Mary Greer in Women of theGolden Dawn, the “magical mother” of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.—by M. Isidora ForrestM. Isidora Forrest is the author of a number of books and articles on theEgyptian goddess Isis, including Isis Magic and Offering to Isis, as well asarticles on selected deities in modern Neopagan practice and modern spiritualmagic. She is a Prophetess in the House of Isis, a priestess of theinternational Fellowship of Isis, a Hermetic adept, a maenad for Dionysos, and afounder of the Hermetic Fellowship in Oregon.* Edward Maitland, Anna Kingsford: Her Life, Letters, Diary, and Work, vol. 1,344–345.** Edward Maitland, Anna Kingsford: Her Life, Letters, Diary, and Work, vol. 2,268.Regardless of its origins, the idea of Rosicrucianism was very appealing. AsFreemasonry spread across Europe in the eighteenth century and expanded again inthe nineteenth century, all manner of arcane motifs, scriptural themes, ancientmystery religions, and secret societies such as the mysterious RosicrucianBrotherhood were harvested for nuggets of inspiration. Consequently, severalMasonic Rosicrucian fraternities were founded. The Rosicrucian movement spawnedseveral groups concerned with the study of religious mysticism, philosophicaland religious doctrines, alchemy, Qabalah, spiritual transformation, and generalesotericism.A Brief History of the Golden DawnThe Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was the brainchild of Dr. William WynnWestcott (1848–1925), a London coroner who was interested in all aspects ofoccultism. Westcott was a Master Mason and Secretary General of the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia, or Rosicrucian Society in England (S.R.I.A.), a MasonicRosicrucian research order. Westcott was interested in the many varieties ofMasonry that thrived outside the conventional craft. He was actively involved inmost of the esoteric orders that abounded in Britain at the time and was widelyesteemed for his expertise on the Qabalah, alchemy, and Hermetic philosophy. Hepublished an impressive volume of work in both the Hermetic and medical fields,including a translation of the famous Qabalistic text Sepher Yetzirah as well asEliphas Levi’s treatise on the tarot, The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum.He also edited a series of Hermetic and Gnostic texts and published them asindividual volumes of his Collectanea Hermetica series.The origin story of how the Golden Dawn came into being has more often than notbeen a source of confusion and deliberate mystification. According to Westcott’soriginal version of events, he received some sixty pages of a manuscript writtenin cipher from an elderly Mason, the Reverend A. F. A. Woodford, in 1887. It wasclaimed that Woodford had received the manuscript from “a dealer in curios.” Themanuscript, which seemed to be old, was quickly deciphered by Westcott using thecipher found in Abbot Johann Trithemius’s book Polygraphiae. It proved to be aseries of ritual outlines for the initiation ceremonies of a quasi-Masonicoccult order. An additional paper, also written in cipher, was inserted into themanuscript: a letter purporting to contain the credentials and address of aGerman Adept named Fraulein Sprengel. As the story goes, Westcott exchanged aseries of letters with Sprengel, who authorized him to establish a new temple inEngland. Westcott fleshed out the outlines into full working rituals.While the Cipher Manuscript is a genuine outline for an effective esotericgroup, it is now considered highly likely that Westcott concocted the storyabout Fraulein Sprengel and her letters. During the Victorian era, esotericgroups needed an ancient “pedigree” in order to attract prominent Freemasons,Rosicrucians, and serious occultists into their ranks. After all, the Freemasonshad the story of Hiram Abiff, the Rosicrucians had the legend of ChristianRosenkreutz, and the Theosophists had Blavatsky’s occult “Masters.” SurelyWestcott must have felt the need to provide evidence that the Golden Dawn wasnot something merely created out of thin air, that it had a similar, noblehistory to back it up.The pages of the Cipher Manuscript were probably ritual outlines for a prototypealchemical group known as the Society of Eight, which was founded in 1883 byFrederick Holland but never fully manifested. The papers were copied down byKenneth Mackenzie, author of The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia, a leading member ofthe S.R.I.A. and Grand Secretary of the Swedenborgian Rite of Freemasonry. AfterMackenzie’s death in 1886, Westcott became Grand Secretary of the S.R. andacquired all of Mackenzie’s papers, including the folios of the CipherManuscript that were among the assorted documents of the Swedenborgian Rite. Inany event, once Westcott had deciphered the ritual outlines, he began toimplement his vision of a new occult society that was hands-on and practical,and not just another theoretical study group.In February of 1888, the Isis-Urania Temple was inaugurated in London and theOrder of the Golden Dawn was born. Westcott had already recruited two fellowMasonic Rosicrucians to be co-equal officers in the governing triumvirate forhis new order: Dr. William Robert Woodman and Samuel Liddell “MacGregor”Mathers.Of the three founding members of the Golden Dawn, Samuel Mathers was a mosttalented ritualist. He was also known for his translations of a series ofgrimoires, including The Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage, The Key of Solomonthe King, and The Grimoire of Armadel. As a practical magician, Mathers had fewequals. And of the three founding Chiefs, it was Mathers, the primary Chief ofthe Inner Order, who made the Golden Dawn into a truly magical initiatory order.By the end of 1888, the Isis-Urania Temple in London had thirty-two members,nine women and twenty-three men. That same year, two more temples wereestablished. A year after its founding, the Order had grown to around sixtymembers, about a third of whom were women. More temples were founded in theyears that followed.Members of the Order included quite a few doctors and writers. Many belonged toother esoteric groups such as the Freemasons and the Theosophical Society. Ingeneral, they were intelligent, creative people who sought out spiritualknowledge. Some of the more notable members of the original Order includedWilliam Butler Yeats, one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century;William Horton, a prominent graphic artist in the Art Nouveau movement; ReverendWilliam Alexander Ayton, a clergyman and practicing alchemist; William Peck,city astronomer of Edinburgh; authors Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood;Arthur Edward Waite, a Christian mystic, occultist, and prolific author ofseveral books on Freemasonry, Qabalah, and other esoteric subjects, as well asthe creator of the most popular Golden Dawn–based tarot deck in the world (theRider-Waite Tarot); Constance Wilde, the wife of playwright Oscar Wilde; andfamed occultist Aleister Crowley.5[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-391]Women of the Golden DawnThe Golden Dawn honored gender equality by admitting women to the highest ranksof membership and office. Some were suffragettes and New Women—part of the firstwave of modern feminism. A number of extraordinary women became prominentteachers of the Order.Moina Mathers (1865–1928, born in Switzerland as Mina Bergson) studied at theSlade School of Art in London. Her brother Henri Bergson was a NobelPrize–winning French philosopher. She married Samuel Mathers in 1890 and changedher name to the more Celtic-sounding Moina. A pioneer in the art form of collageand a gifted clairvoyant, Moina was the first person to be initiated into theOrder of the Golden Dawn. Her magical motto in the Order embodied her mission toalways look forward: Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum, meaning “I never retrace mysteps.” Moina’s paintings of Egyptian deities, wall decorations, and otherartwork served to adorn the Isis-Urania Temple and illustrate the Order’steachings. Throughout her life, she remained dedicated to her husband and to thegoddesses and gods of the pagan world. Moina led the Paris branch of the GoldenDawn for several years after her husband’s death in 1918.Annie Horniman (1860–1937) was a wealthy heiress who built two world-renownedtheaters, including Ireland’s famous Abbey Theater. Considered a driving forcebehind the Irish Literary Revival, Horniman was a staunch feminist, fiercelyindependent and outspoken. Although considered by some of her acquaintances tobe overly zealous, fussy, and somewhat undiplomatic, she was by all accounts anexcellent administrator and businesswoman. In the occult world, Annie was askilled astrologer, tarot reader, and ceremonial magician. Her experience in thetheatre undoubtedly benefited the staging of Golden Dawn rituals. Annie’s GoldenDawn motto was Fortiter et Recte (“bravely and justly”), which fittinglyexpressed the way in which she faced the world around her.Florence Farr (1860–1917) was a famous actress on the British stage who playedleading roles in theatrical works by George Bernard Shaw and William ButlerYeats. Intelligent, self-educated, and doggedly independent, Florence joined theIsis-Urania Temple in 1890 under the motto Sapientia Sapienti Dona Data (“Wisdomis a gift given to the wise”). She taught weekly classes in tarot and Enochianmagic and wrote a number of esoteric books. Her specialty was spirit visionwork, and her experience in the theatre made her a gifted ritualist. In 1894Florence became head of the London branch of the Order, until she resigned in1900 to pursue a more Eastern focus.Maud Gonne (1866–1953) was a gifted actress on the Irish stage, an activistwhose fiery speeches incited riots, and one of the founders of Sinn Féin. HerGolden Dawn motto was fittingly Per Ignem ad Lucem (“Through fire to thelight”). Maud’s dislike of the Masonic structure of the initiation rituals ledto her resigning from the Order after a short period of time, although shecontinued to work with Yeats, Horniman, Farr, and Moina Mathers on ideas forrituals exploring the Celtic Mysteries.The “golden age” of the original Order lasted only fifteen years. As with anyorganization involving human beings and their egos, problems eventuallydeveloped. Quarrels and power struggles ensued, and by 1903 the original Orderof the Golden Dawn had ceased to exist and split into different factions. Thework of the Golden Dawn continued in the form of offshoot orders that wereestablished by former members of the original. The two primary offshoots werethe Order of the Alpha et Omega (A.O.) and the Order of the Stella Matutina(S.M.). The A.O. survived until the outbreak of WWII, and the S.M. surviveduntil 1978, when it was officially closed down.The Ethos of the TraditionThe Golden Dawn was not created to be a religion or to replace one’s religion,although religious imagery and spiritual principles play an important role inits activity. Nevertheless, the work of the system can certainly supplement andenhance one’s religious experience regardless of the faith the magicianpractices. Tolerance for all true life-affirming spiritual paths was expected.As the Neophyte is told, “Hold all religions in reverence, for there is none butcontains a ray from the ineffable Light you seek.” 6[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-390] The Golden Dawn wasintended to be a Hermetic Society of men and women, a fellowship of like-mindedindividuals: magicians and occultists, priests and priestesses, who werededicated to the philosophical, spiritual, and psychic evolution of humanitythrough the preservation of the ancient, sacred wisdom of the West. The Orderwas meant to serve as the guardian of this Western spiritual wisdom, keeping itsknowledge intact while at the same time preparing and training those aspirantscalled to the initiatory path of the mysteries.The symbol of the Golden Dawn is a red cross above a white triangle (Figure 1[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor155]). Regardie explains itsimplication with eloquence: “Even upon the altar of the Temple are symbolsindicating the rise of Light. A red Calvary cross of six squares as symbolic ofharmony and equilibrium is placed above a white triangle—the emblem of theGolden Dawn. They form the symbol of the Supernal Sephiroth which are thedynamic life and root of all things, while in man they constitute that triad ofspiritual faculties which is the intrinsically pure essence of mind. Hence isthe triangle a fitting emblem of the Light. And the place of the Cross above theTriangle suggests not the domination of the sacred spirit, but its equilibrationand harmony in the heart of man.” 7[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-389][image/Book8_Fig1.png]Figure 1. Cross and TriangleThe Order SystemThe Golden Dawn order system is based entirely upon a hierarchical structure inwhich certain knowledge is retained for students who have reached specificgrades or levels of achievement in their esoteric training. This is in keepingwith the paradigm of a school, and the Golden Dawn is a school of the Mysteriesthat was designed in such a way as to correlate the various grade levels tospecific esoteric ideas and cosmic principles. The primary philosophy behind thegrade system is the Qabalah, a Hebrew mystical system that encompasses knowledgeof the divine universe: its fundamental spiritual essence, composition, andevolution. The Qabalah teaches that the universe manifested from deity in tenstages, or emanations, known as the sephiroth, considered different aspects ofdivinity, divine powers, and expressions of God consciousness. The ten sephiroththat form the Qabalistic Tree of Life are listed in Table 1[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156].No.NameTranslationAttribute1.KetherThe CrownOneness, unity2.ChokmahWisdomForce, expansion3.BinahUnderstandingForm, contraction4.ChesedMercyConstruction5.GeburahPowerMight, severity6.TipharethBeautyBalance, awareness7.NetzachVictoryEmotion, desire8.HodSplendorIntellect, reason9.YesodFoundationAstral blueprint, matrix10.MalkuthThe KingdomPhysical manifestationTable 1. The Sephiroth, with English Translations and AttributesThe grades of the Golden Dawn correspond to the ten sephiroth, but they alsohave elemental and planetary associations. The titles and basic framework ofthese grades are taken from those of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, whichborrowed them in turn from the degree structure of an eighteenth-century GermanRosicrucian group the Orden des Gold- und Rosenkreuz, or the Order of the Goldenand Rosy Cross.These ten grades are further divided into separate but interconnected orders.The First (or Outer) Order is the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Second(or Inner) Order is the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aurea Crucis, usually referred toas the R.R. et A.C. These two Orders function as outer and inner courts of themysteries. The Third (or Invisible) Order consists of grades that are notattained nor worked by living initiates, although some Golden Dawn groups giveout these high titles honorarily. A list of the grades from lowest to highest isgiven in Table 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor157].FIRST ORDER: The Order of the Golden Dawn (First Degree of the System)GradeSymbolSephirahElementPlanetNeophyte[image/Book8_0=0.png]———Zelator[image/Book8_1=10.png]MalkuthEarthEarthTheoricus[image/Book8_2=9.png]YesodAirLunaPracticus[image/Book8_3=8.png]HodWaterMercuryPhilosophus[image/Book8_4=7.png]NetzachFireVenusThe Portal Grade (Second Degree of the System)Portal—Spirit—SECOND ORDER: The R.R. et A.C.

The Grade Structure of the Hermetic Order of the Golden DawnOf all the initiation ceremonies, the Neophyte Ritual stands apart from therest. Although it is considered a preliminary or probationary rite, hiddenwithin its framework are all the fundamental magical formulae and techniques ofthe Order. The focus of the Neophyte Ceremony is the attraction of the DivineLight into the Temple by the presiding officers, to be implanted in theaspirant’s auric sphere of sensation.First Order Officers who actively perform the Neophyte Ceremony are Hierophant(“initiating priest”), Hiereus (“priest”), Hegemon (“guide”), Keryx (“herald”),Stolistes (“preparer”), Dadouchos (“torch-bearer”), and Phylax (“sentinel”).These Greek titles were derived from those of officiating priests of the ancientGreek mystery religions, such as the Eleusinian mysteries. These seven officersanswered to a governing triumvirate known as the Greatly Honoured Chiefs, whosetitles are Praemonstrator (the “prophesier,” or teacher), the Imperator (or“commander”), and Cancellarius (or “chancellor,” recorder).The mythological narrative that serves as the magical backdrop and astral matrixfor the Neophyte Ceremony is the Egyptian legend of the Hall of Judgment asdescribed in the 125th chapter of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. This depictsthe “Weighing of the Soul,” in which the deceased (represented by the candidate)is brought into the Hall of Truth and judged as to his or her worthiness toreceive the infinite Light. In this setting, the ritual enactment of theWeighing of the Soul represents the purification of the candidate before his orher reception into the Order.This initiation is a process of spiritual alchemy wherein the Neophyte is thebase material (the lead) that is to be transmuted into gold by the Work oftransmutation hinted at by the Hierophant’s speech to the candidate:The Voice of my undying and Secret Soul said unto me—“Let me enter the Path ofDarkness and, peradventure, there shall I find the Light. I am the only Being inan Abyss of Darkness; from an Abyss of Darkness came I forth ere my birth, fromthe silence of a Primal Sleep.”And the Voice of Ages answered unto my Soul—“I am He who formulates inDarkness—the Light that shineth in Darkness, yet the Darkness comprehendeth itnot.” 8 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-388]Further initiations into the elemental grades are analogous to the alchemicalprocesses of separation and purification.The First Order consists of the grades from Neophyte through Philosophus. Thegrades from Zelator through Philosophus are known as the elemental grades andare each attributed to one of the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth.Each is also expressed through a different mythological narrative drawn from theWestern Esoteric Tradition. Advancement through these levels is designed toexpose the initiate to the elemental principles of nature as they exist out inthe greater universe of the Divine and within the psychological makeup of themagician. These four principles are characterized as distinct sections of thesubconscious mind and the auric sphere, and the Golden Dawn tradition symbolizesthem collectively by the Egyptian god Osiris who was killed, dismembered,reassembled, and resurrected into a pure, spiritual form.It is within the grades of the First Order where the students learn thelanguage, symbols, and principles of magic; the Qabalistic Tree of Life; theletters of the Hebrew alphabet; the attributes of the elements, planets, andzodiacal signs; geomancy; gematria, or Hebrew numerology; divine Hebrewgodnames, angelic hierarchies, and words of power; principles of alchemy; theQabalistic parts of the Soul; the cards of the tarot; and so forth. Studentsmust commit the rudiments of occult knowledge to memory before advancing to theperformance of practical ritual magic. That is the domain of the Second Order.Between the First and Second Orders is an additional grade of the Portal, whichis a probationary period between the Inner and Outer Courts of the mysteries.This grade is attributed to the fifth element of spirit, which crowns andcompletes the other four elements. Here the initiate’s assignment is to unifyand assimilate the elements of the psyche that had been individually examinedand cleansed during the work of the First Order.Admission to the Second Order is by invitation only. The Inner Order consists ofgrades from Adeptus Minor to Adeptus Exemptus, and it is here that the initiatebegins the practice of ceremonial magic, both in groups of one’s peers as wellas in solo work. The grade of Adeptus Minor (the “Lesser Adept”) is where themajority of the published magical work of the Golden Dawn system takes place.The higher grades are divided into various subgrades that mirror the grades ofthe Outer Order: Neophyte Adeptus Minor (NAM), Zelator Adeptus Minor (ZAM),Theoricus Adeptus Minor (ThAM), and so on.While the First Order can be seen as Osirian in emphasis, the Second Order isRosicrucian. And while other Rosicrucian groups are oriented solely towardresearch or mysticism, the Golden Dawn’s Inner Order is the preeminent magicalmanifestation of the Rosicrucian impulse. In 1892 Samuel Mathers finished theelaborate initiation ceremony into the [image/Book8_5=6.png] grade of AdeptusMinor. Based on the legend of Christian Rosencreutz as presented in the FamaFraternitatis, the Adeptus Minor Ceremony involves the discovery of C.R.C.’stomb, known as the Vault of the Adepti (Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158]). Aided no doubt by theartistry of his wife, Moina, Mathers designed a highly elaborate version of themystic Rosicrucian vault to serve as the primary temple and ritual chamber ofthe Second Order. All grade initiations pertaining to the R.R. et A.C. requirethis seven-sided chamber. This sacred space is reconsecrated once every year onor around the day of Corpus Christi, a Catholic feast day held in honor of theEucharist. This tradition, adopted by the Second Order, was started by earlierRosicrucians who referred to Corpus Christi secretively as “Day C.”[image/Book8_Fig2.jpg]Figure 2. A Modern-Day Vault of the AdeptiThe Adeptus Minor Ceremony is impressive and eloquent. The mythological settingfor the ritual is the reenactment of the death of Christian Rosencreutz and theresurrection of the Sacred Rosicrucian knowledge. The temple is opened by theofficiating Adepti. The aspirant enters, announces his desire to be admittedinto the Vault, and is rebuffed. Then the aspirant is sent to the anti-chamber,where he or she is divested of all insignia before returning to undertake anarduous period of trial and tribulation, including a symbolic crucifixionaccompanied by the recitation of a potent and binding obligation. After this,the legend of Christian Rosencreutz is recounted to the aspirant. In due course,the door to the Vault is opened and the aspirant is admitted into the mysticalseven-sided tomb, where the body of C.R.C., represented by the Chief Adept, isdiscovered. The secrets of the Vault, including its elaborate symbolism, arefinally explained. Some of the prayers and speeches of this ceremony arehauntingly expressive of the aspirant’s spiritual quest:Buried with that Light in a mystical death, rising again in a mysticalresurrection, cleansed and purified through Him our Master, O Brother of theCross and the Rose. Like Him, O Adepts of all ages have ye toiled. Like Him haveye suffered tribulation. Poverty, torture and death have ye passed through. Theyhave been but the purification of the Gold. In the alembic of thine heart,through the athanor of affliction, seek thou the true stone of the Wise.9[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-387]The [image/Book8_5=6.png] ceremony often has a powerful effect on those whoexperience it. According to Arthur Edward Waite, the ritual was quite inspiring:“It could not be denied that the culminating Grade, as the system was thendeveloped, had the root matter of a greater scheme than had ever dawned in theconsciousness of any maker of Masonic degrees under any Grand Lodge or Chapter,Conclave or Preceptory, in the whole wide world.” 10[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-386]Such sentiments explain why the Golden Dawn system has continued to grow andexpand its influence far beyond the life span of the original Order and itsimmediate offshoots.Dion FortuneOne of the best-known members to have emerged from the Alpha et Omega, DionFortune (born Violet Mary Firth, 1890–1946), was a trained psychotherapist and aCo-Mason. She joined the London Temple of the A.O. in 1919 under the motto DeoNon Fortuna (“By God, not by chance”). Beginning in 1921, she experimented withtrance mediumship that culminated in the town of Glastonbury with archaeologistand psychical researcher Frederick Bligh Bond. While working in Glastonbury,Fortune met Christian occultist Charles Loveday. After a series of inner planeworkings, Fortune, Loveday, and their coworkers had gathered enough material tofound their own magical order, the Fraternity of the Inner Light, in 1924. Thisgroup would remain Fortune’s esoteric focal point for the rest of her days. In1925 she and Loveday were also involved in the Christian Mystical Lodge of theTheosophical Society, from which she resigned in 1927. This was also the yearwhen she married Thomas Penry Evans and was expelled from the A.O. by MoinaMathers for publishing a series of articles that concerned the A.O. leadership.The fraternity she founded later changed its name to the Society of the InnerLight and is still active today.Under her pen name, which was adapted from her magical motto in the A.O., DionFortune wrote several works of occult fiction, including The Demon Lover, MoonMagic, and The Sea Priestess. She also wrote a series of important texts onmagic, including The Cosmic Doctrine, Esoteric Orders and Their Work, SaneOccultism, Applied Magic, and The Mystical Qabalah.Essential ConceptsThe range of studies undertaken by members of the various grades was quitebroad. However, a number of themes and basic principles can be derived from theOrder’s teachings:• Macrocosm and Microcosm. There is a connection between a higher divine realitycalled the Macrocosm, or the “Greater Universe,” and the earthly realm of theMicrocosm, the “Small Universe” of human beings. As above, so below.• Ultimate Divinity. The Golden Dawn is ultimately monotheistic, although itconceives of the Ultimate Divinity as emanating itself through a multitude offorms, aspects, characteristics, and manifestations. Although the system mayappear to be outwardly polytheistic, all deities are thought to be the variousfaces and rich expressions of the ultimate Divine Unity.• Immanence and Transcendence. Ultimate Divinity is both immanent (withineverything) and transcendent (beyond everything). The universe is completelydivine, living, and animated.• The Universal Order. The nature of the universe is ultimately good andconstructive and leans toward balance. Evil is created from a state ofimbalance.• The Way of Return. Humanity has become separated from the Divine throughinvolution, the process by which the spirit manifests into matter. Humans seek“the Way of Return” back to unity with the Divine through evolution, the processby which spirit reconnects with Divinity. Involution and evolution are bothnatural and necessary polar opposites in the process of creation. Althoughspiritual teachers can provide guidance, each individual aspirant mustultimately tread the way back to the Divine alone.• Hierarchies and Intermediaries. Divine beings, deities, archangels, angels,and spirits act as links in a chain, the rungs on a ladder that aid the magicianin climbing and descending the planes into higher realms of Being. Golden Dawnmagicians are taught to always invoke the Highest first.• The Celestial Pattern. Because the Macrocosm and Microcosm are linked, theindividual human soul and aura contain a reflection of the celestial powers.These can be used to cause magical change through the manipulations of the auraand the Astral Light.• The Work. As part of the discipline needed to return to the Divine, humanbeings must learn to understand the invisible realms that lie hidden behind themanifest universe. To that end, the Work embraces the passive practices ofmysticism and active processes of magic. Armed with knowledge gained fromesoteric practices, the fundamental objective of the magician is to achieveunion with the Divine, a goal often called the Great Work.Paul Foster CasePaul Foster Case (1885–1954) was the best-known American member of the Alpha etOmega. In his early years, Case worked as a musician and a musical director intheatrical productions, which led to an interest in stage magic. A keen interestin the tarot resulted in his publication in 1916 of an excellent series ofarticles on The Secret Doctrine of the Tarot in the occult magazine The Word. In1918 Case met Michael James Whitty, the editor of Azoth Magazine andCancellarius of the Thoth-Hermes Temple in Chicago. Case joined the Chicagogroup and quickly advanced through the grades, becoming the Sub-Praemonstratorof the Temple. His magical motto was Perseverantia (“perseverance”).Shortly thereafter, Case and Whitty worked on a text that formed the core ofCase’s excellent little book of tarot card meditations, The Book of Tokens.Whitty died in 1920 and Case succeeded him as editor of Azoth. It was during thesame year that Case was initiated into the Second Order. Personal problemswithin the temple, combined with differences of opinion with Moina Mathers,resulted in Case resigning from the Order in 1921. In 1923 he created acorrespondence course for his School of Ageless Wisdom in Boston. A few yearslater he moved to Los Angeles and founded a new esoteric school for practicaloccultism called the Builder of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), which is active to thisday. Case wrote a number of important books on tarot, Qabalah, Freemasonry,Rosicrucianism, alchemy, and magic.Practical Magic in the Outer OrderTraditionally only one magical rite was ever given to Outer Order students fortheir own personal use—the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. The figure of thepentagram is undoubtedly the most important symbol in modern ceremonial magic.While this figure has been used in the Western occult tradition since the timeof the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, the modern attribution of the elements tothe five points of the pentagram in the manner most commonly used by magicianstoday was introduced by the Golden Dawn. The elements are assigned to thedirections in accordance with the “four winds” attributions of the ancients:air–east, fire–south, water–west, and earth–north (Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159]).The ritual opens with the Qabalistic Cross, vibrating four Divine Hebrew namesand establishing a cross of Divine Light within the aura of the practitioner.The gestures given are similar to the Christian Cross, and the words are takenfrom the last few phrases of the Lord’s Prayer, which is in turn based upon aQabalistic Hebrew prayer. This Cross is Qabalistic because it is associated withthe sephiroth of Kether, Malkuth, Geburah, Chesed, and Tiphareth. Thesesephirotic energy centers are activated within the magician’s auric sphere byphysical gestures, visualizations, and vibration of names and words of power.These spheres also represent a balancing of the four elements within themagician’s aura: Kether—air, Malkuth—earth, Geburah—fire, and Chesed—water. Andalthough the name of Tiphareth is not vibrated, the balancing element of spiritis indicated by the placing of the hands over the heart.[image/Book8_Fig3.png]Figure 3. Elemental Attributions of the PentagramAfter establishing the Qabalistic Cross within the aura, the figure of thepentagram is then traced and visualized at the four cardinal directions,combined with the intonation or vibration of specific Divine Hebrew names.Following this, the magician calls upon four mighty archangels associated withthe elements while imaging their majestic forms on the astral. The magician endsthe ritual by repeating the Qabalistic Cross.More than any other ritual, the Golden Dawn’s Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram hasbeen adopted and employed by magicians and occult groups from all across thespectrum of contemporary magical practice. By far the best known of the GoldenDawn’s techniques, this little ritual is actually quite powerful and containsmost of the techniques used in more complicated magical work. Simply put, it isone of the staples of Golden Dawn practice. “Those who regard this ritual as amere device to invoke or banish spirits are unworthy to possess it. Properlyunderstood, it is Medicine of Metals and the Stone of the Wise.” 11[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-385]There are two forms of this ritual, one for invoking magical energies intosacred space and the other for banishing the same. Respectively, they are theLesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram (LIRP) and the Lesser Banishing Ritualof the Pentagram (LBRP). A banishing ritual is often performed as a preliminarycleansing rite or a prelude to more complex rituals, to clear the area of astralcobwebs beforehand. An invoking ritual has the opposite effect—it is designed tosummon forces into the temple space. Traditionally, students were taught toperform the invoking version in the morning and the banishing in the evening.However, many students employ the LIRP to open a magical working and the LBRP toclose the working down.The LIRP uses the invoking form of the Lesser Pentagram, while the LBRP uses thebanishing form (Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160]).[image/Book8_Fig4.png]Figure 4. Lesser Invoking and Banishing PentagramsThe Lesser Banishing Ritual of the PentagramUse your index figure, a black-handled dagger, or the Outer Wand of Double Powerto trace the figures.1. The Qabalistic Cross. Go to the eastern side (or the center) of the templeand perform the Qabalistic Cross:• Stand and face east. Imagine a brilliant white light touching the top of yourhead. Reach up with the index finger or the white end of the Outer Wand ofDouble Power to connect with this light and bring it to the forehead.• Touch the forehead and vibrate “ATAH” (Ah-tah, meaning “Thou art”).• Touch the breast and bring the white end of the wand or index finger downuntil it touches the heart or abdominal area, pointing down slightly toward theground. Imagine the light descending from the forehead to the feet. Vibrate“MALKUTH” (Mal-kooth, meaning “the Kingdom”).• Touch the right shoulder and visualize a point of light there. Vibrate“VE-GEBURAH” (veh-Ge-boor-ah, meaning “the Power”).• Touch the left shoulder and visualize a point of light there. See thehorizontal shaft of light extending from the opposite shoulder to join thispoint of light. Vibrate “VE-GEDULAH” (veh-Ge-doo-lah, meaning “the Glory”).• Imagine a completed cross of light running from head to feet and shoulder toshoulder. Bring the hands outward, away from the body, and finally bring themtogether again, clasped on the breast as if praying. See a point of lightshining at the center of the brilliant cross. Vibrate “LE-OLAHM” (bow your head)“AMEN” (Lay-oh-lahm, Ah-men, meaning “Forever, unto the Ages”).2. The Pentagrams. Trace a large Lesser Banishing Pentagram. Thrust theimplement through the center of the pentagram and vibrate “YHVH”(Yod-hey-vav-hey.) Keep your arm extended throughout; never let it drop. Thepentagrams should be visualized in white light.3. Turn and walk clockwise to the south and trace the same pentagram there.Charge the figure as before, intoning “ADONAI” (Ah-doh-nye).4. Go to the west and trace the same pentagram. Charge it with “EHEIEH”(Eh-hey-yay).5. Go to the north and draw the same pentagram, this time intoning the word“AGLA” (Ah-gah-lah).6. Invocation of the Archangels. Keep the arm extended. Turn to face the east.Extend both arms out in the form of a Tau cross (a T-shape) and say, “Before me,RAPHAEL.” Visualize before you the great archangel of elemental air rising outof the clouds, dressed in flowing yellow and violet robes and carrying acaduceus wand7. Behind you, visualize another figure and say, “Behind me, GABRIEL.” See thewinged archangel of elemental water stepping out of the sea like the goddessVenus, dressed in robes of blue and orange, with cup in hand.8. To your right, see another winged figure, the archangel of elemental fire,dressed in flaming red and green robes and carrying a mighty sword. Say, “On myright hand, MICHAEL.”9. See the great winged archangel of elemental earth at your left, rising upfrom the vegetation of the ground in earth-toned robes of citrine, olive,russet, and black, holding stems of ripened wheat. Say, “On my left hand,URIEL.”10. Then say, “For about me flames the pentagram, and in the column shines theSix-Rayed Star.”11. Close by repeating the Qabalistic Cross as in the beginning.Practical Magic in the Inner OrderIt is within the Second Order, the R.R. et A.C., where the real work ofceremonial magic begins on a personal, experiential level. Whereas the FirstOrder is a school that teaches students the fundamentals of esoteric knowledgeand prepares them for magical work, the Inner Order is where the student putswhat he or she has learned to practical use. Adepts build and consecrate theirown magical tools (Figure 5[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161]), write and performtheir own rituals based on traditional Golden Dawn formulae, create andconsecrate talismans, practice techniques of skrying and spirit vision work,build and assume the images of godforms, and perform a wide range of advancedtheurgical techniques.Fueling the magic of the Order are practical, active methods for creatingmagical change in the Astral Light, the divine matrix that lies behind themundane veneer of our physical world. Practitioners are taught procedures ofmeditation, visualization, vibration of godnames and words of power, dramaticinvocation, focused intention and willpower, aura control, and the projection ofenergy. All of these techniques are used to hone the magician’s skills andpsychic faculties; they are powerful modes for unlocking latent spiritual powersthat most humans can access only through practice and perseverance.Figure 5. The Elemental Tools of an Adept[image/Book8_Fig5_JamesClark.png]Color is extremely important in the higher grades of the Golden Dawn system,because it is through the proper application of color, as well as through soundsand symbols (“names and images”), that the magician is able to forge a magicallink with the divine intelligences.In addition to creating an elaborate system of color scales, the GD utilizedwhat it called flashing colors. These are essentially the same as complementarycolors used by artists.Complementary colors are two colors that lie directly opposite each other on astandard artist’s color wheel. Flashing colors placed next to each other producean optical “pulsing” effect that is helpful to the magician’s practice.The Exercise of the Middle Pillar is one of the better-known methods forestablishing the central sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life within themagician’s aura, or “sphere of sensation.” By invoking the powers of the holysephiroth with the auric sphere, the magician is able to utilize them forincreased balance, vitality, and awareness. It also strengthens the aura againstoutside influences. Variants of this rite are used for a number of differentpurposes, including healing, the consecration of talismans, and preparation forgodform assumption and communication with the Higher Self. Like the PentagramRitual, the Middle Pillar Exercise has often been co-opted by a wide range ofmodern spiritual traditions without any reference to its Golden Dawn roots.In the basic exercise, the magician visualizes the Middle Pillar superimposedover his or her body, specifically the four sephiroth—Kether, Tiphareth, Yesod,and Malkuth—along with the so-called “invisible sephirah” of Daath, which isused here as a conjunction of the powers of Chokmah and Binah (Figure 6[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162]). The godnames of thesefive energy centers are vibrated a number of times in conjunction with thevisualizations.Israel Regardie held that this simple exercise can increase one’s field ofattention, aid in the achievement of balance and equilibrium, and provide thestudent with a remarkable wellspring of power and spiritual perception. Practiceof the Middle Pillar Exercise is concurrently stimulating and relaxing—itreleases points of tension in both mind and body, often leaving one feelingjoyful, rested, energized, and aligned with the divine forces inherent to theQabalistic Tree of Life.The Exercise of the Middle PillarThis exercise can be performed either standing, sitting, or lying down. Beginwith closed eyes and rhythmic breathing.1. Imagine a sphere of white light just above your head. Vibrate the name“EHEIEH” (Eh-hey-yay) three times or more until it is the only thought in yourconscious mind.2. Imagine a shaft of light descending from your Kether (crown) center to yourDaath center at the nape of the neck. Form a sphere of light at the Daathcenter. Vibrate the name “YHVH ELOHIM” (Yode-heh-vav-heh El-oh-heem). Intone thename the exact number of times that you vibrated the previous name.3. Bring a shaft of light down from the Daath center to the Tiphareth centeraround your heart. Form a sphere of light there. Vibrate the name “YHVH ELOAHVE-DAATH” (Yode-heh-vav-heh El-oh-ah v’-Dah-ath) the same number of times asbefore.4. See the shaft of light descending from the Tiphareth (heart) center into theYesod center in the groin region. Imagine a sphere of light formed there. Intonethe name “SHADDAI EL CHAI” (Shah-dye El-Ch-eye) the same number of times asbefore.5. Visualize the shaft of light descending from the Yesod (groin) center intoyour Malkuth center at the feet and ankles. Vibrate the name “ADONAI HA-ARETZ”(Ah-doe-nye ha-Ah-retz) the same number of times as before.[image/Book8_Fig6.png]Figure 6. The Exercise of the Middle Pillar6. Imagine the Middle Pillar complete. Then circulate the light you have broughtdown through the Middle Pillar around the outside of your body to strengthenyour aura. (Perform each circulation a number of times.)7. Using the cycles of rhythmic breathing, bring the light down one side of thebody and up the other, from Kether to Malkuth and back to Kether. Exhale andvisualize the light descending the left side of the body. Inhale and imagine thelight ascending the right side of the body back to Kether.8. After performing this for a short space of time, imagine the ribbon of lightdescending from Kether down the front of your body to Malkuth and rising up yourback, returning again to Kether. Inhale for rising, exhale for descending.9. Still employing rhythmic breathing, visualize the sphere of Malkuth, then seethe light rise again in a ribbon that spirals around the shaft of the MiddlePillar in the center of your body from Malkuth to Kether. When it reachesKether, imagine a shower of light cascading down the outside of your body as itdescends to Malkuth again. Circulate the light in this manner for some time.10. Finally, focus some of the energy in Tiphareth, the heart center, beforeending the exercise._____The practice of magic involves the invocation of the various forces and energiesthat comprise the building blocks of the manifest universe. Within the WesternEsoteric Tradition, these forces are categorized as the elements, the Qabalisticsephiroth, the planets, and the zodiacal signs. The Golden Dawn developed aunique system for summoning and releasing these energies using the linealfigures of the pentagram and hexagram. The Pentagram Ritual of the First Orderwas expanded to include a series of separate pentagrams for invoking andbanishing the five elements of fire, water, air, earth, and spirit, in additionto the twelve signs of the zodiac. Various forms of the hexagram are used toattract and dismiss the seven planets of the ancients and the ten sephiroth ofthe Tree of Life. Employing these lineal figures resulted in a framework forworking Qabalistic and planetary magic that is systematic, logical, precise, andadaptable to the magician’s specific objectives.[image/Book8_Fig7.png]Figure 7. Planetary Attributions of the HexagramThe hexagram is the symbol of the Ruach Elohim, or “Spirit of God.” This Spirithas two essential principles—masculine and feminine—represented by the trianglesof fire and water in perfect equilibrium. The usual form of the hexagram is thewell-known “Star of David” formation, showing the sephirotic ordering of theplanets. The six points of the figure are attributed to the sephiroth on theTree of Life and their planetary correspondences (Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163]). The two triangles ofthe hexagram are traced in a clockwise motion to invoke and anticlockwise tobanish.[image/Book8_Fig8.png]Figure 8. Four Forms of the Lesser HexagramAnother standard ritual, the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram, is used to establisha protective magic circle of planetary or sephirotic energies in the temple.This ritual is unique in its makeup because it employs four different variationson the basic form of the hexagram (Figure 8[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164]). These four forms arebased on the symbolic images of the elements: the Hexagram of Fire resemblesflames, that of earth looks like the pentacle, that of air bears a likeness to adiamond or spear-head, and that of water resembles a cup. Although they arereferred to as the Hexagrams of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, they are not usedto invoke these elements. Instead, the four hexagram forms reflect the presenceof the planetary forces in the realm of the elements on the astral plane.Pentagram rituals are terrestrial and elemental; hexagram rituals are celestialand sephirotic.There are three parts to the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram. It opens with theQabalistic Cross, then proceeds to the tracing of the four hexagrams, and endswith the Analysis of the Keyword, which refers to the letters I.N.R.I., animportant acronym of the cycle of life, death, and resurrection or rebirthconnected to a host of religious and magical concepts. One of the power wordsemphasized in this ritual is ARARITA, a notariqon or acronym constructed fromthe Hebrew sentence Achad Rosh Achdotho Rosh Ichudo Temurahzo Achad, meaning“One is his beginning, One is his individuality, his permutation is One.”The Lesser Invoking Ritual of the HexagramThis is the general-purpose Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram. It is notdifferentiated for any single planet or force. This is an appropriate ritual forcreating a magic circle wherein a balance of all planetary or sephirotic forcesis desired.1. Opening. Face east and perform the Qabalistic Cross.2. The Hexagrams. Go to the east. Trace the Lesser Invoking Hexagram of Firetoward the east. Thrust through the center of the figure and vibrate the word“ARARITA.”3. Go to the south and trace the Lesser Invoking Hexagram of Earth toward thesouth. Charge the center of the figure as before and vibrate “ARARITA.”4. Go to the west and trace the Lesser Invoking Hexagram of Air toward the west.Energize it by thrusting through the center of the figure and vibrate as before,“ARARITA.”5. Go to the north and trace the Lesser Invoking Hexagram of Water toward thenorth. Thrust and intone as before, “ARARITA.”6. The Analysis of the Keyword. Return to the east and perform the Analysis ofthe Keyword:• Extend your arms out in the shape of the Tau Cross (a T-shape), palms facingforward. Say with feeling, “I.N.R.I.” (Pronounce each letter.) “Yod Nun ReshYod” (Yode-noon-raysh-yode). As you pronounce the names of the Hebrew letters,trace them in the air before you, from right to left.• Return to the Tau Cross position and say, “Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother!Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer! Sol, Osiris, Slain and Risen! Isis, Apophis,Osiris!”• Through the previous oration, gradually raise the arms and lift the headupward. Vibrate strongly and slowly, “IAO.”• Return to the stance of the Tau Cross, saying, “The Sign of Osiris Slain.”• Put your right arm straight up in the air from the shoulder. The left armshould be straight out from the left shoulder so that the position of the twoarms together resemble the letter L. Hands are to be open flat, with palmsforward. Turn your head so that you are looking over your left arm. Say, “L, theSign of the Mourning of Isis.”• Raise the arms overhead to an angle of sixty degrees so that they form theletter V. Keep the arms straight and the palms facing forward. Throw the headback and say, “V, the Sign of Typhon and Apophis.”• Cross the arms on the chest to form the letter X. Bow your head and say, “X,the Sign of Osiris Risen.”• Say slowly and powerfully, “L.V.X.” (Pronounce each letter separately and givethe sign of each as you do so.) Say, “LUX” (lukes).• Remain in the Sign of Osiris Slain and say, “The Light … (hold arms out in theTau Cross position for a moment, then re-cross them again on the chest) … of theCross.”_____One of the standard symbols worn by a Golden Dawn Adept is the Rose Cross Lamen,an emblem of the many occult forces utilized in the Order’s work (Figure 9[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor165]). Within the magician’spersonal practice, the Ritual of the Rose Cross epitomized the Rosicruciannature of the Golden Dawn’s Inner Order. This rite utilizes the Pentagrammaton,or divine “five-lettered name,” referring to the Hebrew name of Jesus, Yeheshuah(YHShVH), as rendered by Christian Qabalists of the Renaissance. It isspecifically the ineffable name of the Tetragrammaton (YHVH) with the letterShin placed in the center of the name to represent the descent of thequintessential spirit into the realm of the four elements. Along with Eth(essence), Ruach (breath), and Eheieh (I am), the Pentagrammaton is one of theHebrew names closely connected with the element of spirit.[image/Book8_Fig9.png]Figure 9. The Rose Cross Lamen of the AdeptIn this ritual, the figure of the Rose Cross is traced at six points: in thecross-quarters as well as zenith and nadir, above and below (Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor166]). A seventh, centralpoint is formed by the magician, standing in the center of the crosses at theend of the rite. The Ritual of the Rose Cross is a straightforward rite forsoothing disruptive forces, both external and internal. Thecross-quarters—southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest—are areas wherethe elemental forces meet, blend, and sometimes clash with each other. Tracingthe crosses in conjunction with the vibration of the Pentagrammaton at thesepoints helps to calm and settle these energies, invoking balance and equilibriumwherever and whenever it is needed.Together, the symbols of the rose joined to the cross present a multitude ofideas: the union of the divine masculine and divine feminine, regeneration andredemption, the blessings of the Christ impulse and consciousness, and strengththrough sacrifice. Additionally, it depicts the four points in space, with afifth at the center. Like the pentagram, the Rose Cross is indicative of spiritruling over matter, but while the pentagram depicts spirit as the head rulingover matter, the Rose Cross portrays spirit permeating the very heart of matter.The pentagram and the Rose Cross are both symbols of protection, but while thepentagram is more appropriate for summoning and dismissing specific energies,the Rose Cross is particularly suited for meditation, protection, balancing,blessing, and healing.[image/Book8_Fig10.png]Figure 10. Tracing the Rose CrossThe Ritual of the Rose CrossThe room should be clear of any obstructions and the altar should be movedaside. The only implement needed will be a stick of incense. A number of otheroptions are also available, including the Outer Wand of Double Power, the LotusWand, the Rainbow Wand, or a Rose Cross Wand.1. Opening. Face east and perform the Qabalistic Cross.2. Rose Crosses. Go to the southeast (SE) corner of the room and face outward.Trace a large cross and circle there with the incense or wand (Figure 11[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167]). As you draw thecross, visualize it in a golden light. The circle should be imagined as flamingred. While tracing this symbol, vibrate the name “YEHESHUAH.” On the lastsyllable, thrust through the center of the circled cross, charging it.[image/Book8_Fig11_JamesClark.png]Figure 11. Movements in the Rose Cross Ritual3. Keep the tip of the implement at the level of the center of the cross andwalk to the southwest (SW) corner of the room. Draw the cross and circle (rose)as before and thrust the implement through the center of the figure, intoning,“YEHESHUAH.”4. Move to the northwest (NW). Trace the figure and intone, “YEHESHUAH.”5. Move to the northeast (NE). Trace the figure and intone, “YEHESHUAH.”6. Return to the SE and complete the circle. Touch the head of the implement tothe cross already drawn there, but do not retrace or intone the name.7. Now move diagonally across the room toward the NW, holding the implementhigh, but stop in the center of the temple and make the Rose Cross directlyabove your head. Vibrate the name “YEHESHUAH” as before.8. With the implement held straight up in the air, walk to the NW corner of theroom. Touch the tip of the implement to the center of the cross alreadyformulated there. Do not retrace the cross or intone the name.9. Move diagonally across the room again toward the SE, but lower your implementand stop in the center of the temple. Trace the Rose Cross below you and vibratethe name “YEHESHUAH.”10. Bring the tip of the implement up and continue to walk to the SE corner.Touch the tip of the implement to the center of the Rose Cross already tracedthere. Do not retrace or intone.11. Move clockwise to the SW and touch the head of the implement to the crossalready traced there.12. Walk diagonally toward the NE, but stop in the middle of the room to touchthe center of the cross above your head. Intone the name “YEHESHUAH.”13. Continue on to the NE and simply touch the implement to the center of thecross already formulated there.14. Move diagonally across the room toward the SW, but stop in the middle of thetemple to touch the cross below you. Vibrate the name “YEHESHUAH.”15. Continue on to the SW corner and simply touch the center of the crossalready formulated there.16. Move clockwise and link up with all the crosses by simply touching theircenters with the wand (NW, NE, and SE). No need to intone as you do so.17. Upon returning to the SE, the site of the first cross, touch the center andpause. Then retrace the golden cross over the original, only much larger. Tracea large circle and vibrate “YEHESHUAH” while tracing the lower half of the redcircle (Figure 12 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168]).Vibrate “YEHOVASHAH” while tracing the upper half of the red circle.[image/Book8_Fig12.png]Figure 12. The Final Rose Cross18. Walk clockwise to the center of the room. Observe all six Rose Crossessurrounding you, all connected by ribbons of light.Spirit VisionOne important area of magical work in the Second Order is skrying, a method ofclairvoyance also known as spirit vision. Within the Golden Dawn tradition,skrying and astral projection can be described as forms of self-hypnosis thatuse symbols as portals into the astral realm in order to effect changes inconsciousness. From these higher levels of awareness, the magician often triesto see the underlying causes of things—to work at a problem from a higher angleor perspective—to get inside the machinery of the universe and see just whatmakes it tick.The Second Order describes three such methods of clairvoyance, although they arenot easily distinguished from one another. These include skrying in the spiritvision (or simply skrying), traveling in the spirit vision (astral traveling orastral projection), and rising on the planes. These three techniques can bedescribed as seeing, traveling, and rising, although they can all be describedgenerally as spirit vision workings. These are controlled astral visions:meaningful and intense experiences that are completely understandable. In thesevisions, the seer maintains complete control over his or her powers of choice,willpower, and judgment. Through these experiences, the magician is able toreach the deepest levels of what Carl Jung called the collective unconscious orwhat Hermetic philosophers called the Anima Mundi, the Soul of the World.The Qabalah teaches that everything in the universe is created or prefabricatedin the astral world of Yetzirah before it manifests in the physical world ofAssiah. The astral plane is a level of reality that is higher than the physicalworld but lower than the divine world. It is a place that is in between: adomain of reflections, images, dreams, and visions. It is sometimes called theTreasure-house of Images and is said to contain the Akashic Records or theAkashic Library. This is a realm comprised of all the memories and experiencesof humanity over the course of history, embedded within the substance of theether.Through spirit vision work, the magician views or enters the astral world andinteracts with angels, spirits, and other entities—working with those archetypesthat exist as a part of his own psychic makeup. But he is also working with theelementals and spirits as they exist out in the greater universe. To interactwith one is to interact with the other. With skill and practice, the seerundergoes an intense daydream-like experience during which visions are seen andinformation obtained.Golden Dawn spirit vision work is usually done by using a skrying symbol. Thiscan be virtually anything: elemental or alchemical triangles, tarot cards,astrological symbols, geomantic tetragrams, sigils, Enochian pyramids, etc. Allof these symbols may be used as astral doorways for visionary work, as well astools for training clairvoyance and other psychic faculties. Traditionally theGolden Dawn employed a series of tattva cards borrowed from Eastern Theosophyand Hindu sources for this purpose. These are a series of emblems that conformto the five basic elements correlated to specific colors and shapes (Table 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor169]).Tattva NameShapeColorElementAkasaOval/eggBlackSpiritTejasTriangleRedFireApasCrescentSilverWaterVayuCircleBlueAirPrithiviSquareYellowEarthTable 3. The Tattvas and Their CorrespondencesThe five basic tattvas are used to create twenty compound or elementally mixedtattvas, which are symbolized by placing a small image of one of the tattvasinside that of a larger one. The three compound tattvas shown in Figure 13[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170] are taken from a set oftattva cards created by Israel Regardie and show the mixed emblems for Earth ofAir, Spirit of Fire, and Fire of Earth.The Order devised a method for using skrying symbols in conjunction with acommon optical effect known as negative after-images, a phenomenon thatdovetails perfectly with the Order’s teachings on flashing colors. Negativeafter-images are the patches of complementary color formed in the retina of theeye by prolonged exposure of the eye to colors of high saturation. Theafter-image continues to appear in one’s vision after exposure to the colorceases. In Golden Dawn spirit vision work, the transition between the symbol andits after-image is used as a trigger for the opening of a portal into the astralworld.[image/Book8_Fig14.jpg]Figure 13. Israel Regardie’s Tattva CardsFlorence Farr and Elaine Simpson briefly described their method and personalexperience of a skrying vision in a side lecture labeled “Flying Roll No. IV,”entitled “An Example of Mode of Attaining to Spirit Vision and What was seen byTwo Adepti”:Rise, and perform the Qabalistic Cross and prayer. Then proceed to contemplationof some object, say a Tarot Trump. […] In this case you should have givenprevious study to the card, as to its symbolism, coloring, analogies, etc. […]Deeply sink into the abstract ideal of the card. […] Consider all the symbolismof the Tarot Card, then all that is implied by its letters, number, andsituation, and the paths connected therewith. The vision may begin by theconcentration passing into a state of reverie; or with a distinct sense ofchange. […] If you are highly inspired, fear not, do not resist, let yourselfgo; and then the vision may pass over you.12[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-384]Farr and Simpson go on to describe what they perceived in a skrying into thetarot card of the Empress.Israel Regardie“Francis” Israel Regardie (1907–1985) was the author of several notable books onceremonial magic (Figure 14[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor171]). Born in England,Regardie’s family moved to Washington D.C. and Regardie spent most of his lifein the United States. He was an enthusiastic student of all things esoteric. In1926, the young Regardie joined the Washington College of the SocietasRosicruciana in America, a non-Masonic Rosicrucian Order that used theinitiation rituals of the Golden Dawn and had some correspondence with WynnWestcott. In 1928, Regardie relocated to Europe to become secretary to AleisterCrowley.By 1932, Regardie was a published author in his own right, with two of his mostimportant books in print that year: A Garden of Pomegranates, which describesthe mystical system known as the Qabalah, and The Tree of Life, a comprehensivetextbook covering virtually every aspect of magic from the perspective of apracticing magician. Publication of The Tree of Life combined with a favorablebook review by Dion Fortune brought Regardie an invitation into the BristolTemple of the Order of the Stella Matutina, one of the primary offshoots of theGolden Dawn. He was initiated into the Order in January of 1933 and made rapidprogress through the grades. He left the Stella Matutina at the end of 1934,having concluded that much of the Order’s teachings would soon be lost. Threeyears later he published the bulk of the Order’s teachings in four volumestitled The Golden Dawn.In 1937, Regardie returned to the US, where he trained as a chiropractor andtherapist. He continued to publish a number of books on magical topics until theend of his life, including The Middle Pillar, The Philosopher’s Stone, TheFoundations of Practical Magic, and Ceremonial Magic. In 1982, he initiated asmall number of Golden Dawn students into the Adeptus Minor grade at a temple inGeorgia.Israel Regardie is often credited as the person most responsible for removingthe veil of secrecy surrounding Western occultism. According to Francis King andIsabel Sutherland, “That the rebirth of occult magic has taken place in the wayit has can be very largely attributed to the writings of one man, Dr. FrancisIsrael Regardie.” ** King and Sutherland, The Rebirth of Magic, 185.[image/Book8_Fig13.jpg]Figure 14. Israel RegardieEnochian MagicThe Enochian system of magic originated from the ceremonial skryings ofEnglishmen Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelly toward the end of the sixteenthcentury. Enochian magic has been a part of the Golden Dawn curriculum since thebare-bones outlines of the initiation rituals were first set down in the foliosof the Cipher Manuscript. Divine Enochian names, as well as the ElementalWatchtower Tablets from which they were taken, are introduced to the student inthe grades from Zelator through Portal. However, the Enochian system is notstudied in depth by the student until he or she enters the Second Order.Within the R.R. et A.C., Enochian magic is employed for invoking powerfulelemental, planetary, and spiritual forces, as well as for spirit vision work inthe various angelic realms represented by the squares on the Elemental Tablets,invocations using the Enochian Calls, and other aspects of the system includingthe Heptarchia Mystica, Tabula Sancta, Sigillum de Emeth, etc.[image/Book8_Fig15.png]Figure 15. Enochian Tablet of the North (Earth)A good example of Enochian as used in the practical workings of the Order can befound in the consecration ritual of the Four Elemental Weapons. The followingexcerpt from the Consecration of the Earth Pentacle calls upon the forces of theEnochian Tablet of Earth (Figure 15[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172]), including the Kingand Seniors of the North. The magician is instructed to take up the Magic Sword,read an Invocation to the King of the element of earth, and trace an invokingpentagram of earth. Following this, the magician traces a Saturn hexagram andreads an invocation to six Enochian Seniors associated with earth:“In the Three Great Secret Holy Names of God borne upon the Banners of theNorth, EMOR DIAL HECTEGA, I summon Thee, Thou Great King of the North, IC ZODHEH CHAL, to attend upon this ceremony and by Thy presence increase its effect,whereby I do now consecrate this Magical Pentacle. Confer upon it the UtmostOccult Might and Virtue of which Thou mayest judge it to be capable in all worksof the nature of Earth so that in it I may find a strong defense and a powerfulweapon wherewith to rule and direct the Spirits of the Elements.” […] “Ye MightyPrinces of the Great Northern Quadrangle, I invoke you who art known to me bythe honorable title, and position of rank, of Seniors. Hear my petition, oh yemighty Princes, the Six Seniors of the Northern quarter of the Earth who bearthe names of: LAIDROM. ALHCTGA. ACZINOR. AHMLICV. LZINOPO. LIIANSA.” 13[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-383]The Order took the Enochian skryings of Dee and Kelly in new directions,crafting it into a fully integrated system of Western magic and spiritualknowledge. “The thing that distinguishes Enochian Magic as taught by the GoldenDawn is that it makes possible an astonishingly effective and powerful synthesisof both theoretical and practical occult philosophy. … In the hands of MacGregorMathers and his colleagues the Enochian system stood revealed as a trueconcourse of all the forces in the microcosm Sephirotic, elemental, planetaryand astral. It fused Kabbalah, tarot, astrology, and geomancy into a unifiedpsychological field.” 14 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-382]It is undeniable that the Golden Dawn’s inclusion of Enochian into itscurriculum helped bring attention to Dee and Kelly’s angelic workings and drivethe current renaissance of interest in their work. Perhaps one of the greatesttributes to the Enochian system is the position of high respect afforded to itby the Golden Dawn; it is considered to be the apex and crowning jewel of theentire system. This is precisely why Enochian is not taught until all otheraspects of the Golden Dawn curriculum have been thoroughly assimilated by thestudent.At the outset, let it be said that a good deal of systematic study will berequired to appreciate the value and subtle significance of this system. It isone of the most amazing magical schemes that I have ever encountered, since itprovides a thorough-going and comprehensive synthesis of the entire magicalsystem of the Golden Dawn. […] Therefore, because it is a synthetic amalgamationof all the Order, the student will find it necessary and imperative to have madehimself thoroughly familiar with all the other items of knowledge taught by theGolden Dawn. He must know his Tarot and Geomantic attributions so well that thenames, symbols and ideas are all at his fingertips—this, naturally, in additionto the basic knowledge items of the Hebrew alphabet, Tree of Life, and theQabalah generally. The formulae of practical Magic derived from the Z-documents,dealing with the symbolism of the Candidate, the Temple, and the Ceremony of theNeophyte Grade will require to be not only memorized and known, but understood.The student will need to be perfectly acquainted with the Pentagram and HexagramRituals, the formulae of the Consecration Ceremonies, the general art ofinvocation, and formulating Telesmatic images, and drawing Sigils.15[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-381]Several Second Order rituals contain Enochian material in varying degrees.Different aspects of the Enochian system are studied in every grade andsub-grade of the Inner Order.The Magic of LightThere is a particular set of Second Order teachings collectively known as the ZDocuments, the Z Docs, or simply the Zeds, which can be found in IsraelRegardie’s The Golden Dawn.These manuscripts explain how various aspects of the Order’s Neophyte Ceremonycan be used as ritual formulae for endless varieties of practical magicprocedures. One of these documents is known as Z.2: The Formulae of the Magic ofLight.The Magic of Light refers to the Golden Dawn’s formula of practical magic, thevarious forms of which are hidden under many layers of symbolism within theNeophyte Ceremony.There are five divisions of the Magic of Light, representing five differentareas of occult work. These are classified under the five letters of Yesheshuah,the Pentagrammaton.All works of ceremonial magic, including evocations and invocations, fall underthe letter Yod and the element of fire. The consecration of talismans and theproduction of natural phenomena (rains, storms, earthquakes) fall under theletter Heh and the element of water. All works of spiritual development andtransformation fall under the letter Shin and the element of spirit. Thiscategory is further divided into three types of magic that correspond to thethree Yods or flames of the letter Shin. (These three flames are furtherassigned to the three Mother Letters: Aleph—Invisibility, Mem—Transformations,and Shin—Spiritual Development.) All forms of divination and astrology fallunder the letter Vav and the element of air. Lastly, all works of alchemy fallunder the letter Heh Final and the element of earth.It is within these five divisions of practical magic that the magician begins tobring all aspects of the Golden Dawn system together. Everything that thestudent has learned up to this point is utilized: the study and memorization ofthe Hebrew alphabet, Qabalistic principles, astrological correspondences,meditation, visualization, dramatic invocation, vibration, flashing colors,projection of energized willpower, assumption of godforms, various rituals ofthe pentagram and hexagram, and Enochian magic. All of this knowledge becomespart and parcel of the ritual tool kit of the practicing Golden Dawn magician.Adepts study the outlines of magical rites provided in the Z.2 document tocreate their own unique versions of the same in fully expanded rituals. IsraelRegardie supplied readers with rituals that he had created based on the Z.2outlines as examples, but he also admonished students not to slavishly copy orsimply cut and paste his versions. Skilled students are fully expected tofashion their own personal rituals using their own ingenuity and inspiration.Having the ability to create one’s own effective rituals in this manner is oneof the hallmarks of the advanced magician.Advice for the Modern PractitionerToday’s Golden Dawn magicians have many options that were unavailable to theirVictorian age counterparts. Several Golden Dawn temples and orders exist today.Some are traditional, others not so much. Some groups mix other elements orspiritual traditions with Golden Dawn teachings. There is nothing inherentlywrong with this, so long as these groups make these distinctions clear toprospective members.But you would be well advised to do your homework before joining any group. Askquestions in the magical community. Read books. Don’t believe every claim youread on the internet. Better to work on your own than get involved with asketchy teacher or a scam operation.Self-initiation is also an option. Most of the original Golden Dawn’s sidelectures, supplementary Flying Rolls, and curriculum from Neophyte throughZelator Adeptus Minor have been published and are readily available for anyinterested student who is dedicated enough to pursue the studies on their own.One does not need to be a member of any acknowledged organization or temple todo the Work. There are probably many more people practicing solo or in smallgroups than is generally realized. The Golden Dawn current is very much aliveand relevant in a world that could use a little more balance and sacredness ofthe kind stated in the Tiphareth clause of Adeptus Minor obligation:“I further promise and swear that, with the divine permission, I will from thisday forward apply myself to the Great Work—which is to so purify and exalt myspiritual nature that with the Divine aid I may at length attain to be more thanhuman and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my higher and divine genius,and that in this event, I will not abuse the great power entrusted to me.” 16[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-380]SourcesCrowley, Aleister. “The Holy of Holies.” In Collected Works of Aleister Crowley,vol. 1.

An early love of music,particularly of the saxophone, resulted in Chic’s many years of experience as alead musician in several jazz, blues, and rock ensembles, working with manyfamous performers in the music industry. His interest in Freemasonry and theWestern Esoteric Tradition resulted in research articles on Rosicrucianism andthe Knights Templar, printed in such publications as Ars Quatuor Coronatorum andthe 1996–2000 Transactions of the Metropolitan College of the SRIA. Chic is amember of several Masonic, Martinist, and Rosicrucian organizations. He is apast Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar in Florida(2010–2011) and is the current Chief Adept of the Florida College of theSocietas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis. A close personal friend andconfidant of Dr. Israel Regardie, Chic established a Golden Dawn temple in 1977and was one of the key people who helped Regardie to resurrect a legitimatebranch of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the United States in theearly 1980s, with an initiatory lineage that dates back to the original Order of1888. He met his wife and co-author, Sandra Tabatha Cicero, shortly thereafter.Chic served as the G.H. Cancellarius of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnfrom 1985 to 1994, and as G.H. Imperator of the Order from 1994 to the presentday.Sandra “Tabatha” Cicero was born in rural Wisconsin. A lifelong fascination withthe creative arts has served to inspire her work in the magical world. Aftergraduating from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee with a bachelor’s degreein fine arts in 1982, Tabatha worked as an entertainer, typesetter, editor,commercial artist, and computer graphics illustrator. In 2009 she obtained adegree in paralegal studies. She met Chic Cicero in 1983, and the Golden Dawnsystem of magic has been her primary spiritual focus ever since. Tabatha spentfive years working on the paintings for The Golden Dawn Magical Tarot, which shebegan at the encouragement of Israel Regardie. Tabatha is a member of severalMartinist and Rosicrucian organizations and is the current Imperatrix of theSocietas Rosicruciana in America (www.sria.org). She has served as the G.H.Cancellaria of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn from 1994 to the presentday.Both Chic and Tabatha are Chief Adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnas reestablished by Israel Regardie (www.hermeticgoldendawn.org), the oldestcontinuously operating Golden Dawn Order in the United States, as well as aninternational order with temples in several other countries.Art CreditsFigure 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor155], Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159]–Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor160], Figure 8[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor164]–Figure 10[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor166], Figure 12[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168], and Figure 15[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172] by the Llewellyn ArtDepartment.Figure 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor158] and Figure 13[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor170] are photographs © Chicand Sandra Tabatha Cicero.Figure 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor161], Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163], and Figure 11[LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167] by James Clark.Figure 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor162] by Mary AnnZapalac.Figure 14 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#_idTextAnchor171] is a scan ofRegardie’s Tattva Cards © Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#_idTextAnchor000]1 [LCBCeremonialMagick04_Book7and8.xhtml#footnote-395-backlink].

In thepresent book, however, we find a unique example of a major magical traditionwith a single founding luminary who is inextricable from the philosophies andpractices of the tradition itself: Aleister Crowley. One of the most importantand influential occultists of all time, Crowley was the founder and “prophet” ofthe system of attainment known as Thelema. A brilliant and controversial genius,Crowley has had a singular influence over the entire field of magick (alwaysspelled with a k in Crowley’s nomenclature) since he burst on the scene at theturn of the twentieth century.Biographical SketchEdward Alexander (“Aleister”) Crowley was born on October 12, 1875, in RoyalLeamington Spa, England, to a prosperous brewing family. Raised in the strictProtestant sect known as the Plymouth Brethren, Crowley was steeped in the Biblefrom early childhood, and deeply internalized its symbol sets and poeticlanguage. While he soon began to question fundamental Christian doctrines, thebiblical mythology and morality he was exposed to in his formative yearsinfluenced his thinking and his personal spiritual development for the rest ofhis life. While attending Cambridge University, Crowley was introduced tooccultism via Karl von Eckartshausen’s The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, and he soonfound himself drawn to the initiatory, magical organization known as theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.1[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-439] Crowley had found thetraining ground he had been seeking, and here his magical adventure began inearnest.Crowley rose quickly through the ranks of the Golden Dawn, and for a time he wastaken under the wing of its cofounder S. L. Mathers. Eventually, a schism withmany of the British members of the order led them to travel together to Paris.Their mutual affection was short-lived, however, and Crowley soon found himselfdisenchanted with Mathers and with the order itself. As he noted some yearslater in Liber Causae:The rituals were elaborated, though scholarly enough, into verbose andpretentious nonsense: the knowledge proved worthless, even where it was correct:for it is in vain that pearls, be they never so clear and precious, are given tothe swine.The ordeals were turned into contempt, it being impossible for any one to failtherein. Unsuitable candidates were admitted for no better reason than that oftheir worldly prosperity.In short, the Order failed to initiate.2[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-438]Disillusioned with this experience, Crowley spent the next several years of hislife immersed in various adventures, both exotic and domestic. He traveled tothe Far East to study Buddhism and meditation with his former Golden Dawncolleague Allan Bennett, continued his hobby of mountaineering, and explored asmany of the world’s religious traditions as he could find, both in theory and inpractice. He married his first wife, Rose Kelly, and settled into a brief periodof domestic life at his newly purchased home on the shores of Loch Ness inScotland, Boleskine House.While on his honeymoon with Rose in Egypt, he experienced the pivotal moment ofhis magical career: the reception of Liber AL vel Legis,3[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-437] also known as The Book ofthe Law. In an experience that by today’s nomenclature would be considered a“channeled” writing, Crowley claimed to have had the Book dictated to him byAiwass, an entity representing the forces of a New Aeon embodied by the Egyptianhawk-headed god Horus, or Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In the years following the reception ofthe Book, Crowley gradually came to feel that the purpose of his life was toserve as the prophet of this New Aeon, in the name of its central Law of Thelema([image/446.jpg]), expressed in the now infamous maxim Do what thou wilt shallbe the whole of the Law. We will discuss the implications of this Law, and thedoctrine of True Will, in the paragraphs that follow. Crowley eventually tookthe magical motto To Mega Therion (The Great Beast), which was simultaneously areference to a figure described in the Apocalypse of John, but also an inversionand extension of that archetype as a positive and regenerative force of freedom,bringing the Law of Thelema to humanity.Crowley dedicated the rest of his life to extending the Law of Thelema into theworld through his teaching and writings, and through his administration of themagical orders he led until his death, the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] and theOrdo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Aleister Crowley died on December 1, 1947, at hisboarding house in Hastings, England.Scientific Illuminism, Syncretism, and the A[image/449.jpg]A[image/449.jpg]After his disheartening experiences with the Golden Dawn, Crowley worked withhis then-mentor George Cecil Jones in 1907 to found theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], his new take on a Qabalistically-based initiatorysystem, which stripped away much of the verbosity and excessive focus ondoctrine found in the G.D. The core approach was termed scientific illuminism,or skeptical theurgy, and was centered on the idea that each aspirant must cometo their own conclusions about beliefs, practices, and their results, based ontheir experience in the system. In essays such as “The Soldier and theHunchback” and elsewhere, Crowley encouraged aspirants to adopt a distinctlyskeptical and investigative approach to their work, and to avoid assuming anydoctrine to be true until verified by inner experience. In Liber Causae, henoted:Should therefore the candidate hear the name of any God, let him not rashlyassume that it refers to any known God, save only the God known to himself. Orshould the ritual speak in terms (however vague) which seem to imply Egyptian,Taoist, Buddhist, Indian, Persian, Greek, Judaic, Christian, or Moslemphilosophy, let him reflect that this is a defect of language; the literarylimitation and not the spiritual prejudice of the man P. 4[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-436]Crowley adopted a syncretic approach to the construction of his new system,bringing in elements of both Eastern and Western traditions. Again, in LiberCausae he wrote that he had constructed the system by “choosing only thosesymbols which were common to all systems, and rigorously rejecting all names andwords which might be supposed to imply any religious or metaphysical theory.” 5[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-435] More than any initiatorysystem that had come before, Crowley’s A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] synthesizeda great number of practices drawn from Hindu yoga, Buddhist, and Taoisttraditions, alongside such traditional Western elements as Qabalah, astrology,tarot, Enochian studies, and ceremonial magick. His system included many of thephilosophical traditions with which he had become acquainted during his tenurein the Golden Dawn, such as Neo-Platonism, Hermeticism, Rosicrucianism, and theEgyptian pantheon. It also carried forward many of the magical techniques he hadlearned in the G.D., such as astral travel, the vibration of God-Names, and theuse of a vast system of Qabalistic correspondences of various words, phrases,colors, gods, spirits, incenses, and much more, as codified in his referencetext 777.6 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-434][image/Book9_Fig1.png]Figure 1. The Tree of Life with the Grades of the A∴A∴In addition to the integration of these diverse traditions and practices,Crowley’s aim with the system of the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] was to improvethe efficiency of training. He stripped away the preliminary Knowledge Lecturesof the Golden Dawn’s system, generally expecting that those attracted to hissystem would be able to “bootstrap”’ themselves through these materials largelythrough self-study in the early grades of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. He alsocondensed the system of the grades themselves. For example, the array oftraditional invocation and evocation rituals, construction of talismans andmagical implements, Enochian work, and scrying techniques, which would have onlybeen encountered in the Second Order of the original Golden Dawn, were nowpresented openly in the earliest stages of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] (Figure1 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor174]). Almost nothing inthe curriculum of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] was held back from public view,save for the initiation rituals themselves and a few key words and ritualprocedures. In all of this, Crowley’s guiding maxim was “Mystery is the Enemy ofTruth.”Perhaps the most dramatic change in Crowley’s revised system was thenear-complete removal of any social context for training. Aside from theearly-grade initiations, there are no group rituals inA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], and the order incorporates none of the social orfraternal aspects of groups like the Golden Dawn and many others. There are no“lodges” or “temples” in the conventional sense, and instruction is accomplishedentirely through an aspirant’s personal contact with a single assigned“Superior.” Crowley’s aim was to remove the interpersonal dramas, socialstatus-seeking, and similar drawbacks that in his view had compromised theinitiatory integrity of the Golden Dawn.The Holy Guardian AngelThe Holy Guardian Angel (or HGA) is Crowley’s term for that force, aspect ofconsciousness, or external entity that many other traditions have spoken of asthe Higher Self, the Augoeides, the Higher Genius, and innumerable other names.Crowley discussed the Holy Guardian Angel in different ways at various stages ofhis life, and with considerable variation depending on his audience and hisintention. At some points, he described the Holy Guardian Angel as if it weresynonymous with the Higher Self—an aspect of our own conscious or unconsciousexistence. At other times, he quite definitively characterized the Holy GuardianAngel as an external entity of some sort. For example, his experience with hisown Holy Guardian Angel, Aiwass, was of such a quality during the dictation ofThe Book of the Law that he perceived it as an external voice dictating to him.In the system of the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], from the very beginning, thepath toward the “Knowledge and Conversation” (K & C) of the HGA is of singularimportance. All of the tasks in the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] curriculum upto the Adeptus Minor (Tiphareth) grade are designed to be stepping stones towardthe K & C. These tools come in several varieties: magical rituals, meditation,the gradual raising of the kundalini through various practices, devotionalpractices, and much more; but all of these are simply tools to be used to attainKnowledge and Conversation. After the K & C, when the knowledge of the True Willis consciously and deeply ingrained in everyday living, one can choose to do amagical ritual and be assured that it is in line with the True Will. This israrely the case before K & C.There is communication with the HGA well before Adeptus Minor, to be sure, butit tends to be experienced through the vehicle of the unconscious mind, andveiled in the language of symbol. The experience of this is such that one maynot sense a conscious communication at all for quite some time, but onegradually improves the ability to speak in this language of symbol; hence therequirement in A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] and other orders to memorize variousmagical “correspondences,” for such symbols are in one sense the “native tongue”of the Angel.Eventually, the aspirant begins to perceive these communications in a much moredirect and conscious manner. In the system of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], theso-called Vision of the Holy Guardian Angel is attributed to Malkuth, which isthe sephira of the Neophyte (1°=10 [image/473.jpg] ) grade. It is often in theNeophyte grade that aspirants begin to have more of these consciouscommunications. It is a courtship—a gradually increasing and intensifyingintimacy, a gradual improving of our ability to perceive the language of the HGAin our lives. Finally, at the Adeptus Minor (5°=6 [image/473.jpg] ) grade, thebreakthrough of Briatic consciousness into our previously Yetzirah-bound mindforges a conscious link to the HGA. Thus, the defining characteristic of thetrue Adept of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] is that he or she can communicatewith the Angel consciously and at will.The True WillThe core of the philosophy and religion of Thelema is to be found in the worditself: thelema is the Greek word for will. This “True” Will is understood to bemuch deeper than the simple will of the ego or the whims of the personality. Itis one’s life purpose, or basic nature, and the living out of that nature acrossthe individual lifetime and even multiple incarnations.The True Will is the will of the deepest inmost Self—the core of who one trulyis as a spiritual being. Also, and importantly, it is an expression of theuniversal will, as particularized and expressed in the individual life. All toooften, the True Will is erroneously conceptualized as a singular choice of acareer or a single task to be accomplished in life. This is far too narrow adefinition, as the True Will is the essence of one’s real Self. It encompassesactions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and it pertains to the way onelives, moment to moment, as well as the entire arc of one’s lifetime. Clearly,the True Will is much, much more than a choice of career or a single life taskto complete. There is often, however, a great deal of overlap between the TrueWill and what one chooses to spend one’s time doing in life—one’s occupation orfavorite hobbies, for example. The True Will is very likely to overlap withone’s passions, interests, and preferences. On the other hand, we’ve establishedthat this is not the simple will of the ego-personality (or, in the terms ofQabalistic psychology, the ruach). Sometimes aspirants find that their TrueWill—which ideally the ego facilitates—is not necessarily comfortable norparticularly harmonious with the ego’s conceptions of itself. Often, thediscovery of the True Will forces one to make painful choices about lifestyle,priorities, career, relationships, and many other things. Such growth processesare painful precisely because they make one stretch outside the comfort zone;but in this case, the aim is to harmonize these egoic choices in the day-to-daylife with the deeper needs of the soul and the commandments of the HGA.The True Will should equally explain one’s choices in any given moment, and inany given situation, just as well as it explains the overall path of one’s life.When contemplating one’s True Will, one should try to take a step back from theeveryday circumstances, career and life choices. The True Will explains the wayone affects the universe, the choices one makes, and the paths one tends totake, whether one happens to be a stockbroker in New York City, a fisherman inMalaysia, or anything else. In other words, this central truth of Self willexpress itself in a certain way regardless of the mundane situations in which anindividual finds themselves.The process is incredibly individualized, and no two seekers will experience itspeaks and valleys in the same way. It may be said without exaggeration that theaspirant must think of themselves as the prophet of their own Angel—as the highpriest or priestess of a religion that is theirs alone. The aim of that religionis to deepen, intensify, and delineate with ever-increasing clarity the mysticaland magical procedures that effectively invoke the Holy Guardian Angel. Thedevelopment of this religion is essentially the work of the aspirant in theearly stages of their journey. The body and mind are the vessel in which theAngel abides. The purpose of this vessel is to live out the True Will, which isthe voice of the Angel in one’s everyday life.As mentioned earlier, the understanding of the True Will takes a quantum leapforward with the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Thisattainment typically climaxes as a result of intensive and focused ritual (suchas the classic Abramelin approach) at the Adeptus Minor grade ofA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], corresponding to the sphere of Tiphereth on theQabalistic Tree of Life. With this attainment, the supernal realm of theneshamah—the spiritual intuition and the voice of the Angel itself—becomesapprehensible to the conscious mind for the first time.The spiritual and mystical import of the True Will concept is self-evident fromthe discussion above; however, it carries implications for magical practiceworthy of deep consideration. Most importantly, Crowley believes that when amagician is fully aware of their True Will, they are able to make more efficientchoices about which magical aims to pursue, and when and how. Since the TrueWill of the individual magician is by definition the Will of the Universe andaligned with natural law, the magician’s choices will therefore be aided by themomentum of the universe itself, much like a boat sailing with the currentrather than against it. Indeed, Crowley’s basic definition of magick itself is“the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.” 7[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-433] This applies equally tomundane, everyday actions as to traditional forms of ritual magick.The doctrine of True Will has important interpersonal and societal implicationsas well. In his essay “Duty,” Crowley writes:Abstain from all interferences with other wills. […] To seek to dominate orinfluence another is to seek to deform or destroy him; and he is a necessarypart of one’s own Universe, that is, of one’s self. […] The essence of crime isthat it restricts the freedom of the individual outraged. […] Crime being adirect spiritual violation of the Law of Thelema, it should not be tolerated inthe community. Those who possess the instinct should be segregated in asettlement to build up a state of their own, so to learn the necessity ofthemselves imposing and maintaining rules of justice. […] The ultimate aim isthus to reintegrate conscience, on true scientific principles, as the warden ofconduct, the monitor of the people, and the guarantee of the governors.8[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-432]An Overview of the Methods and Tools of A[image/449.jpg]A[image/449.jpg]9[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-431]There is no shortage of published material concerning the system of theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], in terms of its overall approach and its trainingmethods. This is certainly by design, as Crowley intended the methods andmaterials of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] to be widely accessible and, in time,widely replicated. There is plenty of available material concerning what thesystem is, yet it is rare to find cogent and practical discussion of why and howthe system works. In this section, we will explore the reasons why the methodsand tools of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] are arranged the way they are, whythey unfold in a certain manner across the grades ofA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], and how they lead the aspirant toward the K & C ofthe HGA and beyond.There is a specific technology here, to be sure, but it tends to be discussed interms of a grade-by-grade analysis, such as the way the tasks and the nature ofeach grade are attributed to the four elements or the corresponding sephiroth.We will consider it from this perspective as well, but also go beyond thatapproach and shift the focus to the type of training that occurs along the way.Our exploration here is not drawn directly from the writings of AleisterCrowley. Rather, it is an attempt by the present author to convey the essence ofthe system as a practical methodology.The system of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] below Tiphereth can be arranged intofive training “tracks”—essentially, five different types of tools that worktogether to bring the aspirant to Knowledge and Conversation. These fivetraining tracks unfold concurrently across the first order grades (Probationerthrough Dominus Liminis). We will briefly outline the five tracks and then cyclethrough and discuss each of them in more detail. Obviously, it is not possibleto discuss every task assigned in A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] in this place.10[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-430] Rather, we will emphasizethe key practices that exemplify the five training tracks, and show how theycomplement each other in the unfolding path of the aspirant.Track One: The development of magical skills and techniquesTrack Two: The training of the mind—to focus, to empty, to become, and to remainreceptiveTrack Three: The stimulation and activation of the chakras and the raising ofkundaliniTrack Four: Devotional practicesTrack Five: Balancing the psycho-magical constitutionBefore we look at these in detail, it should be emphasized that everything inthe A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] system below Tiphereth—everything leading up tothe 5°= 6 [image/473.jpg] grade of Adeptus Minor—is devoted solely to theaccomplishment of the K & C of the HGA. It is easy to lose sight of this, due tothe diverse nature of the tasks assigned and the many traditions that are woventogether in the system. Furthermore, every aspirant has their own prejudices andpredispositions that may lead to magical myopia. In any case, the whole point ofthe system is not to accumulate a grab bag of unrelated magical techniques, butto become fully oneself. The aspirant must attain the K & C of the HGA, anddiscover with certainty the True Will. Then they must carry out that will withforce and precision.Track OneTrack one is the development of magical skills and techniques. This track isactively worked from the very earliest stages of theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]—as early as Probationer.ProbationerThe Probationer is likely to be experimenting with a full spectrum of magicaltechniques, but by the time of the passage to Neophyte (assuming theProbationary year is successful), there will be even more specific emphasis onthe traditional magical tools. Somewhat like learning an alphabet, one simplyhas to master the basics, and let them form a foundation for all that comesafter. The focus here is on pentagram and hexagram ritual forms (Lesser,Greater, Supreme, etc.) as well as on developing competence with thecorresponding elemental, planetary, and zodiacal invoking and banishing rituals.Karl GermerThough Karl Johannes Germer is best known as the successor of Aleister Crowley,his true legacy is the corpus of Thelemic literature he saw published during hislifetime. Recognized as a Master of the Temple and chosen by Crowley to succeedhim as head of the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] and O.T.O., Germer made it hislife’s work to spread the Law of Thelema by preserving and publishing Crowley’swritings.Karl Germer and Aleister Crowley met in Germany in 1925 after being introducedby Hans Traenker. Germer was starstruck and became Crowley’s devoted student andcolleague. Establishing the Thelema Publishing Company with Crowley in 1929,Germer initiated the publishing program that he would carry on until his death.He eventually became Crowley’s right hand and managed the affairs of the O.T.O.as Grand Secretary General while acting as Crowley’s representative in theUnited States.Maintaining the well-being of Crowley was Germer’s first priority for as long asthe two men knew each other. Even Germer’s choice of wives was influenced bythis devotion to Crowley, as their personal wealth and ability to supportCrowley and his activities were primary considerations before a marriageproposal. As Crowley’s health declined in post-war England, Germer ensured thathe received frequent shipments of luxuries and basic goods from the US. Thisexpense was largely shouldered by the members of Agape Lodge in Los Angeles,whose dues and donations were primarily earmarked to support publishing andCrowley’s care packages.As Crowley’s viceroy in the US and chosen successor, Germer found himselffrequently at odds with the local leadership of Agape Lodge and quickly becamefrustrated when their priorities appeared to diverge from his own. He saw theSouthern California group as mostly a social venue where little serious work wasbeing done to advance the Law of Thelema. The mystic in him felt that theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] was a better vehicle of the Thelemic Current thanthe O.T.O. and that neither would survive if there was no foundation ofpublished literature to support them. After Crowley’s death, Germer devoted mostof his time, energy, and the finances of the O.T.O. to bringing Crowley’sremaining unpublished work to print. Such titles as Magick Without Tears, TheBook of Thoth, and Liber Aleph would not be available today without his efforts.Agape Lodge closed in 1949 and no further O.T.O. initiations were conductedduring Germer’s lifetime. He turned his attention to hisA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] students and finding sources of funding for thepublishing program. Upon his death in 1962, he left no successors or plans forthe continuity of either order. The O.T.O. eventually reconstituted itself, butthe A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] splintered into multiple claimant groups headedby Germer’s remaining students. Though this failure to appoint suitable heirswould seem to leave a shadow over Germer’s legacy, his diligence in preservingCrowley’s body of work is what enables these organizations to continue to existand the Law of Thelema to have the reach it does today.—Andrew FerrellAndrew Ferrell currently serves as the Vice-Chancellor and Grand Praemonstratorof the Temple of the Silver Star. As TOTSS Librarian and Archivist, Andrew isdedicated to preserving and sharing the printed legacy of Aleister Crowley, KarlGermer, Jane Wolfe, and Phyllis Seckler. He is an initiate of the O.T.O., anaspirant to the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], and a lifelong student of theMysteries. In the remaining hours of the day, he is an IT professional andenjoys talking and playing with his three dogs, “The Secret Chiefs.”NeophyteThe Neophyte is essentially formulating their own “astral atlas.” There may alsobe experimentation with the Enochian system (although this is not specificallyassigned until the Practicus grade) as well as various Solomonic and Goetictechniques.What is essentially happening here, by design, is that much of the traditionalinstruction that would have occurred in the old Golden Dawn’s Second Order isbeing handed to the Neophyte right at the outset, with only the preparation ofProbationer as a preliminary. These skills are drilled in from the verybeginning of the system—but why? It may not be immediately obvious why theability to correctly perform a pentagram or hexagram ritual, or any of theseother techniques, is necessarily related to the path toward Knowledge andConversation. But consider: if one cannot design a ritual to effectively invokea fundamental aspect of nature, such as a particular element or planetaryinfluence, and make oneself an adequate vessel for the invocation andutilization of that specific force, how can one design the ultimate ritual ofinvocation—that of the HGA? The basics simply must be mastered. To be sure,learning any specific ritual form, such as a hexagram ritual, is in itself oflittle consequence; but as a tool for developing the capacity to invoke, safelycontain, and direct magical force, it is invaluable.The Neophyte is also trained and tested in the control of the Body of Light, andin the related techniques of scrying and so-called astral projection. TheNeophyte is tested by his or her Superior in these procedures, to ensure theNeophyte has developed adequate facility with the Body of Light in order tocompetently explore the astral realms. This skill is important because theability to speak the language of symbol, which is the natural language of theastral world—and of the subconscious mind—is directly related to the aspirant’sgrowing capacity to receive consciously the various communications from the HGA.While initially, in the path of the aspirant, these impulses will likely be moreor less subconscious—speaking through dreams and intuitive flashes of variouskinds—the more consciously one can speak and understand this language, thecloser one is to conscious communication with the Angel.PracticusThe Practicus moves on to work with divination. Why is this necessary? Keep inmind that divination is yet another method of using the conscious mind toreceive subtle impressions from a set of symbols, and if one cannot sit downwith a set of universal symbols like the Tarot or the I Ching and get somethingapprehensible and useful out of them, how can one possibly begin to tune intothe subtle impressions that will be coming from the HGA? How can one build theright sort of spiritual ‘radar,’ with the necessary level of sensitivity toperceive the message of the HGA, if one cannot execute something as basic as aTarot reading?PhilosophusThe Philosophus is tasked with mastering evocation and working with talismans.How do these practices lead the aspirant toward K & C? Consider the basic natureof evocation: it is the ability to externalize magical force, particularized toa specific form and type of energy of the magician’s choosing. For example, theevocation of a particular spirit into a triangle requires the ability to tapinto a specific energy source, and to effectively utilize the correct magical“muscles” to bring it down into manifestation. Whether one sees such an act aspurely psychological or as an interaction with an actual external entity, onestill has to have manifested something concrete; and by doing so, the aspirantstrengthens the skills to interact compellingly, vibrantly, and effectively withthe HGA when the time comes. We do not mean to imply that the nature of K & Cwill be exactly the same as that of conversing with a Goetic spirit; however,the skills strengthened by perfecting evocation will be directly applicable tothe eventual K & C working.Similarly, the ability to create and consecrate powerful talismans is animportant preparation for K & C. What is the nature of a talisman? It is aphysical object imbued with a specific force as chosen by the magician. And whatis the aspirant, if not a talisman of the force of the HGA? If one cannot imbuea physical talisman with a specific force as simple as Mercury, for example, howcan one possibly make the entire being a conscious talisman of the influence ofthe HGA?Track TwoTrack two is the training of the mind to focus, to empty, and to become andremain receptive. Here we have another set of tasks that is very likely to beapproached from Probationer onward. While one can choose whatever practices onelikes as a Probationer, it is very important to have some exposure to the basicsof asana (postures) and dharana (concentration practices). Through these rajayoga practices, the aspirant is beginning to develop skill in stilling andfocusing the mind, and training it to become receptive to subtle impressions. Inaddition, through the use of reflective meditations and study of the Holy Books,the aspirant will strengthen his or her ability to gain deeper understanding ofimportant arcana of all sorts. Why is this important? Perhaps it is ratherself-evident that if one cannot get the mind to be quiet—if one cannot still theflurry of everyday thought and allow the mind to become receptive to subtleimpulses for something as simple as meditating on a line of text or a redtriangle—how can one possibly achieve sufficient stillness of mind for theultimate “meditation” of the final K & C working?These raja yoga practices continue across the First Order grades, climaxing withDominus Liminis. For example, Liber Turris 11[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-429] is assigned in thePracticus and Philosophus grades to strengthen the ability to destroy thoughtsat their source in the brain. Liber Yod,12[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-428] for the Dominus Liminis,serves as training in bringing the entirety of the mind to a single point offocused intensity. All of these practices, placed here just as the aspirant ison the final approach to Tiphereth, are entirely consistent with the aim of theDominus Liminis to harmonize all the work done in the Order so far, and to aimwith one-pointedness to the K & C of the HGA.Finally, we have the practices of Liber Jugorum,13[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-427] which develop theaspirant’s control of thought, word, and deed. The Practicus attempts to controlspeech, the Philosophus action, and the Dominus Liminis thought. Why? If onecannot control one’s speech in everyday life, how can one compose and deliverthe most perfect invocation of the HGA? If one cannot control everyday actions,how can one create the perfect ritual to invoke the HGA? If one cannot controleveryday thoughts, how can one, at that supreme moment of focus, direct allone’s attention to the HGA? The control practices of Liber Jugorum strengthenmany magical muscles necessary for ultimate success in the Great Work.Track ThreeTrack three involves the stimulation and activation of the chakras and theraising of kundalini—the divine, life-giving, regenerative force resident inevery human. Through various practices, this life force can be intensified andapplied in specific, targeted ways to transformational processes in the body, inthe mind, and in the subtle energy centers with which the magician works.Many Probationers will be working with asana, and this practice is preliminaryto more advanced kundalini work. Formal testing on asana is not required untilthe Zelator grade, where one must sit perfectly still in front of one’s Superiorfor a full hour before being passed. When there is sufficient facility withasana, it is appropriate to begin working with pranayama—the control of breath.This also may start as early as Probationer, but formal testing does not occuruntil Zelator. One of the important things to note about this testing ofpranayama is that the desired results (often described as “fine perspiration”and “automatic rigidity”) are in fact early signs of kundalini activity. Theseare just the beginning stages, but it is evident that even at the level ofZelator, work is being done to initiate the flow of kundalini, and concreteresults are beginning to manifest. In practice, these early results assist withthe growing awareness of ecstatic energy states in the mind-body apparatus, andwith the conscious direction of this energy to desired ends.This process is greatly amplified through the practices given in Section SSS ofLiber HHH,14 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-426] which isassigned to the Practicus of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. This beautiful andpowerful practice—an instruction in Thelemic tantra—involves the consciousmovement of energy between the base of the spine and the brain. The aspirantconceives of these opposite poles as being Hadit and Nuit, (essentially, thedivine masculine and feminine archetypes in the Thelemic pantheon) and builds upa sort of courtship between them. After much extended practice, typically overthe course of many days or longer, the aspirant brings the work to a climax asthese poles are at last allowed to unite in ecstasy. What is the utility of thispractice in terms of our training? In addition to the considerable mysticalbenefits, any such practice where the aspirant becomes a conscious vessel ofmagical force, and learns to direct it in a targeted fashion, is a means ofdeveloping important magical skills.As with the other training tracks, the process of raising the kundalini is offundamental importance in the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] system. In a veryreal sense, the kundalini is the fuel that potentiates all the transformationswe undertake in this system. All of the willed transformations of self are givenmore potency by virtue of this energy being raised and applied in the intendedmanner. Additionally, and very importantly, the spiritual ecstasy that occurswhen these kundalini-related practices are brought to their conclusion is initself transformative, healing, and evolutionary; its nature is to potentiatethe transformation of the human into the more-than-human. The experience of this“divinized” ecstasy is so important in the path toward K & C that it can’t beoverstated. By the time the aspirant has completed the work of the first fewgrades of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], the consciousness of the divine natureof this ecstasy should be so acute and so vivid that the very idea of God—theidea of our HGA—is the “sexiest” thing imaginable. Likewise, sex itself comes tobe perceived as inseparable from holiness—it is, in fact, true worship of Nuitwhen practiced mindfully.Track FourTrack four consists of devotional practices—the bhakti yoga of theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] system. While this work is especially assigned tothe Philosophus grade, corresponding to Netzach, the aspiration, the devotion,the fire, the passion for the path itself, and the progress toward union withthe Angel are not new to the aspirant. Indeed, it is highly unlikely that anaspirant would even progress to the Philosophus grade at all without having beenfueled by intense devotion and aspiration all along the way. All the truth andbeauty that enraptures the aspirant, that unfolding mystery for which theycontinually reach, that siren song that calls them onward—all of these aresimply one or another aspect of the Holy Guardian Angel active in their life andconsciousness.As noted earlier, these muscles of devotion and aspiration are cultivated mostpointedly in the grade of Philosophus, corresponding to the sephirah Netzach;for it is just at this moment on the path, when one is nearly ready to begin theformal K & C working, that one must fully light the fires of aspiration. The keydevotional instruction formally assigned to the Philosophus is Liber Astarte velBerylli.15 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-425] This is abeautifully constructed work in which one essentially creates one’s ownreligious system devoted to a chosen deity. It is clear from the instructions inthe book that the point here is to gain practice in the art of worship—toexercise and strengthen the muscles of devotion, so that in the very nearfuture, as one undertakes the K & C working, one can direct this newlystrengthened ability toward one’s own HGA. This makes a good deal of sense,since it is unlikely that the Philosophus has full conscious contact with theHGA, and will therefore need other gods, symbols, and images as “stand-ins.” Inpractice, this need tends to diminish quickly as the aspirant nears theclimactic experiences of the Dominus Liminis and Adeptus Minor grades, and theHGA increasingly instructs them in all the essentials of their true religion,and they take their rightful place as the “prophet” of their own Angel.Track FiveTrack five is the balancing of the psycho-magical constitution. The aspirantmust prepare themselves as a grail or other vessel for the indwelling of thelight of the Angel. If the aspirant’s development is unbalanced, the grail willtopple. If they have failed to build themselves into a seamless and solidvessel, the grail will leak. They must fashion themselves into the perfect formthat, by its design, invokes the desired force—the light of the HGA.One way to conceptualize the process of attaining this balanced form is embeddedin the passage through the elemental grades of the First Order ofA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. At each grade, the aspirant builds a symbolicweapon to symbolize and concretize the inner changes occurring in that grade.These elemental weapons correspond, of course, to the four elements of earth,air, water, and fire, but we can also understand them in the context of CarlJung’s four functions of the psyche: sensation, intuition, thinking, andfeeling, respectively. The pantacle (disk) is the weapon of earth, Malkuth, andsensation; the dagger is the weapon of air, Yesod, and intuition (spiritualintuition often first manifests through the subconscious, which is attributed toYesod); the cup is the weapon of water, Hod, and thinking; and the wand is theweapon of fire, Netzach, and feeling, aspiration, and desire. Additionally, atthe Dominus Liminis grade, the magick lamp is constructed as a symbol of thecrowning of spirit over the other four elements. All of these things—the fourelements, the four functions of the psyche, the four weapons—are representativeof the balanced development of the psycho-magical constitution. By traversingthese grades in a stepwise and balanced manner, one can indeed fashion oneselfinto a perfect grail for the light of the HGA, for it is said that a god willnot indwell a temple improperly prepared.Jane WolfeJane Wolfe (1875–1958), Soror Estai, was an American silent film characteractress, magician, and Thelemite. Chiefly, she is remembered as a skilled,graceful and persistent administrator. She helped found the Ordo Templi OrientisAgape Lodge in Pasadena, California, and for some time was the Lodge Master. Itis no exaggeration to say that she was one of the people who kept the O.T.O.alive in the difficult years following Crowley’s death. She was also a skilledmagician.Her early years were focused on practical things. Wolfe studied stenography, andworked in this field for ten years in New York. An attack of neuritis put an endto that pursuit, and she moved into acting, first in the theatre and then in thefledgling motion picture industry. She relocated to Los Angeles with KalemStudios, and became a leading character actor. Her best-known film effort was asecondary role in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, a Mary Pickford movie, made in1917.During her first years in California, Wolfe discovered spiritualistic practices.In the fall of 1913, she was given a copy of the book Magic, White and Black byFranz Hartmann. This book, subtitled The Science of Finite and Infinite Life,Containing Practical Hints for Students of Occultism, could be said to haveinfluenced much of her later life in the way it tied personal discipline, inparticular the control of the mind, to spiritual attainment.This book whetted her interest in esotericism, and her biographer, PhyllisSeckler, documents that in August 1917 Wolfe used a Ouija board to contactseveral spirits. In 1918 she began to experiment with automatic writing, withthe help of L. V. Jefferson. She connected with a spirit named “Fee Wah,” whoappeared periodically throughout the rest of her life, according to herbiographical record.In 1918 Wolfe began corresponding with Aleister Crowley, and two years later sherenounced her career in Hollywood to join Crowley at his Abbey of Thelema atCefalù, Sicily. The Abbey was a magical retreat/school modeled on the principlesof Thelema and the training system of the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. Shelived there from 1920 until its closure in 1923.Enough of Wolfe’s diary entries have been conserved that we know how sheprogressed during her time at Cefalù. The students did daily magicaldevelopmental studies of beginning A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] degrees. Dailywork included pentagram and hexagram rituals and Thelemic solar adorations.Wolfe also became adept at pranayama, asana, and dharana. These magicalpractices were taught to her directly by Crowley, and are carefully documentedin her diaries. Her work there resulted in her admission as a Probationer in1921.Wolfe is most inspirational for her early mystic tendencies, gradually broughtunder her own control through her studies, and the management of both her mindand body. She seemed naturally at ease with astral workings, and at the sametime, she skillfully used her own body to enhance and enable spiritual states.It is clear from her history that the discipline she developed using thepractices learned at Cefalù greatly enhanced her ability to reach and controlmystical states.—Harper FeistHarper Feist is a member of the O.T.O. and Local Body Master at Leaping LaughterOasis (Minneapolis), and is also a member of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg].Outside, but related to, her spiritual pursuits, Harper holds a PhD in physicalchemistry and is a martial artist, practicing the Japanese art of iaido. Herprimary historical interests surround the intersection of magic and science inthe Medieval and Renaissance periods, but she is also fascinated with the morepersonal history of her nineteenth- and twentieth-century magical grandmothers.Ritual Construction TechniquesCrowley was a master at extracting doctrines and practices of true value fromthe verbose (and often corrupted, incomplete, or mistranslated) source materialsof Western magical traditions. One of his greatest gifts to modern magicalpractice is his analysis of the components of effective ritual, outlined mostsuccinctly in various chapters of Magick in Theory and Practice.16[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-424] These include banishing,purification, consecration, general invocations, the oath or proclamation,specific invocations, bringing down the magical force, the completion of thework, and the License to Depart. While these basic components do not varysignificantly from prior approaches, Crowley showed great ingenuity in his workwith them over his lifetime, employing ecstatic states, sexual acts,psychoactive substances, dramatic action, and finely crafted poetic invocationsrather than the often turgid and verbose tools of past traditions.Banishing is a traditional term used for the clearing of the physical, mental,and spiritual space in which the magician is working. Crowley typically employedtraditional rituals such as the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram,which cleanse the microcosmic and macrocosmic realms, respectively.Purification is a further cleansing of the magician and the space, typicallysymbolized as a washing with elemental water. The aim is to remove any unwantedor superfluous energies that might sully the purity of the magician’s mental andphysical space. Consecration, often seen as an action of the element of fire andcarried out through the use of incense, elevates the purified magician/space bylinking and dedicating it to the sacred aim of the rite.The general invocation is, as the term implies, a general raising of divineforce. Any invocation that achieves this aim for the magician is a candidate foruse, but common examples from the Western Hermetic and Thelemic traditionsinclude the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia, the First Call of the Enochiansystem, and the Priest’s portion of the Anthem from Crowley’s Liber XV: TheGnostic Mass:Thou who art I, beyond all I am,Who hast no nature and no name,Who art, when all but Thou are gone,Thou, centre and secret of the Sun,Thou, hidden spring of all things knownAnd unknown, Thou aloof, alone,Thou, the true fire within the reedBrooding and breeding, source and seedOf life, love, liberty, and light,Thou beyond speech and beyond sight,Thee I invoke, my faint fresh fireKindling as mine intents aspire.Thee I invoke, abiding one,Thee, centre and secret of the Sun,And that most holy mysteryOf which the vehicle am I.Appear, most awful and most mild,As it is lawful, in thy child! 17[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-423]The oath or proclamation is the magician’s statement of purpose for the riteand/or an actual taking of an oath to execute the rite. With this act, themental conception of the ritual’s aim (thought) is translated into a conciseverbal summary (word), and is then accomplished by the completion of the ritualitself (deed).The specific invocation harnesses the generic force brought forth by the generalinvocation, and particularizes it to the specific energies necessary forcompletion of the ritual. Specific invocations may be ritualized, as in the caseof the various Invoking Rituals of the Pentagram (for the four elements) or theHexagram (for planetary and zodiacal forces). Specific invocations may also bepoetic in nature, such as a set of stanzas dedicated to calling forth aparticular deity, spirit, or other entity, as in this excerpt from Crowley’sevocation of Bartzabel, the Spirit of Mars:Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!Send forth a spark of thine illimitable light and force, we beseech Thee, thatit may appear in the Heaven of Mars as the God Elohim Gibor.O winged glory of gold! O plumes of justice and stern brows of majesty! Owarrior armed with spear and shield! O virgin strength and splendour as ofspring! That ridest in thy Chariot of Iron above the Storm upon the Sea! Whoshootest forth the Arrows of the Moon! Who wieldest the Four Magick Weapons! Whoart the Master of the Pentagramand of the blazing fury of the Sun! 18[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-422]Once the specific, desired magical force is present, it must be brought downfrom the highest, ineffable spiritual realms through increasingly dense astralplanes, and finally into the physical world, so that the force may be used toconsecrate the talisman, magical weapon, eucharist, or other “magical link” tocomplete the rite. This may be accomplished through the poetic invocationitself, as in the excerpt above, where we see the divine force, embodied byElohim Gibor, brought down to the archangelic realm as manifested in Kamael, andthe angelic “choir” the Seraphim. Subsequent stanzas of this invocationparticularize the force further to the intelligence Graphiel and then finally tothe spirit Bartzabel itself.Once the talisman or weapon is consecrated or the eucharist consumed, the riteis concluded by the License to Depart—a dismissal of the spirits called forth,returning them to their proper abodes.The Ordo Templi Orientis and the Integration of Sex MagickAround 1912, Crowley came into contact with Theodor Reuss, who was the leader ofthe Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). The O.T.O. claimed to be an AcademiaMasonica, or a repository of esoteric rituals and practices of the Freemasonictradition. They also claimed to possess a “supreme secret” supposedly drawn fromtantric sexual practices that had been learned by adepts traveling in the East.According to Crowley, Reuss contacted him because Crowley had unknowinglypublished this supreme secret in The Book of Lies,19[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-421] and he wanted Crowley tokeep secret the full details. Crowley was admitted to the O.T.O. and eventuallyentrusted with the leadership of the order in the United Kingdom.The introduction of sex magick and mysticism into Crowley’s magical toolkit wasnothing short of revolutionary. Sex magick rites gradually began to replace manyof the more elaborate ritual techniques of traditional Western magick thatCrowley had learned in the Golden Dawn. Crowley’s work with sex magicktechniques would dominate his personal magical practice for decades to come,documented in his Rex de Arte Regia diaries and elsewhere. In parallel withthese developments, Crowley was simultaneously coming to terms with his own roleas the Prophet of Thelema and the New Aeon. Remarkably, the central cosmologyand pantheon of the New Aeon was inherently tantric, in the broad sense, andperfectly suited for implementation in a sex magick context: Nuit, the skygoddess and the embodiment of infinite possibilities, resembles the traditionalShakti, while her consort, Hadit, is the force of aspiration itself, not unlikeShiva. The product of their ecstatic union, the god Ra-Hoor-Khuit, or Horus, canbe understood as an emblem of that spiritually awakened consciousnesscharacteristic of the New Aeon: free, forceful, unashamed, and in harmony withuniversal Will.Jack ParsonsJohn Whiteside “Jack” Parsons (1914–1952) was a pioneer in the field of rocketscience, a writer, and an occultist. He experimented with early rocket engines,developed solid rocket fuel, and co-founded Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Hiscontributions to science led NASA to name a crater on the moon in his honor. Healso figures prominently in the history of Thelema in the early twentiethcentury because of his involvement with the Ordo Templi Orientis andA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], his own magical work, and the small body ofwriting he left behind.Jack Parsons was initiated into the O.T.O. in 1941 at Agape Lodge in SouthernCalifornia, the only functioning O.T.O. body at the time. He later entered theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] as a student under W. T. Smith. Parsons advancedquickly in those systems and demonstrated a great deal of personal charm andleadership. Aleister Crowley eventually named him Master of Agape Lodge when hewanted to replace W. T. Smith. Parsons’s tenure at the helm of Agape was notwithout controversy. At times, word of his ritual magick would alarm evenCrowley.One of his Parsons’s documented rituals, known as the Babalon Working, wasconducted with the assistance of a young pre-Scientology L. Ron Hubbard. Fromthat operation came a document called Liber 49, which purports to be the fourthchapter of The Book of the Law. The Babalon Working was intended to invoke thegoddess Babalon into manifestation on the physical plane. Parsons believed thatthe ritual brought his second wife, Marjorie Cameron, into his life, and hesuspected her to be an incarnation of Babalon. The Babalon Working was a pivotalmoment for Jack Parsons, and the visions he received during that time greatlyinfluenced his later work and writings.After taking the Oath of the Magister Templi in 1948, Parsons called himselfBelarion Antichrist and positioned himself against what he viewed as the tyrannyof Christianity. He authored a document called The Book of the Antichrist, whichcontained a manifesto calling for freedom against religious and socialoppression.The most well-known of his written works is an essay titled Freedom Is aTwo-Edged Sword, in which Parsons expounds eloquently on freedom, sexualliberation, government control, the power of women, Babalon, and other aspectsof liberty as held by the Law of Thelema, “Do what thou wilt.” Symbolically,Parsons describes the sword of freedom as having a two-edged blade, where oneedge is the exercise of liberty and the other, the responsibility of the freeindividual to ensure the liberty of others.Parsons’s occult activities attracted the attention of the F.B.I., and at onepoint his security clearance was temporarily revoked, preventing him fromworking on government contracts. He left the O.T.O. in 1945 and continued hiswork with the occult and with dangerous chemicals until his death in 1952, whenan accidental explosion in his garage took his life at the age of thirty-seven.Regardless of the sensational aspects of his life, Jack Parsons can be viewed asa champion of the Thelemic principle of liberty. His life of science wasdedicated to freeing humanity from the bonds of gravity. His occult life wasdedicated to freeing the soul from the veils of the material world. But it isthrough his few written works that we get a picture of what drove him. Hispassionate writing is infused with energy and consistently articulates a themeof attaining personal freedom. Jack Parsons bore the torch of Thelema in itsearly days, and he can be remembered for his vision of what an advanced society,free from the bonds of repression, might look like.—Rex ParsonsRex Parsons has been pursuing his True Will as a star in the body of Nuit since2010 e.v., if not well before that. He is an initiated member of the Ordo TempliOrientis and a former officer of 418 Lodge, O.T.O., and serves as a Temple Chiefin the Temple of the Silver Star. In 2016 e.v., he was ordained a Priest ofEcclesia Gnostica Catholica. He regularly officiates celebrations of Liber XV,the Gnostic Mass, and performs other functions of the clergy. He is acontributor to the first two volumes of Daughters of Babalon, available fromLulu.com. He currently lives in the valley of Sacramento, CA.In published writings such as Liber Nu,20[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-420] Liber Had,21[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-419] and Liber H.H.H., Crowleywrote powerful and beautiful instructions on the mystical application of theseforces, while his writings on their use in sex magick were largely reserved forthe private papers of the highest degrees of the O.T.O. However, some hintsabout these magical applications of sexual energy can be found in writings suchas Amrita,22 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-418] Magick inTheory and Practice, and elsewhere. The basic concept is that the generativeforce, which naturally resides in all humans as a function of procreation, canbe harnessed and directed to specific magical aims in service of the will of themagician. Before this can be safely and effectively done, however, the magicianmust undergo rigorous training: a purification of the sex force, stripping awayany accretions of societally based shame or negativity, followed by theconsecration of the force to divine aims, all fueled and supported by themagician’s training in yogic concentration techniques.Aside from his compelling interest in the O.T.O.’s sex magick secrets, Crowleycame to view the order as a primary vehicle of promulgating the Law of Thelemain the world at large, as well as a custodian of his own literary legacy. Herestructured the order as a model of an ideal society that would allowindividuals to exercise their True Will without undue restriction, while alsooptimizing the order’s self-regulatory, creative, and governmental functions. InLiber 194: An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order,Crowley (writing as Frater Baphomet, his motto as the head of the O.T.O.) notes:By the study of [the Order’s] Balance you may yourself come to apprehension ofhow to rule your own life. For, in True Things, all are but images one ofanother; man is but a map of the universe, and Society is but the same on alarger scale. […] [The order] combines monarchy with democracy; it includesaristocracy, and conceals even the seeds of revolution, by which alone progresscan be effected.23 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-417]While the membership of the O.T.O. was relatively miniscule in Crowley’slifetime, the order today has thousands of members worldwide. In accordance withCrowley’s wishes, the O.T.O. functions as the custodian of his literary estateand maintains an impressive archive of Crowley’s personal writings, magicalimplements, and other artifacts.Key Rituals and PracticesCrowley was an incredibly prolific writer, and his output included countlessbooks, essays, poems, plays, and even book reviews—but for magicalpractitioners, his creative and in some cases revolutionary rituals are the coreof his legacy. It is beyond the scope of this book to examine all of these indetail, but it may be useful to explore several key ritual writings in outline.Rituals of the Pentagram and HexagramCrowley adopted the traditional forms of these fundamental rituals when helearned them during his tenure with the Golden Dawn. He somewhat controversiallymade them publicly available in The Equinox,24[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-416] along with many of theG.D.’s initiation rituals, and he later presented radically revised adaptationsof these rituals in The Book of Lies, in the form of the Star Ruby (pentagram)and the Star Sapphire (hexagram). While these revised versions do not serveprecisely the same purposes as the traditional forms, they do represent some ofCrowley’s earliest efforts to integrate his new Thelemic cosmology andphilosophy into basic ritual practices. Also, contrary to the statements of somecommentators, Crowley continued to teach the traditional forms of these ritualsto the end of his life.Liber Resh vel Helios 25 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-415]Partially inspired by the Islamic custom of multiple prayer sessions spreadthroughout the day, Crowley developed the solar adorations contained in LiberResh and assigned them to students as a basic daily practice. The aim is toalign the magician’s consciousness with the stations of the sun—dawn, noon,dusk, and midnight—through symbolic identification with the ThelemicizedEgyptian deities Ra, Ahathoor, Tum, and Khephra, respectively.The Mass of the Phoenix 26 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-414]First published in The Book of Lies, the Mass of the Phoenix is another ritualrecommended for daily use, and like Liber Resh involves the magician identifyinghim- or herself with the sun at dusk. It is a eucharistic ritual that climaxeswith the consumption of a “Cake of Light” (essentially a small cookie scentedwith cinnamony Oil of Abramelin) that has been dabbed with a small amount of themagician’s own blood.Liber V vel Reguli 27 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-413]Described by Crowley as the “Ritual of the Mark of the Beast: an incantationproper to invoke the Energies of the Aeon of Horus, adapted for the daily use ofthe Magician of whatever grade,” 28[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-412] Liber Reguli isessentially a special application of a pentagram ritual involving a simultaneousinvocation of the four elements as well as spirit itself. As the quote abovesuggests, this is an explicitly Thelemic ritual, calling upon Therion, Babalon,Nuit, and Hadit, and employing averse (i.e., rotated so as to appear upsidedown) pentagrams.Liber Samekh 29 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-411]While living at his Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily, in the early 1920s,Crowley wrote Liber Samekh for his student Frank Bennett. It was designed to beused as a months-long ceremonial working for Bennett to invoke his Holy GuardianAngel, and is a masterpiece of ritual construction and (especially) ritualcommentary. In the “Scholion” that follows Liber Samekh’s ritual text, we findsome of Crowley’s most profound and direct writings on the nature of spiritualillumination, and some of his most detailed descriptions of the visualizationsand other inner work to be used by the magician during the performance of theritual.Liber Pyramidos 30 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-410]Originally written as a self-initiation ritual, Liber Pyramidos employs a unique“pyramidal” temple layout, and was designed to be a distillation of (andundoubtedly, in Crowley’s mind, an improvement upon) the Neophyte initiation ofthe Golden Dawn. Its ritual formulae are distinct and powerful and can be usedquite effectively as temple opening and closing ceremonies.Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass 31[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-409]Conceived as the central public and private ritual of the Ordo Templi Orientisand its Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (Gnostic Catholic Church), the Gnostic Massis one of the crowning examples of Crowley’s ritual writing genius. The Massunfolds as an interplay between the Priest, Priestess, and Deacon, who can beseen as representing the Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury of alchemy and the threegunas of Hindu philosophy. It incorporates ritual themes and structures from theRussian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Masses, as well as magical formulae drawnfrom Egyptian and Greek traditions. In many ways, it is a veiled ritualenactment of the technical secret at the center of the O.T.O.’s teachings, andit can be profitably studied in this light.The Priestess is seated upon the altar and is (at her option) nude. Clothed ornot, the Priestess can be seen as a representation of Nuit and the embodiment ofdivinity itself. The Priest, meanwhile, functions as a symbol of the aspirationto the divine—the Hadit force within each of us that yearns for ecstatic unionwith Nuit. The fruit of that union is seen as Ra-Hoor-Khuit, formulated as aEucharist of wine and a Cake of Light that is consumed by the Priest. Eachmember of the assembled congregation also partakes of the Eucharist, as anaffirmation of their participation in the mystery of the Mass that has just beenenacted.During the Mass, the Deacon and the congregation recite the Creed, which isworthy of study as a concise statement of core Thelemic assumptions about thelaws of the universe that underlie the magick of the Mass.The CreedI believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the Company ofStars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in oneFather of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent ofthe Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein allmen are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her nameBABALON.And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His nameBAPHOMET.And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love andLiberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA.And I believe in the communion of Saints.And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritualsubstance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle ofIncarnation.And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is tocome.AUMGN.

AUMGN.32 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-408]As the central public ritual of the O.T.O./E.G.C., the Gnostic Mass is presentedregularly at many locations around the world and is one of the best ways towitness Thelemic ritual presented within the living culture of Thelemiccommunities. Any reader with even a passing interest in the magick of AleisterCrowley is strongly encouraged to attend a Gnostic Mass.Post-Crowley Magick in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries: Chaos Magickand BeyondAs a man bridging the Edwardian and early modern eras, Aleister Crowley was amagician of our time. This made him uniquely positioned to be seized upon as ahero by the counterculture of the 1960s, and to become the leading figure of theoccult revival that followed, decades after his death. Crowley was hugelyinfluential on figures such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, theChurch of Satan’s Anton LaVey, and experimental filmmaker Kenneth Anger.Crowley’s collaboration with Gerald Gardner in the early twentieth century laidthe groundwork for the emergence of the modern witchcraft/Wicca tradition andthe broader neo-pagan movement. Likewise, several of Crowley’s students went onto be important thinkers and writers in their own right, including IsraelRegardie, Austin Osman Spare, and Kenneth Grant. These initiates contributed tothe post-Crowley world of magick well into the late twentieth century, and theirsuccessors have continued their work to the present day.Phyllis SecklerPhyllis Seckler (Soror Meral) was one of the leading individuals responsible forestablishing Thelema and the modern Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) in California.She was a IXº of the O.T.O. and an adept of the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg],and founded the College of Thelema. Her dedication to Thelema lives on in anumber of organizations, as well as personally within her students.Born in Canada in 1917 as Phyllis Evelina Pratt, Seckler later moved toCalifornia and worked as an art teacher, raising her young children after theend of her first marriage. She started taking acting lessons, and through herdrama teacher at the time, Regina Kahl, she was introduced to Agape Lodgemembers, and even lived in the Lodge for a period of her life. (Aleister Crowleyhimself would later express delight at her sketches illustrating theinteractions among the various individuals at Agape Lodge!)Seckler was received into the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] by Jane Wolfe in1940, and after Wolfe’s death in 1958, she received personal instruction fromKarl Germer, head of both the O.T.O. and the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], whorecognized her as having achieved Knowledge and Conversation of the HolyGuardian Angel and the grade of Adeptus Minor 5°= 6 [image/473.jpg]. During thistime, Seckler typed out copies of central Thelemic writings such as The Visionand the Voice, Liber Aleph, and other key texts so that they would not be lost.Many of these texts would later be published and achieve a wide circulation.Additionally, she spent a segment of her life married to Grady McMurtry, anotherkey figure in the early history of the modern O.T.O. Together they initiatedmany of the earliest members of the modern O.T.O. in the United States. In 1979,she became the founding Master of 418 Lodge, a position she would continue tohold until her death a quarter century later.Throughout her life, Seckler worked tirelessly to establish and grow a number ofkey Thelemic organizations in California, including the Ordo Templi Orientis,College of Thelema, Temple of Thelema, Temple of the Silver Star, andA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. Her writings included many essays in her journalIn the Continuum, which contained a selection of key writings by AleisterCrowley not easily available in print, as well as her own writings on Thelema,magick, tarot, Qabalah, and other topics. (See the “Additional Reading[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchorx11]” section.)Seckler died peacefully among loved ones in 2004. Today, many of her personalstudents are among the most prominent and well-known writers and speakers incontemporary Thelema.—Lauren GardnerLauren Gardner, PhD, is a counselor, educator, and psychotherapist in privatepractice in Chapel Hill, NC. Her esoteric background includes significanttraining in Golden Dawn, A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], Raja Yoga, and severalrelated systems and traditions. Her doctoral dissertation examined theexperiences of Pagans in psychotherapy.Crowley’s experimental and often transgressive approach to magick helped shapethe so-called “chaos magick” movement. The work of magicians such as PeterCarroll and Phil Hine can easily be traced to the rule-breaking aesthetic ofCrowley’s corpus. Likewise, figures such as Genesis P-Orridge, Robert AntonWilson, and Timothy Leary picked up Crowley’s tools of mind- and culture-changeand transmuted them into their own symbol sets and modes of work. P-Orridgechanneled his efforts into the musical groups Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV,and even founded a magical order of sorts, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY).Author Robert Anton Wilson explicitly discussed Crowley’s philosophies in hiswritings, both fiction and nonfiction, and has been an initial source ofinspiration for many aspirants who have gone on to work with Crowley’s systems.Psychologist, LSD advocate, and counterculture icon Timothy Leary needs nointroduction. While his broader work is well known, under the surface was a deepaffinity for the mind-expanding and libertarian focus of Crowley’s writings.Leary was even known to quote Crowley’s “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole ofthe Law” maxim when appearing on television shows.Crowley was the first prominent modern magician to live in the era of Freud,Jung, and other proponents of the depth psychology field. While his explicitexploration of this movement appears to have been rather fleeting, there is nodoubt that he was undertaking work of a parallel nature. With Freud, he sharedan appreciation of the importance of the sex force, and Jung’s work withcomparative religion and philosophy from the psychological point of viewmirrored Crowley’s attempts to translate his own similar research into magicalpractice. Crowley’s essay “An Improvement on Psychoanalysis,” published inVanity Fair in 1916, is his most complete analysis of depth psychology as heknew it. It should be noted that this was written well before Jung’s mostimportant writings on alchemy and other esoteric traditions, and one wonderswhat Crowley would have thought had he ever reviewed Jung’s mature work, or thetranscendent Red Book,33 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-407]which was not published until many decades after Crowley’s death.Crowley’s efforts to integrate Eastern meditative techniques into the canon ofWestern magick prefigured the rise of a culture-wide fascination with yoga,tantra, and all things Eastern. His passionate support for the sexual liberationof humanity found itself powerfully expressed in the “free love” movements ofthe late 1960s, and the greater awareness and celebration of the diversity ofsexuality and gender fluidity that is currently visible in our culture. To besure, much work remains to be done to secure humanity’s ultimate freedom, andthe forces of superstition, intolerance, bigotry, and oppression are never farfrom our doorstep; but Aleister Crowley’s magick—and indeed the whole of hislife’s work—is a potent example of one seeker’s path to find the liberationinherent in living his own True Will.Organizational ContactsUnlike many of the traditions described in this volume, Thelema exists intoday’s world as a living, growing community, embodied in the work of manyorganizations, large and small, and an even greater number of unaffiliatedindividual practitioners. Among these are two of the organizations formerly ledby Crowley himself, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and theA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg], as well as more recently developed trainingoptions such as the Temple of the Silver Star (totss.org). More informationabout these organizations is easily found online, but a few additional words arewarranted regarding the A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] (Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor175]).A[image/449.jpg]A[image/449.jpg]Since the death of Karl Germer (Crowley’s successor as the Head of the Order) in1962, there has been no universally acknowledged governance ofA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg]. After Germer’s death, multiple claimants arose,each with its own leaders and its own (sometimes rather tangled) history. Theonly manifestation of A[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] the present author andeditors can personally vouch for in terms of its historical legitimacy, thecompetence of its leaders, and the linkage of its administrative Triad to thespiritual roots of the Order is the one that may be contacted viaonestarinsight.org. This is not to denigrate the work of otherA[image/2.jpg]A[image/2.jpg] claimants—we know with certainty that muchimportant work is being done by initiates of these organizations.[image/Book9_Fig2.png]Figure 2.

Ultimately, your own personal spiritual attainment will be the bestindicator of the wisdom of your choice.Grady McMurtryMajor Grady Louis McMurtry (1918–1985) is best known for reviving the OrdoTempli Orientis as Hymenaeus Alpha X°, after the death of Karl Germer, FraterSaturnus X°.McMurtry joined the Order in June of 1941, taking both Minerval and I° on thesame day. Then World War II intervened and McMurtry joined the cause in Februaryof 1942, taking him away from Agape Lodge but resulting in his meeting AleisterCrowley that October. By November of that year, Crowley elevated McMurtry to theIX° with the motto Hymenaeus Alpha (777). In several letters (1942–1947) Crowleydeclared McMurtry to be his Caliph, or spiritual heir, and gave him authority“to take charge of the whole work of the Order in California. … Thisauthorization is to be used only in emergency.”The death of Karl Germer in 1962, without designating an heir, created such anemergency. Phyllis Seckler, Soror Meral IX°, began contacting Order members andinforming them of Germer’s demise. When she contacted McMurtry about it, theybegan plans to rebuild the Order based on McMurtry’s authorization from Crowley.She helped him move back to California, and they began meeting with survivingmembers of the Order. Only a few were still interested, most having lostconnection during the years in which Germer refused to let the Order initiate ordo any organizing or activities.During McMurtry’s leadership, the Order legally defended its right to Crowley’sliterary heritage and began publishing and initiating again, includingincorporating the Order to give it firm legal standing in 1971. By October of1977 McMurtry created Thelema Lodge in Berkeley, California, as the Grand Lodge,or center of operations. He was quite charismatic and encouraging to the youngpeople of the ’70s, and the membership quickly expanded. From less than a dozenmembers, the Order grew to having several local bodies across the US, withmembership in the hundreds. It also began forming and implementing many of thecommittees and ruling bodies needed to fulfill Crowley’s design for the Order.Today the Order’s membership is counted in the thousands, with local bodies inover twenty-five countries and five Grand Lodges around the world.—Marlene CorneliusMarlene Cornelius was born a Thelemite.

The temples of Egypt where theWestern magical tradition has its roots were built to honor many gods andgoddesses. The Neoplatonist thinkers who fused magic with Greek philosophy tocreate the first fully developed Western occult traditions were Pagans who madeofferings to the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece. It was only after theChristian minority seized political power in the classical world and made Paganworship a crime punished by death that magic had to be adapted to the newregime, and very often the adaptations in question were fairly transparent: thusgods and goddesses were redefined as planets in astrological magic, as sephirothin Cabalistic magic, and as saints and angels in Christian folk magic.The occultists who revived ceremonial magic in the nineteenth century made useof these various redefinitions but rarely noticed the Pagan subtext hardwiredinto them. A millennium and a half of enforced Christianity had reshaped mostWestern magical traditions from top to bottom. Furthermore, many of the peoplewho helped relaunch Western occultism in those years were themselves Christiansto one degree or another, and most others were unwilling to face the socialbacklash that anyone who renounced Christianity could expect to suffer. Manyyears passed before such projects as Dion Fortune’s public rites of Isis andPan34 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-406] resulted in therebirth of full-blown polytheist religions in the Western world.Even when that happened, polytheist approaches to ceremonial magic remained fewand far between for too long. While such pioneering Neopagan movements asGardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca borrowed certain elements from ceremonialmagic, those borrowings were used to flesh out traditions of religious ritualand folk magic; the broader possibilities open to the ceremonial magician weretoo rarely explored from that perspective. Remarkably often, too, the ceremonialelements brought into these Neopagan religions still had their full quota ofJudeo-Christian symbolism. It was thus quite common in the late twentiethcentury, for example, for Wiccans who claimed to reject the Judeo-Christian Godand all his works to invoke that god by his Hebrew names in the Lesser Ritual ofthe Pentagram, and call on four staunchly Judeo-Christian archangels to boot.Gerald GardnerGerald Gardner is rightly known as the father of the modern witchcraft movement,but his work is a synergy of many magical streams that came before him, mostnotably Freemasonry, nineteenth-century Romantic paganism, and earlytwentieth-century ceremonial magick.Gardner himself was a Royal Arch Mason, and seems to have borrowed several basicconcepts from that august organisation, most notably the three degree initiatorysystem that is at its foundation. Masons have also traditionally referred totheir system as the Craft, a term that is now also commonly used by modernwitches.Gardner’s Masonic affiliations were noted by Aleister Crowley in his diary whenGardner came to Crowley’s residence for tea on May Day in 1937, a meeting thatwould lead to Gardner becoming initiated into the magical order run by Crowley,the Ordo Templi Orientis.35[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-405] Crowley also sold severalbooks to Gardner, including a copy of The Blue Equinox, which would have asignificant impact on Gardner’s own work.A study of Gardner’s early notes for his Book of Shadows (or Ye Bok of Ye ArtMagical, as it was originally called) shows that he cribbed a great deal fromCrowley, as well as from the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnand grimoires such as the Key of Solomon (itself translated by Golden Dawnleader S. L. MacGregor Mathers).36[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-404]For example, Gardner’s witchcraft rituals often begin with the “casting of thecircle,” wherein the witch calls upon the Four Watchtowers. This is a conceptoriginally dating from the Enochian magick of Dr. John Dee, court magician ofQueen Elizabeth I, later used by the Golden Dawn, and which Gardner probablylearned from reading Israel Regardie’s publications of Golden Dawn material.Gardner’s Book of Shadows also contains a version of the Golden Dawn LesserBanishing Ritual of the Pentagram that appears to have been taken fromRegardie’s work.The text of Aleister Crowley’s famous public ritual The Gnostic Mass was a hugeinspiration for Gardner, and he used several passages from it to form the basisfor some of the witchcraft rituals he wrote, specifically the Drawing Down theMoon rite, the February Eve Sabbat, and the Charge of the Goddess. Gardner alsoseems to have used some aspects of the O.T.O.’s secret initiation rituals whenformulating his witchcraft initiation ceremonies.Gardner’s work, although undoubtedly highly influential, is far from being an“authentic” tradition passed down by word of mouth from the pre-Christian era.Instead, Gardner’s witchcraft is an amalgamation of many different threads ofceremonial magick practice, skillfully woven into a tapestry that evokes thoseancient ways in the spirit of the practitioner.—Rodney OrpheusRodney Orpheus is an Irish musician, writer, and technology designer. He haspublished two books, Abrahadabra: Understanding Aleister Crowley’s ThelemicMagick and Grimoire of Aleister Crowley, and produced a couple of dozen records.He currently resides in London with his wife, Sulinna, and their cats.A reaction against this sort of awkward pastiche was inevitable. During the lastfew decades of the twentieth century, as a result, the occult community in muchof the Western world was riven by the unhelpful notion that Paganism andceremonial magic were incompatible. To the very limited extent that this wastrue, it was purely a function of the fact that nearly all the living traditionsof ceremonial magic active at that time invoked the Christian God through ahybrid Jewish-Christian Cabala and treated Pagan gods and goddesses as purelysymbolic images. All that was necessary to break down the imaginary barrierbetween Pagans and ceremonial mages was the development of systems of ceremonialmagic that, like the equivalent systems of the ancient world, invoked thedeities and symbolism of polytheist faiths instead of the Christian God andJewish and Christian symbolism.With this in mind, beginning in 2008, I developed a system of ceremonial magicthat used the technical methods of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, themost richly elaborated of modern magical systems, but took its symbolism fromthe traditions of modern Druidry. The basic teachings and practices of thatsystem saw print in 2013 in my book The Celtic Golden Dawn and found anenthusiastic audience. One of my central projects since then has focused onworking out ways to develop a more broadly based approach to polytheistceremonial magic, since Druidry makes up a modest fraction of the modernmovement of nature-centered spiritualities. The result is the system presentedin the pages that follow.Like the one I presented in The Celtic Golden Dawn, this system derives from therituals and practices of the Golden Dawn tradition. Is that the only kind ofmagic that can be adapted to the needs of the polytheist mage? Of course not.The Golden Dawn tradition is the system of ceremonial magic I’ve practiced mostintensively over the years, however. If you happen to be an initiate of adifferent system of ceremonial magic and want to adapt that to polytheist use,the rituals given here may provide some inspiration in that project.Requirements of Polytheist Ceremonial MagicThe rituals and practices that follow require little in the way of hardware andprops, but they have two important requirements. The first requirement is thatyou have some relationship with a traditional pantheon of gods and goddesses.How you choose to relate to the pantheon in question is purely up to you. Therelationship may be anything from a sympathetic appreciation of symbols andmyths to daily worship at the altars of your gods, but you’ll need some suchconnection in order to use what follows. What’s more, whatever your religiousand spiritual opinions happen to be more generally, the more you treat the godsand goddesses as real beings in your magical workings, the better the resultswill be.Two cautions are worth mentioning here. First, don’t mix pantheons in yourmagical work. If your broader spiritual life includes personal relationshipswith deities of two or more traditional pantheons, that’s fine, but choose onepantheon to work with in your ceremonial magic, and stick with that. A pantheon,in one of its many senses, is an alphabet of forces, and jumbling together twoor more pantheons in magical work is like jumbling together two or morealphabets in writing a letter—you’re likely to produce pretty fair[image/555.jpg].37 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-403]The second caution has to do with using invented pantheons from fantasy novels,movies, video games, and the like. It’s true that novels, movies, and games fillsome of the same roles today that mythology filled in ancient times, but there’san important difference. The tellers of the old myths weren’t simply making upstories for entertainment; the gods and goddesses whose traditional narrativesthey repeated were beings that some of their listeners had encounteredpersonally in religious experiences, and from whom many people in theirsocieties had received spiritual guidance and an assortment of blessings. Askyourself this: if you were to find yourself right now in a situation where yourlife was on the line, would you consider praying for help to one of the deitiesin the pantheon you’re considering? If not, it may not do you much good toinvoke those deities for help in magic either. If you invoke fictional gods toempower your workings, you’re likely to work fictional magic, rather than magicthat will do things for you in the world of everyday fact.All these considerations relate to the first requirement of polytheistceremonial magic. The second, which is closely related, is that you will need tohave a patron deity—a god or goddess with whom you have a particularly closepersonal bond. Most of today’s polytheist traditions encourage participants toseek out a patron deity, and a great many books on contemporary polytheistpractice offer various methods for establishing a relationship with a god orgoddess. How you go about doing this is therefore entirely up to you, but you’llneed to have done this before you begin work on the rituals that follow.What if you have more than one patron deity? In that case, pray to your patronsfor guidance to find out which one of them you should invoke in magicalceremonies. Focus is one of the keys to magical success, and working inpartnership with a single patron deity in your magical work will produce quickerand more powerful results than jumping from patron to patron. You can certainlycontinue to invoke your other patron or patrons in other contexts. It’s just inmagical practice that it’s important to work with one patron at a time.Polytheist Magic, Polytheist ReligionMore generally, it’s important to realize that ceremonial magic is not the samething as religion. If you belong to an established polytheist tradition of onekind or another, you may have learned and adopted various rules regardingspiritual practices. The rituals in the pages below probably don’t follow thoserules, nor do the rites and practices you may have learned from other sourcesfollow the same rules as the rituals that will be covered here. That is as itshould be. Your kitchen stove and the water heater that provides you with hotshowers both work with heat, but I don’t recommend using the user’s manual forone to make sense of the other!Magic is not religion. Religion is the body of traditions, teachings, andpractices by which we establish mutually beneficial relationships with thedivine powers that shape the universe of our experience. Polytheist ceremonialmagic builds on that foundation, providing operative mages—that is, people whopractice magic—with tools to transform themselves and their lives using powerthat comes out of the relationship between the individual human and one or moregods or goddesses. You can participate in a religion without practicing magic,just as you can practice some kinds of magic and not participate in a religion.Some corners of the polytheist community these days place a great deal of valueon historical authenticity. Others place an equally great value on practicingonly those traditions with which they have personal ethnic or culturalconnections. They certainly have the right to make that choice for themselves,but magic has its own longstanding customs in such matters. The oldest survivingbody of ritual texts in the Western occult tradition, the Graeco-Egyptianmagical papyri, are a lavish gallimaufry of magical symbols and techniquesderived from more than a dozen cultural and ethnic traditions of various eras,all of them efficiently reworked to fit the needs of operative mages in thethird century CE. The same spirit has guided the entire history of magic, andthere are good reasons for that.Magic exists to accomplish things. If you go shopping for a hammer, let’s say,you’re not going to choose it based on whether the label claims it’s anauthentic hammer just like the ones used centuries ago, nor will you limityourself to the kinds of hammers that happened to be used in the past by yourethnic or cultural ancestors. Instead, you’ll choose the hammer that’s bestsuited for the job—and yes, if that means that you pick up a hammer of Englishdesign made of German steel to help you build a shrine to an Egyptian god,that’s what it means.The same principle applies to magic. Operative mages set out to make thingshappen, and assemble the tools and techniques that are best suited to do that.Authenticity is important for museum pieces, but for a working system of magicmeant to transform yourself, your life, and your world, it’s irrelevant.With these points in mind, we can proceed to the practices of polytheistceremonial magic.Polytheism and NeopaganismPolytheism is a category of world religions that includes various ancient,indigenous, modern, and reconstructed or revived devotions, defined by theiraffirmation with religious regard of many gods. In some areas of the modernworld, this category of religion shares demographical intersection withtraditions and trends of Neopaganism, but is nevertheless globally distinct fromthese.Polytheism today, as throughout history, represents a vibrant, international,cross-cultural array of religious traditions, pantheons, and pathways todevotion, worship, and practice, rather than a single thing, and includes manytraditional and culturally specific expressions. When Neopaganism and polytheismintersect, it may be easy to mistake one for the other, or assume them to beexpressions of the same thing; but as with all the myriad expressions ofidentity, distinction is vitally important in order to maintain clear lines ofboth the respect and the insights that serve as inroads to wisdom and growth. Anindividual may be Neopagan and polytheist without either being erased orreplaced by the other.Polytheisms from around the globe today face unprecedented hardships and violentoppression from a world rapidly secularizing to accommodate the pressures ofWestern expansion and economic sustainability, as governments and majorityreligious movements seek to deplatform, disempower, and erase their chances forrepresentation and voice in the emerging twenty-first century. While Neopaganismis a distinctly modern concept born of intersecting spiritual practices of thetwentieth-century West, polytheism includes non-Western cultures and identitiesthat are put at risk not only by oppressive evangelized and secularizingdominance but also by the casual erasure or disregard within adjacent (butdistinct) Western movements such as Neopaganism.Many polytheisms also have a place for intersecting or devotional practices ofmagic, mysticism, or esoteric mystery, but at their core they represent diversereligious traditions of devotion to many gods, who are affirmed and held asholding genuine existence independent of human consciousness and life. Whilethere are many philosophical and occult roots that derive from ancientpolytheistic peoples and cultures, these must be understood to be reflective ofa system-wide polytheistic society rather than of polytheism itself; correlationand equation, like magic and religion, are distinct concepts.When adapting contemporary magickal and esoteric practices to a framework ofpolytheistic religious identity, it is important to embrace a worldview thatplaces humble devotion to the gods before magick or craft, for these aretraditions of relation and of devotion before all else.—Theanos ThraxTheanos Thrax is a temple priest and polytheist consultant, educator, and authorwho writes on religion, identity, theistic orientation, and human rights topics.Residing in the woods of New England with four dogs, two cats, and an Africanraven, they serve as head caretaker of an Ophidiarium of sacred serpents.The Circle of PresenceMagical practice in the standard Golden Dawn tradition begins and ends with asimple ritual called the Cabalistic Cross. This is a straightforward adaptationof the Christian practice of making the sign of the cross, and it’s entirelyappropriate if you happen to be a Christian. The cross is a Christian symbol,and the act of making the cross on your body is a Christian ritual; decking itout with divine names drawn from other traditions won’t change that.In place of the Cabalistic Cross, the system of polytheist ceremonial magicoutlined here has a different ritual called the Circle of Presence. This is thebasic opening and closing gesture you’ll be using whenever you begin and end amagical working. The one thing you’ll need in order to adapt it to your ownspiritual needs is the name of your patron god or goddess, the deity with whomyou have a personal relationship, as discussed previously. If your patron deityhas more than one name, choose the one you prefer. In the rituals that follow,(PATRON) indicates where to speak the name of your patron deity.Here and in other places, you’ll be using a special mode of speech calledvibration. To learn how to do this, chant a simple vowel tone, such as ah, andchange the way you hold your mouth and produce the sound until it produces abuzzing or tingling sensation somewhere in your body. That’s vibration. Withpractice, you’ll find that you can fill your entire body with the sensation, andeven direct it outside your body. In the rituals that follow, every word printedIN CAPITAL LETTERS is to be vibrated.Once you’ve settled on the name of your patron deity you’ll be using, andpracticed vibration enough to get some effect, you can proceed to the ritual. Itis done as follows._____First, stand facing east. Raise your hands from your sides in an arc until yourpalms join above your head, fingers pointing up. Draw your joined hands down toyour forehead, visualizing light descending from infinite space to a point aboveyour head, and say, “In the name of …”Second, draw your joined hands down to your heart. Visualize a ray of lightdescending from above your head to the center of the earth, and vibrate the nameof your patron deity, (PATRON).Third, separate your hands, and touch your right shoulder with the fingertips ofyour left hand and your left shoulder with the fingertips of your right hand,the hands crossing at the wrists. Say, “… my patron god(dess) …”Fourth, raise the elbows straight up and bring your hands up, out, and down in acircular motion, bringing them back together, palm to palm, in front of yourlower abdomen or groin (depending on your body’s proportions). Visualize yourfingertips tracing a circle of light. As you do this, say, “… I place myselfwithin the circle of her (or his) presence …”Fifth, bring the joined hands up to your heart again, fingertips pointingupward. Visualize the shaft of light descending from infinite space to thecenter of the earth, the circle of light you drew with your hands, and yourheart shining like a sun. Say, “… and protection.” This completes the ritual._____The Circle of Presence is a useful ritual in its own right and can be performedanytime you feel a need to call on the presence and protection of your patrongod or goddess. As already noted, though, it also serves as the opening andclosing gesture of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Once you’ve practiced itoften enough that you can do it by memory, learning and practicing the LesserRitual of the Pentagram is the next step in your magical training.The Lesser Ritual of the PentagramThis is the workhorse ritual of Golden Dawn magic, the ritual you’ll be doingmore often than any other as you proceed to the summits of magical practice. Inits original form, it’s also one of the most thoroughly Judeo-Christian ritualsin the entire system. Several significant changes thus need to be made to reworkit for polytheist use.First, as we’ve already seen, the Cabalistic Cross is replaced by the Circle ofPresence, so that the ritual is oriented toward your own patron deity ratherthan the Jewish or Christian one.Second, the pentagrams are drawn in a different way. In the version of thepentagram rituals used in standard Golden Dawn magic, the basic all-purposebanishing uses a pentagram traced from the point of earth to the point ofspirit, the same gesture used to banish the element of earth. Why? Because anenduring theme of Christian teaching is the rejection of everything earthy asevil. The words of the Hegemon in the Theoricus grade of the Hermetic GoldenDawn—“Quit the material and seek the spiritual”38[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-402]—sum up two thousand yearsof Christian moral and mystical teaching, and also express the basic intentionof the version of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram taught by the HermeticGolden Dawn.That’s an attitude that finds no justification in polytheist spirituality. Froma polytheist perspective, the material world is not opposed to the spiritualworld—quite the contrary, spirit finds its natural expression in matter, andmatter finds its natural fulfillment in spirit. The way of tracing thepentagrams used in polytheist ceremonial magic needs to reflect that radicaldifference. We therefore trace the summoning 39[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-401] pentagram clockwise fromthe uppermost point, representing the descent of spiritual realities intomanifestation through the elements of fire, air, water, and earth. The banishingpentagram is traced counterclockwise from the top point, representing thewithdrawal of manifested realities into spirit through the same sequence ofelements in reverse.Third, the Hebrew divine names and archangels used in the Hermetic Golden Dawn’sversion of the ritual are relevant only to Christians, Jews, and those who arecomfortable working with Judeo-Christian religious symbolism. Polytheistceremonial magicians need to be able to replace them with names suited to theirown religious needs.For the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, then, you will need four divine namesfrom your pantheon—if at all possible, two gods and two goddesses—and these fournames need to have four and only four letters each (think ZEUS, ISIS, and soon). Why? Because the entire ritual is structured by a pattern of relationshipsbetween the numbers 1 and 4. There is one center and four quarters, one spiritand four elements, one practitioner relating to the four directions, and so on.In the ritual below, the deity names will be indicated by (DEITY 1), (DEITY 2),(DEITY 3), and (DEITY 4).Experiments with names that have more or fewer letters show that rituals callingon these deities simply don’t work as well. If your tradition has an alphabet ofits own, such as the runes, the Ogham fews, or the Greek alphabet, you can use adeity whose name has four letters in that alphabet whether or not it has fourletters in ours. Thus the Greek goddess Tyche, [image/556.jpg] in Greek, wouldbe entirely appropriate to invoke in this ritual.Modern Pagans very often assume as a matter of course that deities can only beassigned to directions on the basis of elemental symbolism. In this ritual, thatis not required—you don’t need an air deity in the east, a fire deity in thesouth, and so on—and in fact, it’s not usually appropriate. (The LesserPentagram Ritual used in standard Golden Dawn practice, for example, assigns itsfour-lettered divine names to the four quarters without any regard for elementalsymbolism.) Instead, the best rule is to have two gods facing each other and twogoddesses facing each other—gods in the east and west and goddesses in the northand south, or vice versa. The most powerful deity should go in the east, and therest may be arranged however the symbolism of your tradition and your own senseof appropriateness may guide you.Once you’ve chosen your deities, you can proceed to the ritual, which is done asfollows._____First, perform the complete Circle of Presence ritual, calling on your patrondeity.[image/Book10_Fig1.png]Figure 1. Spirit PentagramsSecond, go to the eastern quarter of the space and trace a pentagram with thefirst two fingers of your right hand, beginning with the top point, as shown inFigure 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor177]. You drawclockwise to summon and counterclockwise to banish. Visualize the pentagramdrawn in a line of pure white light. Point to the center of the pentagram andvibrate the name (DEITY 1).Third, trace a line in the air around to the southern quarter, imagining itdrawn in light. Draw the pentagram in the same way, point to the center, andvibrate the name (DEITY 2).Fourth, repeat to the west, trace the pentagram, and vibrate the name (DEITY 3).Fifth, repeat to the north, trace the pentagram, and vibrate the name (DEITY 4).Then trace the line back around to the east, completing the circle, and returnto the center.Sixth, stand at the center, facing the east, and say, “Before me the powers ofair, behind me the powers of water, to my right hand the powers of fire, to myleft hand the powers of earth. For about me stand the pentagrams, and upon meshines the blessing of (PATRON).” Visualize the elements in the four directionswhen you say these words.Seventh, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual._____An example may be useful at this point. Here is one way that a worshiper of thegods and goddesses of ancient Egypt might perform the Lesser Ritual of thePentagram._____First, perform the Circle of Presence ritual with these words: “In the name ofTHOTH, my patron god, I place myself in the circle of his presence andprotection.” The god’s name is vibrated.Second, trace the pentagrams in the four quarters and the circle that unitesthem, vibrating a divine name in each pentagram. In the east, the name is AMUN;in the south, ISIS; in the west, PTAH; and in the north, BAST.Third, return to the center, visualize the elements, and say, “Before me thepowers of air, behind me the powers of water, to my right hand the powers offire, to my left hand the powers of earth. For about me stand the pentagrams,and upon me shines the blessing of THOTH.”Fourth, perform the Circle of Presence ritual again with the same words. Thiscompletes the ritual._____It’s entirely possible to add additional symbolism from your tradition to thisritual. If you have traditional symbols, emblems, or beings that represent thefour elements or the four directions, for example, you can call on these in thethird step of the ritual in place of the references to the powers of theelements. For example, a Druid working with the symbolism of the Druid Revivaltraditions could choose to say, “Before me the Hawk of May, behind me the Salmonof Wisdom, to my right hand the White Stag, to my left hand the Great Bear.”The Middle Pillar ExerciseThe next practice to learn, once you’ve memorized the Lesser Ritual of thePentagram and gotten comfortable with it, is the Middle Pillar exercise. This isthe basic internal energy practice of Golden Dawn magic. It’s meant to waken andenergize five energy centers in the subtle body, and then circulate energythrough the subtle body as a whole.The energy centers of the Middle Pillar are located above the crown of the head,at the throat, at the heart, at the genitals, and between the soles of the feet,extending a short distance into the ground. These are not the same as thechakras used in many Asian schools of mysticism. They are centers of resonancein what many systems of Western occultism call the aura and the Golden Dawntradition calls the Sphere of Sensation—the roughly egg-shaped body of subtleenergy that surrounds and interpenetrates the physical body. The centers of theMiddle Pillar are located along the midline of the physical body, but are notphysical organs.This exercise can be adapted to fit whatever pantheon you prefer to work with.You’ll need five deities, whose names can have any number of letters—thefour-letter restriction applies only to the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Thestandard approach, which follows the logic in Israel Regardie’s fine littlemanual The Art of True Healing, is to use deities corresponding to the fiveelements—spirit, air, fire, water, and earth, in that order. One furthercomplexity is that whichever option you choose, the deity of the fourth energycenter, which is located at the genitals, should be the same gender you are.40[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-400]Along with your five deities, you’ll also need five colors and five symbols. Thedefault option if you’re using the elemental scheme is white, yellow, red, blue,and brown, in that order, and the symbols are the sun, a cloud, a flame, a dropof water, and a stone. You don’t have to use the default option. If yourtradition has other symbols for the five elements, you can use them; if itassociates the elements with other colors, you can use those.However you do it, work out a suitable arrangement of correspondences, as shownin Table 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor178].Crown CenterDEITY 1COLOR 1SYMBOL 1Throat CenterDEITY 2COLOR 2SYMBOL 2Heart CenterDEITY 3COLOR 3SYMBOL 3Genital CenterDEITY 4COLOR 4SYMBOL 4Foot CenterDEITY 5COLOR 5SYMBOL 5Thus a male Heathen who worships the Anglo-Saxon deities might choose this:Crown CenterTiwWhiteSunThroat CenterWodenBlueRavenHeart CenterHrethaRedFlameGenital CenterIngGreenSheaf of barleyFoot CenterEostreBrownFlowersA female Heathen might instead choose this:Crown CenterTiwWhiteSunThroat CenterWodenBlueRavenHeart CenterThunorRedHammerGenital CenterFrigGoldSpindleFoot CenterEostreBrownFlowersTable 1. Correspondences for the Middle Pillar ExerciseOther correspondences could be chosen easily enough; these are just samples.Make your decision and give it a try. Once you’ve chosen your symbolism, theexercise is done as follows._____First, perform the complete Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram as given inthe previous section. The banishing version of the ritual is always used in thisexercise, to clear unwanted energies and influences from your sphere ofsensation. Regular practice of a banishing ritual does for your energy body whatregular bathing does for your physical body, and should be a daily exercise onthe part of every ceremonial magician.Second, imagine a ray of light descending from infinite space to form a sphereof light just above your head, about eight inches in diameter. This sphere isCOLOR 1 and contains SYMBOL 1. When you have formulated it clearly in yourimagination, vibrate NAME 1 three times.Third, bring the ray of light to your throat, and form another sphere. This oneis COLOR 2 and contains SYMBOL 2. When you have formulated it, vibrate NAME 2three times.Fourth, bring the ray of light to your heart, and form a third sphere, which isCOLOR 3 and contains SYMBOL 3. NAME 3 is vibrated here three times.Fifth, bring the ray of light to your genital center, and form a fourth sphere.This one is COLOR 4 and contains SYMBOL 4. NAME 4 is vibrated here three times.Sixth, bring the ray of light to your feet, and form a fifth center. This one isCOLOR 5 and contains SYMBOL 5. The name vibrated here, three times, is NAME 5.Seventh, return your attention to the center at the top of the head. Bring acurrent of white light a few inches wide down the left side of the head andneck, the left shoulder and arm, and the left hip and leg, down to the center atthe feet, then back up the right leg and hip, the right arm and shoulder, andthe right side of the neck and head, back to the center at the head. Repeat thisa total of three times; if possible, synchronize with the breath, so that theenergy flows down with the outbreath and up with the inbreath, but it is moreimportant to visualize the whole course than to make it happen within a singlebreath.Eighth, in the same way, bring a current of white light from the center abovethe head, down the midline of the front of the body to the center at the feet,then back up the midline of the back of the body to the center above the head.Repeat a total of three times.Ninth, breathing out, draw a current of white light straight down the midline ofyour body from the center above the head to the center at the feet, along theMiddle Pillar. Breathing in, draw a current of energy back up the Middle Pillarof the body to the center above the head; breathing out, allow it to spray likea fountain out and over the whole body, cleansing the entire aura, pooling atthe feet and being drawn back up the Middle Pillar with the next inbreath. Youonly need to do the current down the Middle Pillar from above once; do the restof the cycle, up the Middle Pillar and down through the aura, a total of threetimes.Tenth, perform the Circle of Presence. This completes the exercise.Opening and Closing a TempleThe Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar exercise are the dailypractices of Golden Dawn magic, the disciplines that develop magical power andstrengthen the energy body of the operative mage. Most people who are interestedin magic, though, also have practical ends in mind—they want to wield magicalenergies to improve their own lives and the lives of others. The Golden Dawntradition has plenty of methods for doing this too, and with a little alterationto refit them for polytheist use, they can be put to work to make changes in theworld.Practical magic in the Golden Dawn tradition is done in an open temple. A templein this context doesn’t mean a building set apart for the purpose of yourmagical work—though if you happen to have one of these, you can certainly useit! Any space can become a temple of magic for the duration of a magicalworking, and a special ritual is used to open a temple at the beginning of aworking and close it at the end. In this polytheist version of Golden Dawnmagic, you will open and close your temple in the name of your patron deity; youwill vibrate his or her name where indicated by the word (PATRON).You will need a few physical props for your magical temple. The first of theseis an altar. Any item of furniture with a flat top around waist height, largeenough to hold a few ritual items and small enough that you can move around iteasily, can serve as an altar so long as you can set it in the middle of yourworking space. The altar is traditionally covered with an altar cloth, which canbe as simple as an unhemmed length of fabric or as ornate as your budget orsewing skills will allow. The Hermetic Golden Dawn used a black altar cloth; youmay do the same if you like, or choose a color or pattern more relevant to thespiritual tradition you practice. For example, as a Druid, I use a white altarcloth.For the ritual of opening and closing, you’ll also need a cup, bowl, or othercontainer of water, and an incense burner. Choose these to match your traditionand your taste. You can use any incense appropriate to the magical working youhave in mind. For general purposes, a good purifying incense such asfrankincense is fine.41 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-399]Stick, cone, or loose incense on charcoal are equally appropriate depending onyour preferences.To set up the temple before you begin the opening ritual, you need to know whichway east is. An ordinary hiker’s compass will tell you this if you’re not sure.Set the altar in the middle of the space, with the water on the north side andthe incense burner on the south side. Anything else you need for the ritual thatyou plan on performing once you have opened a temple also goes on the altar.Once the temple is set up, put on a robe if you prefer to wear one while workingmagic, light the incense, and proceed to open the temple as follows._____First, stand at the west side of the altar, facing east. Raise your right hand,palm forward, to salute the divine powers you will summon during the ritual, andsay, “In the name of (PATRON), and in the presence of all the gods andgoddesses, I prepare to open this temple.”Second, perform the complete Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram to callmagical energies into the space.Third, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the vessel ofwater in both hands and raise it up. Say, “Let this temple and all within it bepurified with water.” Go to the east, dip the fingers of one hand into thewater, and flick droplets of water three times to the east. Go around to thesouth, and do the same thing; repeat the same action in the west and the north.Return to the east, face east, lift up the vessel of water in both hands, andsay, “The temple is purified.” Then go back to the west of the altar and returnthe vessel of water to its place.Fourth, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the incense. Ifyou are burning stick incense, just the stick is fine; if you are using cone orloose incense, lift up the burner in both hands. Then say, “Let this temple andall within it be consecrated by fire.” Go to the east, and with one hand, wavesmoke from the incense three times to the east. Go around to the south and dothe same thing; repeat the same action in the west and the north. Return to theeast, face east, lift up the incense in both hands, and say, “The temple isconsecrated.” Then go back to the west of the altar and return the incense toits place.Fifth, starting from the west of the altar, walk clockwise in a circle aroundthe altar, passing the east four times. Each time you pass the east, bow yourhead in respect. This is the ancient and very widespread rite ofcircumambulation, still practiced in many polytheist societies around the world.As you walk, imagine your movements creating a whirlpool of energy that draws inmagical power from the far reaches of the universe to your magical temple. Whenyou have passed the east four times, circle back to the west of the altar andface east.Sixth, spread your arms wide and say, “(PATRON), my patron god(dess), I ask youto bless and consecrate this temple of high magic, and aid me with your power inall the work I perform herein.” Pause for a time and concentrate on sensing yourpatron deity’s presence and power surrounding you.Seventh, still standing at the west of the altar, facing east, raise your righthand again, palm forward, and say, “In the name of (PATRON), and in the presenceof all the gods and goddesses, I proclaim this temple duly open.” This completesthe ritual._____Once you have opened the temple, you can do any magical working you wish insidethe sacred space you’ve established. A little later on, we’ll discuss some ofthe possibilities. Whenever you open a temple using the ritual just given,however, it’s important to close the temple once you’re finished with whateveryou intend to do. The closing ritual is done as follows._____First, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the vessel ofwater in both hands and raise it up. Say, “Let this temple and all within it bepurified with water.” Repeat the process of purifying the temple with waterexactly as you did in the third step of the opening ritual. Then go back to thewest of the altar and return the vessel of water to its place.Second, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the incense andsay, “Let this temple and all within it be consecrated by fire.” Repeat theprocess of consecrating the temple with fire exactly as you did in the fourthstep of the opening ritual. Then go back to the west of the altar and return theincense to its place.Third, starting from the west of the altar, walk counterclockwise in a circlearound the altar, passing the east four times. Each time you pass the east, bowyour head in respect. As you walk, imagine your movements dispersing thewhirlpool of energy you created earlier and sending the intention of yourworking out into the universe to accomplish your will. When you have passed theeast four times, circle back to the west of the altar and face east.Fourth, spread your arms wide and say, “ In the name of (PATRON), I set free anyspirits who may have been imprisoned by this ceremony. Depart unto your rightfulhabitations in peace, and peace be between us.” Pause for a moment, then performthe complete Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.Fifth, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, raise your right handagain, palm forward, and say, “In the name of (PATRON), and in the presence ofall the gods and goddesses, I proclaim this temple duly closed.” This completesthe ritual._____Modern WitchcraftThe Witchcrafts of Gerald Gardner and Alex and Maxine Sanders were based aroundcovens and initiatory practices. But today, there are far more solitarypractitioners of Witchcraft than individuals who have gone through initiationsor work in groups. This is due largely to the “rise of the book” in Witchcraftcircles. During the 1950s and 1960s, obtaining Witch rituals required either aninitiation or a willingness to create one’s own. By the end of the 1970s,entrance into the world of Witchcraft could be obtained for the price of amass-market paperback.Gerald Gardner’s Book of Shadows (a name for a collection of Witch rituals andmagickal advice) was first reproduced in the 1964 pamphlet Witch, published by acritic of Gardner’s soon after the old man’s passing. However, Witch was noteasily obtainable and had a short print run. That would change in the 1970s whenboth occult and mainstream publishers began printing how-to Witchcraft bookscomplete with rituals. This gave Witchcraft to the masses, making the need foran initiator less urgent.One of the most influential of those books from the 1970s was The Spiral Dance,written by California Bay Area resident Starhawk (born Miriam Simos in 1951) andpublished in 1979. The Spiral Dance articulated a different kind of Witchcraftfrom that of Gardner and Sanders, one infused with second-wave feminism and1960s-era politics. It also included ideas from what’s come to be known as theFeri Tradition, founded by Victor (1917–2001) and Cora Anderson (1915–2007)during the 1960s. The Witchcraft of the Andersons added new elements to theCraft and became one of America’s first and largest homegrown traditions.New Witchcraft traditions weren’t just reserved for North America. TheWitchcraft of Robert Cochrane (birth name Roy Bowers, 1931–1966) first wentpublic in England in 1960. Though slow to gain traction, it would inspireseveral different traditions on both sides of the pond during the 1970s due to aseries of letters written by Cochrane before his death. Today Cochrane is oftenhailed as the architect of “Traditional Witchcraft,” a strain of the Craftinspired by English cunning-craft and other forms of folk magic.Witchcraft continued to grow in popularity during the 1980s and ’90s, with theCraft first written about by Gardner being hailed primarily as “Wicca.” Today,Wicca is recognized as a religion by a variety of Western governments, and itsprimary symbol, the pentacle, can be seen on grave markers at national veteranscemeteries in the United States. Witchcraft has continued its pattern of growthin the new millennium, trending often on social media sites.—Jason MankeyJason Mankey has been a practicing Witch for the last twenty-five years and isthe author of Transformative Witchcraft: The Greater Mysteries and Witch’s Wheelof the Year: Rituals for Sabbats, Circles & Solitaries, both published byLlewellyn. He lives with his wife, Ari, and two cats in California, where theylead two local covens.The differences between the form of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram used instandard Golden Dawn practice and the form used in this Pagan version of theGolden Dawn are important to keep in mind. In the Hermetic Golden Dawn, theLesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is done at the beginning as well as theend of each working; in polytheist ceremonial magic, we do the Summoning Ritualat the beginning and the Banishing Ritual at the end. Since the Summoning Ritualin the form given here is meant to call magical energies into manifestation, andthe Banishing Ritual withdraws them from manifestation, using these two ritualsto bracket the opening and closing ritual makes good sense and strong magic.As with the other rituals we’ve covered, you can insert additional symbolisminto the opening and closing rituals if you wish. If your tradition has a sacredwell and a sacred fire, for example, or any other suitable symbolism relating towater and fire, you could insert those into the purification with water and theconsecration with fire: thus, for example, an Irish Pagan might say, “Let thistemple and all within it be purified by the waters of the Well of Segais,” and“Let this temple and all within it be consecrated by the smoke of the fire ofBilé.”Elemental Pentagram RitualsMany relatively simple magical workings can be done in an open temple with nofurther preparation, and a ritual for making and consecrating an herbal amuletis included at the end of this book. For more potent workings, though, it’soften better to summon the magical energies of one of the four elements into thetemple once it’s open, and a specific set of rituals—the elemental pentagramrituals—are used for this purpose.To use these rituals, you’ll need to choose four deities from your pantheon whorule over the four traditional elements. These names can be as many letters asthey happen to be—again, the four-letter rule applies only to the Lesser Ritualof the Pentagram, not to the elemental rituals or any other ritual in thissystem. You need a deity of air or the sky, a deity of fire or the sun, a deityof water or the sea, and a deity of earth or of fertility. Fortunately, thesearen’t hard to find in most traditional pantheons. You can invoke the samedeities for the elements that you invoked in the Middle Pillar exercise, ordifferent ones if you prefer. All that matters is that you settle on a set ofnames and use them consistently. In the rituals that follow, the names will beindicated by (EARTH DEITY), (WATER DEITY), (AIR DEITY), and (FIRE DEITY); asusual, every name in capital letters is to be vibrated.The elemental pentagram rituals use the same basic structure as the LesserRitual of the Pentagram, and they begin and end with the Circle of Presence.You’ll be tracing a different set of pentagrams for each ritual, starting fromthe point corresponding to the element, as shown in Figure 2[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor179].371[image/Book10_Fig2.png]Figure 2. Elements and the PentagramThese are not the versions of the elemental pentagrams used in the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn. As with the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, this isdeliberate. The Golden Dawn versions are traced according to a complex theorythat derives from the symbolism of the Tetragrammaton, the holy four-letteredname used for the Jewish and Christian God, and the results have practicaldifficulties—for example, using the Golden Dawn version, you can’t invoke airwithout simultaneously banishing water, and vice versa! Tracing the pentagramsfrom the point assigned to each element, going clockwise to invoke andcounterclockwise to banish, works equally well in practice and avoids thesedifficulties.The rituals themselves are done as follows.Pentagram Ritual of EarthFirst, perform the Circle of Presence to invoke your patron deity.[image/Book10_Fig3.png]Figure 3. Earth PentagramsSecond, go to the east and trace a pentagram of earth with the index and middlefingers of your right hand, clockwise to summon or counterclockwise to banish(Figure 3 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor180]). Imagine itdrawn in emerald light. Point at the center of the pentagram and vibrate thename (EARTH DEITY). Trace a line of emerald light around to the south, thentrace the same pentagram and vibrate the same name. Do the same to the west andnorth, and finally trace a line back around to the east to complete the circle.Third, return to the west of the altar, face east, and say, “Before me thefertile plains, behind me the rolling hills, to my right hand the tallmountains, to my left hand the deep caverns, for about me stand the pentagrams,and upon me shines the blessing of (PATRON).”Fourth, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual.Pentagram Ritual of WaterFirst, perform the Circle of Presence to invoke your patron deity.[image/Book10_Fig4.png]Figure 4. Water PentagramsSecond, go to the east and trace a pentagram of water with the index and middlefingers of your right hand, clockwise to summon or counterclockwise to banish(Figure 4 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor181]). Imagine itdrawn in blue light. Point at the center of the pentagram and vibrate the name(WATER DEITY). Trace a line of blue light around to the south, then trace thesame pentagram and vibrate the same name. Do the same to the west and north, andfinally trace a line back around to the east to complete the circle.Third, return to the west of the altar, face east, and say, “Before me thedancing streams, behind me the great ocean, to my right hand the strong rivers,to my left hand the quiet lakes, for about me stand the pentagrams, and upon meshines the blessing of (PATRON).”Fourth, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual.Pentagram Ritual of AirFirst, perform the Circle of Presence to invoke your patron deity.373[image/Book10_Fig5.png]Figure 5. Air PentagramsSecond, go to the east and trace a pentagram of air with the index and middlefingers of your right hand, clockwise to summon or counterclockwise to banish(Figure 5 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor182]). Imagine itdrawn in golden light. Point at the center of the pentagram and vibrate the name(AIR DEITY). Trace a line of golden light around to the south, then trace thesame pentagram and vibrate the same name. Do the same to the west and north, andfinally trace a line back around to the east to complete the circle.Third, return to the west of the altar, face east, and say, “Before me therushing wind, behind me the silver mist, to my right hand the shining sky, to myleft hand the billowing cloud, for about me stand the pentagrams, and upon meshines the blessing of (PATRON).”Fourth, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual.Pentagram Ritual of FireFirst, perform the Circle of Presence to invoke your patron deity.[image/Book10_Fig6.png]Figure 6. Fire PentagramsSecond, go to the east and trace a pentagram of fire with the index and middlefingers of your right hand, clockwise to summon or counterclockwise to banish(Figure 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183]). Imagine itdrawn in crimson light. Point at the center of the pentagram and vibrate thename (FIRE DEITY). Trace a line of crimson light around to the south, then tracethe same pentagram and vibrate the same name. Do the same to the west and north,and finally trace a line back around to the east to complete the circle.Third, return to the west of the altar, face east, and say, “Before me thelightning flash, behind me the fire of growth, to my right hand the blazing sun,to my left hand the flame upon the hearth, for about me stand the pentagrams,and upon me shines the blessing of (PATRON).”Fourth, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual._____In magical workings, the elemental pentagram rituals are done after you open thetemple and before you close it. Only one element is summoned in any ritualworking, and once summoned, it must be banished again before closing the temple,to avoid leaving unbalanced energies behind in the place where you practicemagic. The closing ritual and the final Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagramfinish the process of clearing away the energies, so the space you use for yourtemple can be used for other purposes.The Supreme Ritual of the PentagramFor most kinds of practical magic, it’s appropriate to summon whicheverelemental force is best suited to the work you have in mind. Not all magic aimsat purely practical ends, though. Magical workings for spiritual development arealso an important part of the operative mage’s toolkit. It’s through rituals ofspiritual development that you build on the foundations laid down by dailypractice of the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram and the Middle Pillar exercise,to strengthen your connection with the gods and goddesses, with your patrondeity, and with the currents of magical power that surge constantly through theuniverse.For rituals of spiritual development, it’s best to summon all four elements atthe same time, since a state of balance among the elemental powers in theuniverse and in yourself is a key part of spiritual development through magic.The ritual used for this purpose is the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram, whichsynthesizes the four elemental pentagram rituals into a single ceremonial form.The Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram is done as follows._____First, perform the complete Circle of Presence ritual, calling on your patrondeity.Second, go to the eastern quarter of the space, and trace the pentagram of airthere, drawing it clockwise from the air point. Visualize the pentagram drawn ina line of pure yellow light. Point to the center of the pentagram and vibratethe name (AIR DEITY), the same name you use in the Pentagram Ritual of Air.Third, trace a line in the air around to the southern quarter, imagining itdrawn in white light. Draw a pentagram of fire in the south, tracing itclockwise from the fire point, visualizing it in red light. Point to the center,and vibrate the name (FIRE DEITY), the same name you use in the Pentagram Ritualof Fire.Fourth, trace the line of white light around to the west. Trace a waterpentagram there in blue light, clockwise from the water point, and vibrate thename (WATER DEITY), the same name you use in the Pentagram Ritual of Water.Fifth, trace the line of white light around to the west. Trace an earthpentagram there in green light, clockwise from the earth point, and vibrate thename (EARTH DEITY), the same name you use in the Pentagram Ritual of Earth. Thentrace the line of white light back around to the east, completing the circle,and return to the center.Sixth, stand at the center, facing the east, and say, “Before me the powers ofair, behind me the powers of water, to my right hand the powers of fire, to myleft hand the powers of earth. For about me stand the pentagrams, and upon meshines the blessing of (PATRON).” Visualize the elements in the four directionswhen you say these words.Seventh, repeat the Circle of Presence. This completes the ritual._____The Supreme Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is done in exactly the same way,except that the pentagrams are all drawn counterclockwise from the relevantelemental point. Both versions should be practiced until you can do them frommemory before you use them in a magical working. One convenient way to do thisis to use both forms in a more potent version of the Middle Pillar exercise.The Greater Middle Pillar ExerciseThis working can be done once a week in place of your ordinary Lesser Ritual ofthe Pentagram and Middle Pillar exercise. The version presented here as anexample uses the Irish pantheon, and the mage’s patron is the Dagda. If you wishto use this exercise, of course, you should replace these with the appropriatenames of your own patron deity and pantheon. You should also replace the Song ofAmergin, the incantation that forms the center of the rite, with some similarincantation from your own tradition. For example, Heathen mages might choose touse the tremendous passage from the Old Norse Havamál in which Odin describeshis self-sacrifice on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The incantation used shouldexpress some of the core spiritual truths of your tradition. In its Irish form,the exercise is done as follows._____First, perform the complete Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram, calling onAN DAGDA in the Circle of Presence. The names for the four quarters are DANU inthe east, LUGH in the south, BADB in the west, and BILÉ in the north.Second, perform the complete Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram, using thesame name in the Circle of Presence. Invoke air in the east in the name ofNUADA, fire in the south in the name of BRIGHID, water in the west in the nameof MANNANAN, and earth in the north in the name of ERIU. While invoking theelements, concentrate on feeling their presence and power flowing in through thepentagrams you have traced.Third, standing in the center of the space, facing east, recite the Song ofAmergin:I am the wind on the sea;I am the wave of the sea;I am the bull of seven battles;I am the eagle on the rockI am a flash from the sun;I am the most beautiful of plants;I am a strong wild boar;I am a salmon in the water;I am a lake in the plain;I am the word of knowledge;I am the head of the spear in battle;I am the god that puts fire in the head;Who spreads light in the gathering on the hills?Who can tell the ages of the moon?Who can tell the place where the sun rests? 42[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-398]While you recite each line of the Song of Amergin, imagine that you are what youdescribe: a wind of the sea, a hawk upon a cliff, a wise Druid, and the rest ofit. Perceive yourself as a reality that goes beyond the body you presentlyinhabit. Believe that, like the Welsh wizard-bard Taliesin, you have been allthings previously.43 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-397]Fourth, perform the complete Middle Pillar exercise in the usual way, exceptvibrate the name corresponding to each energy center nine times rather thanthree, and perform each of the circulations of energy nine times instead ofthree. Done in the wake of the recitation of the Song of Amergin, this can be anextraordinarily potent experience.Fifth, perform the complete Supreme Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with thenames already given to release the elemental energies you have summoned.Sixth, perform the complete Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram with thenames already given to clear away leftover energies and finish the exercise.Consecration Ritual for an AmuletThis sample ritual is a basic ritual for making and consecrating an amulet toprotect and bless a garden, using the traditions of natural magic. The amuletitself is a small bag of waterproof green cloth, into which will be put a mossagate and the dried leaves of comfrey (Symphytum officinale) and lovage(Levisticum officinale), two commonly available herbs. Do not make the amulet inadvance. Instead, simply put the raw materials (the bag, the moss agate, and twolittle bowls—each containing half a teaspoon or so of one of the herbs) on thealtar as shown in Figure 7[LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184]. You will also need apiece of silk or linen in which to wrap the amulet after it’s made andconsecrated.[image/Book10_Fig7.png]Figure 7. Altar for Sample RitualThe pantheon for the following ritual is Roman, and the mage’s patron is Vesta.If you wish to use this ritual, of course, it should be adapted to fit your ownpatron and pantheon._____First, stand at the west side of the altar, facing east. Raise your right hand,palm forward, to salute the divine powers you will summon during the ritual, andsay, “In the name of VESTA, and in the presence of all the gods and goddesses, Iprepare to open this temple.”Second, perform the Circle of Presence ritual with these words: “In the name ofVESTA, my patron goddess, I place myself in the circle of her presence andprotection.”Third, trace the pentagrams in the four quarters and the circle that unitesthem, vibrating a divine name in each pentagram. In the east, the name is JOVE;in the south, JUNO; in the west, MARS; and in the north, MAIA.Fourth, return to the west of the altar, face east, visualize the elements, andsay, “Before me the powers of air, behind me the powers of water, to my righthand the powers of fire, to my left hand the powers of earth. For about me standthe pentagrams, and upon me shines the blessing of VESTA.”Fifth, perform the Circle of Presence ritual again with the same words asbefore.Sixth, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the vessel ofwater in both hands and raise it up. Say, “Let this temple and all within it bepurified with water.” Purify the temple with water in the usual way, then goback to the west of the altar and return the vessel of water to its place.Seventh, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, pick up the incense andsay, “Let this temple and all within it be consecrated by fire.” Consecrate thetemple with fire in the usual way, then go back to the west of the altar andreturn the incense to its place.Eighth, walk clockwise in a circle around the altar, passing the east fourtimes. Each time you pass the east, bow your head in respect, and imagine yourmovements creating a whirlpool of energy that draws in magical power from thefar reaches of the universe to your magical temple. When you have passed theeast four times, circle back to the west of the altar and face east.Ninth, spread your arms wide and say, “VESTA, my patron goddess, I ask you tobless and consecrate this temple of high magic, and aid me with your power inall the work I perform herein.” Pause for a time, and sense Vesta’s presence andpower surrounding you.Tenth, still standing at the west of the altar, facing east, raise your righthand, palm forward, and say, “In the name of VESTA, and in the presence of allthe gods and goddesses, I proclaim this temple duly open.” Then perform thecomplete Invoking Pentagram Ritual of Earth, vibrating the name of CERES, thegoddess of earth, in the four quarters.Eleventh, say aloud, “I now create an amulet for the purpose of blessing andprotecting my garden.” Then put the herbs and the moss agate into the bag, andtie it shut. While you do this, imagine your garden thriving, a place ofabundance and perfect safety. Make the image in your mind as clear and vivid asyou possibly can. When you have finished making the amulet, place it in thecenter of the altar.Twelfth, raise your arms in invocation and say, “Ceres, great goddess,protectress of all green and growing things, I ask you to strengthen this amuletwith your power and wisdom so that it will bless and protect my garden.” Thenrecite the following verses:Bounteous Ceres, thee I sing,Source of Jove the mighty king,Ancient goddess, Saturn’s wife,Middle center of all life,Which forever streams from thee,All-prolific deity.44 [LCBCeremonialMagick05_Book9and10.xhtml#footnote-396]Repeat these verses three times. While you do so, concentrate on the presence ofthe goddess Ceres in and around your temple, and sense a stream of divine powerdescending from her into the amulet. Hold that image as long and as intensely asyou can. When your concentration falters, say, “Ceres, great goddess, I thankyou for your blessing and your help.” Then wrap the amulet in the piece of silkor linen. This will keep the magical charge intact while you banish the energiesyou have invoked.Thirteenth, perform the complete Banishing Elemental Pentagram Ritual of Earth,again vibrating the name CERES in each quarter, to release the energies you haveinvoked.Fourteenth, pick up the vessel of water and purify the temple with water inexactly the same way you did in the opening. Return the vessel to its place.Fifteenth, pick up the incense and consecrate the temple with fire in exactlythe same way you did in the opening. Return the incense to its place.Sixteenth, starting from the west of the altar, walk counterclockwise in acircle around the altar, passing the east four times. Each time you pass theeast, bow your head in respect. As you walk, imagine your movements dispersingthe whirlpool of energy you created earlier. When you have passed the east fourtimes, circle back to the west of the altar and face east.Seventeenth, spread your arms wide and say, “ In the name of VESTA, I set freeany spirits who may have been imprisoned by this ceremony. Depart unto yourrightful habitations in peace, and peace be between us.” Pause for a moment,then perform the complete Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, using thesame names as in the opening.Eighteenth, standing at the west of the altar, facing east, raise your righthand again, palm forward, and say, “In the name of VESTA, and in the presence ofall the gods and goddesses, I proclaim this temple duly closed.” This completesthe ritual.A Final NoteThe rituals and exercises given in this book are merely examples of what can bedone with Pagan ceremonial magic. Every working performed by Golden Dawn mages,even the most complex, can be reworked in this same way to suit the needs ofPagan operative mages, and the same is true of other systems of ceremonialmagic. Take the time to practice, master, and learn from the examples givenhere, and you’ll find that it’s easy to adapt other rituals the same way.BibliographyGreer, John Michael. The Celtic Golden Dawn.

SeeSallustius, Sallust, On the Gods and the World, 153–155."},{"pageContent":"Book ElevenMagician’s Tablesby David Allen HulseThe proper use of magical correspondences in the ritual work of a Magician is anessential part of any magical ceremony. The methodology behind any system ofmagical correspondences is derived from the renaissance doctrine of signatures.The philosophy of the doctrine of signatures looks to nature to find sympatheticcorrespondences. Thus, the walnut and the human brain are linked by this methodof symbology, since the walnut is a hard shell enveloping a segmented nut thatresembles the human skull surrounding a brain.A complex system of symbolic correspondences has been developed by manydifferent magicians and magical traditions by associating things of this worldwith the vast stretches of the cosmos, including the visible planets and theband of the zodiac. The core key symbols always involve the letters of thealphabet, the range of numbers, and the spectrum of the rainbow, all aligned tothe elements, the planets, and the zodiac. Numbers are inevitably linked towords by associating a number value to each letter of a magical alphabet. It isthe specific alignments between various symbol sets made by the magician thatwork with the logic of this doctrine of signatures.For the practicing magician of the seventeenth century, the classical textbookto be consulted for such magical correspondences was Three Books of OccultPhilosophy by Henry Cornelius Agrippa. For the practitioner of the magical artsin the nineteenth century, the classical textbook was The Magus by FrancisBarrett (which was derived from Agrippa). For the twentieth century, the singlemost influential work concerning the doctrine of magical correspondences wasAleister Crowley’s 777.My own publications concerning the magical tradition have focused on thecategorization of the magical systems of the world, both East and West. Thismodest chapter cannot capture all the nuances found in my Eastern Mysteries andWestern Mysteries. But given the limitation of space, I have crafted a lucidoverview of the Qabalistic key to the Tarot found in the teachings of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn as the true foundation of all magicalendeavors. Magical correspondences will be provided for the elements, theplanets, and the zodiac. The Western mandala known as the Tree of Life will bereferenced throughout the following tables.Those wanting a deeper grasp of the complexities of the symbolism for the Treeof Life should refer to the second key in The Eastern Mysteries concerning theHebrew alphabet and the twelfth key in The Western Mysteries concerning theTarot.There is one common source from the nineteenth century for our modern magicaltradition of symbolic correspondences. It is the magical fraternity of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in England in 1887 by threeFreemasons. These three founders (sometimes referred to as the three SecretChiefs of the Order) were Dr. William Robert Woodman, Dr. William Wynn Westcott,and Samuel Liddell (MacGregor) Mathers. Two notable occultists from this order’smembers were Arthur Edward Waite and Aleister Edward Crowley, whose work in bothmagic and the Tarot continues to affect our modern magical community.If we look at the work of Agrippa or Barrett, we will find no mention of theTarot in their own doctrine of correspondences. But when we look to the esotericteachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, we find that the key totheir doctrine of signatures was a rectified order for the Tarot.Eliphas Levi and the French occult movement of the nineteenth century alignedthe esoteric symbolism of the Hebrew alphabet found in the tradition known asthe Qabalah with the 78 cards composing the Tarot. The specific Hebrew text usedas the lynchpin in this system of correspondences was the Sepher Yetzirah (Bookof Formation), a short treatise giving the cosmological attributes of the 22letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Wynn Westcott issued an English translation ofthis esoteric text, an indication that both Westcott and Mathers had access tothis treatise as a means of solving the conundrum of how to allocate the Hebrewalphabet to the Tarot itself.Eliphas Levi used the Marseille Tarot deck from France as the basis forattributing each letter of the alphabet to a specific Tarot card (table 1).Since the deck of 78 cards leads with 22 trump cards of an archetypal nature intheir pictorial symbolism, known as the Major Arcana, Levi was able to pair oneof 22 Hebrew alphabet letters to each of these cards. He used the actual imagesof the cards to make this alignment. Thus, he ascribed the first Hebrew letterof Aleph to key I, the Magician, since the arms, body, and legs of the Magiciansuggest in their shape the letter Aleph (א). Other symbolic images thatidentified in their shape the Hebrew alphabet included the lion’s mouth in keyXI, Strength, as the Hebrew letter Kaph ([image/212.jpg]); the crossed legs,arms, and body in key XII, the Hanged Man, as the Hebrew letter Lamed([image/214.jpg]); and the falling mason’s inverted body, legs, and arms in keyXVI, the Tower, as the Hebrew letter Ayin ([image/100.jpg]). This tradition wasincorporated into both Papus’s The Tarot of the Bohemians and Oswald Wirth’s TheTarot of the Magician.HebTarotHebTarotHebTarot[image/566.jpg]The Magician[image/567.jpg]Justice[image/568.jpg]The Devil[image/569.jpg]The High Priestess[image/570.jpg]The Hermit[image/571.jpg]The Tower Of God[image/572.jpg]The Empress[image/573.jpg]The WheelOf Fortune[image/574.jpg]The Star[image/575.jpg]The Emperor[image/576.jpg]Force (Strength)[image/577.jpg]The Moon[image/578.jpg]The Pope[image/579.jpg]The Hanged Man[image/580.jpg]The Sun[image/581.jpg]The Lover[image/582.jpg]Death[image/583.jpg]Judgment[image/584.jpg]The Chariot[image/585.jpg]Temperance[image/586.jpg]The Fool[image/587.jpg]The WorldTable 1. Eliphas Levi’s Hebrew Key to the TarotHowever, with the advent of the Golden Dawn system of magic, both Westcott andMathers, using Westcott’s translation of the Sepher Yetzirah (published in1887), unpublished materials at their access inherited from other occultists andmagical orders, as well as the extensive library at the British Museum,discovered a different system of correspondences between the Hebrew alphabet andthe Tarot. They forged a founding document known as the Cipher Manuscript tosupport this radical departure of symbolic correspondences from the systempopularized by Eliphas Levi, acting as if their own esoteric teachings came froman existing Rosicrucian lodge in Germany. But the system they came up with forthe Tarot was of their own invention and has shaped the contents of almost everymodern published Tarot deck, including the decks of Arthur Edward Waite, PaulFoster Case, and Aleister Crowley.When candidates came into the Golden Dawn for initiation into the mysteries,their first year of study focused on being able to write the Hebrew alphabet.Many would-be initiates were confused that this was the secret housed in theteachings of the Golden Dawn. But it truly was the crux of the matter, for theunique correspondences elucidated between the Hebrew alphabet and the MajorArcana of the Tarot were truly the treasure and greatest secret of the teachingsof the Golden Dawn. Every ritual aspect of their ceremonies depended on thisunique allocation for the Tarot, including the elaborate system of Enochianmagic derived from John Dee’s scrying work with Edward Kelley.I have found in my own work with both the Tarot and magic in general that thesystem of magical correspondences devised by the Golden Dawn is the mostworkable and useful of any published esoteric system of allocations. This systemcan classify the contents of dreams and waking visions. It can serve as a key toall esoteric texts and magical artwork. It greatly expands with years ofpractice. It can imbue the deepest symbolic meaning to any mundane occurrence inone’s life. It grows internally with one’s insight into the connections latentbetween the symbol sets. It becomes such a fabric of one’s own mental processesthat it is constantly running at a subconscious level. It needs to be at thefoundation of the work of any practicing magician.For the beginning student as well as the advanced practitioner, there willalways be the tendency to modify this system of correspondences or completelyreplace it whole cloth with another. Aleister Crowley certainly did this bydeviating from four of the Golden Dawn Major Arcana Tarot cards, and his studentFrater Achad went even further by juggling the 22 paths of the Tree of Life thathouse the 22 cards of the Major Arcana in order to have greater astrologicalalignment between the sephiroth and adjoining paths. But I want to stress againthe value of this system that Westcott and Mathers envisioned, for it is farricher than any other system or any other variation on a theme. Both ArthurEdward Waite and Paul Foster Case have preserved the integrity of this system intheir own work with the esoteric nature of the Tarot, as well as AleisterCrowley (with the exception of four cards: the Emperor, Strength, Justice, andthe Star).As such, the next table to be shown in this chapter is this very reconditealignment of the Hebrew alphabet to the Tarot (Table 2[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187]). Every practicingmagician needs to deeply ingrain in his or her memory these extremely richcorrespondences connecting the Hebrew alphabet with its cosmological attributesfound in the Sepher Yetzirah to the 22 cards of the Major Arcana. Even if youhave already been exposed to this system of correspondences, you need to makesure that it has been memorized to the point that every detail can be recalledon demand.You will find in modern occult literature many a variation to the attributeslisted in Table 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187].Thelemites swap the Emperor with the Star in accordance with the 57th verse ofthe first chapter of The Book of the Law: “All these old letters of my Book arearight; but [image/188.jpg] is not the Star.” 1[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-478]Thelemites also keep the old tradition of positioning Justice at 8 and Strengthat 11, but retain the Golden Dawn zodiacal attributes of Libra for Justice andLeo for Strength. Such symbolism should be viewed as secondary rather thanprimary.The column labeled “Value” in Table 2[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187] displays thenumerical value assigned to the Hebrew alphabet, which is different from thenumeral associated to each Tarot card. In Eliphas Levi’s system, the numericalsequence for the first ten Major Arcana cards was the same value as thenumerical value of the Hebrew alphabet. But in the Golden Dawn system, the leadcard of the Fool has the sequence number of 0 but the numerical value of 1 forAleph. Thus, the Fool, which is Aleph and one, is also none. This is the greatsecret for the Tarot that the Golden Dawn system was able to decipher.TarotHebrewValueHieroglyphCosmosColor0.

The Golden Dawn Hebrew Alphabet Key to the TarotArthur Edward Waite, in his introduction to Knut Stenring’s translation of theSepher Yetzirah (1923), makes this wry observation on the secret order for theTarot:The proper placing of the Tarot Fool is the great crux of every attempt—andthere are several—to create a correspondence between the Trumps Major and theHebrew letters. If it be worthwhile to say so, the correct sequence, whichemerges from unexpected considerations, has never appeared in print, and it isnot to be confused with a Victorian allocation now well known, but which used tobe regarded as important: it referred the cipher-card to Aleph, and therefore tothe number one, so that we are confronted by the strange analogy of 0 = 1, thealternative being—as we have seen—that 0 = 300, otherwise 21 in the alphabeticalorder. 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-477]In his usual pompous style, Waite reveals the real secret of 0 = 1 as the truekey to the Tarot, even though he states the opposite. His own Tarot designbetrays this unique symbolism devised by the Golden Dawn (of which he was amember).My twelfth key to book 2 of The Western Mysteries devotes a whole chapter toshowing how Waite incorporated the symbolism of the Golden Dawn into each of hisown 78 unique designs for the Tarot, which still serves as the basic blueprintfor almost every modern Tarot deck.This secret of allocating the Fool to both the number zero and the Hebrew letterAleph is also hinted at in the 48th verse of the first chapter of AleisterCrowley’s The Book of the Law: “My prophet is a fool with his one, one, one; arenot they the Ox, and none by the book.” 3[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-476]The letters of the Hebrew alphabet each have a letter name, and for Aleph it iswritten as ALP ([image/321.jpg]), which is valued at 111. Each letter of thealphabet is in its shape a hieroglyph that is a translation of this letter name.For Aleph it is the Ox, as shown in the column labeled “Hieroglyph” in table 2.Thus, in the above verse by Crowley, the fool, the number 111, the Ox, and thevalue of none are all connected to Aleph as the Fool in the Tarot.The color scale allocated to both the Hebrew alphabet and the Tarot cards of theMajor Arcana shown in Table 2[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187] is derived from theGolden Dawn tradition that allocated four different color scales for the 22Major Arcana cards. This scale is the most representative of the hues of therainbow and is labeled the King scale, which corresponds to the highest of thefour worlds in the Hebrew Qabalah. It is incorporated into the design for theRose Cross used in the Golden Dawn system of magic.The Tarot cards in Table 2[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187] are ordered in adifferent way than in any previously published Tarot. Strength (Fortitude insome decks) and Justice are swapped, so that Strength is numbered 8 and Justice11. This swap occurred when Mathers and Westcott were applying the attributes ofthe Sepher Yetzirah to the designs of the cards themselves. Waite himselfswapped these two cards without giving a proper explanation for the exchange.The Hebrew letters Teth and Lamed are both simple letters (the other twodivisions being double and mother letters). The twelve simple letters areallocated to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and Teth is Leo, while Lamed isLibra. By establishing the Fool as Aleph and the lead card, Justice showing awoman holding a scale in one hand and a sword in the other would naturally fallto Teth and the sign Leo, while Strength showing a woman opening the mouth of alion would fall to Lamed and Libra. By swapping these two cards, Strengthbecomes Leo (clearly showing the lion of Leo in its design), while Justicebecomes Libra (clearly showing the scales of Libra in its design), which bringsboth cards into astrological harmony.The most radical move by Westcott and Mathers was to displace Eliphas Levi’sattribution of the Magician to Aleph and align Aleph to the Fool. The positionof the Fool card eluded all previous commentators on the Tarot. This card waseither put between key 20, Judgment, and key 21, the World, or it was allocatedto last place and followed key 21. By placing the Fool to lead the deck andnumbering it zero, the cosmological symbolism of the Hebrew alphabet matchesperfectly the images of the cards themselves once Strength and Justice areexchanged.Mathers and Westcott placed the 22 Major Arcana cards on a design of the Tree ofLife derived from Athanasius Kircher. They revised the paths connecting the tenstations on the Tree of Life (known as sephiroth) to reflect their own uniqueconnection of the Hebrew alphabet to the Tarot. This revised Tree of Lifemodified the existing paths of the traditional Jewish Qabalistic Tree of Life,which had a different scheme for the 22 paths connecting the ten sephiroth. Inthe original Tree of Life, the three horizontal paths were assigned to the threemother letters, the seven vertical paths were assigned to the seven planets, andthe twelve slanting paths were assigned to the twelve signs of the zodiac.4[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-475]The Tree of Life is a map of the universe, a Western equivalent to the Easternmandala. The diagram shows a series of ten circles symbolizing tenever-expanding limits of the universe. The tenth station at the bottom is earth,the ninth station through the third stations are the seven planets([image/634.jpg] ), the second station is the fixed stars composing the zodiac,and the first station is the white light of God, known as the primum mobile, orfirst swirling of creation. These ten stations should be seen as ten concentriccircles, where the center is Earth and the tenth station and the outermostcircle is the white light of the first station, the cause of all creation.These ten stations, known in Hebrew as sephirah (singular) and sephiroth(plural), form in their symbolism developed by the Golden Dawn the mostcomprehensive exposition of the symbolic nature of the first ten numbers. Theseten stations or numbers classify the astrological nature of our own cosmos andare given a complex coloring scheme in the Golden Dawn based on the rainbow ofcolors.The 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet serve as channels connecting these tenstations forming the Tree of Life. The combination of 10 stations and 22 pathsform the 32 Paths of Wisdom described in the Sepher Yetzirah, illustrated inFigure 1 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor188] and Table 3[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor189].[image/Book11_TreeLife.png]Figure 1.

The 32 Paths of Wisdom on the Tree of LifeIt should be noted that in the Golden Dawn system of magic, the first tenstations on the Tree of Life, known as the ten sephiroth, are allocated to the40 pip cards in the Minor Arcana of the Tarot. The four Aces fall to station 1,while the pip cards—numbered 2 through 10 in the suits of Wands, Cups, Swords,and Pentacles—are allocated to stations 2 through 10.The Hebrew Qabalah has four levels to the cosmos and each level has its own Treeof Life. The highest world is named Atziloth, which is the Archetypal world.This world is the idea of creation itself, the impulse behind creation, andcorresponds to the suit of Wands and the element of fire. The second world isnamed Briah, which is the Creative world. This world is the act of creating andcorresponds to the suit of Cups and the element of water. The third world isnamed Yetzirah, which is the Formative world. This world is the pattern orblueprint behind creation and corresponds to the suit of Swords and the elementof air. The fourth and final world is named Assiah, the world of Action. Thisworld is the created world, which is the material world, and corresponds to thesuit of Pentacles and the element of earth.In light of the four worlds for the Tree of Life, the Golden Dawn worked out acomplex system of color coding for the ten sephiroth and 22 paths of each ofthese four worlds. The four major color schemes of 32 colors for each of thesefour worlds are labeled the King scale for the world of Atziloth, the Queenscale for the world of Briah, the Prince scale for the world of Yetzirah, andthe Princess scale for the world of Assiah. These four names are derived fromthe rectified order of the court cards in the Golden Dawn system for the Tarot,where the old Knight becomes the new King and the old King becomes the newPrince. This has eluded many a modern commentator and will be discussed in greatdetail in a later section dealing with the four elements.Table 4 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor190] and Table 5[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor191] show the four colorscales for the ten sephiroth and the 22 paths in the four worlds. This schemewas first devised in the teachings of the Golden Dawn as envisioned by MoinaMathers, and was later popularized in the magical writings of Aleister Crowley.In his Book of Thoth, Crowley labeled the King scale as the Knight scale inorder to help the reader understand that the old Knight is now the new King inthe Golden Dawn allocations for color to the Tree of Life.Sephirah(Path)King Scale(Atziloth)Queen Scale(Briah)Prince Scale(Yetzirah)Princess Scale(Assiah)1—KetherBrillianceWhite brillianceWhitebrillianceWhite flecked gold2—ChockmahSoft sky blueGrayBluish-gray mother of pearlWhite flecked red, blue,yellow3—BinahCrimsonBlackDark brownGray flecked pink4—ChesedDeep violetBlueDeep purpleDeep azure flecked yellow5—GeburahOrangeScarlet redBright scarletRed flecked black6—TipherethClear pink roseYellow (gold)Rich salmonGold amber7—NetzachAmberEmeraldBright yellow greenOlive flecked gold8—HodVioletOrangeRed russetYellow brown flecked white9—YesodIndigoVioletVery dark purpleCitrine flecked azure10—MalkuthYellowCitrine, russet, olive, blackCitrine, russet,olive, black flecked goldBlack rayed yellowTable 4.

The Four Color Scales for the 22 Paths in the Four Worlds (continued)The Golden Dawn system for assigning color correspondences to the Tree of Lifegives four separate color schemes, one for each of the four worlds. The tensephiroth are given four unique color schemes corresponding to the four worlds.The 22 paths are also given four unique color patterns. There are 16 possiblecombinations (4 × 4) of ten sephiroth with 22 paths by pairing four differentcolor values of the sephiroth with four unique color values for the paths. Thus,the color scheme for the ten sephiroth in the Atziloth world can be connected by22 paths in four different color values (one for each world). This is true forthe other three worlds as well, each having four possible color schemes for theconnecting paths.The classic combination of 16 seen in most modern colored versions of the Treeof Life utilizes the Queen scale for the ten sephiroth and the King scale forthe 22 paths. This is the fifth of 16 combinations and corresponds to[image/630.jpg] of [image/614.jpg] in the world of Briah. Both of these colorschemes follow most closely the twelve gradations of the rainbow ranging fromred to red violet and appear in almost every color illustration of the Tree ofLife in modern magical literature.Though the various shades of color seem arbitrary for each of the 128 colorattributes shown in the color scales for the 32 emanations in four worlds, thereexists a pattern to the King, Queen, and Prince color scales. The King scalecorresponds to the father, the Queen scale to the mother, and the Prince scaleto the son (based on the family division found in the Tetragrammaton). The unionof the father with the mother results in the son. The combination of the Kingscale with the Queen scale results in the color attribute for the Prince scale.Look at the color scale for Chockmah: soft sky blue (King-Father) combines withgray (Queen-Mother) to form bluish-gray mother of pearl (Prince-Son). This logicholds true for all 32 emanations on the Tree of Life.The Princess color scale does not follow this logic. It is its own scale andrepresents an earthy amalgam of colors. This scale can be interpreted by usingthe matching colors found in the other three scales. Thus, the Princess scalefor Chockmah is white flecked red, blue, and yellow. This can be seen on theTree of Life using the Queen scale as Kether, Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphereth,which is white light speckled with [image/610.jpg] (blue), [image/622.jpg](red), and [image/628.jpg] (yellow).Now that we have established the basic core correspondences in the Golden Dawnfor the Tarot and the Tree of Life, we should study in detail the magicalsymbolism for the elements, the planets, and the zodiac, the magical buildingblocks of the cosmos. We will start with the elements, which in the Westerntradition can be grouped as three alchemical elements, four elements at the fourdirections, five elements around the five points of a pentagram, and 16counterchanges of four elements (each of the elements paired with itself and theother three), the last grouping of 16 (as 4 × 4) being extremely complex in itsset of correspondences.The Three Alchemical ElementsIn the lore of alchemy there exist three basic elements that compose the entireuniverse. These three elements are Mercury ([image/713.jpg]), Sulfur([image/714.jpg]), and Salt ([image/Book11_Salt.png]). As color they are yellowfor Mercury, red for Sulfur, and blue for Salt. These three symbols appear inArthur Edward Waite’s Wheel of Fortune card on the rim of the wheel.This trinity of Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury symbolize female, male, and combinedenergies. Salt is the feminine, receptive force of water and the Moon. Sulfur isthe masculine, active force of fire and the Sun. Mercury is the joining of maleand female to form both the child and the hermaphrodite as air and the Stars.These three elements also correspond to the three qualities of human life asportrayed in the Hindu theory of the three Gunas (or types of human behavior).These three aspects are labeled weighty inertia (Tamas), fiery activity (Rajas),and poise in quietude (Sattva) and are symbolized as tattvas by the yellowsquare (Tamas), the red upright triangle (Rajas), and the blue circle (Sattva).Salt is equivalent to Tamas, Sulfur to Rajas, and Mercury to Sattva.Arthur Edward Waite utilized this variation of the three tattva colors ofyellow, red, and blue as the three alchemical elements in designing his Wheel ofFortune card. The yellow serpent descending the wheel is[image/Book11_Salt.png], the rising red Hermanubis is [image/714.jpg], and theblue sphinx at rest on top is [image/713.jpg].This basic triple division for classifying our world is also found in theesoteric attributes of the Sepher Yetzirah, for the Hebrew alphabet is dividedinto three parts: three mother letters, which are the source of all sounds;seven double letters, which have two distinct pronunciations each; and twelvesimple letters, which have only one pronunciation. The twelve simple letters arethe zodiac, the seven double letters are the seven planets, and the three motherletters are the three elements.These three mother letters are Aleph as the element of air, Mem as the elementof water, and Shin as the element of fire. Their pronunciations hold the key tothis elemental symbolism, for Aleph is the ah of a breath, Mem is the murmuringof running water, and Shin is the hiss of a fire. The three correspond to thealchemical trinity as Aleph for Mercury, Mem for Salt, and Shin for Sulfur.Table 6 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor192] delineatesthe elements as three.Symbol[image/Book11_Salt.png][image/713.jpg][image/714.jpg]AlchemySaltMercurySulfurColor (Alchemy)BlueYellowRedCosmosMoonStarSunFamilyMotherChildFatherYahwehHeh ([image/17.jpg])Vav ([image/32.jpg])Yod ([image/13.jpg])IAOA(Moon)[image/722.jpg] (Stars)I(Sun)GunasTamasSattvaRajasQualityInertiaEquilibriumActivityMotionDownwardCenteredUpwardTattvaSquareCircleTriangleColor (Tattva)YellowBlueRedHebrewMem ([image/210.jpg])Aleph ([image/70.jpg])Shin ([image/110.jpg])SoundMurmuringExhalingHissingBodyBelly, genitalsHeart, lungsBrainElementWaterAirFireTarotXII.

Alchemical Trinity of ElementsThis division of the elements into three forms the basis for the most commondivision of the elements in the Western magical tradition. That division is thegrouping of the elements into four (by adding earth to the three elements ofair, water, and fire) to correspond to the four basic directions of the compassas north, south, east, and west.The Fourfold Division of the ElementsThere is a beautiful portrayal of the symbolic components for the division ofthe elements into four in Arthur Edward Waite’s portrayal of the Wheel ofFortune (Figure 2 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor193]),which he derived from Eliphas Levi’s illustration of the Wheel of Ezekiel in TheMagical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum Interpreted by the Tarot Trumps. As thethree alchemical elements divide the world into air, fire, and water, thedivision into four adds the additional element of earth to the mix.These four elements within the alchemical tradition are derived from variousparts of a hexagram, formed by the interlacing of two triangles([image/Book11_StarDavid.png]). Fire is the upright triangle ([image/630.jpg]),water is the downward triangle ([image/614.jpg]), air is the upright trianglewith the upper crossbar from the hexagram ([image/590.jpg]), while earth is thedownward triangle with the lower crossbar from the hexagram ([image/729.jpg]).This interlinking of two triangles is also the basis in the East for the mostsupreme mandala of all, the Sri Yantra, composed of nine interlocking triangles.Together these four elements can be aligned to the four directions. The GoldenDawn Lesser Pentagram Ritual assigns an element and a color to each of the fourdirections: the element of air and the color yellow are in the east, the elementof fire and the color red are in the south, the element of water and the colorblue are in the west, and the element of earth and the color green (or black)are in the north.[image/RWS-10-FortuneRx.png]Figure 2. Waite’s Wheel of Fortune CardThe four elements are also the basis in the Tarot for the division of the MinorArcana into four suits: the suit of Wands corresponds to the element of fire andthe color red, the suit of Cups corresponds to the element of water and thecolor blue, the suit of Swords corresponds to the element of air and the coloryellow, and the suit of Pentacles corresponds to the element of earth and thecolor green.The binding element to this fourfold division used in the Golden Dawn is thefour-lettered name of God in Hebrew known as the Tetragrammaton([image/730.jpg]) and variously translated as Yahweh, Iehovah, or Jehovah. InHebrew it is written as Yod ([image/13.jpg]) valued at 10, Heh ([image/17.jpg])valued at 5, Vav ([image/32.jpg]) valued at 6, and Heh ([image/17.jpg]) valuedat 5. Together they equal the mystic number of 26.Each of these four letters of God reflects the division of the family intofather, mother, son, and daughter. Yod ([image/13.jpg]) is the father, Heh([image/62.jpg]) is the mother, Vav ([image/32.jpg]) is the son, and the finalHeh ([image/17.jpg]) is the daughter. The father is the element of fire, themother is the element of water, the son is the element of air, and the daughteris the element of earth. Now this elemental division of the family unit intofour is the basis of the Golden Dawn’s revision in the Tarot to the order of thefour court cards.In the Tarot, the four Minor Arcana suits of Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacleseach contain four figures derived from the court of a king: the King and hisQueen and the Knight and his Page. Before the advent of the Golden Dawn, thesefour court cards (or coate cards, since they are all dressed in Medieval garb)fell to the family division of King as father, Queen as mother, Knight as son,and Page as daughter. But within the symbolism of the Golden Dawn for the Tarot,these four court cards assumed a different family order. The Knight became thefather and the new King, the Queen remained the mother, the old King became thenew Prince as the son, and the Page became his consort of Princess as thedaughter. In this new order for the court cards, the Knight as the King remainedmounted on his steed, the Queen remained seated on her throne, the new Princecommanded a chariot (which combined the mobility of the Knight with the throneof the Queen), and the Princess was stripped of her clothes and wrapped in herelement.Crowley, in devising his Book of Thoth, saw the possibility of the readermissing this subtle change in the court cards. He retained the old name ofKnight rather than renaming him King, kept the Queen, and added the Prince andPrincess.In Crowley’s magical record from May 3, 1920, he attempted to elucidate thismisunderstood bit of symbolism unique to the Golden Dawn: “Why do the TarotCards give the Knight as the father, the King as the son? It is an echo of thelegend of the Wandering Knight who wins the Queen, and whose son becomes theKing. This, in turn, relates to the customs of matriarchy.” 5[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-474]Further Clarification on the Court CardsEliphas Levi described the traditional order for the court cards of the Tarot asfollows: “KING, QUEEN, KNIGHT, ESQUIRE. The married pair, the youth, the child…”(from Doctrine and Ritual of Transcendental Magic, p. 103, 1896). Thistraditional symbolism for the court cards depicting a King and a Queen as amarried pair, a Knight as a youth, and a Page as a child was revised in theGolden Dawn teachings found in their Book T. In this esoteric Golden Dawnsystem, the traditional Knight was elevated to the status of the King astridehis horse, while the traditional King became the Prince riding a chariot. ThePage was transformed to a consort for this Prince as a Princess, while only theQueen remained as herself and became a consort for the Knight as the new King.There are two main Tarot decks designed in the twentieth century that definealmost all the symbolism found in every modern deck. These two decks are from A.E. Waite (illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith) and Aleister Crowley (illustratedby Lady Frieda Harris). When Waite designed his deck, he kept the traditionaltitles for the court cards as King, Queen, Knight, and Page. But when Crowleydesigned his deck, he incorporated the proper designs for the court cards asenvisioned by the Golden Dawn. He correctly showed the Prince in his chariot andthe King mounted on his horse. His one variation was retitling the new King asthe Knight, so that it would be easier to identify the new King as thetraditional Knight.In looking at any modern variation on the Tarot, we can immediately identify itas coming from either Crowley or Waite. If the court cards show a Prince drivinga chariot and a King on his steed, then they stem from the Golden Dawn system asillustrated by Crowley’s Tarot. But if they have as court cards the traditionaldesigns of King, Queen, Knight, and Page, then they are derived from the WaiteTarot deck.It should be noted that the majority of Tarot decks published since 1970 havebeen influenced by Waite rather than Crowley. However, the Crowley/Harris Bookof Thoth was the first Tarot design to show not only the correct court cards butalso the proper titles and astrological correspondences for the Minor Arcana, aswell as the correct Hebrew alphabet and astrological attributes for the MajorArcana according to Book T of the Golden Dawn.This subtle point of symbolism has been missed by Arthur Edward Waite, PaulFoster Case, Israel Regardie, Robert Wang, and Christopher Hyatt, to name just afew contemporary commentators on the Tarot. If this fine point of symbolism ismissed, then the two elements of fire and air are inadvertently swapped. If theMagician can comprehend this secret concerning the court cards, then all theelemental secrets found in the esoteric teachings of the Golden Dawn can befully comprehended. The correspondences for the four court cards are listed inTable 7 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor194].Traditional TitleKnightQueenKingPageRevised G.D.

The Secret Order of the Court CardsEach of the four letters of the Tetragrammaton correspond as well to the fourKerubic Angels of Lion, Eagle, Man, and Bull that drove the wheeled chariot ofEzekiel. (They also drive the chariots of the Princes in the court cards.) TheLion is Yod and fire, the Eagle is Heh and water, the Man is Vav and air, andthe Bull is the final Heh and earth. The astrological symbols corresponding tothese four angels can be numbered as 26, the same value as the Tetragrammatonwritten on the Wheel of Fortune. For the Lion is Leo, the 5th sign; the Eagle isScorpio, the 8th sign; the Man is Aquarius, the 11th sign; and the Bull isTaurus, the 2nd sign: 5 + 8 + 11 + 2 = 26 = [image/743.jpg].If we use the Latin Cabala Simplex values of Selenus (1624) to decode the wordROTA (an anagram for TAROT) written on the rim of the wheel, the number 48 isgenerated, as R = 16 + O = 15 + T = 18 + A = 1 (Table 8[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor195]).If the value for the Tetragrammaton is subtracted from the value of ROTA, thenumber 22 is produced, symbolizing the 22 Tarot keys of the Major Arcana liningthe rim of the Wheel of Fortune (48 − 26 = 22). If we add these two numbersinstead, the number 74 is generated (as 26 + 48), which is the value of theletter name Lamed in full ([image/344.jpg] = 30 + 40 + 4 = 74) that governs thenext Tarot key, Justice.ABC, KDEFGHI, JLM1234567891011NOPQRSTU, VXYZ1213141516171819202122Table 8.

The Hierophant,and the final Heh = IV. The Emperor.

The Four Elements in the Wheel of Fortune CardIn the “Alchemy” column in Table 9[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor196], earth is symbolizedas the sign for Aquarius ([image/760.jpg]), representing the alchemicaloperation of dissolution. It is the dissolving of the three alchemical elementsinto one divine elixir. The Latin letters correspond in shape to the alchemicalelements, while the quadrant ruled by each element (and each fixed sign) alsogoverns one of the four quadrants of each directional Enochian Watchtower.The four elements flow down the Tree of Life and touch all ten sephiroth. Airflows from Kether to Tiphereth to Yesod, forming the middle pillar. Fire zigzagsfrom Chockmah to Geburah to Netzach. Water zigzags from Binah to Chesed to Hod.Earth is the joining of air, fire, and water at Malkuth.Table 10 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor197] containsfour unique color schemes for the four elements. The first color code is basedon the four elements in Western magic. The second color code is based on thefour humours of the body derived from the Greek physician Hippocrates. The thirdcode is based on the Chinese elements, while the fourth code is based on theHindu tattva system.Each is a unique take on the four elements, but the primary scale to use is thefirst one, based on the three primary colors of red, blue, and yellow for fire,water, and air, and the fourth color of green (or black) for earth.Symbol[image/630.jpg][image/614.jpg][image/590.jpg][image/729.jpg]ElementFireWaterAirEarthColor (Element)RedBlueYellowGreen/blackYahwehYodHehVavHehHebrewShinMemAlephTavTarotJudgmentHanged ManFoolWorldFamilyFatherMotherSonDaughterSuitWandCupSwordPentacleCourtKnightQueenKingPageDirectionSouthWestEastNorthSeasonSummerFallSpringWinterArchangelMichaelGabrielRaphaelAurialSephiroth2, 5, 73, 4, 81, 6, 910Planets (Sephiroth)[image/765.jpg][image/766.jpg][image/767.jpg][image/Book11Cross.png]HumourYellow bilePhlegmBloodBlack bileTempermentCholericPhlegmaticSanguineMelancholicBodySpleenBrain/lungsLiverGall bladderQualityHot/dryWet/coldHot/wetDry/coldColor (Humour)YellowBlueRedBlackTrigramChen [image/768.jpg]Tui [image/769.jpg]Sun [image/770.jpg]Ken [image/771.jpg]NatureFireLakeWind/woodMountainColor (Trigram)RedBlackGreenWhiteTattvaAgniApasVayuPrithiviShape[image/630.jpg][image/773.jpg][image/774.jpg][image/775.jpg]Color (Tattva)RedWhite (silver)BlueYellowTable 10. Additional Symbols for the Four ElementsThe Pentagram of Five ElementsA further mystery to the division of the elements into four is the addition of afifth element of spirit, which rules and animates the other four (Figure 3[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor198]). This division intofive elements is placed upon the five points of the upright pentagram so thatthe lower right point is fire, the upper right point is water, the upper leftpoint is air, the lower left point is earth, and the crowning apex point isspirit. The position of the four lesser elements on the pentagram is the sameposition as the four Kerubic angels in the Wheel of Fortune card, as well as thefour quadrants of the four Enochian Watchtowers. If the pentagram is tracedbeginning with the apex point and moving next to the lower right leg, theelements of spirit, fire, air, water, and earth are traced in order, reflectingthe older Renaissance model of fire and air above water and earth.[image/Book11_Fig3.png]Figure 3. Pentagram of Five ElementsThis five-pointed star expands the sacred name of God known as theTetragrammaton to the Holy name of Jesus as Yehoshuah, which places the letterShin ([image/110.jpg]) as a symbol of the fiery spirit in the center of the fourelements. Yahweh ([image/777.jpg]) becomes Yehoshuah ([image/778.jpg]), whichwas the great secret of the Renaissance Christian Qabalists. As Yahweh islabeled the Tetragrammaton (or word of four letters), Yehoshuah is labeled thePentagrammaton (or word of five letters).The pentagram is the primary symbol of both magic and the magician. It isreferred to as the Pentalpha, since it is made up of the Greek letter Alpha (Α)entwined five times. In the tradition of the Golden Dawn, this symbol is tracedin the four directions to protect the magician during the ceremony of the LesserPentagram Ritual.In Renaissance art, the upright pentagram was traced on the human body so thatthe apex point was at the head, the upright points at the arms, and the downwardpoints at the legs.Inverted, this pentagram has been associated with black magic or the darker artsin modern times. But the ancient symbol of a pentagram with its apex pointpointing downward initially symbolized the light of the star descending on Earthas a blessing to humanity. This can be seen as a symbol for the Star ofBethlehem, which is a downward-pointing star shedding its light on Earth to markthe birth of the Messiah. This inverted pentagram symbolism is also used by theMasonic order of the Eastern Star to denote the guiding star for the Magi thatleads to the birth of the Messiah.This fivefold symbolism of the elements is an expansion of the table for fourelements. The addition of a fifth element in alchemy is the operation ofdistilling the quintessence from the primal four elements. Table 11 illustratesthe quintessential division of the elements.Symbol[image/779.jpg][image/780.jpg][image/Book11Burst.png][image/781.jpg][image/782.jpg]ElementFireWaterSpirit(Space)AirEarthPentagramLower rightUpper rightApexUpper leftLower leftYehoshuahYod ([image/783.png])Heh ([image/784.png])Shin ([image/785.png])Vav ([image/786.png])Heh ([image/784.png])Color(Elements)RedBlueWhiteYellowGreen (Black)PlatonicSolidPyramidIcosahedronDodecahedronOctahedronCubeSides4201286TarotWandsCupsMajor ArcanaSwordsPentaclesFingerMiddleIndexThumbRingLittleSenseSightTasteHearingSmellTouchMajor ArcanaEmperorStrengthHierophantLoversHermitTree of Life5 and 74 and 81 and 26 and 93 and 10DirectionSouthWestCenterEastNorthTattvaAgniApasAkasaVayuPrithiviShapeTriangleCrescentOvalCircleSquareColor(Tattva)RedWhite(Silver)Black(Blue violet)BlueYellowChinese ElementFireWaterMetalWoodEarthStar[image/788.jpg][image/789.jpg][image/790.jpg][image/791.jpg][image/792.jpg]Color(Star)RedBlackWhiteGreenYellowTable 11. Pentagram of Five ElementsIn table 11, spirit can refer to space, as opposed to the four terrestrialelements. This is especially true in terms of the tattva Akasa. The five MajorArcana cards listed represent the five senses by way of their correspondingHebrew alphabet letters. They are all taken from the twelve simple letters thatrepresent the zodiac. The connections between the five senses and five selectHebrew alphabet letters are derived from the symbolism found in the Book ofFormation (Sepher Yetzirah). The ten sephiroth on the Tree of Life refer to thefive fingers of the right and left hands. For the right hand, the thumb is 1,the index finger is 4, the middle finger is 5, the ring finger is 6, and thelittle finger is 3. For the left hand, the thumb is 2, the index finger is 8,the middle finger is 7, the ring finger is 9, and the little finger is 10.For the Chinese elements, earth and spirit are interchangeable, so that in onescheme metal is spirit while in an alternate scheme earth is spirit. The ChineseTaoist system of magic employs the pentagram as a symbol of creation anddestruction. The five points of the pentagram correspond to the five Chineseelements as follows: apex point = metal, lower right = wood, upper right =water, upper left = earth, and lower left = fire.The path of creation is the clockwise motion starting with the lower left leg ofthe pentagram and following the other four points in a clockwise motion, leadingfrom fire to earth, metal, water, and wood, then returning to fire again. Thepath of destruction traces the actual shape of the pentagram and begins with thelower left leg of fire and then traces upward, following the path of the star tometal first, then wood, earth, and water, leading back to fire again.One final system of dividing the elements will be detailed next, and that is thesixteen subdivisions of the four major elements of fire, water, air, and earth.It is at the heart of the system of magical correspondences found in the GoldenDawn system of magic.Sixteen Combinations of the Four ElementsThe four elements have sixteen possible pairings, and these sixteen form themost detailed descriptions for the elements. These sixteen subdivisions areillustrated by the sixteen divinatory shapes of geomancy, sixteen tattvacounterchanges (as well as sixteen select I Ching hexagrams), sixteen letters ofthe Enochian alphabet, sixteen court cards of the Minor Arcana, and the sixteensecret channels normally not drawn on the Tree of Life that form the 33rdthrough 48th invisible paths. There are also sixteen color combinations for thefour color schemes in the Golden Dawn for the Tree of Life in the four worlds,as well as sixteen quadrants of the Enochian Watchtowers.The Golden Dawn teachings concerning these sixteen counterchanges for the fourelements depend on a correct understanding of the four court cards, and mostcommentators on this subject confuse two cards, the Knight and the King. Theolder titles of Knight, Queen, King, and Page were transformed into King, Queen,Prince, and Princess by the Golden Dawn, and clarified by Crowley as Knight,Queen, Prince, and Princess.The tables in this section will use the traditional titles for the court cardsas Knight, Queen, King, and Page to make a clear distinction between the titleof Knight and King, since the old Knight is the revised title of King while theold King is the revised title of Prince within the Golden Dawn tradition.The correct allocation of the sixteen elements to the sixteen court cards isshown in Table 12 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor200].Court CardWandsCupsSwordsPentaclesKnightFire of fireFire of waterFire of airFire of earthQueenWater of fireWater of waterWater of airWater of earthKingAir of fireAir of waterAir of airAir of earthPageEarth of fireEarth of waterEarth of airEarth of earthTable 12. Elemental Counterchanges for the Court CardsEach of the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth are paired to all ofthe four elements. Thus, fire is subdivided into fire of fire, water of fire,air of fire, and earth of fire. Each of these four pairings is predominatelyfire, but each is in some way altered by its pair. Fire of fire intensifies theelement of fire itself, while water of fire cools the fire by the influence ofwater. As symbols, fire of fire could be a fire consuming itself, while water offire could be a flow of lava.The tattva itself when paired to a tattva counterchange can serve as a portal tothe astral landscape described by any specific elemental counterchange. Thehexagrams of the I Ching corresponding to the sixteen elemental counterchangescan also serve as a means of imagining an astral elemental landscape.Geomancy is an ancient form of divination that utilizes the earth as thedivining table. Sixteen geomantic shapes are generated by four rows of eitherone or two points. These sixteen figures are given titles that indicate theirdivinatory meaning. The Golden Dawn attributes for geomancy are derived fromLatin titles for these sixteen figures, but this divinatory system has itsorigins in Africa and the Middle East. The Enochian alphabet attributes can becorrectly deciphered by linking these sixteen geomantic shapes to the sixteenelemental counterchanges. Table 13 lists the sixteen geomantic figures and theirassociated elemental counterchanges.Within the Golden Dawn tradition these sixteen geomantic shapes are tied tosixteen select Enochian alphabet letters. The connection between the two isestablished through the astrological nature of these sixteen geomantic shapes.It is this connection that gives sixteen select Enochian letters their specificnumber values.The zodiac signs associated with the court cards are each composed of the last10 degrees of the preceding sign followed by the first 20 degrees of thepredominate sign. The corresponding geomantic shape has both a planet and a signassociated with it, including the lunar nodes, known as the head and the tail ofthe dragon. The planets associated with the zodiac signs are their planetaryrulers.FigureTitleFigureTitleFigureTitleFigureTitle[image/acquisito.png]Acquisitio[image/793.jpg][image/puer.png]Puer[image/794.jpg][image/FortunaMajor.png]FortunaMajor[image/795.jpg][image/CaudaDraconis.png]CaudaDraconis[image/796.jpg][image/laetitia.png]Laetitia[image/797.jpg][image/populus.png]Populus[image/798.jpg][image/rubeus.png]Rubeus[image/799.jpg][image/via.png]Via[image/800.jpg][image/albus.png]Albus[image/801.jpg][image/puella.png]Puella[image/802.jpg][image/tristitia.png]Tristia[image/803.jpg][image/FortunaMinor.png]FortunaMinor[image/804.jpg][image/conjunctio.png]Conjunctio[image/805.jpg][image/carcer.png]Carcer[image/806.jpg][image/amissio.png]Amissio[image/807.jpg][image/CaputDraconis.png]CaputDraconis[image/808.jpg]Table 13.

Sixteen Sub-elements as Court Cards, Geomancy, and Astrology(continued)There is a direct link between the sixteen court cards and the sixteencounterchanges of elements, and this link in turn determines the numbering ofthe Enochian alphabet by way of the sixteen geomantic figures. The path tosolving the correct attributes for the sixteen elements is as follows: 16elements [image/881.jpg]16 court cards [image/881.jpg]16 Major Arcana[image/881.jpg]16 geomantic figures [image/881.jpg] select 16 Enochian letters.From these associations, the Hebrew letter for the corresponding Major Arcana islinked, and the number value of that Hebrew letter is then paired with sixteenselect Enochian alphabet letters, all linked by the sixteen geomantic shapes.The Numerology of Enochian LettersHow did the Golden Dawn derive numerical values for the Enochian alphabet? Atable showing sixteen select Enochian letters as the sixteen geomantic figuresis found on page 77 of volume IV of Israel Regardie’s The Golden Dawn. There isno source for this table, but it clearly connects the Enochian alphabet with thedivinatory shapes for geomancy. The Enochian table “Notes to the Book of theConcourse of the Forces” is found on page 298. This second table offers acorrelation between the sixteen geomantic figures and sixteen select Hebrewalphabet letters based on the astrological attributes of the geomantic figures.Mathers was able to discover the correct astrological attributes for the Hebrewalphabet from the Qabalistic text the Sepher Yetzirah and connected them to thetraditional astrological attributes of geomancy. If we combine these two tables,the numerical values for sixteen select Enochian letters can be obtained byparalleling Enochian to geomancy to astrology to Hebrew.But where did the Golden Dawn derive geomantic attributes for sixteen selectEnochian alphabet letters? The source Mathers used in numbering Enochian isfound in A Treatise of Angel Magic by Dr. Rudd (being Ms. Harley 6482 in theBritish Library). In the table “The Characters of the Sixteen Figures ofGeomancy” (found on page 20 of the manuscript), Rudd assigned to sixteen selectEnochian letters both their geomantic figures and their astrological attributes.Mathers spent many hours in the British Museum for research leading to theesoteric teachings of the Golden Dawn, and he used these attributes and combinedthem with the astrological values for the Hebrew alphabet. By this combinationhe numbered sixteen select Enochian alphabet letters by substituting the numbervalues for the Hebrew alphabet.As an example, Dr. Rudd showed that the Enochian letter Pe was the geomanticshape Puer and also Mars in Aries. Mathers knew that Aries in Hebrew was theletter Heh, valued at 5. Therefore, he numbered Pe as 5.Crowley, in studying this system, realized that five additional Enochian letterswere without astrological or number value. He intuited that these five remainingletters should be aligned to the five points of the pentagram, and based ontheir elemental attributes he paired these five additional Enochian letters tothe appropriate Hebrew alphabet letters and gave them a number value. Theseattributes can be seen in Crowley’s notes to his own The Vision and the Voicewhen he numerically deciphered the three-letter Enochian calls.Where Mathers depended on Rudd’s previous research in order to establish anumber value for the Enochian alphabet, Crowley based his additions on his ownmagical insight. Neither Mathers nor Crowley utilized Dee’s own use of theEnochian alphabet as numbers as it appears in his calls to the 30 Aethyrs. Tosee a discussion of Dee’s own number code for Enochian, refer to theintroduction of chapter 11 in the second volume of my Western Mysteries.Table 15 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203] lists thecorresponding Hebrew letter and Major Arcana card based on the astrologicalqualities of the geomantic shapes. Where Table 14[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor202] linked the sixteencounterchanged elements to the sixteen court cards, Table 15[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203] links the sixteencounterchanged elements to sixteen select Major Arcana cards and their Hebrewletter equivalents. The number value of the Hebrew letter determines the numbervalue of the corresponding Enochian letter, which link back to the geomanticshape for each of the sixteen counterchanged elements.ElementMajor ArcanaHebrewNumber ValueEnochianNameEnglish[image/885.jpg]Temperance[image/886.jpg]60[image/887.jpg]GonI[image/888.jpg]Emperor[image/889.jpg]5[image/890.jpg]PeB[image/891.jpg]Strength[image/892.jpg]9[image/893.jpg]GedG[image/894.jpg]Judgment[image/895.jpg]300[image/896.jpg]OrthF[image/897.jpg]Moon[image/898.jpg]100[image/899.jpg]DonR[image/832.jpg]Chariot[image/901.jpg]8[image/902.jpg]MalsP[image/903.jpg]Death[image/904.jpg]50[image/905.jpg]DrunN[image/906.jpg]Hanged Man[image/907.jpg]40[image/908.jpg]UrL[image/909.jpg]Lovers[image/910.jpg]7[image/911.jpg]GraphE[image/912.jpg]Justice[image/913.jpg]30[image/914.jpg]MedO[image/915.jpg]Star[image/916.jpg]90[image/899.jpg]TalM[image/918.jpg]Fool[image/919.jpg]1[image/920.jpg]CephZ[image/921.jpg]Hermit[image/922.jpg]10[image/923.jpg]FamS[image/868.jpg]Devil[image/925.jpg]70[image/926.jpg]VauU[image/927.jpg]Hierophant[image/928.jpg]6[image/929.jpg]UnA[image/878.jpg]World[image/931.jpg]400[image/932.jpg]GisaTTable 15. Sixteen Sub-elements as Tarot, Hebrew, Number, and EnochianThe Major Arcana cards associated with the sixteen sub-elements and the sixteencourt cards are derived from the geomantic astrological attributes. The numbervalue for each Hebrew letter associated with the Major Arcana is the source forthe number value of sixteen select Enochian alphabet letters in the Golden Dawnsystem of magic.The Golden Dawn magical symbolism for the Enochian alphabet covered only 16 of21 letters. The remaining five excluded Enochian letters were numbered byAleister Crowley in his analysis found in The Vision and the Voice. Crowley,realizing there were five additional Enochian letters to be given symbolicvalue, came up with his own system based on the elemental values of thepentagram. He intuited each of these attributes, for there was no correspondingsystem of attributes for these five missing letters found in the Golden Dawnteachings on Enochian.In table 16 are the number values for the five excluded Enochian letters thatAleister Crowley was able to decipher by means of the elemental pentagram andthe corresponding Hebrew letters for the four elements plus spirit. Crowley gavefor spirit the value of the Hebrew letter Daleth ([image/76.jpg]) at 4, sincethe key number to his Liber Legis was 31 as AL ([image/24.jpg]) for God, whichreduces to 4 as 3 + 1.

The Five Excluded Enochian LettersThe teachings of the Golden Dawn by means of astral projection explored theinner landscape of each of the sixteen combinations of elements. The doorway toenter these elemental landscapes was the Eastern system of tattvas (derived fromRama Prasad’s Science of Breath), which combined five elements (in the form of ayellow square, silver crescent, red triangle, blue circle, and blue-violet oval)into twenty-five sub-elements. The primary element was first drawn, and then thesecondary element was drawn as a smaller shape within the larger symbol. Sixteenof these combinations correspond directly to the sixteen combinations ofelements. Thus, the tattva for air of fire was a blue circle within a redtriangle, while the tattva for fire of air was a red triangle within a bluecircle.Sixteen select hexagrams composing the divinatory oracles from the Chinese IChing can also be associated with these sixteen combinations of the fourelements, for each hexagram is made of a primary trigram at its base and asecondary trigram above this base. The trigrams themselves are made up of threelines each, and are eight in number. Four of these trigrams were allocated tothe four elements by Aleister Crowley in his own working with the I Ching. Thesefour trigrams are Chen ([image/768.jpg]) as fire, Tui ([image/769.jpg]) aswater, Sun ([image/770.jpg]) as air, and Ken ([image/953.jpg]) as earth.

Sixteen Sub-elements as Astral LandscapesAs the four suits of ten cards each in the Minor Arcana correspond to the tensephiroth on the Tree of Life, and the 22 Major Arcana cards form the 22 visiblepaths that join these ten cosmic stations, the sixteen court cards correspondingto the sixteen sub-elements have two special allocations on the Tree of Life,one known and the other secret.The Golden Dawn places the sixteen court cards on four specific sephiroth on theTree of Life corresponding to the formula of the Tetragrammaton. This subtlesymbolism has been misinterpreted by most commentators on the Tarot, for theKnight and the King are typically confused in this formula. The four letters ofthe Tetragrammaton as the family unit of father, mother, son, and daughter areplaced on the Tree of Life at Chockmah (2), Binah (3), Tiphereth (6),and Malkuth(10). These in turn are the stations for the Knight, Queen, King, and Page.Since there are four sephirotic Trees in the four worlds, the sixteen courtcards correspond to four unique sephiroth in each world. The sixteen uniquesephirotic attributes for the sixteen court cards are shown in Table 18[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206].ElementCourt CardFamilySephirahWorldColor[image/885.jpg]Knightof WandsFatherChockmahAtzilothPale sky blue[image/814.jpg]Queen of WandsMotherBinahAtzilothCrimson[image/891.jpg]King of WandsSonTipherethAtzilothPink rose[image/824.jpg]Page of WandsDaughterMalkuthAtzilothYellow[image/827.jpg]Knight of CupsFatherChockmahBriahGray[image/832.jpg]Queen of CupsMotherBinahBriahBlack[image/837.jpg]King of CupsSonTipherethBriahYellow[image/906.jpg]Page of CupsDaughterMalkuthBriahCitrine, russet, olive, black[image/909.jpg]Knight of SwordsFatherChockmahYetzirahBluish-gray mother of pearl[image/995.jpg]Queen of SwordsMotherBinahYetzirahDark brown[image/915.jpg]King of SwordsSonTipherethYetzirahRich salmon[image/997.jpg]Page of SwordsDaughterMalkuthYetzirahCitrine, russet, olive, black (flecked gold)Table 18.

The Sixteen Court Cards on the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life(continued)There is a second secret allocation for the court cards to the Tree of Life.Paul Foster Case, in his mail-order lessons on the Tree of Life, gave a diagramshowing the sixteen invisible paths on the Tree of life. These sixteen paths arethe channels not shown on the Tree of Life that connect the various sephiroth.Case did not give any allocations to these sixteen invisible paths. However, Iwas able to devise a system of allocations for these sixteen invisible pathsshown in Figure 4 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor207].They are based on the elemental nature of each court card based on the suit foreach card.[image/Book11_InvisiblePaths_TreeofLife.png]Figure 4. The Court Cards as Sixteen Invisible Paths and Four Select Sephirothon the Tree of LifeThe Origins of the Sixteen Invisible PathsThe diagram of the sixteen Invisible Paths on the Tree of Life (Figure 4[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor207]) does not exist inthe esoteric magical teachings of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Thisdiagram also does not appear in the copious magical writings of Aleister Crowleynor in the Qabalistic studies of his student Frater Achad. However, this obscurediagram does appear in the correspondence course dealing with the Tree of Lifeby Paul Foster Case for his own fraternal order of the Builders of the Adytum.Case provided this diagram without any attributions or commentary. When firstencountering this diagram, I discovered a pattern to interpret these sixteeninvisible paths based on the symbolism found in the teachings of the GoldenDawn.Since the forty Minor Arcana cards of Ace through Ten are the ten sephiroth,while the 22 Major Arcana cards are the 22 visible paths on the Tree of Life,the remaining sixteen court cards can be attributed to these sixteen invisiblepaths.Twelve invisible paths emanate from the first three sephiroth on the Tree ofLife known as the supernal triad of Kether (1), Chockmah (2), and Binah (3).Each of these three sephiroth is the source for one of the three elementsflowing down the Tree of Life: Kether is the element of air, Chockmah is theelement of fire, and Binah is the element of water.By this symbolism, twelve of the court cards correspond directly to four paths,each emanating from the three sephiroth making up the supernal triad. The Wandssuit of four court cards emanates from Chockmah as the element of fire. The Cupssuit of four court cards emanates from Binah as the element of water. The Swordssuit of four court cards emanates from Kether as the element of air.The Pentacles suit of four court cards is the element of earth, and falls to thefour remaining paths below the abyss emanating from Chesed and Geburah. Two ofthese invisible paths end in Malkuth, which is the element of earth on the Treeof Life.These sixteen invisible paths are governed by sixteen select Enochian alphabetletters, since the sixteen court cards are ruled by sixteen Enochian lettersbased on the symbolism of both geomancy and astrology. Thus, the visible pathsthat form the Tree of Life are governed by Hebrew, while the invisible paths aregoverned by Enochian.The first three sephiroth on the Tree of Life form a supernal triangle and arethe source of the threefold elements of air, fire, and water. The first station,Kether, is air; the second station, Chockmah, is fire; and the third station,Binah, is water. These three supernal elements flow through the rest of thesephiroth on the Tree of Life, ending in Malkuth as a summation of the threeelements in the fourth element of earth. Kether flows down the middle pillar toTiphereth and Yesod, Chockmah zigzags to Geburah and Netzach, and Binah zigzagsto Chesed and Hod. All meet in Malkuth to combine the three elements into afourth element of earth. The flow of the elements on the first ten stations ofthe Tree of Life is shown in Table 19[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor208].ElementSephirothAstrology[image/590.jpg]1.

Hod[image/1007.jpg][image/729.jpg]10. Malkuth[image/1009.jpg]Table 19. The Flow of Elements across the SephirothIf we look at the sixteen invisible paths, we will discover that the sephirothforming the supernal triad each have four invisible paths, while Chesed andGeburah each have two invisible paths. Using the logic of the elemental flowfrom the supernal triad, Kether is the source of air (which corresponds to thesuit of Swords), Chockmah is the source of fire (which corresponds to the suitof Wands), and Binah is the source of water (which corresponds to the suit ofCups). The remaining four paths emanating from Chesed and Geburah fall below thesupernal triad and are the element of earth and the suit of Pentacles. Thesefour lower invisible paths terminate in Yesod and Malkuth, the two lowest pointsof the Tree of Life.Table 20 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209] shows thecourt cards as sixteen invisible paths on the Tree of Life. Note that the 22visible paths on the Tree of Life correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrewalphabet, while the sixteen invisible paths correspond to sixteen selectEnochian alphabet letters:Court CardPath #ConnectingSephirothEnochianNameColor (Court)Knight of Wands332 to 5[image/1010.jpg]I—GonPale sky blueQueen of Wands342 to 8[image/1011.jpg]B—PeCrimsonKing of Wands352 to 9[image/1012.jpg]G—GedPink rosePage of Wands362 to 10[image/1013.jpg]F—OrthYellowKnight of Cups373 to 4[image/1014.jpg]R—DonGrayQueen of Cups383 to 7[image/1015.jpg]P—MalsBlackTable 20.

Our modern planets of Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto did notfigure into this count, though recently Pluto was declassified as a planet.The mystery of the seven planets and their proper allocation to seven selectMajor Arcana cards is the most difficult set of correspondences for decipheringthe allocation of the seven double letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Differentversions of the Sepher Yetzirah give conflicting attributes to the sevenplanets. Mathers and Westcott used the imagery of the corresponding Tarot cardsto correctly attribute the seven planets to the Tarot.Westcott and Mathers struggled over the mystery of the planets in the SepherYetzirah. The Hebrew alphabet has seven double letters, which have two distinctpronunciations. In every printed text of this esoteric manual over the mysteryof the alphabet, the three elements and the twelve signs were clearly delineatedwithout any confusion. But when it came to the seven double letters, differentversions of the printed text gave the planets in conflicting orders.The most common attribute for these seven double letters is the Platonic orderof the planets, where the first letter, Beth, equals Saturn and the 7th and lastletter, Tav, equals the Moon. Eliphas Levi adopted this order in placing theplanets with the double letters, but his scheme led with the Magician card asAleph, whereas the Golden Dawn adopted the Fool as Aleph.Westcott and Mathers compared the cards in their revised order with the sevendouble letters and determined that the Platonic order would not work. Theystudied intently the actual symbols in the corresponding Major Arcana cards andused the symbolism to guide their allocations. As such, the Magician, whichcorresponds to Beth, became the planet Mercury rather than Saturn, for they sawin the Magician an image of Hermes-Mercury-Trismegistus. Table 22[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor211] shows both Levi’sand the Golden Dawn’s Tarot allocations for the seven planets.HebrewDouble LetterPlanetLevi:א = MagusGolden Dawn:א = FoolSecret OrderSymbol inMajor Arcana[image/72.jpg] =Beth[image/639.jpg]High PriestessMagician[image/592.jpg]Magician as Hermes[image/74.jpg] =Gimel[image/610.jpg]EmpressHigh Priestess[image/594.jpg]Priestess as Isis lunar goddess[image/76.jpg] =Daleth[image/622.jpg]EmperorEmpress[image/876.jpg]Empress as Earth Mother[image/212.jpg] =Kaph[image/628.jpg]ForceWheel ofFortune[image/610.jpg]Jupiter as god ofgood fortune[image/194.jpg] =Peh[image/876.jpg]The StarThe Tower[image/622.jpg]Lightning bolt as Mars[image/583.jpg] =Resh[image/713.jpg]JudgmentThe Sun[image/628.jpg]Sun in card as the Sun[image/587.jpg] =Tav[image/594.jpg]The WorldThe World[image/639.jpg]Alternate symbol for Saturn as EarthTable 22. The Seven Planets in the Major ArcanaPaul Foster Case was able to decipher every mystery concerning the Hebrewalphabet and the Tarot except this mystery of the planets. Case admitted in hisfirst published book, An Introduction to the Study of the Tarot (gleaned fromhis magazine articles found in the occult periodical Azoth), that he needed torely on Aleister Crowley’s 777 to correctly decipher these planetary attributes.Crowley learned of this secret order through his exposure to the Golden Dawnsystem of magic. In a footnote in regard to using the Sepher Yetzirah tocorrectly identify the astrological nature of the Tarot, Case states, “Theplanetary attributes are from Book 777, London, 1909.” 6[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-473]The use of these seven planets is fundamental to the practice of alchemy, whichworks with seven metals corresponding to these seven planets. This doctrine isthe same as the chakra system of the Eastern Tantric tradition, which placesseven interior stars in the spiritual body that can be contacted through ritualand meditation.The Tree of Life orders these seven planets as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun,Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, and places them at station 3 through 9. This orderis sometimes referred to as the Platonic order of the planets. However, the daysof the week are also ordered by the seven planets in a different order. Startingwith Sunday, the seven planets are Sun (Sunday), Moon (Monday), Mars (Tuesday),Mercury (Wednesday), Jupiter (Thursday), Venus (Friday), and Saturn (Saturday).[image/Book11_Fig5.png]Figure 5. Hexagram of Seven PlanetsThe classic symbol for the Platonic order of the planets used in the Tree ofLife is the hexagram of seven planets (Figure 5[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor212]). The seven planetsare laid upon the points and center of the hexagram (which is both the Star ofDavid and the Shield of Solomon) in the Platonic order, starting with Saturn andending with the Moon. At the center is the Sun, whose geometric shape is thehexagram. This is the position for the seven planets as the sephiroth on theTree of Life, starting with Binah and ending with Yesod.The names and signs for the seven planets are derived from Greek mythology andform the seven vowels in the Greek alphabet. The seven planets are seven shadesof the rainbow as well as the first seven notes of the octave and the sevendirections in space composing the directional cube found in the Sepher Yetzirah.The Western symbolism for the seven planets is shown in Table 23[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213].Planet[image/639.jpg][image/610.jpg][image/622.jpg][image/628.jpg][image/876.jpg][image/713.jpg][image/594.jpg]Sphere7th6th5th4th3rd2nd1stRoman GreekSaturn, KronosJupiter, ZeusMars, AresApollo, HeliosVenus, AphroditeMercury, HermesDiana, ArtemisSymbolScytheThroneSpear, shieldChariot wheelsMirrorCaduceusCrownShapeTriangleSquarePentagramHexagramHeptagramOcta-gramEnneagramGreek[image/722.jpg] = 800Y= 400O= 70I= 10H= 8E= 5A= 1Hebrew[image/112.jpg][image/212.jpg][image/194.jpg][image/108.jpg][image/76.jpg][image/72.jpg][image/74.jpg]Tree of Life3Binah4Chesed5Geburah6Tiphereth7Netzach8Hod9YesodColor (Tree of Life)BlackBlueRedYellowGreenOrangeVioletMagic Square3 × 3 = 94 × 4 = 165 × 5 = 256 × 6 = 367 × 7= 498 × 8 = 649 × 9 = 81TarotXXIXXVIXIXIIIIIIColor (Tarot)IndigoVioletRedOrangeGreenYellowBlueCube of SpaceCenterWestNorthSouthEastAboveBelowPath (Tree of Life)32nd21st27th30th14th12th13thAngelZaphkielZadkielCamaelRaphaelHanielMichaelGabrielStoneOnyxSapphireRubyCarbuncleEmeraldDiamondCrystalFaceRight earLeft earRight nostrilRight eyeLeftnostrilMouthLeft eyeBodyRight footHeadRight handHeartGenitalsLeft handLeft footOctaveB (Ti)A (La)G (Sol)F (Fa)E (Mi)D (Re)C (Do)Table 23. Platonic Order of the Seven PlanetsIn Table 23 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor213], thereare two scales of color, one based on the sephiroth of the Tree of Life and theother based on the paths connecting the sephiroth. There are five variations:[image/1110.png] = black and indigo (blue-violet), [image/1111.png] = blue andviolet, [image/1112.png] = yellow and orange, [image/1113.png] = orange andyellow, and [image/1114.png] = violet and blue. Both scales are valid colorattributions. You should use the first set when dealing with the sephiroth ofthe Tree and the first ten numbers, and use the second set when dealing with theTarot and the Hebrew alphabet.The other major set of correspondences for the seven planets is based on thealchemical tradition of associating the seven planets with the seven metalsinvolved in alchemy. These seven metals are the Western equivalent of the seveninterior stars of the body referred to as the chakras in the Hindu Tantrictradition. Chakra in Sanskrit means wheel, and these seven interior stars areseen as spinning wheels of energy and light.The seven planets are aligned in the human body from the base of the spine tothe crown of the head (Figure 6[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor214]). At the base of thespine is Saturn, the metal lead, and the first chakra, Muladhara, while at thecrown of the head is Mercury, the metal quicksilver, and the seventh chakra,Sahasrara.[image/Book11_ChakraDude.png]Figure 6. Seven Chakras as Seven PlanetsThe chakra order of the planets and metals is [image/639.jpg] (lead),[image/622.jpg] (iron), [image/610.jpg] (tin), [image/628.jpg] (gold),[image/596.jpg] (copper), [image/594.jpg] (silver), and [image/592.jpg](quicksilver). The alchemical operation of changing lead into gold can be seenas raising the energy from the base chakra (lead) to the heart (gold).When the Tarot cards representing the seven planets are applied to the sevenchakras, an interesting order opens up when counting from the last card to thefirst: the World (1st/root chakra), the Sun (4th chakra), the Tower (2ndchakra), Wheel of Fortune (3rd chakra), the Empress (5th chakra), the HighPriestess (6th chakra), and the Magician (7th/crown chakra). This flow of energyraises the root chakra to the heart center before descending to the lowerchakras. It opens the heart to love and compassion before descending to thelower energies of the genitals and the solar plexus. Table 24[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215] illustrates thesymbolism for the seven chakras found in the Eastern Tantrik tradition and theWestern traditions of both the Golden Dawn and Theosophy.In the language of alchemy, each of the seven planets corresponds to analchemical metal. These seven metals refer to the seven interior stars of thebody known as the seven chakras in the Eastern Tantric tradition. They aresituated along the spine, which in the Theosophical tradition is divided into 33divisions.These seven chakras are seen as seven flowers, each with a different number ofpetals that contain the 50 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet. The first sixchakras total to 50, while the 7th chakra is 20 × 50 = 1,000 petals. In theTheosophical tradition, the petals of the chakras are replaced by rays of light.The first six chakras total to 360 rays, while the 7th is 360 rays on its own.In Table 24 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor215], thereare many variations on the color scheme for the seven chakras. The Tantrictradition uses the symbolism of the tattvas. Theosophy and the Major Arcana ofthe Tarot use the seven shades of the rainbow in various orders. The modernvision for the chakras uses the rainbow in the natural order, starting with redat the base of the spine and ending with violet at the crown of the head. Thisis similar to the twelve zones of the body divided by the twelve signs of thezodiac, where the head is red and the feet red violet.This overview has detailed the elements as a division of 3, 4, 5, and 16 and theseven planets. It will end with a discussion on the esoteric nature of thetwelve signs of the zodiac in light of the Golden Dawn system of magic.Planet[image/639.jpg][image/622.jpg][image/610.jpg][image/628.jpg][image/596.jpg][image/594.jpg][image/592.jpg]MetalLeadIronTinGoldCopperSilverQuicksilverTarotXXIXVIXXIXIIIIIIChakra1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7thTable 24.

Seven Planets as the Seven Chakras (continued)The Twelve Signs of the ZodiacEach of twelve signs of the zodiac is ruled by a planet and corresponds to aspecific element. As elements, the signs are also classified as cardinal (thefirst sign of an element), fixed (the second and middle sign of an element), ormutable (the third and last sign of an element).Each sign rules part of the human body. There are two major divisions of thebody, one from Greek astrology starting with the head and ending with the feet,and the other from the Sepher Yetzirah.

Basic Astrological Symbolism for the ZodiacThe planetary rulers for the zodiac divide the tweve signs into two groups ofsix signs each, one group ruled by the Moon and the other group ruled by theSun. The planets are arranged in an alchemical hierarchy, where Saturn andJupiter are at the bottom of the ladder and Mercury is at the top, crowned bythe Sun and Moon. This pattern has five planets ruling two signs each, and theluminaires ruling one sign each (Table 26[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor217]).SignPlanetPlanetSign[image/604.jpg][image/594.jpg][image/628.jpg][image/606.jpg][image/602.jpg][image/713.jpg][image/713.jpg][image/608.jpg][image/600.jpg][image/596.jpg][image/596.jpg][image/612.jpg][image/598.jpg][image/622.jpg][image/622.jpg][image/616.jpg][image/626.jpg][image/610.jpg][image/610.jpg][image/618.jpg][image/669.jpg][image/639.jpg][image/639.jpg][image/620.jpg]Table 26. Alchemical Ladder of Planetary RulersThe twelve signs of the zodiac correspond in the Hebrew alphabet to the twelvesimple letters (which have only one pronunciation). Westcott and Mathersdetailed the zodiac in the Major Arcana of the Tarot. The zodiac is placed inthe Major Arcana as twelve cards starting with the Emperor as Aries and endingwith the Moon as Pisces.The zodiac is divided into twelve shades of the rainbow as well as twelve notesof the octave. The corresponding Hebrew alphabet letter can be chanted in theappropriate tone and visualized in the appropriate color. This can also becoordinated with the twelve zones of the body, shown in Table 25[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216], for healingrituals. Any sacred word in Hebrew can be chanted as a mantra and visualized ascolor using these sound and color attributes.The Sepher Yetzirah describes a model of the cosmos as an expanding cube. Thethree elements are the three inner coordinates, the seven planets are the sixfaces and center, and the twelve signs of the zodiac are the twelve edges of thecube. The Sepher Yetzirah also gives a permutation of the Tetragrammaton for thetwelve signs, as well as twelve distinct human activities.Table 27 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218] delineatesthe symbolism for the twelve signs found in the Major Arcana.SignTarotHebrewColorNotePath on Tree of LifeCube(Sepher Yetzirah)GodHuman(Sepher Yetzirah)[image/598.jpg]Emperor[image/1197.jpg]RedC15NE[image/1198.jpg]Seeing[image/600.jpg]Hierophant[image/1200.jpg]Red orangeC#16SE[image/1201.jpg]Hearing[image/602.jpg]Lovers[image/1203.jpg]OrangeD17EAbove[image/1204.jpg]Smelling[image/604.jpg]Chariot[image/1206.jpg]Yellow orangeD#18EBelow[image/1207.jpg]SpeakingTable 27.

The Zodiac in the Major Arcana (continued)All versions of the Sepher Yetzirah are clear in assigning the zodiac to thealphabet. However, the human functions of coition and working are sometimesswapped for the Hebrew letters of Yod and Lamed.The order of the twelve Tribes of Israel can be paired to the twelve signs ofthe zodiac and can be found in the Golden Dawn tradition. The Twelve Apostlesare also symbolic of the zodiac. Twelve unique icons are used in Churcharchitecture to symbolize these Twelve Apostles. Agrippa paired to the zodiacboth angels and Roman deities. The zodiac is also reflected in the Greekalphabet of twenty-four letters. They are grouped into twelve pairs and placedon the zodiacal zones of the cosmic body of Sophia, the Gnostic goddess ofwisdomTable 28 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219] shows thezodiac symbolized by these cosmic principals.SignTribe/BannerHebrewApostles/IconAngelRomanDeityGreek[image/598.jpg]Gad/Cavalry[image/1233.jpg]Simon, Peter/Two crossed keysMalchidielPallas[image/1234.jpg][image/600.jpg]Ephraim/Ox[image/1236.jpg]Andrew/Saltire crossAsmodelVenus[image/1237.png][image/602.jpg]Manasseh/Vine, wall[image/1239.jpg]James the ElderThree scallop shellsAmbrialPhoebus[image/1240.jpg][image/604.jpg]Issachar/Ass[image/1242.jpg]John/Serpent in chaliceMurielMercury[image/1243.jpg][image/606.jpg]Judah/Lion[image/1245.jpg]Thomas/Carpenter squareand spearVerchielJupiter[image/1246.jpg][image/608.jpg]Naphtali/Bird[image/1248.jpg]James of Alphaeus/Vertical sawHamalielCeres[image/1249.jpg][image/612.jpg]Asher/Cup[image/1251.jpg]Philip/Cross and two loavesZurielVulcan[image/1252.jpg][image/616.jpg]Dan/Eagle[image/1254.jpg]Bartholomew/Three flaying knivesBarbielMars[image/1255.jpg][image/618.jpg]Benjamin/Wolf[image/1257.jpg]Matthew/Three money pursesAdnachielDiana[image/1258.jpg][image/620.jpg]Zebulon/Ship[image/1260.jpg]Simon the Zealot/Fish on open BibleHanaelVesta[image/1261.png][image/624.jpg]Reuben/Man[image/1263.jpg]Jude of James/Ship with cross- shaped mastsGabrielJuno[image/1264.jpg][image/626.jpg]Simeon/Sword[image/1266.jpg]Judas Iscariot/Money bag with thirty coinsBarchielNeptune[image/1267.jpg]Table 28.

The Zodiac in the Natural WorldThe 36 DecansThe zodiac in the Golden Dawn tradition is symbolized in the Minor Arcana in twoways: twelve of the court cards correspond to the twelve signs, while the pipcards numbered 2 through 10 in the Minor Arcana are allocated to the zodiac (of360 degrees) divided into 36 decans of 10 degrees each. Each sign is made up ofthree decans, and each decan is approximately ten days.Each court card is composed of the last decan of a zodiac sign and the first twodecans of the next zodiac sign. Thus, the court cards are a hybrid of twozodiacal signs, rather than one sign. The first two decans represent theelemental nature of a specific sign at the peak of its power. The third and lastdecan represents the decline of the element as it changes into the elementalnature of the next successive sign. This is the reason each court card iscomposed of the last decan of the preceding sign and the first two decans of theprimary sign: to show this shift of elemental energy from one sign to the next.Table 30 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor221] lists thesymbolism for the Minor Arcana as the 36 decans.Court CardDecanRulerSignPipColorTitle(Lord of)Q of W0º–10º[image/622.jpg][image/598.jpg]2WSky blueDominion11º–20º[image/628.jpg][image/598.jpg]3WCrimsonEstablished strengthK of P21°–30º[image/596.jpg][image/598.jpg]4WDeep violetPerfected work0°–10º[image/592.jpg][image/600.jpg]5PRed flecked blackMaterial trouble11°–20º[image/594.jpg][image/600.jpg]6PGold amberMaterial successKn of S21°–30º[image/639.jpg][image/600.jpg]7POlive flecked goldSuccess unfulfilled0°–10º[image/610.jpg][image/602.jpg]8SRed russetShortened force11°–20º[image/622.jpg][image/602.jpg]9SDark purpleDespair and crueltyQ of C21°–30º[image/628.jpg][image/602.jpg]10SCitrine, russet, olive,black flecked goldRuin0°–10º[image/596.jpg][image/604.jpg]2CGrayLove11°–20º[image/592.jpg][image/604.jpg]3CBlackAbundanceK of W21°–30º[image/594.jpg][image/604.jpg]4CBlueBlended pleasure0°–10º[image/639.jpg][image/606.jpg]5WOrangeStrife11°–20º[image/610.jpg][image/606.jpg]6WPink roseVictoryKn of P21°–30º[image/622.jpg][image/606.jpg]7WAmberValor0°–10º[image/628.jpg][image/608.jpg]8PYellow brownflecked whitePrudence11°–20º[image/596.jpg][image/608.jpg]9PCitrine flecked azureMaterial gainQ of S21°–30º[image/713.jpg][image/608.jpg]10PBlack rayed yellowWealth0°–10º[image/594.jpg][image/612.jpg]2SBluish-gray motherof pearlPeace restored11°–20º[image/639.jpg][image/612.jpg]3SDark brownSorrowK of C21°–30º[image/610.jpg][image/612.jpg]4SDeep purpleRest from strife0°–10º[image/622.jpg][image/616.jpg]5CScarlet redLoss in pleasure11°–20º[image/628.jpg][image/616.jpg]6CYellow (Gold)PleasureKn of W21°–30º[image/596.jpg][image/616.jpg]7CEmeraldIllusionary success0°–10º[image/713.jpg][image/618.jpg]8WVioletSwiftness11°–20º[image/594.jpg][image/618.jpg]9WIndigoGreat strengthTable 30.

Days of the Year and the ZodiacSymbolism of the Rose CrossWe will end this book with one final use of the rainbow and the zodiac. Thesupreme symbol for initiates of the Golden Dawn can be seen in the Rose Cross(Figure 7 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223]). Thiscross of gold has at its center the Rose of 22 Petals: three petals in thecenter, seven in the middle, and twelve at the outer edge. Each petal has aHebrew letter corresponding to one of three elements, seven planets, or twelvesigns. The color scale utilized is the King (Atziloth) scale for the 22 paths.[image/Book11_Fig7RoseCross.png]Figure 7. Rose Cross of 22 PetalsThe petals themselves are based on the rainbow scale of twelve shades, while theHebrew letter is drawn in the flashing (or opposite) color. This is a techniquefor constructing all magical talismans based on elemental, planetary, orzodiacal influences, where the background color is the specific element, planet,or zodiac sign while the symbol itself is in the complementary flashing color.This flashing color is always the opposite sign (180°) of the zodiac (360°).Table 32 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#_idTextAnchor224] shows therainbow scale on the Rose Cross. The Hebrew letters are shown as three columnsrepresenting the three rings of Hebrew letters on the Rose Cross. The elementsare the inner ring, the planets are the middle ring, and the zodiac is the outerring of rose petals on the cross. Also shown is the corresponding musical notefor the rainbow scale of color, which can be used in conjunction with the Hebrewletters listed as a means of chanting all 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet.ColorFlashingColorNoteHebrewZodiacHebrewPlanetHebrewElementRedGreenC[image/17.jpg][image/1377.jpg][image/194.jpg][image/622.jpg][image/110.jpg][image/1381.jpg]Red orangeBlue greenC#[image/32.jpg][image/600.jpg]OrangeBlueD[image/82.jpg][image/1385.jpg][image/108.jpg][image/628.jpg]Table 32.

Hope in the Prison of Despair by Evelyn de Morgan(Image courtesy of the Art Renewal Center® www.artrenewal.org)Story: The Future“I invoke the spirit of the future. Come to me, powerful spirit, and show mewhat will be!”A spangled mist appears before me, forming into a human shape with handsoutstretched and huge eyes welling with compassion. “What will be cannot beshown,” the spirit says in a voice like chiming bells.“Why can’t it be shown?” I ask. My deepest fear is that there is no future. “Isit because it doesn’t exist?”“Yes. No,” the spirit says.That kind of answer generally means I’m not asking the right questions. I try adifferent tack. “What can you show me?”“Before you can know me,” the figure says, “you must understand the present.”Folding both arms against a slender chest, the figure vanishes.Those eyes! They promised all the joy and sorrow in the universe. Was the figuremale or female? What color was that mist? It seemed to be white and blue, darkand light at once. Was it a god, a spirit, an illusion, an angel? What did thespirit have to show me—what knowledge, what warning, what certainty ofwell-being?What Is the Future?We talk about time as if it is a river. The river flows only one way, like anarrow. The present is a little boat floating on the river, always changing,moving away from the past toward the future.We talk about the future as if it is a place we are all journeying towardtogether. We hope that it is a utopia, a Star Trek world where everything weneed appears when we ask for it, work and creativity are rewarded, hatred fades,and acceptance rules. We fear we will arrive at a dystopia where only a few havewhatever they want, everyone else has too little to live, and brutality rules.Magickians read cards and cast horoscopes and perform divinations to catch aglimpse of the future. This implies that we believe the future is at leastpartially predetermined and available for us to view. Forewarned is forearmed—ifwe can predict a future, we can avoid the worst effects and maximize the bestones. We hope that the future is changeable and that the choices we make todaywill help to determine the life we will experience. We fear that it is too lateto change our future, or worse, that we never had the power to change it at all.The future does not yet exist. How can we know what choices to make to steerourselves down the river of time toward the destination we choose?What fixes meaning is story.Story: The Present“I invoke the spirit of the present. Come to me, powerful spirit, and show mewhat is at hand!”Crash! A young man falls on his knees in front of me. He struggles to his feet,twisting his torso weirdly beneath a slick silver cable that binds his armstogether at the wrists and snakes up his chest. He gasps for air through hisconstricted throat. As I watch in horror, the cable grows up around his mouthand reaches for his eyes.I cry out and grasp the cable, tearing it away from his mouth. The stuff feelsoily; I smear my hand down my thigh. I see despair and gratitude in his eyes.“To save me,” he gasps, “you must challenge fate.” With a loud clap hedisappears. I feel the rush of air on my face as he vanishes.Shaken, I take a deep breath. It is clear something is terribly wrong. The painin his eyes haunts me. What happened to him? He seemed so strong. What is thedreadful cable that imprisons him?To my horror I see a sliver on my hand where I touched the cable. As I watch,the tiny shard grows into a silver thread. It winds around my wrist and slowlygrows up my arm, colder than ice, thicker and weightier with every passingsecond.I grab at the wire with my free hand to pull it away. Instead it leaps to twinearound my other wrist, binding my hands in front of me. The thing wraps my armand slithers across my chest. I watch fearfully as the silver cable climbstoward my throat. Am I trapped? Is his fate to be my fate?The Present as ForesightFuturists make educated guesses about what will happen if current trendscontinue, using the present as a form of foresight. Just now there is a dominantstory that says:The future is a place on the linear flow of time. We can never return to anearlier time, the past is fixed and unchangeable, we can only move forward. Whatthe human race does in the present affects what will happen to nature in thefuture. The power to decide human action lies with large corporations and nationstates who set the policies that govern our lives. Since we know the effectsthese policies are having in the present we can project what will happen goingforward. These projections show us the inevitable future arising from thepresent.7 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-472]Projecting our present into the future presents a grim prospect:• The climate crisis has already led to species extinctions, the drowning ofislands, and the first climate refugees.• The oceans choke with plastics and industrial processes contaminate land andrivers.• The world economy bestows unimaginable wealth on a very few while leavingmillions of people starving.• Wars and droughts drive millions of refugees from their homes.• The power to shape the future collects in the hands of increasinglyauthoritarian governments and corporations who exclude individuals andcommunities from the decision-making process.Dystopia seems increasingly more likely. We imagine awful futures in which therivers and oceans die, animal life is extinguished, massive population crashesreduce the human population, and we all end up as serfs to unapproachablewarlords. At its worst we imagine a future that threatens our existence as aspecies.8 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-471]If this is our future and it is out of our hands, what hope do we have for abetter life for ourselves and our children?This is an urgent question. People are literally killing themselves for lack ofhope. The World Health Organization reports that close to a million peoplecommit suicide each year. The vast majority of suicides occur in low- andmiddle-income countries. Our most vulnerable populations are at highestrisk—people undergoing discrimination and experiencing disaster or personalviolence, and migrants and refugees escaping those conditions. Worse, it is theleading cause of death among 15 to 29-year-olds, the people who carry our hopesinto the future.9 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-470]How can we regain control over our fate? How can we liberate our present andrescue our future?Story: SoteriaThe slick silver cable makes the first turn around my throat. Panicking, I fallto my knees and choke out, “O friendly spirits who aid humanity, whoever andwherever you may be, save me!”A flash of light heats the air around me. I see a golden hand touch the cable atmy throat, igniting it like a fuse. Golden sparkles dissolve the cable down mychest, my arms, and my bound wrists. The sparkles fizzle out just at the lastwrap around the hand that touched the spirit of the present.I take a grateful breath and look up into the face of my savior. The spirit isall of gold yellow hair and dark amber skin and shining eyes, draped withglittering cloth. I say, “Thank you for saving me. Who are you?”He says, “Soter is a good name.”“Soter?” I say, getting to my feet. “You’re a man?” His hair is short and hisface is covered with downy hair like a young man’s.While I watch, his face becomes smooth and his hair grows out to his shoulders.“Soteria then,” she says, with a voice as sweet as honey. “Tell me, magician,how did you fall into such a dire trap?”“I was trying to summon the future.”Soteria shakes her head. “Wandering in the ways of time is dangerous without aguide.”I feel a movement at my wrist. The thread is growing again, much more slowlythis time, inching its way up my arm. “Will it grow back?” I ask, panickingagain. “Can you free me of this?”“I have hampered it, but I cannot remove it entirely,” she says regretfully.“Only you can free yourself, when you understand your destiny.”“The spirit of the present told me to challenge fate,” I tell her. I am wary nowto do this on my own. Invoking the present didn’t seem all that risky, but whatwould have happened to me if Soteria hadn’t responded to my plea? “Will youguide me?” I say.“Every service comes with a price,” she warns.I open my mouth to agree and stop myself. This is not the first time I havebargained with a spirit. “What is your price and when is it due?” I saycautiously.Soteria smiles warmly. “Just as I have helped you, so must you provide your helpto one who needs it.”Rapidly I try to think through the possible consequences. “What happens if Ifail?”“I will not ask you for a task beyond your power.” Soteria holds out a hand. “Iwill not linger. Do you agree?”I am anxious to question the future and desperate to rescue the present. Idecide to trust this daemon whose very name means Savior. “Yes,” I say, puttingmy free hand in hers. “How can I challenge fate?”Rescuing the FutureFuturists actively work to democratize the future. The field of futures studiesdraws on history, economic theory, sociology, psychology, and philosophy topropose multiple futures that benefit humanity.10[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-469]Futurists propose a new story:The future is not a single fixed destination. Instead there are many possiblefutures. Evolutions in human consciousness and communication have linked ustogether in newly powerful ways. We create our futures collaboratively throughimagining possibilities.We can think of futures as stacking up in layers: our individual future, thefuture of our local community, the future of our nation, the future of the worldas a whole. Each life plays out in a specific place on the planet and a specifictime in history. The closer we are to a level in the futures stack the moreinfluence we have over how that future turns out. Each person has the mostcontrol over the individual level and the least influence at the global level.11[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-468]Magick has layers too. Just as there are multiple futures, there are multiplemagicks. Magick today focuses almost entirely on the individual. To be fullyeffective, our magick needs to address the other layers of the stack. We needcommunity, national, and global magicks. But magick hasn’t been a player on theWestern stage for about a century, and it hasn’t been a dominant worldview forseveral millennia. We may believe we can make changes in our own lives, but it’svery difficult to overcome the skepticism that magick can make a change in thewhole world.Our most urgent task is to meet the challenge of that skepticism, because as itturns out, magick may actually be the Western world’s best hope for having afuture at all.Story: DespairSoteria transports me to a stone room built from enormous bricks. A woman bowsbefore a barred window, one arm pulling her robe to herself protectively, theother cradling her head. Her fear and grief overwhelm me. “Who is she?” I askSoteria.“Despair wears her,” Soteria says. “She is trapped in it as in a prison.”I long to comfort this hopeless woman. “How can we help her?”“This is the task I have asked you to undertake,” Soteria says. “Will you freeher from this prison?”It is a heavy burden. How can I lift the heart of another? But her plight isriveting. Nothing seems more important than relieving her torment. “I will doeverything in my power,” I promise. Soteria nods approvingly.The woman turns her head toward me and I realize she can hear me. “What troublesyou?” I ask softly.The hand holding her robe opens a little and something flutters to the floor.Carefully I pick it up. It’s a papyrus filled with rows of Greek letters. I showit to Soteria. “What is this?”Soteria says, “It’s a horoscope.”“Can you read it?”“I am not an expert, but I know one who is. Shall I take you to her?”This time I do not question the cost. “Yes!”Facing the PastHow did we get to the place where the future of life on our planet is actuallyin doubt?Between the 1400s and the 1900s, Europe colonized the world. Colonization is abloodless word that means brutal exploitation. In those centuries, Britain,France, Spain, Germany, Holland, and Portugal killed much of the population ofNorth America, claimed the lands of South America, kidnapped and enslaved peoplefrom Africa, conquered India and the South Pacific, and went to war with China.European civilization justified this conquest by presenting itself as thepinnacle of human achievement. The Christian religion was the finest developmentof human morality. Western science explained the world so clearly it isunassailably true. Western philosophy took human reason to its greatest heights.If European civilization was the most advanced, other civilizations were lessso, and available for exploitation. Enlightenment philosophers helped to shapeslavery. Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, and John Locke all participated in theslave trade and even wrote apologetics for it.12[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-467]Today the European empire has given way to the American empire, which itselfalready seems to be fading. India is shaking off the effects of Britishcolonization. China allies with the South Pacific in what will almost surelyform the next great world power. European civilization is slowly facing therealization that the religion and the science spread to the world as great giftshave turned out to be massively destructive. Rather than elevating the peoplesof the world, they benefited a few at the top while exploiting the vast mass ofhumanity. Ruthless exploitation of resources has so damaged the natural worldthat there is a real danger we will kill life altogether.The Western Magical Tradition solidified among European upper-classintellectuals in the Victorian-Edwardian era. The British and European magicianswho shaped our tradition into its current form embraced the power ofcolonization. They saw their magick as accurately describing the workings of thecosmos and saw themselves as superior to everyone else in the world. After all,their work was indisputably successful. Spiritualist circles, magickal lodges,and occult societies attracted famous artists, actors, poets, and politicians.Magick had real influence in the spheres that mattered. At the dawn of thetwentieth century, magickians stood triumphantly at the top of the world.Our experience as magickians has changed. It is difficult to stand triumphantlyat the top of the world when that world is suffering. How do we hold ourselvesin this new era? Does our magick have anything to offer to the world?Story: Urania, Muse of AstrologySoteria says, “Urania, bring us into your realm and show us what we may see.”We are on a hill beneath the sky. A great plain surrounds us, rippling as ifcovered with water. Urania’s dark hair is bound with a circlet of stars. Herbare feet are planted in the mud, but her eyes are fixed on the heavens, a darkbowl filled with points of light. “Look,” she says. “This is the cosmos visibleto the human eye from Earth. There is the circle of animals,” she goes on,pointing to the zodiacal wheel where the lion and scorpion and goat and ram spinaround the rim. “You trace your individual lives through them. Here you see whatwill be.”I hold the papyrus out to her. “What does this say?”Urania takes it from me, glances at it, and shakes her head. “The stars havewritten a terrible fortune here,” she says. “Health turns to sickness, wealthdissipates, what is loved is lost.”“Can you alter it?” I ask.Urania turns away. “The stars display what Fate decrees.”Was this what the spirit of the present meant when he said I would need tochallenge Fate? I say to Soteria, “Take me to Fate.”UncertaintyWe all experience the future as it unfolds. That means that all of us have theright to be included in shaping that experience. Not only should we be included,but we have a responsibility to shape the future. Science, Christianity andother religions, Western economics—all must coexist with other forms of thinkingand imagining.13 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-466]Just now, capitalism drives the decision making. But what capitalism does theleast well is invest in the distant future. The decisions most planners maketoday do not take into account the entire impact of the decisions they make intime.14 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-465]An important move to regain democratic control of the future is to challenge thefixed nature of the future. In fact, we can point to numerous predictions thatdid not come true and numerous events that humanity has not foreseen. Whathappens next continues to surprise us. Our understanding of the future isfallible. This opens up a window of possibility for a different future than theone predicted by projection of the present.15[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-464]When we say we are uncomfortable with uncertainty and want to know the future,what we really want is to know that we will be well and happy in the future.When the future seems both fixed and grim, uncertainty is a blessing.Story: The Fates and FortuneWe are on a hill beneath a tree. Three women are making thread in the shade. Oneflicks a drop spindle and adds fibers to the lengthening line. She hands it tothe second, who unspools the thread and measures it. Then she in turn hands itto the third, who cuts it.I clear my throat. “Greetings and respect to you, O Fates.”They look at me but don’t stop their work. The spinner says, “Greetings,traveler. Do you come to beg for a child? Or to lengthen a life? Or to cut alife short for someone you despise?”That is a startling set of choices. “To lengthen a life,” I say.The measurer says, “Many a mortal has asked us for a favor. Yet our decrees willnot be overturned.”I try another idea. “I ask to lessen the misery of a life.”The cutter says, “That is not in our power. Fortune determines this.” She pointsbehind me.I turn and look into the eyes of a very beautiful young woman dressed in thefinest gold cloth. She stands beside a wheel fastened to a board that she canspin. “The wheel of Fortune,” I murmur.“Step up!” Fortune says gaily. “Shall we take your life for a spin?” She pullsdown sharply on the wheel. As it spins, I see her age rapidly, her beauty becomehideous, and her fine clothes turn to rags. The wheel suddenly stops and she isonce again young and beautiful and richly dressed. “Will you try your luck?”I hold out the horoscope. “Will you change what is decreed here?”Fortune glances at the papyrus. “She’s had her chance.” She winks at me. “Comeback when you’re ready to play.”The Fates and Fortune vanish and we are alone on the hill. “They say theirdecrees are fixed,” I say. “Is there anyone who can tell me how to alter them?”“There is one teacher,” Soteria says.Challenging FateFatalism is not a new idea in the Western experience. Astrology as we know itsolidified in Alexandria as a fusion of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek systems.What emerged was the idea that the stars determined an immutable fate decreed bythe gods. The astrologer could predict but could not influence what wouldhappen. This grim determinism imagined each human as a helpless victim ofcircumstance.16 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-463]Christians in the same time period also saw fate as decreed by the One God. TheChristian response to a fixed fate was to counsel acceptance and even welcomesuffering on Earth, with the promise of redemption in the afterlife.The Platonic teacher Asklepigenia refused to accept the idea that fate wasunalterable. She articulated a difference between Christian theology and thePagan knowledge of the gods. Asklepigenia taught that an understanding of thegods coupled with ritual could influence what happened in the world.Asklepigenia practiced thaumaturgy, a word that translates roughly to “makingmiracles.” 17 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-462]Asklepigenia’s greatest student was Proklos, who succeeded her as the leader ofthe Academy in Athens. In the biography of Proklos, we learn that he performedmiracles routinely. Proklos himself was healthy and unusually energetic. He wasguided by dreams all his life, which helped him avoid political trouble andsteer the course of his work. Importantly, his magick did not benefit himselfalone. He brought rain to Athens to end a terrible drought. He predictedearthquakes. He healed people with his art and by invoking Asclepius, the god ofhealing. With his knowledge of ritual and his commitment to the gods, he changedthe lives of his friends and his community.18[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-461] He lived out theteachings of Asklepigenia: magick overcomes fate.Story: Asklepigenia and ProklosWe are on a hill beneath a tree, a summery place redolent with the scent offennel and cypress. In front of us a young man and an older woman sit side byside on a stone bench. His arms are bare, and her head is covered with herhimation. All around them, young men and women sit on the ground, some holdingtheir knees, some crossing their legs, all hunched as if weathering a crushingblow.One of the young men is speaking to the teachers. “Proklos, Asklepigenia, howcan you be so calm! They have moved what should not have been moved.” His armsweeps toward the hill above us where the marble columns of the Parthenon gleamin the sunlight. “They have taken Athena from her home. She no longer liveshere.”“They have only taken a statue,” Proklos says strongly. “Athena lives here, inthe soil,” he says, touching the ground, “and here, in our hearts.”One of the women students says, “Isn’t the earth Ge?”“Of course,” Asklepigenia says, “as the sky is Zeus, but this ground is sacredto the goddess of our city.”A man bursts out, “How can we contemplate the gods when the Christians aredestroying our way of life? Is it inevitable? Has Fate decreed it?”“No!” Asklepigenia’s voice rings out strongly. “Fate is never certain so long aswe have magick.”This is what I have come to hear. I step out of the shadow of the tree that hasconcealed me. “How can we challenge fate?”The great teacher turns her eyes on me. She whispers to Proklos and rises tomove away from the group. He continues to teach them as she draws me aside.“I do not know you, stranger, but I welcome you,” she says, in the ancient Greektradition of hospitality. “What troubles you?”I show her the papyrus. “There is a woman in despair because of this. Uraniatells me that the stars have decreed a terrible fortune for her. I have met withthe Fates and Fortune, but they refuse to change her future.”Reading the papyrus, Asklepigenia becomes grave. “It seems her need isdesperate. She will need powerful aids to overcome this.” She looks around heron the ground. “Here,” she says, picking up a smooth oval rock. “This is a stonefrom the sacred hill of Athena. It carries with it the virtue of her power.” Sheplaces it in my palm and closes her hands around mine. “May she grant yousuccess.”As she leaves us, I look down at my arm. The silver cable continues to grow.The Pagan WorldviewAsklepigenia and Proklos were Pagan. Their ritual practices, called theurgy, or“god work,” brought them into direct communion with Hellenic deity. Here are thepillars of their religious and philosophical worldview:• Earth: The earth is sacred.• Spirit in matter: As above, so below—spirit is contiguous with matter.• Paganism: The One spirit is a unity in the forms of multiple gods andgoddesses. Deity can have a female face.• Women: Priestesses, mothers, and women philosophers are indispensableteachers.• Revelation: We come from the gods, and every individual can directlyexperience contact with the gods.• Reincarnation: The soul’s journey is to improve character through successiveincarnations in order to return to the realm of the gods.These elements came under direct attack in the Christian era. Once the urbantemples had been closed, Christian monks fanned out into the countrysidethroughout the Hellenistic world, overturning altars, destroying statues, andwriting “One God!” on the walls of the temples. They preached to the populacethat the fact they could destroy the statues meant that the gods they hadworshipped were powerless spirits, not truly divine. The shrines wererededicated to Christian use.19[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-460]By the fifteenth century, educated Europeans believed they were surrounded bysupernatural forces directed by Satan and the women who allied themselves withhim.20 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-459] Here are thepillars of their worldview:• Earth: The world is corrupt.• Spirit and matter: Spirit is entirely separate from the world.• Paganism is evil, and the only legitimate religion is Christianity.• Women are inferior to men and ally easily with the forces of evil.• Revelation: Any contact with spirits in this world is with evil spirits.• Reincarnation: There is only one life before the soul faces God’s judgment.It seemed that the worst fears of the theurgists had come true and the Paganworldview had disappeared from the world.Story: Tycho and SophieI have learned a great deal from Proklos and Asklepigenia, but I’m still notsure how to alter what the Fates and Fortune have decreed. I ask Soteria, “Isthere anyone else who can help me understand the magick of shaping the future?”“Tycho Brahe,” Soteria says.We are on a hill beneath a tree. In the landscape below, I can see the famousgarden of the Danish island of Hven, laid out according to Tycho’s meticulousdirections, its precise geometry reflecting the harmony of the spheres. In thedistance I can see the famous castle dedicated to the muse of astrology,Uraniborg itself. It stands three stories high, built on a straight north-southorientation to enable the astronomers to make accurate measurements of thestars.Just now there’s no one outside observing the sky. “Let’s try the laboratory,”Soteria says.Without transition we stand in an alchemical workshop. A boy shoves a handful ofcoal into the bottom of a five-foot-high furnace, but there’s no one else in thebasement room. Soteria says, “Let’s try the library.”In a blink we are in a room with windows set high on the wall to let light fallon the tables below. Tycho consults an almanac and makes a mark on a sheet ofpaper. I can read this horoscope. It has the familiar wheel of houses markedwith symbols for the zodiacal signs and the planets. “Sophie,” he says withoutlooking up. “The light is fading. Bring me a candle.”“In a moment,” Sophie calls from across the room.Tycho looks up from his work and sees me. “I wasn’t expecting a guest.” He looksme over. Fortunately Soteria has dressed me in the costliest fashion of the day.“Although nobility is always welcome. Have you come to see the celestialobservatory or the terrestrial one?”I decide not to mention that I’ve seen them both. “I have a friend in trouble,”I say. “I hoped you could help me.”Sophie appears with a beeswax candle in her hand. “We can try,” she says,carefully placing the candle away from the papers.Tycho turns to his sister with a smile. “Check my figures,” he tells her,pushing the horoscope at her. To me he says, “I forbade her to learn astrologybut she taught herself anyway.”“And he’s been boasting about me ever since,” Sophie says, bending over thedesk. “Are you sure about this placement?” When Tycho reaches for a book, shetakes it from him. “Here, I’ll look it up. You help our visitor.”Tycho settles back into his chair and looks at me expectantly. “What is thetrouble?”“My friend has a horoscope that predicts a terrible life,” I say. “She hasfallen into despair. How can I convince her that her fate is not fixed?”“Tell her to pray,” he says immediately. “God comforts all.”That wasn’t the answer I was hoping for. One of the papers on his desk isinscribed with his famous mottos: Despiciendo suspicio, “By looking downward Isee upward,” and Suspiciendo despicio, “By looking upward I see downward.” Ipoint to the paper. “I thought I might counter the influence of the heavens withthe influence of Earth.”Tycho considers this. “How did you think to do that?”I hold out the stone. “I have this from the Acropolis.”He touches it reverently. “It has its own virtue,” he says. He pushes himselfaway from the table and rummages among the shelves on the wall. “Earth calls outfor sea. Here we are.” He pulls out a little clay container with a woodenstopper. “This contains alchemical water. A drink of this can ease the heart.”“What of air?” Sophie says.“Yes,” Tycho says. “Air links the celestial with the terrestrial.” He looks ather. “What could carry the virtue of air?”Sophie picks up the candle and holds it out to me. “Let this light your way.”Taking the gifts from them, I say, “Thank you.” I wonder what I can give them inreturn. “You are a great man and a great woman. Your work will be remembered formany centuries.”“Well,” Tycho says, pleased.Sophie’s eyes light up. “What a kind wish. Thank you.”As we fade into the shadows of the room, I see that the silver cable on my armhas nearly reached my chest.The Pagan RenaissanceAfter the Roman Christian emperors closed the Alexandrian and Athenianacademies, cities farther to the east took in escaping Platonic teachers. Theeastern part of the Roman Empire and the Islamic world continued to studyPlatonic and Hermetic texts. In contrast, the western Roman Christian churchdepended on Aristotle but rejected Plato.In the fifteenth century, western European intellectuals rediscoveredHermeticism, starting with Marsilio Ficino’s translation of the CorpusHermeticum from Greek into Latin in 1463. The Platonic and Hermetic worldviewencouraged learning about the world directly rather than through Aristoteliantheory alone. This experiential approach sparked a renaissance in art, science,and spiritual understanding. The people who studied these texts calledthemselves natural philosophers to emphasize their study of nature.It was impossible to ignore that Pagans had written these important texts. Thenatural philosophers developed a number of approaches to handle this. Some, likeGiordano Bruno, held that the Christian Church had overturned the true Egyptianreligion and converted to Paganism altogether. Others, like Pico dellaMirandola, expounded on the idea of perennial philosophy: all philosophies sharea common root, and the Pagan texts were rough drafts of the perfection of theChristian ones. Pico included the Bible, Platonic texts, and Jewish Qabbalah,along with many other sources, in his work.21[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-458]Tycho Brahe’s work epitomizes the new sciences inspired by Platonic and Hermeticthought. For Tycho, both astrology and alchemy were necessary to explain theworld. He developed a cosmology of earth, sea, and sky, with air forming theconnection between the celestial and terrestrial realms.22[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-457] Sophie Brahe’s workexemplifies the importance of women to alchemy. Women worked in their kitchensand gardens to produce medicines and cosmetics.23[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-456] Alchemists sometimesworked in male-female pairs. Sophie assisted her brother in his astronomicalobservations and in his laboratory and later married an alchemist. Theirmarriage centered on their joint work.The natural philosophers developed a worldview that Proklos would recognize.They taught that humanity is at the center of a cosmos connected end to end by anetwork of spirit, and that studying the cosmos leads to an experience of thelove of the divine.24 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-455]Our magick today descends directly from natural philosophy.25[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-454]Story: Hope in a Prison of DespairI tell Soteria, “Take me to the woman in despair. I want to see if theseremedies will help her.” I hold up the stone, the alchemical water, and thecandle.I find myself looking again at the woman I have been trying to help, the womanin despair, clutching herself before a barred window. I am not in the brick roomwith her though. Instead I am looking at a painting of her on an easel. I am inan art studio. Other paintings hang above one another all the way up the wallsto an enormously high ceiling. The fireplace in the corner barely warms thedrafty space.An artist perches on a wooden chair in front of the easel. She leans back, dabsat her palette, and touches the brush to the panel, shaping another line of careon the face of the despairing woman.“Who is she?” I whisper to Soteria.“Evelyn Pickering de Morgan. She’s a spiritualist,” she answers softly.The artist pauses and looks around the room. “Who’s there?”I step into the light and Evelyn spots me. “Welcome, spirit, whoever you maybe,” she says comfortably.“I am here to help the woman in your painting,” I tell her.“Despair?” She looks from the panel to me and back again. “Life has trapped her,but she will have relief in the end.”“How can she know that?” I say.The artist puts down her brush and grabs a sketch pad. “Wait,” she says. “Don’tmove. Hold the candle out just a little more.”Suddenly self-conscious, I pose for her while she roughs out an outline of aslight figure holding up a lamp. “There!” she says. “I’ve given her Hope.” Shesmiles at me. “You have given me a gift.”“You have given me hope,” I tell her.As she turns back to her painting, I look down at my chest. The silver cable haswrapped around twice and is inching toward my neck.Magic, Religion, and ScienceThe Church recognized the threat posed by natural philosophy. The Renaissancemagickians were conversing with spirits, exploring Pagan ideas, and challengingChristian doctrine. Many natural philosophers were imprisoned and killed by theInquisition. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake.26[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-453]The natural philosophers wanted to continue to study nature and also wanted tocontinue to live free and happy lives. Some proposed an alternative to naturalphilosophy: mechanical philosophy. The Church held that God had created theworld and then left, leaving it to run by itself. The mechanical philosophersbuilt that conception into their worldview, rejecting Paganism and the Paganthought that the world itself was alive. Instead the world and its creatureswere all mechanisms without souls which could be explored and exploited.27[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-452]The category human separated from the category animal. Humans have a soul,intelligence, and emotion; animals do not. This conceptualization led to theimmediate and immensely cruel exploitation of animals (including livevivisection—the screams of the animals were explained as the squeaking of amechanism) and the ongoing loss of the sense of life in the world.Story: Urania, Muse of Astronomy“Take me back to Urania,” I tell Soteria urgently.My guide hesitates. “Are you ready?”“I have to be. I need to act before the chain chokes off my air.” I hold up thestone, the flask of alchemical water, and the candle. “I have earth, water,fire, and air. I can challenge her now.”We are on a hill beneath the sky. The cosmos is filled with washes of light,spirals of pink and blue, towering pillars of smoke and diamond. Urania percheson a rock with her arms on her knees, holding a sextant loosely in one hand. Isay to her triumphantly, “You told me the stars show what must be, but I knowthat isn’t true.”“Of course it isn’t,” Urania says carelessly. “Why did you think the stars showthe future?” She waves an arm at the sky. “The light we see now travelledmillions of years to reach us. When we look at the universe we look at the past.Look there,” she says. “That is where stars are born.” In one of the clouds thegas blows away and dozens of pinpoints of light blaze into existence. “And thereis where stars die.” In a section of the sky filled with reddish haze, a circleof light explodes and blasts blue stuff in all directions, and when the hazeclears, the point is gone, leaving only the red background behind.I hesitate. “But where is the meaning?”“There is no meaning in the stars,” she says. “The universe is a mechanism. Ican show you its movements and its processes. You must find meaning on yourown.”“If we’re looking at the past, are we standing on the present?” I ask. “Is thatwhy we’re not moving?”Urania looks at me. “Why do you think we’re not moving?”As she speaks, I feel the ground beneath me tremble like jelly. I am spinning ininfinity, with no solid place to stand. I stumble and lose my footing. “Soteria,take me somewhere safe!” I cry out.The Rational and the EsotericThe European Enlightenment did not reconcile mechanical and natural philosophy,but instead completed the rejection of the Pagan worldview, a process sometimescalled the disenchantment of the world. We are indebted to Wouter Hanegraaf’simportant insight that the Enlightenment actually defined itself againstesotericism. Enlightenment scholars divided the field of human endeavor, placingsome subjects in the categories “true” and “serious” and others in thecategories of “foolish” and “superstitious,” a process Hanegraaf terms eclectic.Scientific methodologies specifically excluded clairvoyance, intuition,correspondences, and noncausal influences in nature.28[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-451]Hanegraaf asserts that what academics have meant by “magic” or “esotericism” isPaganism. The Pagan worldview understands the divine as immanent, in the world,while Christian monotheism places an invisible creator entirely outside thevisible temporal creation. This failure to recognize Paganism is an academicblindspot.29 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-450]Put another way, the voluminous academic discussion about the relativedefinitions of religion, science, and magic can be usefully reframed as adiscussion about Christianity, mechanical philosophy, and Paganism.Story: The Dark Night of the SoulI grab for Soteria, miss, and fall.I lose my candle instantly. I fall until all the stars fade and there is onlyblackness. I fall until I lose all track of time. I fall until all emotionwashes out of me and leaves me numb. I fall until I cannot even feel myself.Gradually I realize I am no longer falling. I have not landed, I have juststopped. I seem to be held up by something, but I can’t tell what it is. I amsurrounded by darkness and silence.I try to speak, but no sound passes my parched lips. I realize I am perishinglythirsty. After some time I remember that I carry water with me. Fumbling in thehush of blackness, I find the flask. I put the stopper between my teeth and wormit out carefully. A gush of liquid flows down my throat.I can feel again. Waves of feeling pass over me, sorrow, joy, fear, peace. Ibreathe deeply and stop shivering. “Soteria,” I breathe as a prayer. “Save me.”There is no answer. Did I invent her? Does she really exist? Am I just making upstories to protect myself from the meaningless truth of the universe?I am alone. I’m not even sure I believe in my own soul.Overcoming SkepticismEvery marginalized person inhabits two worlds. People of color live in awhite-controlled world. Women live in a male-controlled world. Magickians tooinhabit two worlds, the world of the Enlightenment and the esoteric world. Welook at the night sky and see the brilliant face of the divine, and at the sametime see a mechanical universe completely indifferent to life.When we look at the sun and say “our mother” or “our father,” we have on ourears the ringing of a century and a half of laughter at us: what a sillysuperstition! That was just a way to explain the world before intellect kickedin. This skepticism, the Enlightenment rejection of the esoteric worldview, isthe source of our doubt in our own power.The mechanical universe is hostile and lonely. It also doesn’t match ourexperience. We realize that the physical sun is a ball of gas, but we also knowthat the sun is the source of our life. It isn’t stupid to be grateful for that.We know the world is alive, that other animals do have emotions, and that whenthey scream they are in pain just as we feel pain. The world is not a mechanismto be taken apart but an organic whole. We long for a way to express our deepconviction that life deserves care.We challenge the arrogant belief that one type of knowledge can understand theworld’s tremendously complex living system in its entirety and predict all theeffects of changes we make in the system. Our attempt to master nature iskilling her. In a visceral physical sense, the sun and Earth are our parents.Using this language to describe them indicates our respect for life. We need torecover that respect and listen to our hearts. We need our mother.Story: NeithAt the first moment and the last breath there is one name that we call.“Mother.”“I wondered when you would hit bottom,” a voice says. There is a shape in thedarkness, a deeper velvet.“Who are you?” I whisper.“Ama, Ma, mother,” she says. “Before I am Athena I am Neith. Before I am Neith Iam Nut, the sky. Before I am Nut I am Niw, the dark water from which everythingarises.”I do not know if I am worthy of her care. Yet I have been brought into being.The gift of life is given without asking. “Are you my mother?” I ask her.The darkness lessens and I see more of her shape. “I am the mother of allthings,” she says warmly.I see now that I am lying on a rise that keeps me out of an infinite dark sea.“I’m on a hill,” I say.“Creation always starts on a hill,” she says. “The mound rises from the fertilewater.”The relief and gratitude that fill me are so profound they shake my soul. Theymake my soul. I’m crying, huge gasping sobs of grief and joy, and laughing,filled with amazement for the wonder of the universe. The only word I have forthis is love. Creation is the love given without asking, and love is the onlypossible thanks for this. “I love you, mother.”Remembering the MotherAll around the world we find indigenous and religious peoples calling the Earththeir mother and father, the sun their mother and father, the stars and riversand weather and cosmos their mother and father. The creatures of the Earth arebrother and sister to humanity. The living world is bound by a network ofinterdependence. From this comes a sense of contentment, that there is a placefor us and we belong in it, and a sense of gratitude, that we are found to beworthy of nourishment, that we are given what we need without asking, and thatthe gifts we receive are sufficient to sustain our life.We remember our mother. She is Demeter, Aphrodite, Hera. The ancients said thatNeith moved to Greece and became Athena. One of the sources of our tradition isEgyptian/Kemetic religious philosophy. The ancients told us this. For centuriesthe academy rejected this knowledge in the effort to establish Europeancivilization as superior. This is still largely true, although academic voicestoday argue that we should take the ancients at their word. Esotericism neverforgot this—we have long asserted that our tradition roots in Egypt.Greek and Hellenistic women philosophers studied in the Pythagorean and Platonicschools, and they taught too, even while having families. This was so commonthat the woman philosopher was a familiar figure, and some famous men were knownas mother-taught.30 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-449] TheRoman Christian world targeted the academies as strongholds of Pagan thought,taking particular aim at the work of the women philosophers and systematicallydestroying their work. The closure of the academies also ended for manycenturies women’s involvement with philosophy, women’s involvement in theacademy, and the development of philosophical discourse.31[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-448]We need our mothers back, goddesses and philosophers both. Women magickians arecalled to be mothers ourselves of the new stories, the new rituals, the newphilosophical frameworks of the twenty-first century.Story: IndraThe sky flares into brilliant life.The shape of the mother is gone. She surrounds me in the waters and the vault ofheaven. I find I am lying beneath a tree blossoming with millions of fragrantflowers in a myriad of colors.Beneath the tree a beautiful god is drinking from a cup shaped like the moon. Oris it the moon itself? His skin ripples with the colors from the tree, pink andblue, red and gold, green and purple, smoke and light.I am profoundly grateful that I am no longer alone. A wave of ecstasy washesover me. I reach out a hand and touch his feet, trembling. “Honor to the guru.Honor to Lord Indra. Will you teach me?”Indra smiles down at me. “You seek meaning,” he says. “Look up.” He waves hishands at the sky. Every pinpoint of light flashes brightly as a web of threadslink each to the others in uncountable combinations. “The meaning is in the netitself. Each of these jewels reflects every other jewel. All are connected. Youwere never alone; you can never be alone. All of creation is in relationship.”He takes another drink from the moon. “Look down,” he says. The water near themound flows in little streams; as they flow out over the plain, they vanish intoeach other in a shimmering haze. “All things change, yet what is possible isborn from this. Each of these streams creates a possibility.” The stars arereflected in the water below; we are in the center of a jeweled bowl, waterblending into space, past dissolving into the future.“You are here,” Lord Indra says. “You have always been here.”I pull myself up into a sitting position. I feel the slimy silver cable lickingaround my neck. “It’s winning,” I say. “It’s going to surround me.”“Let it,” Lord Indra says.All this time I have been fighting this thing, with my mind, with my will, withmy desperate seeking. Now I let that all go. I surrender to whatever will be.As soon as I stop fighting the cable flashes all over my body. It surrounds mefrom head to toe completely. Once the shell is complete, its weight vanishes,the sense of restriction lifts, and the slimy sensation turns into tingling andthen vanishes. I am brilliant. I myself have become a jewel reflecting all theother jewels in Lord Indra’s net. For an instant that is an eternity, I see,hear, feel, know, understand, am everything that is.It is a bliss beyond bliss. It seems as if I am rising and I will go onexpanding forever.Honoring the GuruOur tradition has roots not only in Egypt (Kemet) but also in India, Bharata.Pythagoras studied there and brought back the doctrine of reincarnation toGreece. Plato and all subsequent philosophers built on a base of Pythagoreanphilosophy and practice.32[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-447]Ceremonial magick, esotericism, and Western culture are all younger siblings tothe religions of India. It is time for us to recover our humility, express ourgratitude, and honor Bharata as our guru. Westerners have pulled off pieces ofHindu practice that we find useful and studied Tantra to have better sex andyoga for health without acknowledging that these are embedded in a culturalmatrix. When we approach Hinduism and Tantra with reverence on their own terms,we can learn from an intact system how to organically regrow the unity of ourown partially preserved system.Story: Athena SophiaI cannot expand into the infinite universe forever. I must return to my ownform. A golden hand offers to help me up. “Soteria!” I say happily. I leap upand hug her.She is warm and sweet-smelling and laughing. “I see you have found your way.”“Neith, the mother, gave me life. Lord Indra, the guru, gave me meaning,” Iexplain inadequately.She seems to understand. “We are all the children of our mother and our father.This is true for cultures as well as bodies.” She looks me over. “I see you havecompleted your transformation. Are you ready to complete your task?”“Do you think I’m ready?” I have learned to ask.She smiles approvingly. “Do you know how to go home?”I have lost the candle and I have drunk the water, but I still have one talismanleft. I close my fist around the stone and say, “Take me home.”The stars fade to daylight and the tree turns to cypress. I am standing on asummery, fragrant hill looking up at a temple. This one is not so grand as theParthenon, which was meant to impress and intimidate. This is a small templewhose doors open invitingly.I recognize that I don’t know how to enter with respect for the ways of thisplace. “Will you guide me?”Soteria leads me through the columns into the temple itself. On a marble daissits a golden throne, and on that throne sits the goddess. Her armor lays to oneside. She is clad in a simple himation, spinning thread on a drop spindle.“Athena,” I say, dropping to one knee.“Rise,” she says. “Before I am Athena, I am Neith. And I am always a spinner.”Indra showed me that there is a web. I realize that the thread Athena isspinning is salvation. “Can you spin a new future?” I ask her.“You mean to challenge Fate?” Her voice fills the space with an awful beauty.“For I am Athena Soteria, the savior. I am the daughter who has remembered themother. I am the child who has inherited the authority of the father. I havereturned, although I never left you. I am Athena Sophia and my wisdom bringsboth reason and inspiration.” She lowers her gaze to me. “What future would youhave me spin?”“I would comfort Despair,” I say.If her voice filled me with awe before, now it fills me with terror. “I summonyou, Heimarmene! Appear before me and account to me!”There is a flash of light and a spirit stands before the throne. She is Fortunebut not Fortune, brighter, grander; she is not only my personal fortune but alsothe fate of the cosmos. Heimarmene puts a hand on her waist and tosses her hair.“Account to you, sister? Haven’t we grown all high and mighty?”They both laugh and move to embrace each other. “How goes the spinning?”Heimarmene says.“How goes the web?” Athena says.As I look on this happy scene my mouth floods with the bitterness of betrayal.“I thought I was supposed to overcome Fate,” I say to Soteria.The goddesses do not take offense. They turn to me, smiling. “You have notlost,” Athena says.“You have won,” Heimarmene says.They hold out their hands to me. I look to Soteria, who nods and gestures to me.Hesitatingly I step up onto the dais.“There are always three of us,” Athena says. “One of us spins the stuff of thecosmos.” She flicks her spindle.“One of us weaves the pattern of relating.” Heimarmene unspools the thread andmakes a cat’s cradle pattern from it. She holds it out to me.I realize what I have to do. I take the net into my hands. “And one of us livesthe meaning.”Magick in the Twenty-First CenturyThe lodges of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century shaped esotericismto meet the challenges of the modern age, in particular admitting women into thelodges.33 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-446] After theFirst World War, magick retreated from being active in the world andreconfigured as a self-help system. As the academic and popular worlds take aninterest in us again, we have a great deal of work to do to shape our ceremoniesto meet the demands of the next century.We have already talked about some of the tasks in front of us:• Understand the world as a living organism embedded in a living cosmos• Recover the mother and women teachers• Relinquish imperialism and approach other cultures with respect on their owntermsWe also have these tasks:• Establish the relationship to the academy on our own terms• Reknit the relationship of theurgic ritual to Pagan philosophy• Visualize the future togetherThe Esoteric Relationship to the AcademyAs the walls come down between the academy and esotericism, we will need tomanage the relationship proactively on our own terms. After a century and a halfof being denigrated as foolish, it’s flattering to receive some validation. Wemay seek academic recognition of our work as legitimizing. However it isimportant to recognize that magick and the academy have different aims. Ourultimate goal is to experience the living world as divine. Magickians canpartner with the academy, but we must develop our own standards of scholarshipand our own sense of who we are in relationship to the world. In particular wecan insist that the people we accept to help us shape who we are and what we doare practitioners, whether or not they are academic.Non-Western thinkers accuse the West of foraging among intact non-Westerncultures for material to prop up the exhausted Enlightenment project.34[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-445] The academic interest inesotericism is partly a move toward inclusion and partly an example of this kindof foraging. What better place to find material than the methodologies that werespecifically excluded as defining the Enlightenment? We must resist the attemptsto raid esotericism to bandage the failure of mechanical philosophy.The worldview of the Pagan theurgists is a living whole. The animal nature ofthe body, alive in the world, with direct access to the experience ofspirit—these are the qualities whose exclusion has led to the destruction of thenatural world, and human meaning. Theurgy offers a living science, seeking thesources of life and nourishing them within ourselves and the world.Reknit the Relationship of Ceremonial Ritual to Pagan TheurgyWhen the Roman Christian emperors suppressed public Pagan practice, theserituals were split from their philosophical foundations. Both the rituals andthe philosophical texts were passed down to us through the centuries throughdifferent routes. Theurgic ritual forms the foundation of the ceremonial magickrituals we have practiced in the twentieth century and the beginning of thetwenty-first.35 [LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-444]For the Platonists, particularly Asklepigenia and Proklos, theurgy was groundedin Hellenic religious observance. Our theurgy must also ground in Paganpractice. That can include but need not be limited to Hellenic Paganism. Theimportant thing is to enter into any religious practice with respect for itscultural rules and study the system on its own terms.As academics reknit the Platonic philosophies with the rituals practiced by thephilosophers, magickians must engage in the same operation. Academic scholarsread the Platonic texts, find instructions for practices, and search among thesurviving ritual texts for those that correspond with them. They have the texts,we have the rituals. Our operation works the other way around. What Platonicprinciples underlie the rituals we have been practicing for centuries?The Renaissance magickians borrowed Jewish Qabbalah to explain the ritualpractices, but that system was not original to the rituals. There is aconsonance between the Platonic understanding of the soul and the Qabbalisticsoul. However, the Renaissance magickians did not approach Jewish Qabbalah withrespect. Theurgy offers a way to confront our colonialist past and begin to makereparations.Should we relinquish Qabbalah altogether? It is deeply embedded in the frameworkof ceremonial magick today, a historical part of the system. Individuals andcommunities will have different responses. What we can do immediately isacknowledge that Jewish mysticism is an intact cultural system with its ownrules. We can learn something about the people who practice it today andunderstand their rules of engagement.36[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-443]We understand the divine through loving the divine. Theurgy teaches both what isdivine and how to experience the divine. This is why theurgy is emerging ascritical to our future. As we knit together the theory and practice ofceremonial magick we recover a path to our own spirituality. Theurgy brings ourstories back. It is our past, and it is also our future.Visualizing the Future TogetherFuturists say that “what we can imagine we can create.” 37[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-442] Futurists encourageindividuals and communities to create visions of the future that we want to livein. This is an exciting convergence between the field of futures studies andesotericism. Visualization is a key esoteric skill. Magickians learn early on indetail how to build an image and hold it. We pair this skill with the ability tocreate a statement of intent, a clear declaration of what we want to happen.38[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-441]We can create statements of intent about the future we want to see for ourcommunities as well as our nations and the world. Today individual magickianscreate rites to shape the future and release them for general use. Our next stepis to come together physically and virtually to co-create them, test them, andrefine them. We can partner with futurists in the academy and in the communityto learn effective methodologies for working in groups to accomplish this. Wecan also offer our outputs to other communities for their use and invite them tojoin with us. These partnerships will lead to new forms of group endeavors thatwill look very different from the magickal lodges today, less secretive andrigid, more inclusive and fluid, changing dynamically as the need arises.Magickians have always been the people who make the future. Every jewel inIndra’s net reflects every other jewel.39[LCBCeremonialMagick06_Book11andEpi.xhtml#footnote-440] All pasts lead to allfutures. Through divination, precognition, prophecy, and revelation we chart apath through the myriad continually changing possibilities to the future wechoose together.In our future the West rejects mechanical philosophy with the overduerecognition that the world is alive. We learn from older cultures. The peoplesof the world make decisions based on the long-term needs of life. The net ofrelationships that holds us up regenerates. We acknowledge our debt to thetrees, the hills, the animals, the sun, the power of life itself. We recognizethe sacredness in the universe and in ourselves.Story: The Magick of HopeI am standing in a stone room built from enormous bricks, facing a barredwindow. I am bent over, pulling my robe to myself with one arm, cradling my headwith the other.Soteria did not say, “She is despair.” She said, “Despair wears her.”Despair wears me.All the futility and hopelessness of a future of torment washes over me. If thefuture is fixed, if I am powerless, why should I go on?A light flickers on the wall in front of me. I know that light. It is cast by alamp. Hope is standing behind me, holding it in her hands. Slowly I straighten,letting my arms fall, bringing myself up to my full height. The light reminds methat I am a jewel in the net of the cosmos, and I am never alone.In this picture I am also hope. I am a magickian, and I am free to choose myfuture.BibliographyChristianson, John, and Tycho Brahe. “Tycho Brahe’s Cosmology from theAstrologia of 1591.” Isis 59, no. 3 (Autumn 1968): 312–318.Easlea, Brian.
