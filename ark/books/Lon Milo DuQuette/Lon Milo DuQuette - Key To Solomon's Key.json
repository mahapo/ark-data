Itis a very rare treat when someone can lay out the secrets of the universe in aclear and user-friendly way and manage to make me laugh while doing it.

Included are the connectivetissues of early Christianity, the Knights Templars, Freemasonry, Kabbalah,Hermeticism, Alchemy, and Magic. In The Key to Solomon’s Key, the reader isalways treated respectfully with the reasoned insights of a modern investigatorof truth and consciousness. The cheaper sort of phantasmagoria that oftenfollows popular occult myths is exorcised out of this highly credible andreadable accounting. The book, however, carries a ticking religious time-bomb ofhistoric proportions just waiting to explode. The implications for our times areprovocative.” — Arthur Rosengarten, Ph.D.author of Tarot And Psychology: Spectrums of Possibility and Tarot Of The NinePaths: A Guide For The Spiritual Traveler.“For those of us lacking the resources to excavate occult secrets hidden beneaththe Louvre, CIA Headquarters or Rosslyn Chapel, The Key to Solomon’s Key is thenext best thing.

Thompson, Professor of Old Testament, University of Copenhagen.INRODUCTIONBrother Lon DuQuette is about to take us on a guided tour of Chapel Perilous. Hehas asked me to make the following announcement: “Will all readers please fastentheir seatbelts.”Many of the concepts and questions to which you’ll soon be exposed may bealtogether new. Some may threaten your most closely held beliefs and childhoodconditioning. We ask only that you approach with an open mind and a willingnessto continue your own research when you emerge from these pages.Lon lays out the goal fairly early on. We will be encouraged to become “aprincipal player, a junior partner with God in the great plan of creation.” Ourcompanions will be such luminaries as Moses, the great Qabalistic adept; KingDavid, the poet and heroic slayer of Goliath; David’s son Solomon, the greatestMagus of all time; Hiram Abiff, the slain master builder; Jacques DeMolay, themartyred Grand Master of the Knights Templar; and de Molay’s avengers, theruthless Adam Weishaupt and his Bavarian Illuminati.We will stand with the High Priest in Jerusalem in the Holy of Holies and gazeupon the Ark of the Covenant. We will travel to the great temples of Egypt. Wewill be admitted to Masonic initiation chambers the world over, and be invitedinside the sacred walls of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland. We will even cavort withspooks and spies at the headquarters of the CIA in Virginia, and hobnob with thecognoscenti in Paris at the Louvre.We will join the Knights Templar in clandestine archeological digs and discovera secret whose revelation could shatter the foundation of the world’s threegreat monotheistic faiths. What is “the most dangerous secret in the world”? Isit true? And who were the people who discovered it, those who “dreamed greaterdreams” than their European neighbors? Is the Bible real?Frankly, Lon’s statements on the historicity of the Bible exceed the scope of myown research to date. The more I know about history, the more I am aware it iswritten by people with agendas. I am as suspicious of those who claim oneversion as I am of those who advance another. As an example of the difficulty ofdetermining fact from fiction, look at the controversy over whether SaddamHussein did or did not possess weapons of mass destruction. (I tend to agreewith Ted Koppel who quipped that we know he did because we still have thereceipts!) The question of whether Moses, David, or Solomon existed is even moreloaded. While Lon will raise these issues, it is the reader’s task to answerthem. The depth of your research will be the measure of the truth of yourconclusions.Where Lon and I are in absolute agreement is on the pernicious doctrines ofOriginal Sin and Vicarious Atonement. How vile a slander of that mostmagnificent miracle of God called Man to burden him with original sin. Howdespicable the coward’s gesture to fling an innocent life before God to die forhis own redemption. I will die for my own sins, thank you. Let the crucified diefor his. Like the Templar of old, I spit on the belief of the inherently evilnature of mankind and the abdication of individual responsibility on which themyth of the Dying God is anchored.The Seven Secrets of Solomon establish the author’s credentials as a lover offreedom and a believer in the inherent dignity of humanity. These principles area celebration of our divine birthright and a wondrous affirmation of Nature andthe grandeur of Creation. When Lon writes that, “All creation is a play in themind of God,” I hear a ringing endorsement for that participatory, vibratory,divine rock concert we call Life.Lon’s intimate familiarity with Masonry is one of the more delightful themes ofthis book. It is virtually impossible to overstate the importance of Freemasonryas a tool of the Enlightenment. It helped liberate millions and led to thefounding of governments built on the principle of the consent of the governed.(Perhaps our modern task is to expand that doctrine to read “informed consent.”)While Masonry has become an increasingly gray-haired fellowship in the last fourto five decades, one hopes it will regain its appeal to younger generations.Some Masons feel the best way to accomplish this is to camouflage the mysticalroots of the Craft. Yet anyone interested solely in charitable work can joinUnited Way. The active core of Masonry is Initiation into the Mysteries — justlike the active core of this book.Lon’s inclusion of the material from the Goetia is a stroke of genius. For hereis a practical means of experiencing the states of mind and magical powersdiscussed throughout these pages. Myth becomes personal reality. The reader isencouraged to leave the comfort of his or her armchair and begin the work ofachieving the Wisdom and Power of Solomon. Here is where it all comes home. Thisis not a Dan Brown/National Treasure style tale designed to stimulate andtitillate. Rather it is a manual of Gnosis. Lon’s step-by-step instructions andeducated advice for understanding and conducting Goetic evocation are among thebest I’ve read. Simple, clear, methodical, they are intended to be used. Here isa roadmap for the exploration of Self.Welcome now to the wonderful world of Lon DuQuette and the real secrets ofSolomon’s Key.~ James Wasserman 2006 e.v."},{"pageContent":"PART ONESOLOMON’S SECRET[../images/00002.gif]PROLOGUE THE KRYPTOSThey will be able to read what I wrote, but what I wrote is a mystery itself.~ James Sanborn – Creator of the KryptosA most unusual work of art adorns the main entrance and courtyard of the NewHeadquarters Building of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley,Virginia near Washington D.C. It is a multi-faceted sculpture made of lodestone,polished red granite, quartz, copperplate, and petrified wood. It wascommissioned in November 1988 as part of the Art in Architecture program of theGeneral Services Administration. The task of selecting the artist fell to ajoint committee of members of the CIA Fine Arts Counsel, and the NationalEndowment for the Arts, who chose local artist James Sanborn, a Washington D.C.native to receive the $250,000 commission to execute the design he calledKryptos (Greek for “hidden”).Mr. Sandborn certainly did his homework preparing the design and the materialsfor his work that is intended to serve as an elaborate example of the art ofinformation encryption. He studied for months with retired CIA cryptographer, EdScheidt, before setting to work on the sculpture that incorporates a twelve-footcopper scroll punched through with thousands of letters. Since its unveiling in1990 professional and amateur cryptographers have been obsessed with itssolution, but interest in the Kryptos reached fever pitch in 2003 whenbest-selling author Dan Brown hid references to it on the dust jacket of hiswildly popular novel, The Da Vinci Code.1About seventy-five percent of the Kryptos has now been deciphered. Amidtantalizing quotes from the diary of Howard Carter (discoverer of Tutankhamen’stomb) are references that suggest that something important is buried on thegrounds of CIA Headquarters. The deciphered code suggests, only “WW” (former CIADirector William Webster) knows the precise location. Unfortunately, Websterobviously doesn’t think much of the secret treasure (or at least that is what hewould have us believe). Since leaving the agency he told reporters, “I have zeromemory of this. It was philosophical and obscure.”For those of us who are passionately interested in things “philosophical andobscure,” Webster’s words come as no surprise and even less a deterrent tospeculation. Indeed, for anyone who cares to investigate, the entire city ofWashington D.C. – the curious and precise layout of her streets, the sacredgeometry of her civic buildings, and monuments that teem with Masonic and occultsymbolism– all present a gigantic mystery in stone – a mystery that reaches back to thebirth of our nation and principals and traditions upon which it was founded.It is no secret that many of the founding fathers of the United States wereFreemasons. Sixteen percent of the signers of the Declaration of Independence,thirtythree percent of the signers of the Constitution, George__________1Dan Brown. The Da Vince Code. (NY: Doubleday 2003).Washington and a full forty-six percent of the generals in the Continental Armywere members of the fraternity. The cornerstone of the U.S. Capital Building waslaid with full Masonic ceremony by George Washington himself arrayed in fullMasonic regalia.Masonry’s influence goes far beyond the lodge room. Fourteen American Presidentswere Freemasons, and so were nearly two-thirds of all the Supreme CourtJustices. Our language is peppered with Masonic terms and phrases; “on thelevel,” “square deal,” “eavesdrop,” “blackball,” and “shibboleth.” When policeroughly interrogate a suspect they are said to “give him the Third Degree.” Whena judge or the chairman of a meeting uses a gavel, or when we are called upon toswear upon the Bible, even when we shake hands to seal a deal we are usingMasonic devices. Indeed, until 1827 when a scandal tarred the fraternity’sreputation, Freemasonry was for all intent and purposes America’s civicreligion.Masonry is still alive in the twenty-first century, and for the time beingremains the world’s largest fraternal order. As a service organization it is oneof the most generous charitable institutions in the world donating more than amillion dollars a day to various charities. There is no question, however, thather rolls are swiftly diminishing. In a fastpaced new millennium Masonicmembership is no longer considered a requirement for men of business orpolitical ambition.Numbers, however, can be deceiving. While it is true that Masonic lodges areclosing daily and fewer and fewer men are attracted to the fraternity, asignificant number of those who are joining are passionately interested in theesoteric and mystical aspects of the Craft, subjects that have been ignored,misunderstood, even ridiculed by the vast majority of their brethren who came ofMasonic age in the twentieth century. These young esoteric Masons do not viewthe Craft as just another service club with quaint traditions and ceremonies;they do not enter her ageless and sacred doors in order to exploit opportunitiesfor business or political networking; they come on a personal spiritual quest;to be initiated into the Western mystery tradition. Some, including myself, goso far as to view our involvement in the Craft as a magical initiation.The term “initiation” is often misunderstood. It is not merely an ordeal ofpassage or a formal induction ceremony. It is a new beginning – an awakening – astep we take when we have made the conscious decision to move forward – tobecome more than we are. While spiritual in nature, initiation differs fromreligion in a very fundamental way. In my book, Angels, Demons & Gods of the NewMillennium2 I try to explain.“Initiation is a commencement; not a reward for achievement, not a seal ofattainment, not a trophy of adeptship. Initiation is a beginning, and when weevoke a beginning we also by necessity conjure an ending. Death is theinevitable penalty we pay for allowing ourselves to be born, and the honor oflife’s journey between these two great__________2Lon Milo DuQuette. Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium. (ME: WeiserBooks.1997). ps. 130-131.pylons is the only compensation offered for this fate. “The uninitiated invokeneither birth, norlife, nor death. Like sleep walkers our numbedsteps bear us comatose from cradle to grave, ourpale shadow lives pantomime but never experiencethe adventures of the initiate’s journey. Like othermammals we are born, and live, and die. But unlesswe make a conscious effort to wake up, unless weharness and focus the power of our wills to take thefirst steps toward spiritual renewal, we will not, asHomer sang...received our share of the rite. We will nothave the same lot as the initiate...once we are dead and dwellin the mold where the sun goes down.3“Prostitution may be the oldest profession inthe world, but the oldest spiritual institution is mostcertainly the initiatory society. To those who wouldargue that religion holds this august position I mustrespectfully disagree.“Religion merely haunts the outer courtsof the great initiatory temple and holds mystery atarm’s length. From the occasional thread of truth,carried by the wind from the initiatory chamber,religion psychotically weaves and reweaves doctrines and dogma – tapestries ofhope, hate andperpetual distraction. Religion exalts mystery as anunknowable secret that must be sealed in glass likethe corpse of an enchanted princess and fearfullyworshipped from afar. Initiation, on the other hand,requires direct participation and demands each of__________3Hymn to Demeter.us to smash the casket and press mad lips to mystery, wooing her as a lover whowill offer up her treasurers in a succession of sweet surrenders. This she willdo, but only in exact ratio to our evolving ability and worthiness to receivethem.”For this new generation of Masonic initiates the secrets of the Craft are notthe steps, signs, tokens and secret passwords of a quaint service organization,but concern a fundamentally more profound secret concerning the history ofcivilization and the nature of the human soul – a treasure hidden for centuries– a mystery waiting to be brought to light by anyone bold enough to draw theveil.The partially decoded Kryptos teases us with a thrilling and poignant taste ofthe ecstasy of such a discovery by quoting from the diary of archeologist HowardCarter, the discoverer of tomb of Tutankhamen.“At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber caused thecandle to flicker, but as my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, presentlydetails of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange statues andanimals and gold, everywhere the glint of gold. For the moment, an eternity itmust have seemed to those standing by, I was struck dumb with amazement, andwhen Lord Carnavon, unable to stand the suspense any longer, inquired anxiously,‘Can you see anything?’ it was all I could do to get out the words, ‘Yes.Wonderful things!’”Masonry’s rituals, symbols and traditions stand like the Kryptos, a partiallydecoded multi-layered mystery that offers the magical promise of “wonderfulthings” and a supreme spiritual treasure for those brave souls who are not onlywilling to dig but sufficiently prepared to understand and appreciate the fullimpact of a great secret.CHAPTER ONE I CONFESS – I AM A FREEMASON[../images/00003.jpeg]Masonry is a progressive moral science, divided into different degrees; and, asits principles and mystic ceremonies are regularly developed and illustrated, itis intended and hoped that they will make a deepand lasting impression upon your mind.~ From The Fellow Craft DegreeFree & Accepted Masons4imposed. He was not a religious man (confessing only that he believed in aSupreme Being), but he was good for goodness’ sake; not in obedience to divinecommandments; not out ofI am a Freemason. In 1998, at the age of fifty, I was raised5in the same lodgethat raised my father fifty years earlier. Masonry claims to make good menbetter, and although my father had many shortcomings, when all is said and donehe was the most noble and ethical man I have ever known.His morality, as much as I observed, was almost entirely self__________4 All monitorial excerpts from Masonic Degree work are drawn from the CaliforniaCipher, Grand Lodge of California, F. & A.M. (Richmond: Allen PublishingCompany, 1990).5 A Mason is first Initiated into First Degree as an Entered Apprentice, Passedto the Second Degree of Fellow Craft, and Raised to the Sublime Degree of MasterMason (the Third Degree).fear of some deity.He was extremely proud to be a Mason and, although he didn’t remain an activemember of his lodge, he always wore his Blue Lodge6and Scottish Rite7rings andkept his dues scrupulously up-to-date. When I was a child, he enjoyed teasing meabout the secret nature of the Craft and would rattle off his titles; SecretMaster, Perfect Master, Elu of the Twelve, Prince of Jerusalem, Knight RoseCroix, Knight of the Brazen Serpent, Master of the Royal Secret.Master of the Royal Secret – That sounded interesting. I had to ask, “What’s theRoyal Secret?”“I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.”“Please?”“No”“Did you tell Mom?”“No. I can never tell your mother.”8__________6The term Blue Lodge is used to describe the three primary and fundamentalDegrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. Once a Mason hasbeen raised to the Degree of Master Mason, he may then go on to affiliate withother Masonic concordant rites such as the York Rite, the Scottish Rite, and theShrine.7The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is one of the most popular Masonicconcordant bodies in the United States.8 One of the Ancient Landmarks of the Craft (going back as far as the medievalcathedral builder’s guilds) is that Freemasonry is exclusively a men’sorganization. Regular Masonry remains so today (for no other reason that I cansee but the reluctance to abrogate an official Ancient Landmark). There are,however, lodges of Co-Masons (men and women), and other organizations such asAletheia that are exclusively women.I liked that idea. We both laughed, and I felt like I was already sharing aMasonic secret.Once when I was about five, he showed me his lambskin apron. He put it on,carefully centering the knot in front so it was concealed by the apron’striangular flap. He gently smoothed it down with both hands, stood at attentionand recited from memory;“A lambskin apron. It is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason; moreancient than the Golden Fleece or the Roman Eagle; more honorable than the Starand Garter, or any distinction that could be conferred upon me, at that or anyfuture period by King, Prince, Potentate, or any other person, and which it washoped that I would wear with pleasure to myself and honor to the Fraternity.”I was very impressed.He then smiled and made the most curious announcement, “The next time you see mewearing this apron I’ll be dead and lying in a casket at my funeral.”Those were strange words, and a little hard for a five year old to hear. But Dadwas a pretty strange guy. He was right. The next time I saw him in his Masonicapron was at his funeral less than twenty years later. He lived long enough tosee my son born, but not long enough to see me become a Mason. We never becameBrothers. We never had the opportunity to discuss the Royal Secret.A snafu of some sort prevented his lodge brothers from showing up at the funeralto give him the fraternal send off. We were assured a few days later by theMaster that the oversight caused ‘heads to roll’ down at the lodge. Twenty-sixyears later, when I finally became a Mason, I was appointed Chaplain of thatsame lodge. One of my first official acts was to arrange a proper Masonicgraveside service.I have to confess I knew quite a lot about the Craft before I joined. For theprevious quarter-century I had enmeshed myself in the studies, practices andintrigues of several initiatory orders and magical societies. Because many ofthe founders of these esoteric groups were Freemasons I took it upon myself tobecome familiar with the history, doctrines and rituals of the Craft, especiallythose of the York and Scottish Rites. I learned many other very interestingthings along the way as well.By the time I finally joined I wasn’t seeking the same sort of esoterictitillation that spiced my initiatory adventures in these other more secretsecret societies. I knew from the beginning that I was entering an organizationof mostly elderly men with whom I would have little in common except the bondsof fidelity that for centuries have united the fraternity – men who, if theyreally got to know me, would most likely consider my interests too strange, mystudies too occult, my politics too liberal, my morals too permissive, mywritings too weird, and my spiritual world-view downright heretical – men who,like my father, choose not to delve too deeply into mysteries that lie beneaththe symbols and ceremonies that they and those that came before them sodutifully preserved.My expectations were low, and so I wasn’t at all disappointed. I was welcomedinto a lodge that boasted nearly a thousand members whose average age wasseventy-two – a lodge whose tiny library contained only a handful of booksrelating to the esoteric foundations of Masonry, few of which, according to thesign-out sheet, had ever been checked out.It didn’t really bother me. As a matter of fact, it felt kind of good. For thefirst time in many years I was the youngster in a group. I quickly grew to lovemy new brothers and enjoy their company. I came to the comfortable realizationthat (no matter what else Masonry might be) it was a very big tent, and that ifI behaved myself there was a place in that tent for me.It didn’t matter to me that most of the old fellows could care less about theEleusinian Mysteries, or the magic of the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Arabs, orthe Kabbalah, or Gnosticism, or alchemy, or the suppressed history ofChristendom. It didn’t bother me when my new Brothers answered my questions bysaying things like…“Oh, that doesn’t mean anything…It’s just symbolic.”So what if the Royal Secret was still a mystery to these Princes of the RoyalSecret. I was just grateful for the fact that these gentlemen and generations ofother dedicated souls had faithfully preserved and guarded the treasure of theCraft; and were now, with shaking hands, delivering it safely to me across thecenturies as if it were sealed in a locked casket for which they had no key.I was very grateful indeed – because I had the key.CHAPTER TWO I CONFESS – I AM A MAGICIAN[../images/00004.gif]Much light, it must be confessed, is thrown on many of the mystical names in thehigher degrees by the dogmas of magic; and hence magic furnishes a curious andinteresting study for the Freemason. ~ Albert G. Mackey, M.D. 33° 9Nobody speaks for Masonry. Nobody. Indeed, even though I am an active member ofmy Blue Lodge, Scottish Rite bodies and various Masonic research societies,everything I say in the present work concerning the Craft is based entirely onmy own observations and conjectures. So please don’t misunderstand me when Imake the apparently presumptuous statement that I possess the key to themysteries of Freemasonry. I’m not claiming that, like some investigativereporter, I have uncovered the true history behind every political, religious,and social intrigue that has (or hasn’t) taken place on earth in the last fivethousand years. Neither am I suggesting that I’ve mastered the history, meanings or lessons of every degree of every rite of __________9Albert G. Mackey, An Encyclopædia of Freemasonry and Its Kindred SciencesComprising the Whole Range of Arts, Sciences and Literature as Connected withthe Institution. Revised (Chicago: Masonic Publishing Company, 1921). Newestedition (Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing 1997). p. 459.the Craft. I am saying, however, that regardless the circumstances surroundingMasonry’s creation and development– regardless of the past or present motives and activities of its individualleaders and members – the Craft is indeed the custodian of a profound andfundamental secret.I’m by no means saying that I’m the only person on earth who believes theyunderstand the central mystery of this august fraternity. Nor am I certain that,with key in hand, I possess the courage, wit or wisdom to properly apply thisunderstanding to my own efforts towards spiritual liberation and for the benefitof my fellow human beings.Whether or not they realized it, millions of men and women, Masons andnon-Masons alike, possess this key. It’s not a matter of what organization webelong to; it’s not a matter of what we know. Rather, it is a matter of what weare that places the key in our hands. As no two people are (or ever can be) thesame it follows that no two individuals become what they are by the same paths.The pathway I happen to have taken is one that has had for centuries a close (ifat times, uncomfortable) relationship with Freemasonry. I have chosen the pathof magic.10Now, please don’t immediately dismiss me as a crackpot, or worse, some kind ofdevil worshipper. Magic is in the broadest sense of the term simply the Scienceand Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will. The Will I’m talkingabout is both the Will of God (as is commonly understood) and the true Will ofeach of individual, which,__________10To differentiate the spiritual art form from that of the stage illusionist,modern magicians, including myself, prefer to spell the word magick. However, toavoid undo confusion in the mind of the reader, I have decided to revert to themore recognizable magic throughout the present work.if properly realized, can be nothing other than the perfect reflection of thedivine Will. In other words, if I seek and discover my true Will – what my placein the universe is– what I came to earth to be and do – then I’ve discovered (in the only waymeaningful and comprehendible to me) God’s will for my life.As a magician, I have for the last thirty-five years, by means both traditionaland forbidden, endeavored to cause change to occur in my life in conformity withwhat I have perceived to be my Will. I say, “perceived to be my Will” because itis not until we have developed a significant level of illumination that we canwith any degree of certainty know what our Will truly is.For me, the ultimate change I would like to effect is my own enlightenment andspiritual liberation. Call it what you like – salvation, redemption, return toGodhead, absorption in the infinite, nirvana, heaven – it’s the supreme goal ofevery spiritual seeker. However, the magician goes about this Great Work verydifferently than the average Western religious devotee or the Eastern mystic.The disciplines of the East encourage the aspirant to still the body and mindand go within to deal subjectively with the subtle obstacles that stand in theway of his or her perfect illumination. This approach requires quiet patienceand a subtle underlying confidence that all spiritual answers can ultimately befound inside oneself.Western magic springs from the myths and rich traditions of Babylon, Egypt,Arabia, and Israel. It is a spiritual art form that seems particularly suited tothe way the Western psyche is hardwired. Traditionally, the Western mystic’sapproach has not been as subtle as that of his or her Eastern counterpart. Untilrelatively recent times, most Western seekers hadn’t developed the confidence toexplore the possibility that all spiritual answers lie within. For centurieswe’ve preferred to objectify our subjective issues – deal outwardly withinternal matters. For the less adventurous, this has meant submitting to thedictates of a deity that we perceive as existing outside ourselves – outside ofnature. Instead of closing our eyes and searching for our own answers, themajority of Westerners have preferred the path of vicarious illumination –relying exclusively upon faith in the outward, visible reality of theauthoritative words of some person or scripture.To a certain degree, this outward introspection is the foundation of the Westernmagical tradition as well. But the focus of the magician is a little bolder andmore personally challenging. The magician dares view himself or herself as beingan important and integral link in the divine chain of command of spiritualbeings – not a mere observer or helpless victim in need of rescue, but aprincipal player, a junior partner with God in the great plan of creation.The modern magician is certainly not alone in holding this point of view. Infact, according to recent statistics11 nearly one third of the earth’spopulation currently shares to some degree this spiritual self-image. Prior tothe advent of Christianity and Islam it was a near universally accepted fact oflife. But magic is a science and an art form, not a belief system or a religion.Like Freemasonry, magic cares little what one’s religious beliefs or opinionsare.__________11National & World Religion Statistics. Adherents.com:That being said, the fact remains that very few Masons are card-carryingmagicians, or even have an interest in such things. While in theory, Masonryopens her doors to anyone professing a belief in a Supreme Being, theoverwhelming majority of Masons worldwide are Christians or Jews. Bible passagesare recited during the Degree ceremonies, and (unless the candidate requestsotherwise) the Christian version of the Holy Bible is the default Volume of theSacred Law upon which candidates for initiation place their hands when swearingtheir solemn oaths to the fraternity.Lodge meetings have an overtly religious feel to them. They are opened andclosed with prayer, but the prayers are addressed generically to the GreatArchitect of the Universe, or to the Supreme Grand Master. This custom creates aunique spiritual atmosphere in which the Supreme Deity is elevated abovesectarian divisions. We are no longer Methodists praying like Methodists, orJews praying like Jews, or Moslems praying like Moslems, or Pagans praying thePagan way. Within the tiled lodge room we are simply human beings praying to Godbecause it is the human thing to do.When you think about it, this seemingly simple custom is in-and-of itself aradical and revolutionary statement of spiritual liberation. It transforms eachmember into a religion of one – answerable to no one but God – and that isprecisely what a magician is.It is eminently appropriate that the person of King Solomon rises as a centralfigure in the traditions of both magic and Masonry, for it is written thatSolomon was not only a great and wise man of God, he was also the most powerfulmagician the world had ever known.CHAPTER THREE SOLOMON THE KING[../images/00005.gif]We read in the Holy Writings that it was decreed in the wisdom and counsels ofDeity aforetime, that a house should be built, erected to God and dedicated toHis holy name. We also learn from the same sacred source that David, King ofIsrael, desired to build the house, but that, in consequence of his reign havingbeen one of many warsand much bloodshed, that distinguished privilege was denied him. He was not,however left without hope, for God promised him that out of his loins thereshould come a man who would be adequate to the performance of so great andglorious an undertaking. That promisewas verified in the person and character of Solomon, his son, who ascended thethrone…~ From The Master’s LectureFree & Accepted MasonsEverything we know about King Solomon comes to us from the pages of the Bible(primarily the First Book of the Kings, the Second Book of the Chronicles) andother Jewish, Islamic, Coptic, and Ethiopian religious literature. The Bibletells us that Solomon came to the throne of Israel after the death of hisfather, Israel’s great warrior-king David.The story of David, as outlined in the Books of Samuel, could rightly be calledthe world’s first real biography. Never before in literature had a characterbeen so thoroughly exposed, warts and all. The biblical narratives of David andSolomon read like colorful and titillating novels, and represent a remarkabledeparture in style from other books of the Bible.The Bible tells us that Solomon inherited a huge and enormously wealthy nationwith a massive, well-equipped army.12Solomon’s Israel was said to be so rich andmighty that none of its powerful neighbors, including its archenemy Egypt, daredremain hostile. Scripture recounts that the rulers of the world courtedSolomon’s favor and lavished opulent tribute upon the Hebrew King, filling hisgranaries and treasure houses with riches the like of which the world had neverwitnessed before. In a submissive act, unprecedented in biblical lore, Egypt’sPharaoh sent his own daughter to become one of the many wives of the wise andpowerful Solomon.It was within this glorious atmosphere of peace and unparalleled prosperitySolomon fulfilled his father’s dream of building a temple worthy to house thetangible presence of the True and Living God Most High. This great temple wouldbe the exclusive center of worship and sacrifice for the children of Israel, andwould replace the portable tabernacle that had served to house the sacred Ark ofthe Covenant since the wilderness-wandering days of Moses.In order to complete this undertaking, the Bible tells us that Solomon pressedinto service thirty thousand__________121 Kings 4, 21-26 and 1 Kings 9, 17-23, 2 Chronicles 9, 25-26.men to cut timber in Lebanon, seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eightythousand hewers of stone in the mountain, and three thousand overseers of thework. The temple was completed in a little over seven years.13The biblicalaccount14is rich with details about the dimensions and ornamentation of thePhoenician style edifice – so many in fact, modern architects have been able todevelop satisfactory drawings, and models.Solomon died after reigning over Israel for 40 years.15Like his father beforehim, he had his share of troubles (much of it women trouble). Throughout it allhe succeeded in keeping the country united. After his death, however, a stringof mostly despicable kings immediately set to work to make a mess of things. Thenation split up into Judah in the south (where Jerusalem and the temple werelocated), and Israel in the north.The Temple stood in its pristine condition for only thirty-three years. Biblescholars reckon, however, that it remained intact (if in decay) for anadditional three hundred seventy-four years before being completely destroyed bythe armies of King Nebuchanezzar of Babylon around 586 BCE. Nebuchanezzar alsoordered that the fittest members of the Hebrew nobility be taken captive andbrought back to Babylon to serve in his palace and receive Babylonianeducations. Seventy years later, after the death of Nebuchanezzar and theconquest of Babylon by Cyrus__________13Bible scholars estimate 959 BCE.14First Kings (Chapters 5-8) and Second Chronicles (Chapters 1-7). 15Biblescholars estimate 930 BCE.of Persia, the descendants of the Hebrew captives were allowed to return toJerusalem to build a second temple.The moral lessons of Masonry draw heavily from these tales. As we will soon see,the Master Mason Degree focuses particularly on the story of the murder ofSolomon’s master builder, Hiram Abiff, and several degrees of the Scottish andYork Rites illustrate tales of the Babylonian captivity and events surroundingthe return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem. It would not be anexaggeration to say that the heart and soul of Masonry is found in the sectionsof the Bible that tell the story of King Solomon, and the fate of themagnificent Temple of God.The Bible, however, tells us precious little about Solomon the magician. Forthese accounts we must look to the traditions and literature of Judaism andIslam, and from the Alf Laylah wa Laylah, a true magical text better known to usas A Thousand and One Arabian Nights.16__________16The Arabian Nights. Richard F. Burton, translator, Bennett Cerf, editor, (NY:Modern Library, reprint edition, 1997). p. 35.CHAPTER FOUR SOLOMON THE MAGICIAN[../images/00006.gif]Thereupon quoth the Jinni: “Know that I am one among the heretical Jann, and Isinned against Solomon … whereupon the Prophet sent his Minister to seize me.And this Wazir brought me against my will and led me in bonds to him … and heplaced me standing before him like a supplicant. When Solomon saw me, he tookrefuge with Allah and bade me embrace the True Faith and obey his behests. But Irefused, so, sending for this cucurbit, he shut me up therein and stopped itover with lead, whereon he impressed the Most High Name, and gave his orders tothe Jann, who carried me off and cast me into the midmost of the ocean. There Iabode a hundred years, duringwhich I said in my heart, ‘Whoso shall release me, him will I enrich forever andever.’ ”~ From The Fisherman and the JinniKing Solomon is arguably one of the most colorful figures in the Old Testament,but the biblical Solomon is downright dull when compared to Solomon the magicianof other traditions. Judaism and Islam seem to meld into a magical mist of fableand fantasy in the person of Solomon. He is at once a Hebrew king, a Prophet ofAllah, and an audacious oriental wizard. Solomon the magician could talk withanimals, fly through the air on a magic carpet, and cause others to fly throughthe air to him.17He could control the powers of nature and was master of thedenizens of the spirit world, the demons, the afrites, and genii of Shahrazad’sA Thousand and One Arabian Nights. A recurring theme in these tales is theassertion that Solomon enlisted the services of genii and other maleficentspirits to construct the Temple of God.The ancients apparently didn’t see any conflict of interest in this arrangementat all. To them devils, genii, and demons were the spirit representatives of theblind forces of nature that create and destroy everything in the universe.Solomon was God’s instrument on earth and if he could control the infernalspirits to help him build the Temple of God then all power to him.Much like the thundering, smoke-belching heavy equipment used by today’sconstruction workers, these potentially dangerous forces can be instruments ofdeath and destruction when not controlled and directed by a higher intelligence.But in the masterful hands of a skilled operator the same fearful tools can beused for righteous and constructive purposes – including the erection of theHouse of God.Recall how in First Kings we are told that in order to build the Temple, Solomonemployed seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand hewers ofstone in the mountain, and three thousand overseers of the work? The legendaryversion is a little more interesting. Here’s how Moslem religious historianSheikh al-Siuti tells the tale:__________17The Koran: Sura 38 verses 33-35, Sura 27 verses 38 to 40.“When God revealed unto Solomon that he should build him a Temple, Solomonassembled all the wisest men, genii and Afrites of the earth, and the mightiestof the devils, and appointed one division of them to build, another to cutblocks and columns from the marble mines, and others to dive into ocean-depths,and fetch therefrom pearls and coral. Now some of these pearls were likeostrich’s or hen’s eggs. So he began to build the Temple… the devils cutquarries of jacinth and emerald. Also the devils made highly-polished cementedblocks of marble.”18The Jewish Talmud relates a remarkable story of Solomon’s dealings with thearchdemon Ashmodai in an attempt to procure a magical worm called the Shamir.The Shamir had the power to silently cut through solid stone with astoundingspeed and precision. Although Solomon’s control of the elements and hispossession of the silent stone-cutting Shamir are not mentioned directly in theteachings of Masonry, we still hear echoes of the story in the Master’s lectureof the Third Degree:there was not heard the sound of axe, hammer, or any tool of iron in the housewhile it was building…”“…although more than seven years were occupied in its [the Temple] building, yetduring the whole term it did not rain in the day time, but in the night seasononly, that the workmen might not be obstructed from their labors …we also learnthat__________18Solomon Steckoll, The Temple Mount, (London: Tom Stacey Ltd. 1972).The concept of a magical partnership between a masterful servant of God andotherwise destructive and evil spirits will very shortly become a very importantfactor in our understanding of Solomon’s Key. But before we discuss that subjectfurther, we need to take a brief detour through space and time: The place is thelodge room of Lebanon Lodge No. 58, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons inColumbus, Nebraska. The year is 1962 CE.[../images/00007.gif]A “Poor Knight of the Temple.”CHAPTER FIVE A SECRET SOCIETY OF BOYS[../images/00008.gif]I promise that I will be faithful to every trust committed to me, to everypromise I shall make so far as is humanly possible; and that will hold everbefore me as a glorious example, the heroic fidelity of Jacques DeMolay and thatof every other martyr who gave his liferather than betray a friend or be false to a trust. ~ From The Oath of a DeMolayWhen I was fourteen years old I was gently pressured by my father and several ofmy schoolmates to join the Order of DeMolay. Created in 1919 by Frank S. Land, aKansas City businessman and high-degree Freemason, DeMolay is a Masonicorganization for young men between the ages of twelve and twenty-one. At first Ithought the whole thing a little corny and would have much preferred spending mytime practicing my guitar and misbehaving. I confess I didn’t take much of itseriously. There were, however, certain elements of the experience that appealedto me very much.I loved the feel of the Masonic lodge room. After meetings, when the rest of theboys were in the social hall enjoying refreshments, I would sit alone in thesemidarkness of the temple and try to imagine the secret goings on of grown-upMasons. The lodge room felt more sacred than church. It was rectangular andsmelled like old wood and cigars. There were big thrones positioned in the east,south, and west, and two ornate pillars with globes on their capitals flankedthe double doors in the west. There was an altar in the middle of the floor. Itseemed like everything – every chair, every podium, every mounted symbol knewits place and was perfectly situated where it belonged. Is this where the RoyalSecret is revealed?One evening after our Chapter meeting, I remained in the lodge room to drink inthe atmosphere and daydream about rituals. That night I chose to sit in the bigthrone in the south. I knew it was an important officer’s chair because it wasbehind an ornate podium that looked like a shortened pillar. The top of thepodium was covered by a square of black marble. For some reason I felt drawn torest my hands on the marble and feel its cool heaviness. To my surprise it moveda little. I stood up and discovered that it was secured to the top of the podiumonly at one corner and the whole piece could be moved aside revealing a secretcompartment under the marble top.My heart felt like it was going to explode as I quickly looked around to makesure I was alone in the lodge room. Then, I looked inside. There, about sixinches deep inside, rested a little blue book. I carefully picked it up. Therewas nothing written on the cover. I opened it up and discovered it was writtenentirely in a strange code that used Latin letters and symbols (U wr cd t # cn %# :: @ cs t kn fr # bn % pr…etc). I remember thinking, “This is so cool!” Idebated whether or not I should tell my father of my forbidden discovery. Iopted not to fearing in the back of my mind that he might have to kill me.I was particularly impressed by DeMolay’s Second Degree19initiation ceremony.The ritual is really a play staged in the Chapter room by the boysthemselves.20It exemplifies the trial and martyrdom in 1314 of Jacques DeMolay,the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar who was burned at the stake inParis at the hands of the Inquisition. It’s a remarkably elaborate drama full ofoff-stage torture and screaming – just the kind of thing adolescent boys enjoy.In a way, the ceremony is a diluted preview of elements of several degrees ofthe Scottish Rite of Freemasonry that treat on the same subject.As presented, the story is a classic example of good versus evil – the nobleGrand Master of a band of virtuous Knights resisting an envious and greedy Kingof France and a corrupt and superstitious Pope. Even though in this case eviltemporarily triumphs (DeMolay is executed and his Order apparently destroyed),the moral lessons are clear. Our hero remains true to his conscience and loyalto his comrades throughout the ordeals of false accusations, torture, an unjusttrial, and finally the stake.__________19The DeMolay Degree was written by Frank A. Marshall, a Masonic colleague ofFrank Land and passionate admirer of Jacques DeMolay and the Knights Templar.20In larger Chapters, the DeMolay Degree is presented on stage instead of in theChapter room.The ceremony did not focus too clearly about what precisely the charges againstthe Templars and DeMolay were. In the ritual the Master Inquisitor accusesDeMolay of being the head of an order that “practiced many abominations,” andcharges him with:• Hypocrisy and treachery in conducting the Crusades in the Holy Land;• Betraying the King of France (Phillip IV, Le Bel);• Heresy toward the Church;• Living in wealth while the poor starved, and;• Conniving with the infidel to make the Crusades fail of their holy purpose.I have to admit I was pretty awed by the whole thing. In my adolescent eyesJacques DeMolay seemed like a pretty cool guy, and his death was an objectlesson in virtue and loyalty – qualities I hoped I would always be able toemulate. But, besides teaching me what I was for, DeMolay’s story also taught meabout things I should be against – the forces[../images/00009.gif][../images/00010.gif]Phillip IV (Le Bel) King of France & Pope Clement V.of intolerance, superstition, and tyranny.After my DeMolay Degree initiation I joined myBrothers in the social hall for refreshments and listenedto a short talk delivered by our Dad (the term used for theChapter’s adult Masonic supervisor). In this more informalsetting we learned a handful of curious footnotes to theDeMolay story. Our Dad obviously enjoyed this part of theevening, and delivered his talk extempore. First he told usthat some Masonic historians believe that Masonry wasstarted by former Knights Templars who fled to Scotlandwhen the Order was outlawed. With a most endearingtwinkle in his eye he dramatically hinted that secrets ofthe Templars are still hidden in the symbols and rituals ofMasonry. He then went on to tell a tale that sounded as if itcame right out of a horror movie.It seems that as the coals and flames were roastinghim alive, the doomed DeMolay uttered a prophetic cursefor all to hear. He vowed that within one year he would(from beyond the grave or wherever ashes go) summon thesouls of King Philip and Pope Clement to stand with himbefore the bar of heaven. There DeMolay would ask God tojudge who was guilty in this matter. And it came to pass thatless than a year after that awful utterance the King and Popedid indeed join the martyred Grandmaster in the afterlife. I was very impressed!Still, it was pretty strong stuff for a boy of fourteenin small-town Nebraska, and I confess I didn’t meditate toodeeply about DeMolay and his comrades until many yearslater when the ghosts of the Knights Templar would againride into my life.This time the focus of my attention would not beupon the death of Jacques DeMolay, but the heresies andabominations he and his fellow knights were accused ofpracticing.[../images/00011.gif]The Temple Mount in Jerusalem as it would have appeared during the time of theCrusades.CHAPTER SIX THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR[../images/00012.gif]The Templars have something to do with everything. ~ Umberto Eco, Foucault’sPendulum21There is a story that is often repeated by secret society and conspiracy buffsthat in 1792 during the French Revolution (nearly 500 years after the martyrdomof Jacques DeMolay), at the moment the guillotine severed the head of King LouisXVI an unnamed man leapt upon the scaffolding, plunged his hand in the king’sblood, and shouted, Jacques De Molay, tu es vengé! or “Jacques DeMolay, thou artavenged!” Another unsubstantiated legend holds that upon hearing the news of theking’s execution, the same words were reportedly uttered by Adam Weishaupt, thefounder of the notorious (and for a brief time, Masonically connected) BavarianIlluminati.Whether accurate or not, it is certainly true that these stories were widelycirculated almost immediately__________21Umberto Eco. Foucault’s Pendulum, (NY: Ballantine Books; Reprint edition,1990. p. 312.after Louis’ death and the phrase continues to this day to be the watchword forrevolutionary acts that resist and strike back at superstition, tyranny, and theoppression of human thought and freedom, especially those perceived to beperpetrated by the Roman Catholic Church and the “divinely chosen” monarchies ofEurope.For the better part of two centuries Masonic scholars have passionately debatedwhat, if anything, the Knights Templars have to do with Freemasonry. There iscertainly no hard evidence or documents we can refer to that informs us in somany words that on such-and-such a date the Knights Templar went underground andset up a secret benevolent society that employs building tools as esotericsymbols and Bible stories as moral lessons. However, many influential Masons ofthe past, especially those in eighteenth century France,22enthusiasticallyembraced the Templars as their own predecessors.Still, supporters of an historic Templar-Mason connection can only point to themost generic elements within the rituals and liturgies of the Craft thatdemonstrate at most a harmony of anticlerical goals and attitudes shared by thetwo organizations. However, in the philosophical arena (where traditionalhistory is more important than history history) this in-and-of itself can haveprofound significance. As Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia affirms, even the mostconservative Masonic commentators admit the connection has become inextricablyfixed.__________22The hypothesis that Masonry originated with the crusading Knights Templar wasoriginally advanced in 1737 by Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsey, a noted educatorand Freemason, in an address supposedly delivered to the Grand Lodge of France.“This theory of Templar origin which, mythical as it is and whollyunsubstantiated by the authority of history, has exercised a vast influence inthe fabrication of advanced Degrees and the invention of Continental Rites.”23As an adult I became interested in the Templars not because of their possibleconnection with Freemasonry, but because I was acutely interested in theaccusations leveled against them. The charges were many but the ones that mostcaught my attention were those that alleged that:• new initiates were required to spit upon and trample a crucifix underfoot;• that they were forbidden to worship the crucifix;• that new knights were told that Jesus was a man who died like all men die;• that in the higher degrees Templars worshipped a bearded human head or anass-headed statue called Baphomet; and (something that interested me very much);• that they practiced magic.What a curious assortment of accusations to be leveled at a group of Christianknights – yet there was a certain constancy in many of the “confessions” voicedby the tortured members of the order that might lead us to conclude there wasperhaps an iota of truth in these accusations. But before we open that can ofworms, let’s take a very brief look at what we know about this colorful band ofbrothers.__________23Coil’s Masonic Encyclopedia. (NY: Macoy Pub & Masonic Supply Co; Rev. 1996. p.347.On Christmas Day in the year 1118 CE24a group of nine French knights, includingHughes de Payen, (cousin of the Comte de Champayne, and husband of Catherine StClair of Roslin) stood before the Patriarch of Jerusalem and King Baldwin II ofPalestine, and vowed themselves to poverty, chastity, and obedience. They saidthey wished to form a Holy Order of warriors, and requested they be given astheir headquarters the area adjacent to the eastern sector of the King’s Palacein Jerusalem – a place we know today as the Temple Mount.For reasons that no historian can properly explain, the Patriarch immediatelyaccepted their vows and the King summarily surrendered the area to the knights.This area of Mount Moriah had a rich legendary past that reached deep intoSemitic mythology. It was said that an exposed boulder at the summit of themount first issued at the dawn of time from the mouth of the mythical serpentTahum, and would serve as the portal connecting the upper world and the infernalregions. It is also where tradition informs us Abraham built an altar of stonesupon which he prepared his son Isaac for sacrifice. From that altar Jacob (theson of Isaac) took a stone to be his pillow as he slept and dreamed of a ladderreaching to heaven. Upon awaking from his vision, Jacob anointed the stone withoil and it supposedly sank into the ground to form the foundation of what wouldbe the three great Jewish Temples:• King Solomon’s Temple (959 BCE);• a larger but less ornate Second Temple (535 BCE) __________24This exact date, as almost everything connected to the story of the Templars,is the subject of debate and conjecture.built by the children of Israel upon their return from captivity in Babylon;• and the magnificent Third Temple (20 BCE) built by Herod the Great anddestroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.Herod’s Temple was the largest of them all. It was the Temple that stood duringJesus’ lifetime – where the second chapter of the Book of John tells us he wastaken as a child, and where he scourged the moneychangers.The knights called themselves Pauvres Chevaliers du Temple – Poor Knights of theTemple, or the Knights Templar, and it appears they traveled to Jerusalem forthe singular purpose of establishing the order and securing the Temple Mount astheir headquarters. Their expressed official raison d’être was to protect theincreasing number of Christian pilgrims who traveled the dangerous roads to thenewly conquered Holy Land (a job that was already being handled by the Knightsof Saint John). It is highly unlikely, however, that this was truly theirintention – at least not at first. In fact, it is doubtful the nine PauvresChevaliers du Temple did any soldiering at all for the first nine years, duringwhich time it appears they kept to themselves and remained at the site of theTemple Mount.Modern Templar buffs speculate that this tiny group of knights were engaged inan aggressive excavation of the ruins of the Temple Mount, searching for the Arkof the Covenant, or King Solomon’s gold, or other priceless relics. Much as manyof us would like to have solid archeological evidence to support thesespeculations, there appears to be none. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine thatnine men billeted for nine years in the closed confines of the most legendaryand mystical spot on earth wouldn’t eventually want to have a look around.What, if anything in particular, they might have been looking for we can onlyguess, but conspiracy enthusiasts (and modern novelists) certainly think theyfound (or learned) something – something very important – something that in afew short years drew to them the goodwill and deference of the Church of Romeand the princes of Europe.The story of the Templars’ meteoric rise to power is unique in the history ofWestern civilization, and is the subject of many well-researched andwell-documented books and essays. Still, it is frequently hard to separate factfrom legend. Curiously, for our purposes, legend is as important and relevant asfact, for religious and political movements are shaped by what people believe tobe true rather than what may actually be factual. I implore the reader to keepthis fact firmly in mind as we delve deeper into this subject.For nine years after their formation, the Pauvres Chevaliers du Temple initiatedno new members and remained doing something at the temple site. Then, in 1126,two of them, Hugues de Payen and André de Montbard, returned to France to conferwith Montbard’s nephew the Abbot of Clairvaux. The Abbot was no ordinarychurchman. He was the senior advisor to Pope Honarius II and the most brilliantand charismatic figure in twelfth century Christendom. We know him today asSaint Bernard of Clairvaux.Whatever it was he learned from his uncle André, Bernard immediately threw hisundiluted energies and influence behind the Templars. He convinced the Pope togive the Pauvres Chevaliers du Temple full Church recognition, and volunteeredto create the order’s constitution. Oddly enough, the Rule of Order that Bernardcomposed contained no reference whatsoever to protecting pilgrims. What it diddo was unite the two most powerful forces in the Western world; the Church ofRome and the ruthless brutality of the feudal warrior.The Knights Templar were to become the first truly disciplined army since theRoman legionnaires – fighting men who lived like monks – Christian soldierswhose bloody occupation did not jeopardize their prospects of going to heavenbecause they had a license to kill evil. Unlike other knights who owedallegiance to a specific king, duke, baron, or nobleman, the Templars were to beholy warriors answerable only to the Pope.They were not, however, to be a Papal army. Indeed, from the very beginning oftheir existence and for the next two hundred years, Popes treated the KnightsTemplar as if they were too hot to handle. They were allowed freedoms andprivileges enjoyed by no other body in Christendom. They had their own priestsand confessors. They were allowed to build their own, uniquely-styled churches.They were freed from countless other Papal restrictions and supervisions.Europe’s noble families soon began to lavish gifts of land and money upon thenew order, and their privileged sons raced each other to join the Poor Knightsof the Temple.In 1128, before returning to Jerusalem, Hughes de Payen (a relative by marriageto the St Clairs of Rosslyn Chapel fame) travelled to Scotland and paid a visitto his in-laws. The St Clairs were obviously impressed with what they learnedfrom de Payen and immediately granted the new order a tract of land atBallontrodoch (now the town of Temple) to be their headquarters in Scotland.Almost overnight a new class of citizen was introduced into the feudal system ofthe world – a new kind of man – a free man, unencumbered by the restrictions ofChurch and state – a free man who needed no pass from bishop or king or baron orlord or magistrate to move as he will on the face of the earth, from town totown, province to province, country to country. (This freedom of movement is oneof the privileges of a modern Mason as well, and is echoed in the Masonicritual. When asked, “What induced you to become a Mason?” the proper answerbegins with the words, “That I might travel in foreign countries…”)After the Crusades, the Templars’ international structure and organizationalskills turned them into a super economic entity, a world army, a country withoutborders. Because they could skirt Church laws that forbade the borrowing andlending of money with interest they set to work to become the world’s firstinternational/multinational megabank. They invented checking. They maintained anarmy of fierce and highly-trained soldiers and a fleet of sailing ships. Kingsborrowed money from them, and (even though they were technically answerable toPapal authority) for two hundred years popes let them do whatever they wanted.It was as if the Templars (as movie gangsters would say) “had something” on theChurch and the monarchs of Europe. Some speculate they even had something on theSaracens.Were the Templars blackmailing the world, or were they simply a dynamic ideawhose time had come? If they did have something what could it possibly havebeen? What could they have unearthed at that legendary spot where heaven andhell are said to touch the earth? What secret could have Hughes de Payen andAndré de Montbard shared with the future Saint Bernard and the St Clair familythat would have been so earthshaking as to reward the Templars with a blankcheck from the masters of their world? Was this object, this piece ofinformation, this treasure destroyed with them? Was the secret lost?These questions have been the subject of speculation for seven hundred years. Inthe last few years several best-selling books have theorized the treasure mightbe lost gospels or something relating to Jesus and the early history of theChurch; perhaps documents or artifacts proving that Jesus had a twin brother, orthat he was married and had children. Some believe the Templars found the HolyGrail or the Ark of the Covenant, or the mummified head of John the Baptist, orthe demonstrably unresurrected body of Jesus Christ himself. Others morerecently have even speculated they found the golden tablets of Maroni that wouldeventually find their way to the New World to be discovered by Joseph Smith, theMormon prophet. A popular motion picture suggests it was a good old-fashionedtreasure of ancient artifacts, gold and silver.Whatever the nature of the secret, speculation that it was not lost with theseemingly complete destruction of the Templars is fueled to a white heat when welearn that as the tide turned on Wednesday, October 11, 1307 (just two daysprior to the universal arrest of the Templars) a fleet of Templar ships quietlyslipped from the harbor at La Rochelle and were never seen again. French Masonichistorians make no secret of their destination – Scotland.The mystery of what (if anything) the Templars found has driven men mad fornearly a thousand years. I am not exaggerating. For some individuals the Templarmyth has become an all-consuming and unhealthy obsession, and their wild andparanoid public conjectures continue to bring unfair scorn and ridicule upon theefforts of legitimate scholars and researchers.Speaking through one of his characters in the novel Foucault’s Pendulum, UmbertoEco makes the following alltoo-true observation:“For him, everything proves everything else. The Lunatic is all idée fixé, andwhatever he comes across confirms his lunacy. You can tell him by the libertieshe takes with common sense, by his flashes of inspiration, and by the fact thatsooner or later he brings up the Templars.”I realize that by writing this book I am too am running the risk of puttingmyself in the above category. But run the risk I must, because whether or nottheir secret treasure was real or legendary – whether or not their connection toFreemasonry is historic or merely traditional, where magic, Masonry andSolomon’s Key are concerned the Templars do indeed …have something to do witheverything.CHAPTER SEVEN THE TEMPLAR’S SECRET?[../images/00013.jpeg]In writing the life of King Solomon from a Masonic point of view, it isimpossible to omit a reference to the legends which have been preserved in theMasonic system.

It was a universally accepted fact that everythingwritten in the BibleAnd now we return to the subject of King Solomon. Although it may not at firstbe obvious to the reader, the person of the wise King is a vital element ofMasonry’s legendary connection to the Knights Templar and the secret treasurethey allegedly possessed. We’ve learned a little about what the Bible, otherreligious literature, and A Thousand and One Arabian Nights tells us aboutSolomon the king and magician, now let us examine what exactly we know about thehistorical King Solomon.For the greater part of the last two millennia Western civilization has reliedupon the Bible as its primary source__________25Op cit. p. 697. was literally true – the unerring Word of God.Conversely, anything not found in the Bible was considered equally untrue.Nowhere, for instance, do we learn in the Bible that the earth revolves aroundthe sun, or that other planets are worlds that have moons that revolve aroundthem. The Bible successfully established itself as its own unquestioned internalauthority – the Word of God because the book tells us it’s the Word of God – abook that is true because the book tells us it is true – a book that mustbelieved because the book tells us it must be believed. For the better part ofwhat we consider the modern era, the Bible said it. We believed it. That settledit!That may be a perfectly admirable position for a religious devotee to taketoward a spiritual document. It is not, however, a realistic attitude for theserious student of history.26__________26I pause to point out that the documented history of Freemasonry begins in 1717at the height of the intellectual movement known as The Enlightenment – a timewhen reason and the scientific method were loosening the bonds of blind faithand superstition.Other than what is written in the Bible, what exactly do we know about thepolitical and military conquests and glories of King David and the fabulousreign of King Solomon? What records have been discovered and preserved of anempire that stretched from the Euphrates to Egypt? What ruins and archeologicaldigs can we visit to see remnants of Solomon’s magnificent temple or theluxurious palaces he built for his wives – structures which were many timeslarger than his temple? What great museums exhibit the helmets, the armor, theswords and chariots of the massive army that conquered the Philistines, theAssyrians and the Egyptians? Where can we examine the artistry of the sacredvessels of the temple? What archaeologist has uncovered the tomb of David orSolomon, or a tablet or inscription bearing either of their names or the namesof any of their kin or colleagues outlined so explicitly in the Bible?As difficult as it may be for many people to believe, there is no archaeologicalevidence whatsoever to offer even the slightest suggestion that David or Solomonor Israel’s golden kingdoms ever existed. No mention of the name of David27orSolomon has ever been found in the mountains of surviving records kept by theEgyptians or the Assyrians, or those of any other neighboring nations who wereallegedly defeated in battle and for years paid massive tribute to Solomon; noartifacts large or small from a mighty Israelite__________27Recently, after receiving much media attention, a tablet allegedly created byKing Hazael of Aram-Damascus containing reference to the king of the House ofDavid was proven to be a forgery and a hoax. The so-called discoverer was thesame criminal who was arrested for forging an inscription bearing the name ofJesus on a first century ossuary. See The Christian Science Monitor, June 19,2003.army; no object of art; no inscriptions; no letter to or from either David orSolomon, no mention of either of them anywhere in the surviving correspondencesof neighboring kingdoms.Most conspicuously absent are any records whatsoever of seven years of taxes andlabor levies for what the Bible suggests should exist for 183,000 workmenconscripted locally and from foreign countries – documents which most certainlyshould be found in abundance among existing contemporary records.Considering the fact that the Holy Land is an area of the world where digginghas taken place for centuries, and thousands of artifacts have been unearthedattesting to the existence and chronicling the events of early, even prehistoriccultures in the area, is it not almost inconceivable that such celebratedkingdoms and such powerful world rulers such as David and Solomon could remainso completely invisible to the archaeological record?I realize that for some readers this may sound uncomfortably like heresy. Pleasedon’t misunderstand me. I believe it is certainly possible that evidence maysomeday be found that supports these particular biblical accounts. I’m juststating a fact that any objective person willing to do a little honest researchwill discover for himself or herself; that is, after centuries of excavation andimpartial research, there is presently no tangible evidence to suggest that KingDavid, King Solomon or his magnificent temple in Jerusalem ever existed.That being said, I want you to consider the possibility that in twelfth-centuryJerusalem the first Knights Templar– intelligent and motivated men who had the exclusive opportunity to excavatethe alleged site of King Solomon’s Temple – also discovered no tangible evidenceto suggest that King David or King Solomon or his temple ever existed.Any number of discoveries could have led them to conclude that biblical historywas at the very best, unreliable. Perhaps their excavations demonstrated that afoundation for such an edifice could not have possibly existed at or near thatlocation; perhaps they found tablets, inscriptions or other records that provedincontrovertibly the real history of the region – it could have been a thousanddifferent items, artifacts, documents, or bits of information. No matter whatexactly it was, if it proved (as impartial modern experts are almost universallyasserting) that there was no King David – no King Solomon – no King Solomon’sTemple as described in the Bible, then the entire literary foundation for thehistory of the Holy Land prior to the sixth century BCE28would evaporate into afantasy.Like a literary keystone placed squarely in the middle of the chronology of theJudeo-Christian biblical narrative, the story of David and Solomon links andsupports the narratives of both the Old and New Testaments. If this keystone isremoved, not only does the historic integrity of much of the Old Testamentcollapse, but a major facet of the credentials of New Testament Jesus is alsoradically altered. After all, in order to prove Jesus’ birth was the fulfillmentof Old Testament prophesies – that he was the Messiah and heir to the Davidicthrone of Israel, the__________28See Chapter Nine.Gospels go to great lengths to demonstrate that Jesus was a direct descendant ofDavid and Solomon.Removing this keystone would also be unsettling for pious Moslems who, despitetheir differences, considered themselves to be along with Jews and ChristiansPeople of the Book. What would happen to Islamic traditions that also presumedto reach that far back into biblical history?In the twelfth century such faith-crushing revelations would have threatened tovaporize the authority of the Church and reduce to ashes the concept of thedivine right of kings that had been the foundation of the social order in Europeand the West for a thousand years.It would have turned the world upside down. It would have been the mostdangerous secret in the world.CHAPTER EIGHT THE MOST DANGEROUS SECRET IN THE WORLD[../images/00014.gif]Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead. ~ Benjamin Franklin(Freemason)Am I suggesting that the Templars’ secret – the most dangerous secret in theworld – was that the Bible is historically untrue? In a way, yes – but it’s notas simple as that. First of all, in the twelfth century there were very fewactual Bibles (as we think of them today) in existence. There were very fewpeople able to read a Bible, and even fewer able to appreciate what the Biblewas or understand what it was not. For most Europeans it was the Church, not theBible, that dictated the tenets of their faith.If the early Templars believed they possessed such potentially earth-shakinginformation it would have put them in a very sticky predicament. After all, towhom could they threaten to reveal the secret? Who besides a handful ofchurchmen and nobles were even capable of appreciating information that carriedsuch titanic implications? In the twelfth century there was no way for theTemplars to go public. There were no newspapers, no radio or television, nobooks (at least not any that most Europeans could read), no investigativereporters. The Church enjoyed a monopoly on European education, literacy, andthought – it controlled history. While it appears obvious the Church wasintimidated by whatever the Templars had, it would have been futile to confrontthis omnipotent establishment directly.This would have put the early Templars in a position of perpetual danger. Theirsecret would have isolated them from the whole world – at least the worldrepresented by the religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – religionsthat revered certain books of the Bible – religions that owed their veryexistence to their adherents’ belief that they were descendants of certainbiblical characters, and that the Bible narratives were historically true. Themost dangerous secret in the world was also the world’s most blasphemous heresy.The early Templars would have had little choice but to play their cards veryclose to the vest – little choice but to bide their time, build their strength,and seek out others in the Holy Land who also knew the truth – others whosebeliefs made them also outcasts of orthodoxy – others who knew how to survive –others like the Ishmaelite Order of the Assassins who had already created theirown degreestructured secret society to protect themselves and their interests.The Templars would stay in Palestine and learn from the natives – the remnantsof the Jewish esoteric cults, early Christians, and the mystic heretics ofIslam. They would stay and drink in a thousand wonders and new ideas that passedlike caravans through the crossroads of the world that was twelfth-centuryJerusalem. They would dine on delicacies they’d never tasted, hear music they’dnever heard before and listen to stories, histories and philosophies that theynever knew existed. In short order they would become the most EasternizedWesterners in the world – men who saw the bigger picture of life and culture –men who dreamed greater dreams than those of their fellow Europeans – men whotasted the forbidden fruit of knowledge – their eyes were opened and they becameas gods.[../images/00015.gif]Gustave Doré’s David Punishing the Ammonites. Could it be just a fable?CHAPTER NINE BUT MASONS LOVE THE BIBLE[../images/00016.jpeg]I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us withsense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use. ~ GalileoGalileiIt ain’t those parts of the Bible that I can’t understand that bother me, it’sthe parts that I do understand.~ Mark Twain (Freemason)I realize it is difficult, if not impossible, for many people today to evenentertain the idea that the Bible may not be all they’ve believed it to be. TheBible has become the most popular book in the world. Today it is universallyrevered by the faithful as the inerrant Word of God. It occurs to very few of usto question either its holiness or its authenticity. In a world that has gonehellishly mad, we’ve always taken comfort in the fact that the faith of ourfathers is the one thing that remains solid and unchanging. For most of us itwould be unthinkable to suggest that perhaps for the last twenty-five hundredyears the faith of our fathers has been one of the very big reasons why ourworld has gone hellishly mad.On the surface, Masonry appears to be vigorously at odds with this worldview.After all, the Bible is very important to Masonry. As Chaplain of my Lodge Ideliver the following charge to the newly-initiated Entered Apprentice Mason:“As a Mason, you are to regard the Volume of the Sacred Law as the great lightin your profession; to consider it as the unerring standard of truth andjustice; and to regulate your actions by the divine precepts it contains.”The book I refer to as the Volume of the Sacred Law in this particular sectionof the ritual is in most cases a large Bible that rests upon the altar where thecandidate has just taken his solemn oath to the fraternity. I say in most casesbecause not all Masons are Christians or Jews. Indeed, as we learned earlier,candidates for Masonic initiation are not asked to identify themselves asmembers of any particular faith and need only profess a belief in a SupremeBeing and some form of afterlife. At their initiations these candidates areobligated upon whatever holy book they revere as their own Volume of the SacredLaw.While the term Volume of the Sacred Law is employed most often in Masonicritual, the words Holy Bible are used in the ritual when describing the book asone of the Three Great Lights of Masonry (the other two Great Lights being themost recognizable symbols of the Craft, the Square and Compass).Obviously, there appears to be a conflict of traditions here. It would seem atfirst glance that such reverence for the Holy Bible would put Masonry at oddswith a hypothetical Templar secret that threatens to shoot a very big hole inthe Bible’s credibility. But let’s look more closely at what the charge says andhow it says it.A Mason is to regard the Volume of the Sacred Law as the great light in hisprofession, and the unerring standard of truth and justice.He is counseled toregulate his actions by the divine precepts it contains. These are admirableinstructions, and I am certainly not arguing that the Bible (or one’s own Volumeof the Sacred Law) is not a rich and sacred source of spiritual inspiration andguidance. They do not, however, suggest that a Mason is in any way obligated toaccept the Volume of the Sacred Law as an objective history book. Moreover, ithas been my observation that Masonic lectures that employ readings from theBible or make allusions to Bible stories are entirely self-referential tolessons of Masonry and completely free from sectarian doctrines andinterpretations.It may be true that the majority of Masons believe the Bible is historicallyaccurate, but they’ve come to that conclusion not because of anything they learnfrom Masonry, but because of their pre-existing religious convictions. There issomething else at work here, something that struck me like a setting maul to thehead the evening I was raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason.I’m breaking no vows of secrecy when I share with you that the ceremony of thisdegree revolves around the story of King Solomon and the building of his temple.Some of it is taken directly from the Bible and tells the story of King David ofIsrael, and of his son, Solomon, who with the aid of his neighbor King Hiram ofTyre and the master builder, Hiram Abiff, built the magnificent Temple of God.Most of it, however, concerns a patently non-biblical story – a dramatic mythunique to Masonry. It is the story of Hiram Abiff, the master builder who, asthe Solomon’s temple was nearing completion, was accosted by three workmen ofthe Temple who prematurely demanded from him the secret word of a Master Mason,a word that would guarantee them the freedom to travel as they will to foreigncountries29 and earn Master’s wages. Hiram, of course, refused and was murdered.Shocked at their foul deed the ruffians hurriedly concealed the Grand Master’sbody in the rubbish heap of the temple. Later they removed it and reburied itelsewhere. Eventually, the villains were apprehended and brought before KingSolomon where they confessed and were summarily executed. Solomon and King Hiramof Tyre proceeded to locate the grave, raise the body and bring it back toJerusalem to be finally interred beneath the Holy of Holies of the Temple.It’s a wonderful legend and reminiscent of the story of Osiris and the dying godmyths of a score of ancient cultures and mystery traditions. However, it is astory that is found nowhere in the Bible, and certainly not believable from anhistoric point of view. (An unclean dead body interred inside Holy of Holies ofthe Jewish Temple? I think__________29The freedom of unhindered travel would become one of the unique privileges ofboth the Knight Templars, and, the cathedral-building medieval masons.not!) Still, the enactment of this drama is Masonry’s most sacred moment and ispresented by the ritual team with profound, almost religious solemnity.In a subtle way, the ceremony of the Third Degree gives the new Mason permissionto meditate (perhaps for the first time in his life) on sacred mythologicaltruths existing outside the strict confines of the biblical narrative. Forothers (who meditate upon a possible Masonic-Templar connection) the ceremonyalso suggests, in a not-so-subtle way, that perhaps something was buried beneaththe Holy of Holies of the Temple – not the fictional Temple of Solomon, but thevery real ruins of the first centuryBCE Temple of Herod the Great. ModernTemplar treasure hunters even suggest that the Masonic myth points to somethingburied beneath Scotland’s Rosslyn Chapel30whose foundational footprint is saidto be scaled to that of Herod’s Temple.With this supreme ceremony Masonry goes to great lengths to draw the candidate’sattention to the Bible, especially the biblical story of David and Solomon, thenalmost immediately diverts his attention to a dramatic non-Biblical version ofthe story – almost as if to say, ”You know – those Bible stories of David andSolomon and King Solomon’s Temple? There’s something underneath those stories.You might want to dig into it.”Masonry urges her members (all her members) to use the Volume of the Sacred Lawas the Great Light in your profession. The question few of us ask, however, iswhen do__________30Rosslyn Chapel was built in the middle of the fifteenth century by Sir WilliamSt Clair, the Earl of Orkney and prominent descendant of Hughes de Payen, one ofthe original nine Knights Templar.professional stonemasons most need light? The answer is obvious. Masons needlight when they dig, when they excavate, when they explore, when they seek outand bring to light those things hidden beneath the surface.A few pages back we learned what we find when we dig beneath the surface of thestory of King Solomon and the building of his temple. There is another Biblestory that Masonry goes out of its way to draw our attention to – a storysurrounding the events that followed the destruction of Solomon’s Temple. It isthe tale of the capture and relocation of the children of Israel to Babylon, andtheir return to Jerusalem after seventy years to rebuild Jerusalem and theso-called Second Temple. Let’s now take a moment to examine this story and seewhat we find when we turn the Bible’s light upon itself and excavate below thesurface.First we need to try to determine exactly where the Bible narrative actuallystarts to intersect with objective, verifiable history. What are the historicroots of Judaism (and subsequently Christianity, and Islam)? Modern researchershave some startling answers to these questions. If the Knights Templar hadreason to draw the same conclusions, they were indeed custodians of the mostdangerous secret in the world.Let’s start with a place and time everyone seems to agree upon. There is littledebate between secular historians and Bible scholars concerning the existenceand vitality of Judaism as practiced in Palestine during the first century BCEthrough most of the first century CE. No credible historian dares presume todeny the existence of King Herod the Great (73-4 BCE) or his magnificent Templein Jerusalem, or the priesthood that administered the sacrifices, or theexistence and influence of cults and sects such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, andEssenes, all of whom revered a number of scriptural texts that defined theirview of Judaism and dictated in exacting detail divine laws and codes ofbehavior of this magnificent religion.Foremost among these texts are five books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,and Deuteronomy (the Pentateuch), books that through their narrative relate thehistory of the universe, humankind and the children of Israel. Tradition holdsthat the Pentateuch was written by Moses himself around 1280 to 1250 BCE (whenmany Bible scholars compute the dates for the exodus from Egypt) and that hisfive books were part of the mysterious contents of the powerful and dangerousArk of the Covenant. Let’s look briefly at these five books of Moses and try toget a sense of what they are, who wrote them, and where biblical history endsand objective history begins.Genesis, begins with the creation story of the world and humankind. It plots ourfamily tree and the great events that link God and His people – from Adam andEve and the fall of man through Noah and the great flood – through Abraham (whoinstitutes penis mutilation to distinguish his family and people) and his sonsIshmael (father of the Arabs), and Isaac (father of the Jews) – through Isaac’stwin sons Esau (who the Bible tells us God hated before he was born) and Jacob(who God loved) and later was renamed Israel.Then comes Joseph, the son of Jacob/Israel, who after being sold into slavery byhis jealous brothers really showed them all by making it very big in Egypt.Joseph then, in an act of gracious magnanimity, brings Israel, his father, andhis entire family (the children of Israel)31to the land of the Pharaoh to escapea terrible famine.The Book of Exodus continues with the adventures of Israel’s family in Egypt.For a while things are wonderful. Nourished on Egypt’s abundance, the seventyodd children of Israel multiply exuberantly and in a few generations become aponderous population. After a few lean years of famine in the area, theyactually become a serious economic burden upon Egypt’s dwindling resources. In aruthless pogrom, a new Pharaoh (who never knew Joseph) orders the first-bornHebrew males to be slain. The mother of baby Moses places him in a basket andsets it afloat on the river Nile near where Pharaoh’s daughter is bathing. Shefinds the baby and raises it as her own. Moses (like Joseph many years earlier)becomes a prince of Egypt.Moses’ story is one of high drama and excitement. He discovers his trueidentity, kills an Egyptian, is banished to the wilderness, has a closeencounter with God, and is given magical powers that bring plagues and cursesupon Egypt (including the deaths of all the Egyptian first-born males). Moses iseventually allowed to take the children of Israel out of Egypt.In the next three books, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, Moses leads thechildren of Israel for forty years of wandering in the wilderness and raiding__________31At the risk of restating the obvious – the term children of Israel refers tothe descendants of Jacob/Israel, not the former inhabitants of a geographicalnation of Israel.towns and villages. During this time he receives the Ten Commandments, buildsthe Ark of the Covenant (and a portable Tabernacle to put it in), puts to deatha number of wrong-thinking members of the congregation, writes his memoirs (thePentateuch), codifies laws and ordinances, and institutes the forms and customsof sacrificial worship that must be observed by the people in order to pleaseGod. Finally, after a generation of nomadic existence, Moses shows the childrenof Israel where God wants them to slaughter the natives and settle down – moreor less the area generically known as Palestine.The Book of Joshua follows the Pentateuch and continues the adventures of thechildren of Israel (now identified as a loose confederation of twelve tribes) asthey conquer and settle the promised land, but it is the five books of Mosesthat first define Jewish identity as a people, a culture, and a religiousentity.Other books of the “Old Testament” (revered by both Christians and Jews)continue the story of life in the Promised Land – how the children of Israelwere ruled for a time by a series of judges, and how a great king, Saul,eventually arose from among them to unite them politically. Saul was succeededby David, then Solomon, then a string of largely despicable minor kings whowould disunite the nation until it fell prey to a series of conquests. The worstof these conquests and dispersals was delivered by Nebuchanezzar whose armiesdestroyed the Temple of Solomon and took the residents of Judah into bondage inBabylon.These books go on to tell the story so familiar to York and Scottish Rite Masons– a story that has an uncanny number of parallels to the tale of Moses and theexodus from Egypt. Only in this case, the exodus is from Babylon. Here we learnthat after seventy years of captivity, the children of Israel were allowed toreturn to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple of their God and dwell once again intheir own land. Unfortunately, after only two generations the residents ofPalestine had no idea who these returnees were. They resented them as invadersand foreign occupiers.The Prophet Nehemiah and the highly influential scribe, Ezra, appear to havebeen instrumental in arranging the return of the children of Israel toPalestine. They insisted that it was vitally important that the temple berebuilt, so as to reestablish their cultural identity in the region. Accordingto both Bible and Masonic traditions, excavators and workmen had to work with ashovel in one hand and a sword in the other to fight off the disgruntled localswhose neighborly requests to be a part of the building project had been rudelyrejected by the returnees.During the excavation of the ruins of Solomon’s temple workmen discovered in asubterranean vault a scroll containing the five books of Moses, something noliving person among them had ever seen or read before. This event is the centraltheme to the Royal Arch Degree of York Rite Masonry where a ritual officerportraying the workman is lowered by a rope into the dark chamber, retrieves thescroll and delivers the exciting news:“I also found this scroll, but…I was unable to read its contents. I thereforegave another preconcerted signal, and was drawn out of the vault, bringing thescroll with me. We then discovered, from the first sentence, that it containedthe records of the Most Holy Law, which had been promulgated by Moses at thefoot of Mount Horeb.”32 traded his birthright33[and any future claim to theland] to Jacob/Israel for a bowl of lentil soup).34Grasping the importance of the discovery, Ezra the Scribe had a high platformerected from which he could stand and speak to the multitudes. He caused allthose who had returned from Babylon to be assembled before him and announcedthat the lost Book of the Law had been rediscovered. He then proceeded to readaloud for all to hear the five books of Moses.In one of the most dramatic and poignant scenes of the Old Testament, thechildren of Israel hear for the first time in their lives the actual words ofGod from God’s own book. They hear for the first time who they are and wherethey came from. They hear why they are God’s chosen people. They learn that theyare the descendants of Adam and Eve, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel). Theyhear for the first time the story of Joseph and their bondage in Egypt– of Moses and their exodus – a story each and every one of them can identifywith because they have just come out of bondage in Babylon. They learn of theirwanderings in the wilderness, how Moses gave them God’s laws and the forms ofsacrificial worship. They hear why God loves them and has given them this landbecause they are the descendants of Isaac and Jacob/Israel, and they hear whyGod hates the unhappy and resentful locals because they are the descendants ofIshmael and Esau (a gross and hairy man who__________32From the Royal Arch Degree of Masonry.After Ezra’s reading of the Pentateuch, the people became united in spirit andpurpose. The new Temple was built, a particular tribe (Levi) was chosen fromamong them to be the priest class, the Laws of Moses were instituted andenforced, the sacrifices, practices, traditions of the old religion wereresumed, and the people regained their spiritual identity.Ironically, this most dramatic and poignant biblical scene is rarely the subjectof sermons (and never to my knowledge, the subject of motion pictures). Masonry,on the other hand, makes her members think about it a lot.It is at this point in time (approximately 539 BCE, when historical and criticalscholarly evidence confirms that Cyrus the Great of Persia conquered Babylon andbegan to deport and resettle the descendants of Nebuchanezzar’s foreigncaptives) that empirical history starts to hint of the presence of a Jewishpeople whose center of worship is a temple in Jerusalem. Prior tothis,35however, there is silence concerning the children of Israel. Our onlyevidence of Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob/Israel, Esau, Joseph (and theEgyptian captivity), Moses (and the exodus and wandering), Joshua (and theconquest of Palestine), and the kingdoms of Saul, David and Solomon is the Bible– and in this case, the Bible is demonstrably unreliable history.Thomas L. Thompson, Professor of Old Testament, __________33Genesis 25:25.34Genesis 25:34.35There is, however, archeological evidence confirming the existence andtraditions of the near-by Samaritans during this period.University of Copenhagen, writes …“In writing about the historical developments of Palestine between 1250 and 586(BCE), all of the traditional answers given for the origins and development of‘Israel’ have had to be discarded. The patriarchs of Genesis were nothistorical. The assertion that ‘Israel’ was already a people before enteringPalestine whether in these stories or in those of Joshua has no historicalfoundation. No massive military campaign of invading nomadic ‘Israelites’ everconquered Palestine. There never was an ethnically distinct ‘Canaanite’population whom ‘Israelites’ displaced. There was no ‘period of the Judges’ inhistory. No empire ever ruled a ‘united monarchy’ from Jerusalem. No ethnicallycoherent ‘Israelite’ nation ever existed at all … In history, neither Jerusalemnor Judah ever shared an identity with Israel before the rule of the Hasmoneansin the Hellenistic period.”36The Hasmoneans Thompson refers to above were a priest family called theMaccabees who led a successful (and historically verifiable) rebellion againstthe Selucid kings of Syria in the Second century BCE and established anautonomous Jewish kingdom that existed until 67 BCE when the area was annexed bythe Romans.37__________36Thompson, Thomas L., Mythic Past, Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel,(NY: MJF Books, 1999). p. 190.37See Bowker, John, The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, (NY: OxfordUniversity Press, 1997). p. 414.The next obvious question becomes, who wrote the books of the Bible where thesestories originate? And the answer is simple. We don’t know. It is clear thatmultiple scribes and authors were involved. Many traditionalists believe theProphet Jeremiah wrote at least part of these texts, but Jewish tradition, StJerome, and many modern Bible scholars think Ezra the Scribe (or the person orpersons writing as Ezra/Nehemiah) edited and formatted much of the Pentateuchand several other Old Testament books including Joshua, Judges, and the books ofSamuel, Kings, and Chronicles, no earlier than the sixth century BCE. Manysecular scholars agree generally upon the sixth century date but also suggestthat same author(s) actually penned the Pentateuch, and at the very least had ahand in compiling and editing the books of Chronicles, Kings and several otherbooks of the Old Testament.There are literally hundreds of complex and convoluted theories of exactly whoput pen to paper to create the books of the Old Testament, but most seem todovetail in a greater or lesser degree, to the person or persons known in theBible as Ezra. Furthermore, there is almost universal agreement that the workscannot be traced any further back in time than the sixth century BCE. Prior tothis the historical and archaeological fingerprint of a Hebrew people united bya single religion occupying a nation with its headquarters in Jerusalem isnon-existent. Indeed, according to Norman F. Cantor, Emeritus Professor ofHistory, Sociology, and Comparative Literature New York University, RhodesScholar, Porter Ogden Jacobus Fellow at Princeton University, and FulbrightProfessor at Tel Aviv University:“The first millennium of Jewish history as presented in the Bible has noempirical foundation whatsoever.”38of people with no cultural memory whatsoever – people whose ancestors came froma dozen or more regions conquered by Nebuchanezzar – people whose real ancestorswere thrown together by the fortunes of world events and who eventually had tobe relocated when Babylon fell to the Persians. Because Palestine was an areaundefended by a unified political or military presence, it was an ideal“homeland” for such a mass relocation.That is quite a statement, and I venture to say that most men and women of faitharound the world would not believe it even if they were presented withuncontroversial proof. It would be a psychological blow of biblical proportions(forgive me) to anyone whose religious convictions are based upon thehistoricity of the Bible. It would be an even bigger blow to the self-image andthe geo-political interests of contending political forces embroiled in today’sMiddle Eastern conflicts – combatants who appear to be treating the pages of theOld Testament as if they were land grants whose deeds of ownership were signedby God Himself.Nevertheless, the unthinkable appears to be true. The kingdoms of David andSolomon are fable, not history. The idea of twelve distinct tribes of thechildren of Israel with a past reaching back to the thirteenth century BCE waslikely an ingenious concept fabricated in the sixth century BCE39(or later) toprovide a single cultural and religious identity to the descendants of a diverseassortment__________38Norman F.

The Crusaders and the infidels witness twohorsemen sparring in a friendly duel.If considered in this “light” both the Bible and Masonic tradition point therational investigator to at least consider this scenario. If all of this seemslike something that could never happen, I need only point to events of a littleover one hundred years ago involving the American prophet, Joseph Smith, hissuccessor, Brigham Young, and the “exodus” of the Latter Day Saints to Utah.This revelation is indeed earthshaking, and not everyone is capable of absorbingsuch a blow. It would, after all, lead one to speculate upon the unthinkablepossibility that a good percentage of the wars, the genocides, the hatreds andfeuds that have cursed Western civilization for the last three thousand yearshave been (and continue to be) tragic arguments that began over nothing. Ittakes the mature pragmatism of a true spiritual grownup to even speculate on theimplications of such matters. However, it needn’t spell the end to one’s faithin the “holiness” of scripture.Yes, it’s probably true that Moses didn’t write the Pentateuch, David didn’twrite Psalms, and Solomon didn’t write Ecclesiastes or even the Song of Solomon– but somebody did. The holiness – or the spiritual integrity of these documents– is not diminished in any way by their lack of historic reliability. Ask anyKabbalist. Whoever wrote Genesis not only gathered and synthesized the creationmyths of a handful of Semitic traditions, he or she did so with the skill of anilluminated mathematician and the insight of a poetic genius. Whoever wrotePsalms, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon was a passionately devotionalsaint. These works will forever offer real spiritual treasures to the sinceredevotee, but to insist that they are also history is to invite their misuse bysocial and political entities who are always ready to engender and perpetuatefear and hatred between peoples and cultures for their own interests.For me it is clear that Masonry, either by design, accident, or synchronicity,quietly affords her sons the opportunity to become, as it were, spiritualgrownups – good men made better by their work in the Craft – men whose conceptof God is big enough to take a hit or two. Admittedly, this new view of the OldTestament is a pretty big hit. But, unless we are blinded by superstition orbigotry, the readjustment of a few dates and the ability to distinguish betweensacred mythology and viable history needn’t destroy Scripture’s place in ourhearts as …an unerring standard of truth and justice.But the majority of Masons are Christians. We might now ask, how do Masonicideals square with the New Testament? In the second Degree of Masonry, theSenior Deacon in his magnificent Middle Chamber lecture delivers what might beviewed as a hit to a fundamental doctrine of Christianity. Standing between thestately pillars of the Temple he instructs the candidate that he is to pay“…rational homage to the Deity,” and informs him of the nature and meaning ofOperative Masonry; that by that term we allude to a “proper application of theuseful rules of architecture;” and that these rules not only display the effectsof human wisdom they also “… demonstrate that a fund of science and industry isimplanted in man for the best, most salutary, and most beneficent purposes.”What edifying words! What positive and encouraging words for a good man to hearat the beginning of his travels to become a better man. Who on earth coulddisagree with these words?Paul.The Apostle Paul would have violently disagreed. And I believe it is highlylikely the Knights Templar believed they had every reason to violently disagreewith Paul.CHAPTER TEN THE CRUCIFIX[../images/00018.gif]Quantum nobis prodest hæc fabula Christi. (It has served us well, this myth ofChrist.) ~ Pope Leo X (1513-1521)We may never know the details of the Templar’s cultural cross-pollination (ifany) with the Ishmaelite Order of the Assassins and/or other Middle Easternsects or philosophies. History informs us that throughout the twelfth centurythe Templars were fierce and formidable warriors who time and time againdistinguished themselves in battle against the Saracen forces. It is equallyclear that during the years of occupation and eventual decay of the Europeanpresence in the Holy Land the Templars enjoyed from time to time a diplomatic(if not patently cooperative) relationship with the Moslem locals, and becauseof the ease by which the Templars acclimated themselves to their orientalenvironment, rumors circulated of a secret alliance.Whether true or not, in legend and popular (and later, Masonic) imagination theTemplars became almost superheroes (or super-villains), masters of the magicalarts, the Kabbalah, demon evocation, alchemy, even sexual magic. Several ofthese traditions (sex magic not included) are not so subtly touched upon in theYork and Scottish Rites of Freemasonry, where degrees concerning the return ofthe children of Israel from Babylon are heavily peppered with references to theKabbalah and juxtaposed with ceremonies concerning the Knights Templar.Obviously, Masonry doesn’t venerate the Templars because of their supposedsorceries or because they were sodomites or because they perhaps spat oncrucifixes. It is nonetheless a well-known fact that they were accused of (andconfessed to) doing all those things. Still the Craft reveres this disgraced andbanished Order even to the point of institutionalizing the Templar ideal toyoung men in the DeMolay Order.It is true that as the Templars grew rich and powerful, they also grew arrogant,but it is clear to me that from their inception in 1118, until their destructionin 1314, the Knights Templar remained men of faith who considered themselvesChristians and believed most fervently in God. I am, however, suggesting thattheir “secret” made it impossible for them to continue in good conscience toembrace the authority of the Bible and certain doctrines of the Church of Rome –doctrines that demanded from Christians an unquestioning and unhealthy faith inthings the Templars knew (and believed they could prove) to be untrue. We canonly speculate exactly which Church doctrines they rejected, but if there iseven a scrap of truth hidden in testimonies extracted through torture, then weare led to conclude they despised in particular the veneration of the crucifix.Recall that a number of knights confessed that when they were received into theOrder they were required to spit upon and trample a crucifix underfoot, and thatthey were ordered not to worship the crucifix. This is one of the most shockingaccusations leveled at the Templars by the Inquisition, and contributed heavilyto their reputation as black magicians. We must, however, remember that there isa profound difference between the symbol of a cross (which in its many forms hasbeen a venerated symbol since prehistoric times) and that of the crucifix (across displaying a dead and bloodied corpse). It is also significant to pointout the cross (a simple equal-armed device) did not appear in Christian artuntil the middle of the fifth century CE,40and that scenes of the crucifixiondid not appear in Christian art until the seventh century CE.41Prior to this,the symbol of Christianity was the fish, and the image most often associatedwith Jesus was that of a shepherd carrying a lamb.Recall also these same knights testified they where told at their initiationthat Jesus was a man who died like all men die. This opinion was also commonamong firstcentury Christians, including the followers of James, the biologicalbrother of Jesus, who taught, among other things, that the simple act offollowing Jesus’ example and applying his teachings to one’s life was a way tosalvation.This was not, however, the view of the twelfth-century Church of Rome whichpropagated the doctrines of original__________40Found on a Vatican sarcophagus– See B.M. Metzger, M.D. Coogan, “The OxfordCompanion to the Bible,” Oxford University Press, (1993). p. 57. 41Ibid.sin , the total depravity of man, and the imminent physical resurrection of allthe buried corpses in the world. These doctrines were inventions of Paul – a manwho never met Jesus – a man with whom the first-century Church in Jerusalem (ledby James) had significant, perhaps even violent, disagreements.For nearly five hundred years after the deaths of James and Paul Christianitywas enmeshed in major ideological conflicts. These were fights over what wouldbecome the fundamental tenets of the faith. Eventually it came down to a bitterclash between two radically different factions. At the heart of the conflict wasa disagreement about who exactly Jesus was and what made him important. Oddlyenough, the debate didn’t focus directly on Jesus as Messiah or his teachingsbut upon the person of Adam and the doctrine of Adam’s guilt, or original sin.On one hand there were those who more or less took the position of the earlyChurch in Jerusalem, the remnants of the original followers of Jesus. Theyconsidered Jesus a holy man, a martyred master whose bloodline marked him for akingly or priestly destiny. Their view of original sin was basically that theybelieved that Adam’s sin hurt no one but himself and not the entire human race –that he would have died whether he sinned or not. They believed that babies areborn in the same innocent state as Adam before his big mistake, and as suchhumanity doesn’t need a sacrificial offering (such as Jesus’ crucifixion) or ademonstrable miracle (such as being raised from the dead) to achieve salvation.A religion based on this fundamental premise saw Christianity as the naturalevolution from Old Testament law to the new law of the Gospel. It would be arather simple faith that strictly observed the Law of Moses and revered the lifeand teachings of Jesus, the Anointed One– a religion that taught that salvation is earned by following the example ofthe Good Shepherd, by doing good and obeying what he called the greatestcommandment of both the Old and the New Testaments,42“Thou shalt love the Lordthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.”Opposing this was a religion (invented almost entirely by Paul) that relegatedto insignificance the sermons and fundamental teachings of Jesus. The teachingsultimately became irrelevant because Paul believed (that due to the curse ofAdam’s sin) we all are born guilty and come into the world already stained withsin, condemned to die and poised to suffer an eternity of torment. Thissin-of-beingborn cannot be removed by performing good works or adhering to anylaw. Indeed, according to Paul, only one thing can remove the curse – blood –the atoning blood of a crucified God made flesh.This extension of the animal sacrifice motif of the Jews was based upon Paul’smetaphysical obfuscation of the events surrounding the execution and thereported resurrection of Jesus. Just as the blood of a slaughtered lamb was usedin Temple worship services to absolve the devotee of certain sins, Paul positedthat Jesus was the Lamb of God and that the blood of the God-Man-Christ, can(under certain circumstances) absolve us from the sin of Adam. This is who Paultells us Jesus was. This is what Paul tells us Jesus__________42Deuteronomy 6:4. & Luke 10: 25-28.ultimately came to do – not to preach – not to teach – not to serve as anexample – but to die. The blood-drenched body of Jesus nailed to a crucifix wasthe perfect symbol for this suicidal act of blood sacrifice.In order for our sin to be removed, Paul taught we must first surrender ournatural self-esteem by consciously and verbally confessing we believe that(because we were born sinners) we are guilty and deserving of eternal damnation.After accepting this identity we must then exhibit complete and absolute faiththat Jesus was God incarnate who came to earth to take upon himself thesufferings that we deserve for the spiritual crime of being born, and that hisdeath, his physical resurrection, and his bodily ascension into the sky were allobjective historical events.To this unquestioning faith, Paul added one more condition to salvation – theGrace of God. Just exactly what grace is remains an ongoing debate, butaccording to Paul there is nothing we can do to earn it. We either have it whenwe are born or we don’t. Without grace we are damned to an eternity in hell nomatter how good we are in life or how strongly we believe in Christ. For theelect who enjoy the Grace of God there is no crime too hideous, no sin too evilthat can exempt them from salvation.The doctrine that salvation is achieved apart from good works and righteousbehavior is totally unique to Paul and found nowhere else in Scripture.43It istotally alien to the example of Jesus’ life and the words of his ministry. It__________43Isaiah spoke about good works being as “filthy rags” (which Paul would laterquote). But when read in context we see that Isaiah was chastising the peopleover their behavior concerning a specific event, not making a pronouncementconcerning the fundamental nature of man.is the complete antithesis of the position held by James, the brother of Jesus,and his Church in Jerusalem. It would also appear that it would also be at oddswith the Masonic doctrine that tells us that, “a fund of science and industry isimplanted in man for the best, most salutary and most beneficent proposes.”Yet Paul’s doctrines would eventually win out, at least for the Church of Rome.In the fifth century, largely due to the brilliant powers of persuasion of SaintAugustine of Hippo (354-430 CE), Christianity became in essence Paulianity.Paul’s radical doctrines of the total depravity of man and original sin wouldthroughout the Dark Ages define the nature of the human soul, and be the canonof a ruthless and powerful Church – a Church whose doctrines of selfloathingwere symbolized by the intimidating and terrible instrument of sadistic tortureand death – the crucifix.I appreciate the reader’s patience for suffering through this brief excursionthrough Church history and the twists and turns of dogma and doctrine. I did sonot to bore you or to persuade you in any way concerning matters of faith, whichshould always remain a matter of personal conscience. I did so to set the stage,so to speak, for what I am now about to say about the Knights Templar.I believe that at his initiation the Knights Templar candidate was indeed calledupon to spit upon a crucifix and trample it underfoot. I believe he was requiredto do so not as an act of black magic or to abjure the divinity of Christ, butrather to purposefully desecrate the symbol of what the Order believed to be amonstrous perversion of the truth – a lie born of a chain of lies that reachedback a thousand years before the death of the crucified savior – a lie thatoutraged natural reason and common sense – a lie that made us hate our veryexistence – a lie that blinded the masses of Western civilization to theprofound spiritual beauties of the teachings and example of the holy man fromGalilee – a lie that nailed humanity’s spirit and self-esteem upon a cross ofguilt and fear and shame.Furthermore, I hear the echo of this attitude in Masonry’s traditionalantagonism toward temporal tyranny, in its militant stand against ignorance andsuperstition, in its legendary enmity towards oppressive religion, in itsexaltation of the arts and sciences, in its call for a rational homage to theDeity, and in its unambiguous affirmation of the inherent goodness of humankind.Yes, I believe that at his initiation the Knights Templar candidate did indeedspit upon the crucifix and trample it underfoot. And I believe that by doing sohe was taking the first step towards challenging the lie and freeing his ownsoul.[../images/00019.gif]Templar Initiation?(Doré composite by Jody Breedlove)CHAPTER ELEVEN SORCERY[../images/00020.gif]When men stop believing in God, it isn’t that they then believe in nothing: theybelieve in everything.~ Umberto EcoWithout doubt the most ridiculous and ludicrous charge still being leveledagainst modern Masonry is that of sorcery. One need only search the internetusing the key words Masonry and black magic to be bombarded with hundreds of websites that accuse the Craft of everything from Satanism and devil worship tocannibalism and human sacrifice. Even as I am writing this, Masons are beingcondemned in print as an evil race of devils descended from Cain or spacealiens. My favorite accuses us of being shapeshifting reptiles who form a secretworld government that has ruled the world since the fall of Adam. It all wouldbe uproariously funny if not for the disturbing fact that many of these peopleactually believe what they are saying and their malicious and misinformedhate-speech springs from the most vile and dangerous nether regions of the humanheart – from the very real devils of ignorance, intolerance, and anti-Semitism.I’m afraid it is inevitable that this book too (because it treats on the subjectof magic and controversial aspects of history and religion) will be held up bythe ignorant and superstitious as more proof that Masonry is the blasphemousenemy of the True Faith. Today, however (probably to the disappointment ofanti-Masonic webmasters), it is unlikely that I will be imprisoned and burned atthe stake for exercising my freedom of speech and voicing my personal beliefs.In the fourteenth century, the Knights Templar were not so lucky.Sorcery was one of the Inquisition’s favorite charges because it put the pooraccused in the hopeless position of having to prove a negative in order to beatthe rap. Personally, I find it easy to believe that during their nearlytwo-hundred year history individual members of the Order did indeed engage indiverse forms of spiritual practices that would have been forbidden andcondemned by the Church of Rome. But then, we must also remember that the Churchwould have probably condemned as satanic a host of things that today we wouldnot consider strange or evil at all – yoga, acupuncture, transcendentalmeditation, creative visualization, herb tea … talking to a cat!The consistency of some of the Templar’s confessions point in particular to thepractice of consulting an oracle in the form of a human skull, or the head of anass, or even a black cat. Such divinatory practices were not uncommon among Arabmagicians of the period. Still, it is impossible for us to know with any levelof certainty if the charges of sorcery had basis in truth or not. Neverthelessthe air of magic has always enveloped the Templar image and, as we’ve learned,it is legend, not history that takes up archetypal residence in our culturalconsciousness and creates the traditions of secret societies. Keeping this inmind, let’s consider what kind of abominable sorceries might the legendaryTemplars have been practicing.Among the most popular magical practices forbidden by the Church were (and are)those whose literature and traditions would have us believe they originated withKing Solomon. In fact, there is a whole school of magic known as Solomonic Magicwhich encompasses a broad spectrum of techniques that range from makingastrological talismans, to conjuring demons and spirits into triangles, brassbottles or other objects. It is called Solomonic because it is based onmanuscripts44pseudepigraphically attributed to the legendary king himself.It would be unwise for us to dismiss these documents as valueless just becausewe know they weren’t written by King Solomon himself. Some source materialsboast provenances of respectable antiquity (some experts suggest anywhere fromthe first to the seventh century CE). Modern translations of several of theclassics of Solomonic Magic are currently in print and grace bookstore shelvesaround the world providing inspiration to new generations of serious studentsand practitioners (and a source of mischief for incautious would-be wizards).During the time the Templars resided in the Holy Land, however, such texts wereonly__________44 The three most notable Solomonic texts are, The Testament of Solomon, TheGreater Key of Solomon, and the Little Key of Solomon (the Goetia).available in Hebrew and Arabic.Arguably, the most colorful and effective variety ofSolomonic magic is known as Goetia.45and is found in thefirst of a collection of five books called the Lemegeton46orthe Lesser Key of Solomon. These papers are dated 1697 CEand appear to be one collector’s attempt to have his favoriteancient texts of Solomonic magic copied and convenientlybound into a single folio. They bear evidence that their language has beenmodernized, and that they were transcribedfrom far older manuscripts. The centerpiece of the LesserKey of Solomon is a list of seventy-two spirits drawn from anumber of ancient traditions, and instructions how theymay safely be called forth. Each spirit is described in detailalong with the special powers and abilities it supposedly canprovide the magician. The second section of this book contains pertinentexcerpts from this text.At first glance, Solomonic magic appears to have allthe trappings of black magic. In fact, it’s very much like ascene from a gothic horror film. The magician first casts acircle on the ground or the floor of the magical temple. Thiscircle is protected by the numerous names of God found inthe Bible along with the names of traditional archangels,angels and kabalistic words of power. (see Figure A). Themagician, properly dressed and armed with the magic wand,stands in the center of the circle, and with the aid of purewill, magical words and gestures he or she conjures a demon __________45Goetia was originally a Greek word for sorcery or witchcraft. A related word,goetes means a wailer and perhaps alludes to the long tradition of the sanctityof barbarous names of evocation extending back to classical times.46Sloane manuscript Nos. 2731 and 3648 currently found in the British Library.from the infernal regions into a magic triangle placed a few feet outside of thecircle. The triangle is also surrounded by three traditional words of power thatwill keep the spirit trapped safely inside. (see Figure A).The magician then compels the spirit to recognize him or her as its lord andmaster, then charges it to perform some task tradition (and the book) says thespirit is capable of executing. As you will soon discover, the classic procedureis much more involved and complex than this, but I think you get the generalidea of what kind of magic this is.It all sounds pretty wild and dangerous, and in fact it is. But before you jumpto the conclusion that such an enterprise is the nadir of primitive superstitionI would like you for a moment to pause and view such an operation not as amagical ceremony but as a psychological exercise – a psychodrama whereby we callforth and isolate previously uncontrolled potentialities within ourselves andredirect their heretofore chaotic and destructive energies toward constructiveends.We do this naturally every time we exercise self-discipline to master a skilland bring out hidden talents. For example, when I was twelve years old I wantedto play the guitar – learning to how to play the guitar was the object of mymagical operation. In order to do that I first had to conjure a guitar tovisible appearance. This was accomplished by first invoking a divine powergreater than myself (my parents). Then by means of a program of intense prayer(incessant whining) and sacred covenants (promises that I would practice hardand eventually pay back the money) a real guitar finally materialized in myhands.I then created the magical circle by isolating myself from the myriad diversionsof adolescence while I focused intently upon the work at hand. Then I evoked oneby one the demons of my uncoordinated hands and fingers and trapped them in thetriangle of will, determination and practice. Finally, I mastered the spirits ofthe melodies, lyrics and rhythms of the songs I wished to play and made them myservants.Until I mastered these demons I could not call myself a guitar player(magician). Like a Fellow-craft Mason I was not yet a Master. I did not yet haveKing Solomon’s Pass to travel to foreign countries (neighboring towns andcities) and earn Master Mason’s Wages (play in a dance band and make $20 anight!)Other personal demons are more dangerous and harder to master. Indeed, they canbe deadly. How many of us can truthfully say that we have never allowed greed,or jealousy, or insecurity, or lust, or laziness to ruin a potential triumph?How many times have you said to yourself, I am my own worst enemy? Theseuncontrolled bad habits and character flaws could be personified as maliciousspirits who pop up at the worst possible times to sabotage our best-laid plans.Wouldn’t we love to master them and force them to work for our benefit insteadof our undoing?Certainly, from one perspective, the Goetic magician’s “hell”47is his or her ownpsyche, and the infernal spirits are portions of the unconscious mind, orunbalanced and misfiring aspects of our emotional life. Up until__________47Middle English helle – Anglo-Saxon hel – meaning hidden, concealed.the moment we evoke and redirect them these “demons” remain uncontrolled andundirected. The seventy-two spirits that are catalogued in the Goetia and whoappear in the second section of this book are convenient personifications ofthese various potential powers and abilities. What makes them dangerous is thefact that unless they are called forth and forced to labor (like Solomon’sgenii) in harmony with the magician’s will, they will continue to run amuck andwork their mischief in our lives.This is precisely what magical tradition tells us King Solomon did in order togather a labor force to build the Temple of God. But does this type of magicreally work?I assure you it does.Did the Templars engage in such practices? [../images/00021.gif]Magician Evoking a Demon.(Engraving from Robert Fludd – Ultriusque cosmi historia, 1617.)We don’t know. It is clear that Templars not only had the opportunity to beexposed to such practices but because of their secret knowledge consideredthemselves spiritually exempt from Church-imposed proscriptions of suchbehavior. The multiple Templar confessions concerning the oracular head, orBaphomet, might also point to magical operations of this nature.Does Freemasonry teach or encourage such practices?Most assuredly not!Why then, you might ask, am I about to dedicate a significant portion of thisbook to the practice of this particular form of Solomonic magic?Because within the sealed vault of this dark and forbidden spiritual practicecan be found a certain formula of magic that, if used with skill and courage,fulfills the Kryptos’ promise of wonderful things – the Key to Solomon’s Key –the true Secrets of Magic and Masonry.But in order for us to actually use Solomon’s Key we must first come to the fullrealization of who we are and where we fit into the great cosmic scheme.CHAPTER TWELVE INITIATION[../images/00022.gif]In short, whoever finds this house,is ruler of the world, Solomon of his time.~ Jelaluddin Rumi48In the first chapter of this book I said that regardless of the circumstancessurrounding Masonry’s creation and development – regardless the past or presentmotives and activities of its individual leaders and members, the Craft isindeed the custodian of a profound and fundamental secret. I also made what tomany may have sounded like the presumptuous and audacious remark that Ipossessed the key to that secret. I here repeat that assertion.If, however, you were hoping that the nature of the secret takes the form of themummified body of Jesus or a gold-plated Ark of the Covenant hidden under thepyramid at the Louvre or beneath the grounds of CIA headquarters, or proof ofthe extraterrestrial origins of the British Royal family, then I’m afraid youare about to be disappointed. For although wonders such as these may well existand__________48The House of Love. Version by Kabir Helminski, Love is a Stranger (Boston:Shambhala Threshold Books, 1993.someday be brought to light, their discovery would only serve to slightlyreadjust our view of mundane history as it relates to religion and politics.The real secret is not a document or a book or an artifact. It is something thatcan neither be taught nor learned. It is an incommunicable fact of life thatconcerns the most profound wonder in the universe, the mystery of consciousnessitself, and our ability to achieve progressively higher levels of consciousness.In order to do that we must become a new kind of person, and we have to startthat process the same way the legendary Knights Templar did – by firstliberating ourselves from the great delusion that keeps most of us in a state ofspiritual bondage – the delusion that we do not create our own reality – thedelusion that we are helpless victims of someone or something else’s reality.This seems like such a little step, but it is in reality a quantum leap ofconsciousness, a fundamental shift of self-identity. As innocuous as thetraditions and ceremonies of Freemasonry may appear, they do, by their veryorder and structure, elegantly communicate to anyone with eyes to see theessence of the formula of initiation.First of all, we must want to change. In keeping with the most ancient customsof the Mystery tradition, Masonry invites no one into her ranks. Each potentialcandidate must voluntarily apply and swear he is unbiased by friends anduninfluenced by mercenary motives.Secondly, the initiation ritual itself reveals the threefold formula ofevolution: resistance, struggle, and mutation. The candidate submits to thisprocess again and again as he is repeatedly barred from advancement within thelodge room; then confronted with an ordeal or otherwise purified or instructed.Finally he is eventually allowed to pass and take his place in the Temple.The candidate physically experiences this process on the night of hisinitiation, but he is also required to embed the experience in the deepestrecesses of his mind. He does this by painstakingly committing large portions ofthe ceremony to memory and then reciting it letter perfect before the Master andhis lodge brothers. Until this is done he is not considered qualified to takethe next degree. This is more difficult for some than others, but the ordeal ofmemorization is vitally important, for once the formula of initiation becomesimprinted upon the subconscious mind it becomes difficult if not impossible toremove from the psyche. This simple formula, experienced by every Mason in histravels through the degrees, is precisely that outlined in the Egyptian Book ofthe Dead, and parallels the journey of the deceased as he or she passes tohigher and higher levels of post mortem consciousness.The third and most important factor in the formula of initiation is the act ofconsciously inserting ourselves into the divine circuitry of the cosmos. One canrightly argue that we are all, at all times, whether we recognize it or not, aninextricable part of the universal and supreme stream ofconsciousness/existence. But it is not until we wake up and recognize ourposition in this circuitry can we begin the Great Work – the work of invokingthe forces of nature above us so that we may master own demons and redirecttheir chaotic energy to build the Temple of our own evolving soul.This is what the archetypal Solomon did, and in Masonry this is expressed in thedisarmingly simple admonition, “No man should ever undertake any great orimportant undertaking without first invoking the blessing of God.”Once again, the Bible provides the key in a simple story that conceals afundamental secret of magic – a lesson that if we observe we will gain the powerto control the infernal spirits, and if we ignore we will be assured that theinfernal spirits will remain in control of us. The third chapter of the Book ofKings tells us that at the beginning of his reign the Lord appeared to Solomonin a vision by night and said, “Ask that which I should give you.”49Solomonanswered,“Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people and todiscern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great apeople?” And it pleased the Lord because Solomon had asked this thing. And theLord said to Solomon, “Because you have asked this thing and have not asked foryourself riches, neither have you asked the lives of your enemies nor have youasked for yourself long life, but have asked for yourself wisdom to discernjudgment; Behold, I have done according to your words; lo, I have given you awise and understanding heart, so that there has been none like you before you,neither shall any arise after you like you.”50__________49First Kings, chapter 3, verse 5. The Holy Bible From Ancient EasternManuscripts.- Translated from Aramaic by George M. Lamsa (Philadelphia, PA: A.J. HolmanCompany, 1967). p. 378.50Ibid. verses 9- 12.Before undertaking the task of ruling his people and building the Temple,Solomon doesn’t begin by consulting with his inferiors (his ministers, hisgenerals, his architects, his building supply contractors, or labor leaders). Hedoesn’t immediately enmesh himself in the energy-draining details ofmicromanaging such a huge and important project. Instead he turns his attentionupward to the highest level of the hierarchical scale of consciousness. He makesdirect contact with Deity and, instead of behaving like a helpless youngsterasking a parent for pocket money, he boldly makes himself available to serve asa conduit through which Deity’s infinite wisdom and understanding can pass.This profoundly mature and uncomplicated request is instantly granted, as ifDeity had no choice but to acquiesce. A unique51spiritual hierarchy is createdwith Solomon enthroned midway between heaven and hell – poised to work in cosmicharmony with the divine consciousness above him – poised to compel the infernalspirits to do the same.This is the primary secret of Solomonic magic. As long as the magician remainsplugged in to that which is above, he or she is simultaneously plugged into (andmust begin to master) that which is below.__________51Just as no two people share the same spiritual history (karma), flaws,talents, or potential, each magician’s career is entirely unique. Hence theLord’s comment to Solomon, “Lo, I have given you a wise and understanding heart,so that there has been none like you before you, neither shall any arise afteryou like you.”CHAPTER THIRTEEN SEVEN SECRETS OF SOLOMON[../images/00023.gif]“The Hermetic Science of the early Christian ages, cultivated also by … theArabs, studied by the Chiefs of the Templars, and embodied in certain symbols ofthe higher Degrees of Freemasonry, may be accurately defined as the Kabalah inactive realization, or the Magicof Works.”~ Albert Pike5252 1891), arguably the most eminent and influential Masonic scholar and leaderof all time. As I conclude this section of my little book I cannot imagine amore concise distillation of what I wish to communicate by writing it. In onebreath Pike manages to link early Christianity, Arab scholars, the Templars,Freemasonry, Kabbalah, and Magic. His words__________52Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry.

We could argue adinfinitum whether or not there is any truth to these speculations and at the endof the day still not come to a satisfactory resolution. For our purposes, let usbe content with what Brother Albert Mackey wrote in his Encyclopædia ofFreemasonry:“Hermetic Science – The art or science of Alchemy, so termed from HermesTrismegistus who was looked up to by the alchemists as the founder of their art.The Hermetic philosophers say that all the sages of antiquity, such as Plato,Socrates, Aristotle, and Pythagoras, were initiated into the secrets of theirscience; and that the hieroglyphics of Egypt and all the fables of mythologywere invented to teach the dogmas of Hermetic philosophy.” 53Hermetic tradition informs us that first revelation of God to man was theEmerald Tablet of Hermes54Trismigistus.__________53Albert Mackey. Encyclopædia of Freemasonry op cit. p.323.54 In his book, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry (Los Angeles: PhilosophicalResearch Society, Inc. 1996). Manly Palmer Hall, 33°, the greattwentieth-century Masonic scholar and mystic, identifies Hermes with the HiramAbiff, the hero/martyr of Masonic mythology.It was said to have been over two thousand years old at the time of Christ. Itwas reportedly cast in liquid emerald by alchemical means, and the letters wereraised in bas relief rather than being chiseled into the stone. Most authoritiesnaturally dismiss the historic veracity of the legend, but whatever its originthe text stands as the consummate distillation of Hermetic thought outlining thealchemical process that transmutes lead into gold and you and I into gods.The document is only thirteen short paragraphs in length and opens with thestatement:“It is true and no lie, certain, and to be depended upon, that the superioragrees with the inferior, and the inferior with the superior, to effect that onetruly wonderful work.” 55who can affect positive life changes in conformity to his or her enlightenedWill. It’s as simple as that. However, that is more easily said than done, andthere are a few things we must also keep in mind in order to make as above, sobelow actually work for us. These I presumptuously call the Seven Secrets ofSolomon. They are secrets of magic, yes. But they are also secrets of Masonry.For through her rituals, traditions, and teachings the ancient craft ofFreemasonry conveys these same secrets to anyone who has eyes to see and ears tohear.These words reveal the cosmos to be a hierarchy of repeating patterns. Like thekeys of a piano, the notes that comprise the octaves of the worlds above havetheir direct counterparts in (and vibrate sympathetically with) the octaves ofthe worlds below. The superior agrees with the inferior. As above, sobelow.56(I’m going to use this phrase a lot in this chapter so I hope you’ve gota pretty good grasp on this concept.)Armed with this knowledge one becomes (in the truest sense of the term) amagician – a Solomon – a person__________55Ibid. p. 95.56 The Kabbalist will tell us that opening chapter of Genesis affirms thisfundamental concept by informing us that Adam (the human race) was created inthe image of God.

If you can’t swallow this you’ll never be a magician. We are, each one ofus, our own selfcontained King Solomon. We are suns not planets, atoms notmolecules, kings and queens, not subjects. The fundamental unit of society isnot the family, not the community, not the nation, not the Church, but you andI. Until we come to the full realization of this fundamental truth we remainlike unenlightened Crusaders fighting and dying for someone else’s absurdfantasy cause, slaves to arbitrary and impersonal outside entities, unable torecognize (let alone fulfill) our human potential.This profound yet unassuming secret is expressed in Freemasonry by the simpleadmonition that we must first improve and perfect ourselves as individuals sobetter to understand and assist our families, communities, and nations.Solomon’s Secret #2Human beings are inherently good.As we learned in Chapter Ten, this is where we come toe-to-toe with thedoctrines of original sin and the total depravity of man. While it is true thathumans are capable of harboring the most vile and hideous thoughts, and ourfellows continue to plague the world with bloody orgies of pain and death andgenocide, it is not helpful – it is not healthful– indeed, it is not logical for us to focus on these manifestations of evil andassume they represent our true spiritual nature. As a solder, Francis of Assisiwas a playboy and a thief. Young Mohandas Gandhi slapped his wife around. Werethese their essential natures? We are all potential saints and mahatmas, and ifwe can’t wake up to the fact that deep down inside we are good, then we deserveto remain asleep dreaming we are evil.Masonry teaches that a fund of science and industry is implanted in man for thebest, most salutary and most beneficent purposes. In the Third Degree we aretold, “Retain, we entreat you, that goodness of heart, that purity of intention,and that love of virtue of which we think you now possess…”Truly realizing that we are inherently good rather than inherently evil is notonly a fundamental factor in our sense of self-identity, it serves throughoutour lives as a perpetual background meditation that positively effects ouractions, behavior, aspirations, and most importantly our dreams.Solomon’s Secret #3Human beings evolve, and with intent, can accelerate the evolutionary process.This secret has been the foundation for the spiritual practices of the East formillennia, but in the West it’s been successfully suppressed by religiousdoctrine and cultural interests since the fifth century CE. One would think thatat the dawn of the twenty-first century such an obvious fact of life should beexempt from secrethood. However, one glance at the headlines of today’s Americannewspapers and we become embarrassingly disabused.The so-called “debate” between the theories of Evolution and Creationism(currently doing business under the name “Intelligent Design”) is an obviousextension of the argument between those who insist on the empirical (evenscientific) historicity of the Old Testament and those who recognize and acceptthe archeological and critical scholarly evidence. The irony of this debate (aswe will see in Solomon’s Secret # 4) is that true Evolution and true IntelligentDesign need not be mutually exclusive concepts.There will always be those who are willing to put their intellects and commonsense on hold in order to feed some superstition or conform to religiousdoctrine. That is their right. But for the rest of us (including those who arestaunchly religious) our spiritual worldview is not turned upside-down when wesimply recognize the fact that human beings evolve, and that we can through ourown efforts and intentions accelerate that process. Masonry, in hercharacteristically understated way, exemplifies this once radical andanticlerical attitude in metaphor by discussing the symbols of the Rough andPerfect Ashlars.Every lodge is furnished with two stones; one roughly cut but basically cubical;another smoothly cut and perfectly square and cubical. The candidate is informedin the Entered Apprentice Degree:“By the Rough Ashlar we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by nature;by the Perfect Ashlar, of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive bya virtuous education, our own endeavors, and the blessing of God.”Solomon’s Secret # 4 All is Consciousness.In the Third Degree Master Masons are informed:“It is the inspiration of that great Divinity whom we adore, and bears thenearest resemblance of affinity to that Supreme Intelligence which pervades allnature, and which will never, never, never die.” the Bleep do We Know?,Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was quoted,Even as I write, advances in human thought are melding quantum physics withancient mysticism. One word that each of them are using when discussing theultimate nature of reality is “consciousness.” In the highly acclaimedfilm,57What__________57What the Bleep Do We Know? A Film by William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, & MarkVincente, Captured Light Industries – Lord of the Wind Films, LLC. 2004.“Consciousness is the basis of all life and the field of all possibilities. Itsnature is to expand and unfold its full potential. The impulse to evolve is thusinherent in the very nature of life.”Deepak Chopra cuts right to the chase and informs us in no uncertain terms that,“Good is higher consciousness. Evil is lower consciousness.” 58Consciousness, viewed in its supreme totality, could certainly be considered theMind of God. Indeed, if proponents of the so-called theory of “IntelligentDesign” could for a moment unburden themselves of ulterior agendas they mighthasten to embrace quantum theory by quoting the Nobel Prize-winning father ofquantum physics, Max Planck, who shocked everyone in the 1950s by saying,existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of allmatter.”“There is no matter as such.59All matter originates and exists only by virtue ofa force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this mostminute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the__________58Deepak Chopra. How to Know God – The Soul’s Journey into the Mystery ofMysteries. (NY: Three Rivers Press, 2000). p 130.59This quote is featured in the film, What the Bleep Do We Know (Ibid), and wasoriginally from an address delivered by Max Planck in Florence Italy.All things we perceive in the cosmos, including ourselves, are aspects ofconsciousness within the matrix of matter. But from our limited vantage point weare only aware of the reality of our immediate neighborhood. We can’t see thebig consciousness picture. Some of us, however, sense there is more. Like theancient Hermeticists, we are drawn to speculate about the existence of levels ofconsciousness both above and below our own.Deepak Chopra’s comment that, “Good is higher consciousness. Evil is lowerconsciousness,” is profoundly true from a moral point of view, but we can alsoview this hierarchy of consciousness the way the ancient Kabbalists andmagicians did – not as abstractions, but as spiritual beings.Solomon’s Secret #5Deity, Archangels, Angels, Intelligences, Spirits, Demons and you and I arepersonifications of ahierarchy of consciousness.Deity is obviously at the top of the hierarchy of consciousness – the SupremeConsciousness – the Supreme Being. All creation is a play in the Mind of God.Next lower in the hierarchy is a descending array of forces and energies thatare more specialized envoys-of-intelligence in the Mind of God. We could viewthem as units (or aspects) of natural forces and laws. The ancients personifiedthem as spiritual beings, calling them archangels, angels, and intelligences. Wedon’t actually see these forces (entities), but we are certainly aware of howthey affect the world around us.For example: We could personify the law of gravity as a great archangel. Wecould even give this archangel a name – Gravitiel. Gavitiel is a spiritual beingwith huge duties and responsibilities in the universe. As an archangel itembodies all that is gravitational. We see the work of gravity manifest inalmost infinite ways: the tugging of the tidal moon; the falling of a raindrop;the sagging of a breast; the plummeting of a meteor. These specific expressionsof gravity could be viewed as angels (Tugiel, Falliel; Sagiel and Plummetiel)working under the authority of the Archangel Gravitiel.Gravitiel and his angels are responsible for organizing and directing all thework that takes place on the next and lowest level of consciousness where theprocess of creating sustaining, and destroying the material universe takesplace. This is the world most of us consider objective reality. Magicians,however, have a more colorful name – the infernal regions.If you can suffer one more of my metaphoric excursions, let’s look at God as theowner – the boss of the cosmic company. Archangels, angels, and intelligences,are middle management. The workers themselves are spirits and demons that dwellon the factory floor, the lowest level of consciousness. These workers do allthe heavy lifting in the universe and they’re a pretty rough bunch (after all,they’re not only the cosmic construction crew, they are the wrecking crew aswell).This far down the scale of consciousness the purity of the upper levels hasbecome fragmented and disorganized. If this area is not consciously directed bymiddlemanagement these broken pieces of the Mind of God will, like a brutish andrestless mob of unemployed and unsupervised zombie workmen, discharge theirawesome energy in chaotic and destructive ways. On the other hand, oncecontrolled by a higher intelligence they become united in service to thecompany. If they continue to behave themselves they eventually are promoted tomiddle management, etc.The characters in the Masonic story of Solomon personifies this spectrum ofconsciousness:• God at the top – The Great Architect of the Universe;• Solomon (and his fellow Grand Masters, King Hiram of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff) inthe middle; and at the bottom;• The Workmen on the Temple (the Masters, or Overseers of the work; FellowCrafts, or hewers on the mountains and in the quarries; and Entered Apprentices,or bearers of burden). If the Entered Apprentice worked diligently he could beexpected to be advanced to Fellow Craft, etc.Once in place and functioning, this scenario paints a picture of a universe inbalance, a spiritual utopia where everyone is laboring successfully underdirection and supervision to raise themselves (and their inferiors) to the nexthigher level.“… these were all so classed and arranged by the wisdom of Solomon that neitherenvy, discord, nor confusion was suffered to interrupt or disturb the peace andgood fellowship which prevailed among the workmen.”60But where do you and I fit in this cosmic company of consciousness?It depends upon where our present level of consciousness positions us. In ourunenlightened state we’ve convinced ourselves that we’re infernal creaturesliving and dying on the factory floor. Once we open our eyes, however, wediscover that we are relatively high in the hierarchy of spiritual beings. Infact we are, each of us, the most important member of the middle management team– envied by the angels – feared by the spirits and demons. We are Solomon.Solomon’s Secret #6It is our duty to master and redirect the lower forces to constructive ends.Spiritual evolution does not occur in a vacuum. Our consciousness is raisedbecause vibratory room has been made above to accommodate it. (We are promotedto boss when our boss is promoted to a bigger boss.) As above, so below. Withauthority comes responsibility. Once awakened to our true spiritual status werealize that we are actually in charge of a roughneck crew of demons (aspects ofourlower consciousness). Unless we immediately demonstrate __________60From the Master Mason Degree lecture.who’s the boss and get these guys busy working on our “Temple” they will soongain the upper hand and return to running amuck at our expense.This secret is innocuously revealed to the newly raised Master Mason when he istold:“As a Master Mason you are authorized to correct the irregularities of your lessinformed brethren, to fortify their minds with resolution against the snares ofthe insidious, and to guard them against every allurement to vicious practices.”His completed Temple is the microcosmic replica in stone of Deity Itself,fashioned so perfectly it reflects the macrocosmic perfection of God.Solomon’s Secret #7As we are raised – so must we raise.In the previous chapter I wrote that as long as the magician remains plugged into that which is above, he or she is simultaneously plugged into (and must beginto master) that which is below. The seventh Secret of Solomon adds that not onlyis it our duty to master and direct the spirits beneath us, we must also, as weadvance, make sure they advance as well. It does us no good to raise our ownstatus if we are unwilling to raise the status of those beneath us. In fact,failure to do so immediately disconnects us from the source and unplugs us fromthe magical circuitry of the cosmos.The great nineteenth century magician, Eliphaz Levi wrote a marvelous littlepoem called The Magician that perfectly illustrates this greatest of Solomon’sSecrets. I can think of no better way to conclude this portion of the book andprepare you to appreciate what follows.The Magician61O Lord, deliver me from hell’s great fear and gloom! Loose thou my spirit fromthe larvae of the tomb! I seek them in their dread abodes without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.I bid the night conceive the glittering hemisphere. Arise, O sun, arise! O moon,shine white & clear! I seek them in their dread abodes without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.Their faces and their shapes are terrible and strange. These devils by my mightto angels I will change. These nameless horrors I address without affright:On them will I impose my will, the law of light.These are the phantoms pale of mine astonied view, Yet none but I their blastedbeauty can renew; For to the abyss of hell I plunge without affright: On themwill I impose my will, the law of light.__________61The Magician [Translated from Eliphaz Levi’s version of the famous Hymn] TheEquinox Vol. I (1).

Used with permission.64Ibid. areas of your own life and circumstances.But before plunging directly into the excerpts from this remarkable work, Iencourage you to review Chapter Eleven where I outlined the basic character andoperating procedures for this kind of sorcery. Also, I’m sure many readers maystill have questions concerning Solomonic magic in general, and Goetia inparticular. So, in an attempt to preemptively address some of these issues, Iwill (by the magic of imagination) split myself in two – half the hypotheticaland ruthlessly inquisitive owner of this book – the other half, the kindly oldauthor and magician.Question #1.Do you actually expect me to believe this kind of magic works?No. I don’t expect anyone to believe anything. Magic is psychological art formnot a belief system (unless, of course you consider the concept of ‘cause andeffect’ to be a belief system). I am expecting, however, that you will withholdabsolute judgment about the efficacy of such exercises until such time youactually perform a Goetic evocation for yourself.I have on numerous occasions, over the last thirty, years evoked a number of thespirits of the Goetia utilizing the basic formula outlined in the Lesser Key ofSolomon. I have also taught others to do the same. If success is measured bywhether or not the stated purpose of the exercise was regularly achieved, thenmy personal experiences (and reports from others with whom I’ve had personalcontact) lead me to affirm categorically that this kind of magic does indeedwork.Question #2.Are the spirits real or imaginary?I can only offer my personal opinion based upon conclusions I have drawn as theresult of my own experiences with this kind of exercise. There are many veryknowledgeable individuals who disagree with my assumptions. Some think I’vetaken the “magic” out of the magic by over analyzing the process and makingthings too psychological. Others think my views of the art aren’t agnosticenough – that my views are naïve and overly mystical and romantic.I offer no rebuttal to either of these charges other than to say, spirits are asreal as the powers they personify. To quote my literary alter ego, Rabbi LamedBen Clifford,65 “The spirits are both real and imaginary – but most of us do notrealize how real our imagination is.”66For example; I don’t believe in the existence of an objective, tangible entitywho lives at the North Pole and fliesaround the world on Christmas Eve delivering gifts to every__________65Lon Milo DuQuette. The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. (YorkBeach, ME: Weiser Books, Inc. 2001)66Ibid. p 132.one – but I know for a fact that there is a real and magical spirit of madgenerosity personified merrily in the minds of billions of people as SantaClaus. In fact, each year (during the months when this spirit is at the zenithof its power to possess people) this subjective, intangible spirit is in a veryreal way responsible for the manifestation of an unimaginable number of materialobjects and immeasurable wealth and happiness.But beware! The same letters that spell “Santa” also spell “Satan.” This spiritalso has a dark and evil side. When not properly understood, evoked, andcontrolled he can be a cynical and destructive demon who during his icy seasonroutinely brings gifts of family strife, suffocating debt, regret, depression,and suicide.There are those who agree with the great twentieth- century magician, AleisterCrowley, who wrote in his introduction to Goetia, “The spirits of the Goetia areportions of the human brain.”67While I’m not sure I altogether agree, Mr.Crowley certainly provides us with food for thought. How often have we heardthat humans actually use only a tiny percentage of our brains? Who knows whatgod-like powers we could exercise if we used more of our brains?Imagine that we could divide that unused part of the brain into seventy-twosections (the seventy-two spirits of the Goetia) – each section a livingrepresentative of a specific and unique psychic or intellectual power we arepresently not using (the attributes and powers of the spirit). We assign each ofthose sections a mythological name (i.e., Furfur or Orobas) and a symbol (theseal of the spirit) that we can__________67 Op cit. p. 17.gaze upon during altered states of consciousness (induced by the rituals ofpreparation, the incense, babbling strings of incomprehensible words, etc.)whereby we isolate, activate, and employ that portion of the brain.Instead of thinking of the spirits as portions of physical brain tissue,however, it might be more accurate (and just as practical) to view them asportions of the subconscious mind. As the pioneers of quantum physics aresuggesting and demonstrating, the influence of the mind transcends the tinyconfines of the human cranium and operates on multiple dimensions unencumberedby the limits of time and space. Tinkering with the subconscious mind is in avery real way tinkering with cosmos, and since prehistoric times the peoplewho’ve tinkered with their subconscious minds the most have been calledmagicians.Question #3.The text says that many of the spirits have very odd and archaic powers that Ihave absolutely no interest in. If the spirits are merely portions of my brain(or mind) why on earth would I have a section dedicated to fetching horsesorattaining prelaciesor lightingseeming Candles upon the Graves of the Dead?It will become immediately obvious to the reader that the text is written in anodd and archaic style. There is a simple reason for this. It is an odd andarchaic document. As I mentioned in Chapter Eleven, the original manuscriptsdate from 1697 and represent updated versions of far older material. Even thoughthe world has changed a lot since then our daily lives are in essence remarkablysimilar to our ancestors’. We may not have the need of horses, or church honors,or the power to illuminate graves, but we still need a car, career advancement,and some of us occasionally need the wit and eloquence to write and deliver aeulogy.Selecting the proper spirit to perform the specific task you need is a vitalcomponent of the magical operation. Some are very obvious as in the case of #10,Buer, who is said to healeth all distempers. Others are not so obvious and takea little thought and imagination. Being able to recognize your particularproblem metaphorically expressed as the power to understand birds, or causingtrees to bend at your will is the first step to impressing your subconsciousmind with the essence of the issue you need resolved. A “bird” needn’t be a crowor a canary. It could be a chattering gossip, or a biology test. The power to“bend a tree” may suggest the ability to overcome stiff resistance to your ideasor proposals.Question #4.In the first section of this book you spent a lot of time demonstrating that theOld Testament Patriarchs, David, Solomon and others were not historicalcharacters, yet the Lesser Key of Solomon is filled with references to thesecharacters. Are you asking us to again believe in fables?Yes and no. Of course these Bible characters and stories are myths and fables.But myths and fables come from (and profoundly affect) the deepest strata of thehuman psyche. Most of us are happy to suspend our disbelief for a few hourswithin the dark confines of a movie theatre. That same imaginative ability isthe cornerstone of magic – a powerful tool that most of us use only for sex,entertainment and diversion. If used with skill and understanding, however, itis the perfect tool to help us break out of our present narrow stream ofconsciousness.Recall from Chapter Eleven that I asked you to view these operations not as amagical ceremony but as a psychological exercise – a psychodrama whereby we callforth and isolate previously uncontrolled potentialities within ourselves andredirect their heretofore chaotic energies. The medieval magician didn’t thinkin psychological terms at all. He or she believed quite passionately in the OldTestament God (under a host of names), and the supernatural powers of theBiblical Patriarchs, David and Solomon.In a way this gave the ancient practitioner a decided advantage over the modernpractitioner who must either, a) like a true ‘method actor’ (or a participant ina roll-playing game) find a way to temporarily step out of the rational flow ofconsciousness into the classic magical world with its existing rules andcharacters; or b) somehow create a comparable magical world with a mythologicalhierarchy that personifies his or her understanding and beliefs.Both categories can be equally effective. I personally know several Solomonicmagicians (including the great modern master of Goetic evocation, Poke Runyon68)__________68 Carroll (Poke) Runyon. The Book of Solomon’s Magick. (Pasadena, CA: Church ofthe Hermetic Science, Inc., 1996).who whole-heartedly embrace the art form of the classic Goetic workings. Theyoperate by-the-book and, as much as humanly possible, conform with everyinstruction found in the text. They wear the proper attire, construct and usethe proper magical tools and equipment, observe the proper hours, memorize allthe conjurations and constraints – everything. It offends their sense of art(and after all, magic is an art) if the instructions in the classic text areviolated. It bolsters their magical confidence to know in their hearts they aredoing things just like the ancient practitioners. Doing this is the yoga – theZen of their art.Personally, I fall more easily into category b. My sense of art is not at alloffended by amending or discarding portions of the classic text. While I takepains to conform to the basic formula and follow the order of ceremony of theclassic system, I’ve customized everything else to harmonize with my ownspiritual worldview. With a little thought anyone else can do the same.Question #5.Under what circumstances is it appropriate to evoke a spirit?Ultimately, only the individual magician can determine when it is or is notappropriate to use Solomonic magic to evoke a spirit. However, my experience ofwhat has and has not worked for me in the past leads me to make the followingobservations:First, you must have a problem – a real problem. But before enlisting the aid ofspirit to resolve the problem, you must have done everything in your power totake care of the matter by regular means on the physical plane. That’s magictoo. If your neighbor’s thoughtless midnight tuba playing is ruining your sleep,your health, and your ability to stay awake at work – if you’ve asked him tostop – if you’ve called the police and they didn’t help – if you’ve tried toenlist the help of other neighbors – if you’ve marched next door and punched theinconsiderate idiot in his tuba-tooting lip – if you’ve tried everything righthere on earth – then maybe it is time to at least consider a magical remedy.However, if you haven’t exhausted all other measures it would be cowardly andunwise to magically tinker with your precious subconscious mind just to forcesome poor spirit to do your dirty work.Secondly, the problem you wish resolved must be a personal matter. You can’t domagic for someone else. When you formally evoke a spirit you are evoking anadventure. Adventures are not always pleasant and sometimes dangerous, evendeadly. At the conclusion of the adventure, however, if you survive, you’llemerge from the experience a better, wiser, braver, cooler person. No one elsecan take your adventure for you and you cannot take the adventure for someoneelse. Therefore, your reasons for evoking a spirit must be entirely personal.You wouldn’t expect to reap the benefits of psychotherapy by sending someoneelse to replace you on the analyst’s couch.Thirdly, you must feel totally justified in doing what you are about to do. Youmust have a deep emotional involvement in the matter you wish resolved. If youaren’t convinced of your motive – if you aren’t reaching to the very bottom ofthe visceral ‘hell’ of your frustration – your anger, then you are not touchingthe level of consciousness where these beasties exist.Furthermore, once you have evoked it into the Triangle you must be able toconsider the spirit the personification of your problem (for in essence that iswhat it is). You have every reason to be mad at it. The spirit is your problem.It’s always been your problem. For the first time in your life you have isolatedit and can now focus the full force of your righteous anger and indignation –not at your spouse, not at your boss, not at your kids, or your dog, or thegovernment– but at the real source of your problem. It has to listen to you so you betterknow what you want to tell it. It’s either going to shape up and do what youcommand or you are going to annihilate it.My last little word of advice is: “Don’t make deals with the spirit.” In a veryreal way you’ve been unconsciously making deals with the spirit your whole life.That’s why you have your problem. The whole ceremony is your formal way ofbranding your subconscious mind with the idea that you are through making dealswith this tangled piece of ignorance, flawed perception, fear, vice, oraddiction, (take your pick they’re all demons).Do you see the plot of this psychodrama? Do you see the method to the madness?Once you’ve voluntarily reprogrammed your subconscious mind with a traumaticlittle experience like this you become in essence a different person. Differentthings start happening to you when you become a different person. If all goeswell one of those things will be the solution to your problem.Question #6.All these lengthy and verbose conjurations, constraints, and curses – Do I haveto memorize and recite them? What purpose do they serve?Obviously, in order to get yourself in a ‘place’ where the idea of talking to aspirit seems like a perfectly normal thing to do, you must ‘be’ in an alteredstate of consciousness. There are lots of ways to induce altered statesincluding the use of psychoactive chemicals, plants, and herbs. While thesesubstances have always had their place in the mystical life of human beings, tothe disappointment of many they do not mix well with this kind of magic. Theproblem stems from the fact that it is very easy to induce an altered state ofconsciousness by ingesting drugs, it is difficult (if not impossible) to returnto objective consciousness at the precise moment in the ceremony when it isvitally important that you do so. This can be a very dangerous situation inwhich to find oneself. The traditional methods may be less colorful andglamorous (and I mean ‘glamorous’ in the most magical sense of the term), butthey are safer and far more predictable than drugs.In the same way the modern devotee of Transcendental Meditation repeats a mantrain order to step out of the stream of everyday consciousness, the ancientmagician (and the modern Solomonic purist) memorized and recited page upon pageof conjurations filled with strings of strange sounding names and magic words.Curiously, these words don’t necessarily have to mean anything – in fact, themore corrupt and meaningless the words are the more effective they are intriggering the desired effect upon the magician’s consciousness. Eventually, thetedium (even the absurdity of what one is doing) causes the mind to rebel andslip into the desired “space.”In my opinion the modern magician is better served by composing his or her owncustomized conjuration (or conjurations). For me it is unduly distracting toengage in name dropping of Bible characters I know never existed and deities Idon’t worship. In either case, the most important element of the conjurationcomes at the very beginning where the magician, like the legendary Solomon,affirms his or her connection with Supreme Deity. This is the moment when weconsciously insert ourselves in the spiritual hierarchy of the cosmos.Question #7.In answer to question #3 you said that you conform to the basic formula andfollow the order of ceremony of the classic system. Can you outline the basicformula and order of operation?The best way for you to determine for yourself what the basic formula and orderof ceremony is to first acquaint yourself with the following excerpts from theLesser Key of Solomon. Then, if you are passionate enough to explore this kindof magic, acquaint yourself with the full text and other material currentlyavailable (see Bibliography).Below is an outline of my basic operating procedure:Motive and JustificationBefore I begin I ask myself:1). Do I truly have a good reason to raise the spirit? 2). Do I feel absolutelyjustified in doing so? 3). Do I have a sufficient emotional tie to the objectof the operation?4). Is it my unambiguous will to succeed in theoperation?5). Do I have the courage to plumb the depths of mysubconscious ‘hell’ to achieve my ends?Preparation of Temple1). In a clean, uncluttered room, I draw, tape, orotherwise create a Circle approximately nine feet in diameter. Just inside theperimeter of the Circle, I write (or placeplacards displaying) divine names sacred to me.2). About three feet east of the circle, I draw, tape orotherwise create a Triangle, each side measuring two anda half feet. Upon the sides of the Triangle I write (or placeplacards displaying) words of power sacred to me. 3). Inside the Triangle, Idraw, tape, or otherwise create a circle. In the center of the circle within theTriangle,I place an incense burner, incense, and a paper copy of theseal of the spirit I intend to evoke.Preparation of the Magician1). Prior to the ceremony I quietly bathe with thefull intention of cleansing my body in preparation for thisserious work.2). I put on a clean magical robe or insignia representative of my initiatorygrade.3). I pin to my magical robe a cloth patch or paperbearing the image of the Hexagram of Solomon (representing my connection to theSupreme Consciousness). 4). I arm myself with my magic wand, and placearound my neck a medallion displaying the spirit’s seal onone side and the Pentagram of Solomon on the reverse (representing among otherthings my connection to the spirit). Ishow both sides to the spirit upon its arrival.Preliminary Ceremony1). I remove my footwear and enter the Circle.2). I ceremonially cleanse the Circle by sprinkling clean water in the east,south, west, and north.3). I ceremonially consecrate and bless the Circle by elevating a lit candle inthe east, south, west, and north.4). I formally banish the Temple by performing a banishing ceremony with which Iam familiar. (Banishing rituals can be found in any elementary work on modernmagic.) 695). I then pause and pray. That is, I quietly center myself and with willfulintent make contact with the highest consciousness I am capable of imagining. Ivisualize myself in the presence of this Supreme Intelligence and when thevisualization is strong I invoke that presence into myself so that I feel thatI’m a perfect reflection of Deity. This is__________69Lon Milo DuQuette, Tarot of Ceremonial Magick. (York Beach, ME: Weiser Books,1995). pp. 215 – 217.Solomon’s Secret, and the ceremony should not proceed until this invocation isachieved.The Evocation1). From this exalted state of mind I focus my attention on the Triangle and begin my conjuration. (My conjuration is a combinationof phrases from the classic text, myown compositions, ‘barbarous words of evocation’ foundin other material, and certain ‘Calls” in the angelic tongueknown as Enochian.) I repeat the conjuration as many timesas necessary to achieve (what I can only describe as) an irrational state ofconsciousness.2). I continue until the spirit ‘appears.’ (Please notethat for me the spirit seldom appears to my physical eyes. Itspresence is nonetheless unambiguously felt. The sensationof the spirit’s presence is often so tangible that the noviceoften becomes stunned and looses sight of the purpose ofthe operation.)3). Even though I consider the spirit to be the causeof my problem, I nonetheless remember it is also the keyto the solution. I greet the spirit with cool courtesy upon itsarrival.4). I firmly, yet politely, give it a specific, wellthought-out charge, anddemand a positive answer fromthe spirit that it agrees to perform what I demand. Duringthe ceremony I resist any temptation to amend or otherwisecompromise my original demands. (Such thoughts that ariseduring the ceremony are the spirit’s desperate attempt tostrike a compromise. The evocation is a formal statementthat from now on there’ll be no more of that!)5). Before dismissing it, I remind the spirit that it isnow my servant and that if it serves me well, I will see it israised in spiritual status even as I am raised. However, if itdoes not serve me well, I will have not any compunctionabout conjuring it once again, burning its seal and utterlyannihilating it.6). I then give it license to depart, being careful tostipulate that it carry out my orders without harm to me, myloved ones, or any entity living or abstract for whom I holdaffection or goodwill.7). Finally, I banish the Temple as in the beginning,and wait until such time as I cannot feel any residue of thespirit’s presence.After the Ceremony1). I do everything I can to ‘snap out of it’ and returnto everyday objective consciousness. (This is why drugs are ahorrible idea!) If I can’t shake the ‘spooky’ feeling, I banishagain, and again, until I do.2). I break down the Temple and put everythingback in their sacred little containers, including the spirit’sseal that was in the Triangle, which I place in a special boxthat no one else should ever touch.3). While the experience is still fresh in my mind, Isit down and write a detailed record of the operation in mydiary.Did it work?The charge to the spirit should have been so worded that I know within aspecified time period whether or not the spirit is doing its job. Failure of thespirit to perform as promised requires that I evoke it again and issue a threat.Failing again, I re-evoke and torment the spirit in the firebox. Failing again,I re-evoke for the purpose of destroying the seal and the spirit completely.One shouldn’t feel too discouraged if the operation at first appears to be acomplete failure. Maybe you don’t get your sweetheart – maybe you don’t win thelottery. The hell you put yourself through as you wrestle and curse and torturethe spirit to comply with your orders is a spiritual adventure par excellent andwill teach you things about yourself you never knew before – things you mightnot be comfortable knowing – things you might want to change – and you will havedone it all in the privacy of your own home, without having to abuse,traumatize, or destroy anything more sensitive than a scrap of paper.Critics of Goetia warn that this kind of magic brings out the worst us. They areabsolutely correct – but that’s exactly what it is supposed to do – bring outthe worst in us so we, like Solomon, may either make it better or expunge itfrom our lives. I hope that by familiarizing yourself with how the ancientmagician went about this work you will understand how to apply the formula ofSolomon’s Key to your own spiritual quest.[../images/00025.gif]The Demon Belial before King Solomon.
