There is something primeval andmammalian about being born and raised in one part of the world, then travelingto some strange and exotic land to fall in love and find a mate. Indeed, manyclassic fairy tales tell of a wandering prince who wins his dream princess in aforeign land.Obviously, I’m not a prince, and Nebraska isn’t exactly strange or exotic; butfor a seven-year-old boy (rudely uprooted from his home in sunny SouthernCalifornia), the “Cornhusker State” in 1956 was a grotesque nightmare. I feltlike a shell-shocked war refugee—cruelly banished from my beachfront homelandand exiled to a dusty, chigger-infested wilderness populated by coarsebarbarians who didn’t trim the fat off their ham sandwiches, considered Jell-Owith a dollop of mayonnaise to be “salad,” and for some strange reason calledlunch “dinner.”I languished for a full decade in small-town Nebraska, fantasizing that I’d berescued by a flying saucer and plotting my escape back to the hip and trendyland of my birth. At night I dreamed I smelled the beach; I actually tasted thesalt of the ocean on my dream tongue. Throughout my decade of Nebraska exile,California grew in my imagination into a mythical Ithaca. But unlike the heroOdysseus, I had no queen waiting for me on the golden shores of my lost kingdom.For that illusive treasure I would need to grow up and find a Nebraska woman.Perhaps it is because Nebraska breeds a very special woman—the kind of woman whostoically endures some of the most brutal winters on earth for months on endwhen bitter arctic winds blast down from Canada and sweep through the Dakotasfoiled by nothing higher than prairie grass; the kind of woman who, when themercury tops a humid 110 degrees, will wash her hair in the kitchen sink andblithely brush it dry on the back porch; the kind of woman who, without blinkingan eye, will lance a boil, stanch a bleeding wound, or gut a fish; the kind ofwoman who will, with firm and loving hands, tenderly end the life of a sufferingdog or cat.Despite all the cruelties and hardships this land inflicts upon them, theseremarkable women love Nebraska. If destiny conspires to pluck them up and carrythem off to faraway places, their hearts remain rooted in the thick, black loamof the prairie. They pine for that terrible and beautiful place like lovesickmaidens who never recover from an adolescent romance. The change of seasonspulls their hearts back to the awesome land that wooed them so roughly. Like themajestic sandhill cranes, their souls migrate year after year back to the crueland fragrant Eden of the Platte River Valley—a world the Pawnees called the“happy hunting grounds.”DuQuette men must be a lot like Nebraska, for it takes a Nebraska woman to loveus, to endure us, to inexplicably draw strength from our brash insensitivity andother unmanly DuQuette virtues a lesser woman might mistake for self-absorbedstupidity.In 1966, my Nebraska odyssey ended. I returned to California immediately afterhigh school graduation and began classes at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.College life in Southern California in 1966–67 was a very rich and colorfulexperience, little of which had anything to do with academics. The popularity ofmind-expanding drugs and the social and political upheavals of the day(triggered by the Civil Rights movement and the war in Vietnam) were far moreinteresting to me than my English and drama classes. I was profoundly affectedby my experiences with LSD and soon began to seriously turn my attention to thestudy and practice of Eastern mysticism, especially Hindu philosophy and yoga.My brother, Marc, was my mystical fellow traveler on most of these psychedelicjourneys. He would often volunteer to be my sane and sober babysitter and“guide” while I “tripped.” I, on alternate occasions, would do the same for him.The experiences were spiritual journeys we took very seriously, and the deeperwe plunged into the depths of our own psyches, the more we knew thatself-realization was the most important thing a human being can achieve duringhis or her time on earth.One afternoon, the day before a full moon, we decided to drive out to the desertand take a massive dose of LSD together. We watched the full moon set in thewest and the sun rise in the east. We vowed we would not return from the desert“until we were holy men.” I wrote about this event at greater length in anearlier autobiography,1 so I won’t bore you with the details here. I will,instead, jump to the quiet moments a few hours after that eternal day in thedesert.We managed to drive safely back to Costa Mesa late in the afternoon. We werestill quite high but confident enough in our ability to “maintain” in public tovisit our favorite tavern. It was there, sitting on the most comfortablebarstool in the universe, my acid-soaked brain still soaring through therarefied clouds of Technicolor consciousness, that I realized I would beincapable of safely controlling the awesome and terrible nuclear fusion ofconsciousness that was taking place in my cranium. I started to see the bigpicture. If I were to continue my incarnational adventure, I would needsomething, someone, to ground me, to anchor me, to hold my feet to the groundbefore I exploded spectacularly (but prematurely) on the launch pad of life.I needed a Nebraska woman.I had dated Constance on and off during our junior and senior years of highschool in Nebraska, and when I returned to California we kept in touch byold-fashioned letters. We were friends. She liked my progressive politics. Iliked her hair. We’d certainly never discussed marriage. But now I could notimagine a future without her. More accurately, I saw quite clearly that therewasn’t a future without her. Perched high upon the oracular tripod of mypsychedelic barstool, I saw the future set in stone, as fixed and immutable asthe past.I called her from the payphone near the pinball machine and proposed marriage.To this day I really can’t tell you why I asked, and to this day she doesn’tknow why she said yes. But, like a traditional Hindu couple whose parents sealedthe marriage contract when they were babies, we dutifully surrendered to ourdestinies then and there.We’ve been married for forty-seven years. Neither one of us can tell you exactlywhy.Do we love each other? Yes, of course we love each other. Are we happy? Well …sometimes yes, sometimes no. But at least we’ve grown wise enough to realizethat ultimately one person can never make another person happy, and even if wecould, love is bigger than happiness. Each individual in this world, whethermarried or single, is responsible for his or her own condition of happiness orunhappiness.What does all this have to do with homemade magick? My answer is simple. Theedifice of my life—my home, my work, my magick—is built upon a foundation thatis the love, the support, the opposition, the criticism, the irritation, thewisdom, and the ruthless condemnation of this Nebraska maid. Constance is asupernatural force of nature—an awesome and terrible magical being, a goddess, adevil, an angel, a harpy, a demon. She is also the archetypal wife, mother, andgrandmother, but greater than all these things she is her own unique universe.She is, in every relevant sense of the term, a living saint.2Take it from me: it’s not easy being the mortal husband of a saint. Any envy youmight feel for me and my extraordinarily good matrimonial fortune must betempered by an outpouring of pity, for even though I am blessed with many uniqueand admirable qualities, I am not a saint. It’s important that you remainmindful of this cruel irony as I attempt to relate a few of our familyadventures in the pages of this book.Constance and I took no vows to each other during our homemade wedding ceremonyof so long ago. We promised each other nothing. Nonetheless, for overforty-seven years, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, this Nebraskamaid has been and remains the home in my homemade magick.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]1.

It’s a bitmisleading, because ultimately all magick is an intensely personal endeavor—bydefinition homemade. Of course, a person can be formally trained (or at leasteducated) in one or more of the classic magical systems, such as qabalistic,Wiccan, Druidic, Native American, Solomonic, Enochian, etc., or one can be partof a highly structured and formally structured magical group or mystery school,such as a coven or a lodge of esoteric Masons, the Golden Dawn, Servants of theLight, or Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). One might even be lucky enough to beprivately tutored by an experienced and illuminated magical adept. But asmagicians—indeed, as human beings—we have only one universe in which to work,and only one universe with which to work. That universe is ourselves.No matter what your circumstances may be, when it comes time to perform realmagick, your magick can only be executed by, for, and through the agency of youalone. The most I can hope to accomplish in writing a book of this nature is toshare a few scattered accounts of my own life and magical career and encourageyou to consider how my experiences might best be translated and applied to theunique circumstances of your own life. To that end, I think it would be helpfulif I started by giving you a quick review of my background and current magicalmilieu.I was born on July 11, 1948, in Long Beach, California.3 I moved with my parentsand older brother to Columbus, Nebraska, in 1956 and returned to SouthernCalifornia after high school graduation in 1966. I became a professionalmusician at the age of fourteen and made my living as a songwriter and recordingartist through my mid-twenties.I have been married to Constance since 1967. We have one son, Jean-Paul, who isa university professor in Japan. I speak English and only the tiniest fragmentsof French and Spanish. This means that my entire education, magical andotherwise, has been acquired from texts written in or translated into theEnglish language. I quit college (I was pretending to be a drama major) afteronly one year and studied acting for a short time at the Lee Strasberg Theatreand Film Institute in Hollywood. I hold no academic degrees.A series of psychedelically triggered mystical experiences in 1966 through 1971led me to seek preliminary yoga instruction, and I also dabbled in variousmeditation techniques and practices of Eastern mysticism at ParamahansaYogananda’s Self-Realization Fellowship and the Vedanta Society. From 1971 to1975, I studied (via correspondence-course instruction) aspects of the Westernmystery traditions, through the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC),4 the Builders of theAdytum (B.O.T.A),5 and the Traditional Martinist Order (TMO).6Around this time, I became passionately interested in the written works ofAleister Crowley. In 1975 I met Grady Louis McMurtry (aka Hymenaeus Alpha, 777)and his then wife, Phyllis Seckler McMurtry (aka Soror Meral), who initiated meinto two of Crowley’s magical organizations, Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) andA∴A∴ Before Crowley’s death in 1947, the McMurtrys had both been disciples ofCrowley. Grady had received O.T.O.’s highest initiatory degree directly fromCrowley in England, and Phyllis had been the personal student of Crowley’sacolyte Jane Wolfe. The McMurtrys, in turn, introduced me to Francis (Israel)Regardie, former secretary to Crowley and a celebrated occult author in his ownright.In 1976 I was passed into the next degree in O.T.O. in Dublin, California.Assisting the McMurtrys with this ceremony was Helen Parsons-Smith, anotherCrowley contemporary and the widow of both Wilfred T. Smith (former O.T.O. NorthAmerican Grand Master) and John Whiteside (Jack) Parsons. Parsons had been aneminent rocket scientist, a developer of jet-powered take-off and solid rocketfuel. He was one of the founding members of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, theforerunner of NASA. This brilliant magician/scientist was posthumously honoredby the space agency for his contributions to the program by having a crater onthe Moon named for him.In 1978 I was authorized by Grady McMurtry to establish and operate a lodge ofO.T.O. in Southern California, and I remain its Lodge Master to this day. In1996 I was appointed U.S. National Deputy Grand Master of O.T.O. by McMurtry’ssuccessor, Hymenaeus Beta.003.jpg [image/003_fmt.png]In January of 1978, the DuQuette family played host to the head of theO.T.O.—Caliph Hymenaeus Alpha, 777, IX° (Grady L. McMurtry)—at our home in CostaMesa, California. This picture was snapped just prior to Grady signing our lodgecharter and officiating at our first round of initiations. We have always runthe lodge out of our home, and remain the oldest continually operating O.T.O.lodge in the world.I first met McMurtry on November 14, 1975, just one day before he initiated meinto the Minerval Degree (0°) of O.T.O. in the garage temple of his home (andthe home of his then wife, Phyllis Seckler McMurtry) in Dublin, California.Constance was initiated Minerval in the backyard of the same Dublin residence afew months later.Twelve years after this picture was taken, Constance and I had the pleasure ofinitiating our son, Jean-Paul (pictured here at the age of five), on theoccasion of his eighteenth birthday in the backyard of our home in Costa Mesa._____Throughout the years I have supported myself and my family in a number of ways.I was a singer-songwriter and recording artist 7 in the late 1960s and early1970s and afterward held a string of low-paying positions in manufacturing,property management, and advertising, all of which allowed me quite a bit offlexibility to pursue my personal magical studies and practices.In 1988 Constance and I initiated Dr. Christopher S. Hyatt into our O.T.O.lodge, and over the next few years he and I collaborated on a number of writingprojects that opened up an exciting new chapter in my magical and professionallife.So there you have it. In the last forty years, my homemade magical career hasincluded a lot of work with various spiritual disciplines and systems,instructors, and magical orders. I will be the first to admit that I have beenvery lucky, and my experiences are most likely very different from your own. Butyou would be gravely mistaken if you believed that because my life andbackground are in some ways different from yours, it means you are somehow at adisadvantage in your work as a magician.Like it or not, the cards you’ve been dealt in life make up exactly the hand youneed to play. To be a magician, you do not need to be the personal student of anadept, and you do not need to belong to any magical order or society. You areand always will be your own universe. You are a homemade magick school with oneteacher and one student. You are an entire mystic order of one. And even ifsomeday you happen to come under the tutelage of some great master, even if youjoin and become an adept of a powerful occult order, you will still be facingexactly the same obstacles and challenges you are facing right now; you willstill be required to do all the magick yourself; you will remain forever asolitary practitioner.This is not to say that all of us are not influenced and affected by others, orthat our actions, thoughts, and behavior don’t affect our environment. If otherpeople are healed or gain a level of enlightenment as a byproduct of yourself-realization and self-transformation, that’s great. But ultimately you are asolo act; and your temple, your workshop, your laboratory, and your universe areyour own body, your own brain, your own soul.Doing magick is not what magick is about. The goal in magick is to be amagician. The only thing the magician can actually change with magick is themagician. This book is intended to be helpful and instructive, but you’ll beneither helped nor instructed if you think you can accomplish the Great Work byblindly replicating magical operations exactly as described by me or anyoneelse. That’s not how it works.Magick is a process—a step-by-step journey of self-directed, self-willedpersonal evolution. That process must take place within the context of whateveropportunities, liabilities, assets, obstacles, restrictions, and fortunes (goodor ill) your life circumstances have given you and those that you make foryourself.You might be single or married, or your relationship status might becomplicated. You might have children. You might have a corporate or professionaljob, or you might be an artist or a musician. You might be employed, unemployed,or retired. You might be independently wealthy or a penniless ascetic. You mightbe socially and politically conservative or liberal. Your circumstances mighteven be such that you have to keep your magical interests a secret from everyonearound you, or you might be able to burst madly out of the wizard’s closet inpublic.Whatever your situation, once you realize you are a magician, it will beimpossible for you to remove the magick from any aspect of your existence. Whatyou do for a living will no longer be just a job, it will be a magick job. Yourrelationships will be with magical beings. Your hobbies will be magick, and yourlove life will be magick. Your likes, dislikes, fears, dreams, ambitions, andeven shortcomings and vices will be magick. It’s all magick because you neverstop being a magician.002.jpg [image/002_fmt.png]The DuQuette magical family unit, Costa Mesa, California, c. 1975: Lon (Papa),Constance (Mama), Jean-Paul (our “Little Buddha”), and Shep (dog)._____In this book, I will share a few examples of how I’ve made the magical arts anintegral facet of my life. But in addition to that (and even more importantly),I will try to offer you a few glimpses of how a magician interprets each andevery seemingly mundane and un-magical event of everyday life as the magicaladventure it truly is. I hope that you will be able to somehow apply my examplesto the unique circumstances of your own life.Your homemade magical adventure begins when you first wake up to the fact thatyou are quite literally asleep. We will all wake up eventually, but whatdifferentiates magicians from our sleepy neighbors is that we are ready andwilling to jump-start the waking-up process.

Alice replied, rathershyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I WAS when Igot up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sincethen.”Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, ch. 5Every journey has a destination, every journey has a path or paths to thatdestination, and every journey has obstacles and challenges along the way.For magicians, our destination is supreme enlightenment (union and absoluteintegration) with the Supreme Intelligence of the cosmos—complete identity withthe universal consciousness.The path is (at least for a little while) the magical arts and disciplines.The obstacles and challenges on the path are all our shortcomings, characterflaws, vices, bad habits, fears, imbalances, misperceptions, and personal demonsthat are currently distracting us and preventing us from waking up from thedreamworld of un-enlightenment.Before we can even discuss the destination or the path or the obstacles,however, we need to identify just who it is that will be taking this journey. Weneed a traveler, a sojourner, a hero, someone to experience the trip. Thejourney needs you. It sounds simple enough, but it really isn’t. Who you are (orwho you think you are) is vitally important. Allow me to digress for a moment.Constance and I were very young when we first started living together. She wasnineteen years old and I was eighteen. (Yes, she’s almost six months older thanI.) From the very beginning of our relationship, we identified ourselves asspiritual adventurers, cosmic gypsies, who had once again incarnated to pick upwhere we left off … to continue our quest and take the next step towardenlightenment. Admittedly, we were romantic and naive. But we were alsospiritually audacious, and we delighted in our explorations of what were for usexotic foreign religions and cultures. We enjoyed fantasizing about our previousincarnations. We playfully identified ourselves as our own homemade mythologicalcharacters on a timeless quest. We assumed whimsical Native American names(Sleeping Bear and Smiling Squirrel—guess which one I was) and speculated aboutmedieval lives as court jester and scullery maid, or Mandarin lord and youngestwife.We hand-painted bizarre (and patently offensive) anti-Christmas cards and mailedthem to our clueless and easily shocked relatives, and when-ever possible wewore our new and colorful mystical opinions and personas on our sleeves.As sophomoric and silly as these fanciful lovers’ games were, they taught us howto begin discovering who we are. They served to seriously establish andformulate our magical identities and train our imaginations.Constance and I were fortunate that our youth and silliness allowed us to fallquite naturally into the spirit of the game of magical self-identification. Forothers, it might take a little more effort. No matter what your age, background,or circumstances, the process must begin by asking yourself, “Who am I?”So … who are you?Don’t answer with your name, because you know darn well that’s not who you are.Don’t try to avoid this question, because it’s a big one. Unless you can come upwith some kind of answer to this question, there won’t be a magician to work themagick.Well, who are you?Traditionally, the phrase “Know thyself” was chiseled in stone above thethreshold of the temples of the ancient mysteries. That sounds like wise andserious advice, doesn’t it? But think about it: the chances of you truly knowingyourself anytime soon are slim to none!Know thyself? Give me a break! Even though those words represent the first pieceof advice you get at the beginning of your magical career, the cold hard factremains that true self-realization is likely to be the very last thing that’sever going to happen to you. Who and what you really are will be the finalrevelation in life’s great mystery play—the last tiny bit of information your(by then) near-infinitely expanded consciousness will process in the blindingmicro-seconds just before you ecstatically sizzle into pure undifferentiatedGodhead—6106.png [image/6106.png]But if you don’t know who or what you are, there obviously can’t be a you totake the journey. There is no you to choose the destination, no you to find thepath, no you to overcome the obstacles, no you for the magical universe totorture and delight and broaden and purify and perfect, no hook of a you uponwhich to hang the great adventure of your destiny.But don’t worry. There is a real you in there somewhere, and even though youcurrently don’t have a clue about who or what you are, the discovery process hasto begin somewhere! You begin by first pretending you know who you are.Yes, like everything else in life, you are going to have to fake it till youmake it! There’s no other way to start. Sound silly? Sound irrational? Soundinsane? Sound like cheating? Welcome to the world of homemade magick! No need towait for a guru, or a magical mentor, or some lofty adept, or a high priest orpriestess, or some mysterious secret-society hierophant to initiate you. Youjust have to haul off and do it yourself.Go ahead! Roll up the sleeves on your magical robe and start faking it till youmake it. Start right now by pretending you know who you are! It’s easy. Youbegin by renaming yourself, by giving yourself a new homemade identity—a magicalmotto.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]"},{"pageContent":"twoYour HomemadeMagical MottoHalt! Who goes there?There’s no time like the present. (That’s more than a cliché, it’s acosmological fact!) It’s time to give yourself a magical motto. But before yougo changing things, I want you to first take a moment to appreciate the magickof your given name, because in actuality it is your first and most powerfulmagical motto.I’m lucky. I like my name. Right up until the time my father died, he insistedthat I never change or even alter the spelling of my name. As a child Icomplained to him about “Lon Milo” being so weird and different. “You have amagic name,” he insisted. “Don’t ever change it. Don’t even change the spellingor capitalization.” Dad certainly wasn’t a qabalist or mystic, so I’m not surehow he was defining the word magic, but he was very serious and insistent.Your given name is profoundly magical. Your name is the magical incantation thatevokes you! Think about it. The sound of your own name brings you alive to theawareness of yourself. When you are in a public place or a room full of peopleand you hear your name being called, what happens in your mind?“Here I am,” you say in your soul. You remember you are you! You identifyyourself to yourself. You acknowledge your presence, your life, your existence.The sound of your own name wakes you up, and that’s precisely what a magicalmotto should do.If you already have a magical motto, you might consider coming up with a newone. Go ahead. Don’t be shy. Think about renaming yourself. Make it somethingthat sounds cool and perhaps even a little pretentious. The best magical mottois a word or phrase that represents your current understanding of the universeand reality, or expresses the loftiest goals and aspirations you have right atthis moment in your spiritual evolution. As time passes and you grow wiser andmore insightful, you will most likely want to trade in the old motto and choosea new and improved one—one that more accurately reflects your increased level ofenlightenment (not to mention your expanding capacity for pretense).So, are you ready to start pretending you know who you are?Then get serious (or very silly) for a moment and think of the absolute highestspiritual concept or aspiration you can dream up. It doesn’t have to be short.Go ahead and name yourself Frater “All the Power in the Universe Is Inside MyHead” (A.T.P.I.T.U.I.I.M.H.), or Soror “The Archangels Grovel and Bow Down to MyAwesome Coolness” (T.A.G.A.B.D.T.M.A.C.), or Frater “I Don’t Care What You ThinkAbout My Tie I’m Going to Wear It” (I.D.C.W.Y.T.A.M.T.I.G.T.W.I.).You’ll probably want to choose something less silly than these examples, butdon’t worry about it sounding too audacious, corny, or pretentious, becausechances are, anything you think of right now will be profoundly inadequate. Forthe time being, however, you just have to be temporarily comfortable withidentifying yourself with that word or statement. Just pick a motto and stickwith it until you outgrow it.I can always tell when Constance has changed her motto. A new little signappears suddenly in the kitchen on the altar of our refrigerator door. Her firstmotto was Beauty, Growth, Balance. A few years later she became Sister So What!For years after that she simply identified with the prime number 83 because ofsomething she read in an Aleister Crowley essay on numbers, where he wrote: “83:Consecration: love in its highest form: energy, freedom, amrita, aspiration. Theroot of the idea of romance plus religion.” 8022%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell.jpg [image/022creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]Our refrigerator altar. Most everyone decorates the refrigerator door.Constance’s choice of objects includes her past and present magical mottos andsacred images and aphorisms._____Fruitless Love and Aimless Toil was the next motto to appear on the refrigeratordoor, followed a couple years later by the disturbingly profound (and oddlycapitalized) statement iAM FINISHED. Presently she is Glory to God.My first attempt at a magical motto wasn’t a motto at all but a number. Myfather’s admonition to never change my name got me thinking about the qabalisticvirtues inherent in the letters of my own name. I converted the letters intotheir Hebrew equivalents using a chart I created similar to this:A1N50B2O70, 6C8, 20, 300P80D4Q100E5R200F6Sh, S300, 60G3Th, T, Tz400, 9, 90H5U6I10V6J10W6K20X90L30Y10M40Z90L=21594.png [image/21594.png]=30O=21595.png [image/21595.png]=70N=21596.png [image/21596.png]=50M=21597.png [image/21597.png]=40I=21598.png [image/21598.png]=10L=21599.png [image/21599.png]=30O=21600.png [image/21600.png]=70D=21601.png [image/21601.png]=4U=21602.png [image/21602.png]=6Q=21603.png [image/21603.png]=100U=21604.png [image/21604.png]=6E=21605.png [image/21605.png]=5T=21606.png [image/21606.png]=9T=21607.png [image/21607.png]=9E=21608.png [image/21608.png]=5444There are other ways to use Hebrew letters to spell out “Lon Milo DuQuette,” butto me, this was the simplest and most straightforward rendering of the name. Iwas absolutely thrilled that my magick name added up to such a cool-lookingnumber. (It was like a poor man’s 666!) I consulted a table of importantqabalistic words and their number equivalents and, to my disappointment,discovered that 444 was not a number to get too excited about. Multiples of 111are always nice, and there are many ways to play with 444 that generate materialto meditate on, but the most important thing I got out of the whole exercise wasa certain sense of identity and the simple realization that it was “my” numberand one of the reasons my name (and my life) was magical. It is the reason thatI’ve always used my full name on anything and everything I publish. It is mystage name when I perform and my artist name when I record.I chose my first formal magical motto in 1976 on the occasion of my reception asan A∴A∴ Probationer under the mentorship of Phyllis Seckler McMurtry. I chosefor my motto a phrase that incorporated the initials of my name, L.M.D. I chosethe three words “Liberty. Mastery. Dignity.” To further abet my magicalpretensions, I thought it would be extra elegant if I said it in French:Liberté. Maîtrise. Dignité. LMD is also the full spelling of the Hebrew letterLamed 21592.png [image/21592.png],9 which is traditionally assigned to the Tarottrump Justice. I felt my life could use the balance and discrimination that cardrepresents.One year later, when it came time for me to advance to the grade of Neophyte, Ihad grown more thoughtful (and a little less pompous). The ordeals andchallenges of my probationary year had humbled me a bit, and my quest had becomeseriously personal and almost painfully simple. In what was becoming for me anincreasingly complex universe, I realized that my only refuge, my only defenseand protection, my only hope for survival, my only hope for eventualself-mastery, rested on my ability to make and keep my spiritual aspirations asinnocent and pure as possible. I chose the motto “Purity of Aspiration.” Again,I rendered the phrase in French: Pureté de l’aspiration.My subsequent mottos were Hoathe IAIADA, “True Worshipper of the Highest” in theEnochian Angelic language. Perhaps my favorite motto, and one that I thoughtmight last me for the duration of this incarnation, was Adeo Sat Bene, Latin for“So far so good.” Two years ago I accepted a new motto, “Only Love Is.”Nostalgically I returned to French, Seul l’amour est.Before we go any further, I would like you to pause now and settle the matter ofyour magical motto. If you already have a motto, fine. If you don’t, I want youto create one right now. I’ll wait …Got it? Good!Now, I want you to use your new motto to formally give birth to yourself as ahomemade magician. I’m serious. Do you think you can become a magician just byreading about it? No. You actually have to do stuff yourself, stuff that nobodyelse can do for you. Sorry. This is your show. In order to give birth toyourself, you need to be your own mother, father, midwife, and baby. So please,listen up!To illustrate their condition of spiritual blindness, candidates for initiationare (or at least have been since time immemorial) first blindfolded (hoodwinked)and bound hand and foot at the beginning of the ceremony. This is obviously adisturbing and uncomfortable position to find oneself in, and that’s exactly whyit’s done. It’s supposed to be disturbing and uncomfortable.Before initiation, we dwell in the darkness, blind to the light of the greaterreality that is enjoyed by the more spiritually enlightened. The candidate isunable to move forward effectively in this blind and ignorant state, unable tohelp himself or herself (let alone others) while in this sorry condition. As theceremony proceeds, the bound and hoodwinked candidate “travels” (is led around)the temple or lodge room and is “taught” certain lessons. Eventually, as thecandidate grows in knowledge and wisdom, the fetters are gradually removed. Theclimax of this part of the initiation ceremony is when the hoodwink is removedand the candidate is “brought to Light.” But before this supreme moment, thecandidate must first take an oath.It is a scary thing being obliged to take a solemn oath in a ceremony like this.After all, you are making some very serious promises to people you can’t evensee while being tied up and completely at their mercy. In a temple or lodge roomceremony, the candidate must do a little soul-searching. Pragmatically, it isclear that unless he or she goes ahead and takes the oath, the initiation willnot continue. The blindfold will stay on, and he or she will be removed from theinitiation chamber and sent back into the outer darkness. Almost always thecandidate dutifully proceeds to repeat the oath (no matter how it is worded),because in truth he or she is mildly confident that nothing too bad will happen.Unless you’ve read ahead in this book, you’re not sure exactly what you’re goingto promise in the oath you’re about to take. But hey! Don’t you trust me? (Ihope you said no.) Come on! Even though you think it’s silly, take the firststep in your homemade initiation. It’s disarmingly easy, and it will only takean eternal moment.Start by taking a deep breath and pretending you are in the presence of theSupreme Intelligence of the universe (because you really are). Now recite theoath out loud with full magical intent. Then, if you don’t see anything in theoath that you object to, sign it (right here in this book) using your newmagical motto. If you don’t like this oath, cross it out and make up anotherhomemade oath, then recite it and sign it._____OATHI, [Your magical motto],in the presence of all I hold sacred, do hereby acceptabsolute responsibility for my own condition of darkness and ignoranceand solemnly acknowledge and declare that ultimatelyonly I can bring myself to Light._____There! Wasn’t that easy? It has only taken you countless incarnations (plus thenumber of years, days, hours, and seconds of this current lifetime) to get tothis moment. Congratulations! The hardest part is over!You are off to a good start and are now properly pretending to know who you are.You are now ready to undergo the ordeal of initiation.Where do you go to be initiated?How about initiating yourself—right at home![contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]8.

My brother, Marc, had joined the organization (which advertised inmagazines such as Fate and Popular Mechanics) a number of months earlier and hadshared a few of his experiences. I knew I was signing up for a correspondencecourse—an ongoing series of monographs that taught ancient occult principles andexercises. I knew I was to faithfully study these monographs every Thursdayevening in the privacy of my home “temple.” I also knew that my study sessionswould involve a certain amount of ceremony: a little candle lighting, incenseburning, chanting, and meditation—just the kind of spooky stuff a wide-eyed,twenty-four-year-old fledgling mystic like Lon Milo DuQuette was looking for!My first monograph arrived unceremoniously in the mail on a Thursday, a cosmicsynchronicity I could only interpret as a direct message from the gods. Inervously waited for the sun to go down so I could open the envelope and let themagick begin. After dinner, I showered and dressed in my karate gi (the closestthing I had to magical vestments). Constance, who was pregnant with oursoon-to-arrive and as-yet-unnamed baby, agreed to busy herself in the kitchenand living room while I sequestered myself in the bedroom with my candles, myincense, and my first mystical monograph. I opened the envelope, smelled thecontents (yes, I smelled the contents), read the few introductory words, andrealized I was to undergo right then and there a ceremony of initiation.When I was a youngster in junior high school, the word initiation was a word tobe feared. Initiation meant institutionalized bullying and torment inflicted byolder students upon naive and fearful underclassmen. A Midwesternjunior-high-school initiation meant getting your pants pulled off and hoisted upthe flagpole, or discovering (too late) that someone had sprinkled itchingpowder in your jock.Of course there are other, more innocuous kinds of initiation in life, but atthe very least the word implied a preliminary fee or penalty one must pay beforepresuming to be part of an organization.Initiate as a verb means “to begin.” Initiation is simply a commencement. Amagical initiation marks the beginning of a change—a mutation—an evolutionarystep in the life of the magician who, if all goes well, will exit the initiatorychamber a different person from the one who blindly entered. Spiritual evolutionis a series of these commencements. The magician formally recognizes thebeginning of each new phase as he or she grows, step by step, degree by degree,in wisdom and understanding.Formal initiatory societies were very popular in ancient Egypt, Greece, andvarious other Mediterranean and Asian cultures. The rites of initiation offereda more intelligent, elite, and esoteric spiritual experience than could beoffered by the more crude and superstitious religions of the masses. Arguably,the most successful of the ancient initiatory societies was centered in theGreek city of Eleusis. The Eleusinian mysteries celebrated the agriculturalmysteries of the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone for the better partof two thousand years.The Eleusinian mysteries themselves had developed from the far older Mycenaeanagricultural cults and the Egyptian rites of Isis and Osiris. The archetypaltext that set the standard and formula for many of the initiatory societies wasthe Egyptian Book of the Dead, a magical text that on the surface presumes tocounsel the recently deceased on how to navigate the obstacles and challenges ofthe afterlife in the timeless moments of the death coma. In doing so, the Bookof the Dead also reveals the magical formula for the graduated process ofself-induced consciousness expansion—the formula of initiation by degree.Speculation about what actually went on during the ancient initiation ceremoniesfills the pages of many occult books (some good, some laughably bad). Oddlyenough, the process of speculation in and of itself is a vicarious initiatoryexperience, for in order to even contemplate the dynamics of an initiation, onehas to put oneself in the place of both the candidate and the initiator.To its credit, AMORC’s little correspondence-course ceremonies ofself-initiation were artfully crafted and presented in such a way that if thecandidate was sincere and open to the moment, a degree of true initiation couldtake place. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I can tell you without evasion,equivocation, or reservation that on that Thursday evening in 1971, I wasprofoundly sincere and open to the moment.I allowed the printed words on the pages of that monograph to transport me to myown inner temple of initiation. There I met my magical self for the first time.There I pledged with every fiber of my being to discover the powers of my ownsoul and to use those powers to attain enlightenment and spiritual liberationfor the benefit of myself and every monad of existence. I was ready for thatmoment. All I needed was a little shove—a little help and encouragement fromthose few words. The monograph may have given me the shove, but the initiationitself was entirely my own—a homemade initiation.In the forty some years since that quiet evening, I’ve been the candidate inmany initiation ceremonies. Some of them have required the dramatic and magicaltalents of many officers and have taken place in historic and richly adornedtemples of gold and marble. Others have taken place in modest lodge rooms withonly a handful of officers. Some have taken place under the stars or inconverted garages and residential living rooms. In several of my initiations,the presiding officer was visibly intoxicated and the assisting officers ineptlyread their lines from scripts they were seeing for the first time. No matterwhat the circumstances, I considered the experiences true initiations.You’re probably wondering, how on earth can someone consider a ceremonyconducted by a drunken “master” assisted by untrained and incompetent officersto be a true and spiritual initiation?My answer is simple. It is because all true initiations are self-initiations. Nomatter how simple or elaborate the ceremony, and no matter how skilled orcompetent the officers, the initiation itself takes place in the temple of yourown soul. Your “application” is your sincerity, and your “initiation fee” isyour desire and ability to be open to the moment.My little AMORC monograph initiation was a real initiation. It couldn’t havebeen more real, more effective, or more magical if I had been lying in thesarcophagus of the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza and the presidingofficers had been Lao Tzu, Buddha, Pythagoras, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, AleisterCrowley, Mark Twain, and the Dalai Lama.All the initiation ceremonies I have subsequently passed through in my life havesimply been amendments, “booster shots” to that first homemade initiation in mybedroom temple on that Thursday night so long ago.So how about you? Are you feeling sincere and open to the moment? Have youreached a season in your life when all you need is a little shove to push youinto the deep end of the pool of homemade magick? If your answer is yes, thenyou have just applied to and been accepted by the hidden hierophants of theAncient and Mystical Order of Homemade Magicians (A.A.M.O.O.H.M.).You may now open your initiation monograph.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]10.

The protocols of ceremonial magick suggest that both the magician and thetemple be purified with water and then consecrated with fire."},{"pageContent":"PART IIMagical Weapons"},{"pageContent":"fiveWhat Are the Magical Weapons, Really?With the Wand createth He.With the Cup preserveth He.With the Dagger destroyeth He.With the Coin redeemeth He.12The Tarot card the Magician represents (among many other things) the alchemicalelement mercury, the planetary sphere of Mercury, the Roman god Mercury, theGreek god Hermes, and Thoth, the Egyptian god of magick. The classic image onthe card shows the magician holding a wand high above his head with his righthand while he points downward with his left hand.Before him is an altar or table upon which rest the four primary weapons of themagician:• A disk (representing the element of earth, the material plane, the body, etc.)• A sword (representing the element of air, the world of ideas, the mind andimagination, etc.)• A cup (representing the element of water, the world of the soul intuition, theheart and emotions, etc.)• A lance or wand (representing the element of fire, the world of pure will, theuniversal life force of the cosmos)Magical weapons don’t come ready-made. They have to be homemade or obtained andconsecrated in a very personal and special manner. The traditional books ofmagick go to great lengths detailing precisely how to fashion each of thesemagical tools, and I’ve known quite a few magicians over the years who did apretty good job following these ancient recipes and made absolutely beautifulmagical tools.But I’m a pretty lazy guy and not at all handy, so I figure that just doing thebest I can is … well … the best I can do. My homemade magical weapons haveserved me well over the years, and as far as I’m concerned, they contain as muchor more magical virtue than if they were actually Parsifal’s lance, the HolyGrail, Excalibur, and the plate Jesus used to pass around canapés at the LastSupper.Lazy or not, we all should take the greatest of interest in what our magicalweapons are and how we go about bringing them into our lives. These simpleobjects represent all aspects of consciousness and being (and by that I meanyour consciousness and the consciousness of the entire cosmos), organized intofour broad categories. The qabalists identified each of these four groupingswith a letter from the Great Name, 15584.png [image/15584.png] 15586.png[image/15586.png] , one of the principal names of God found in the OldTestament: (Yod 15588.png [image/15588.png] )–(Heh 15590.png [image/15590.png])–(Vav 15592.png [image/15592.png] )–(Heh 15594.png [image/15594.png] ),commonly pronounced Jehovah. Hebrew is written from right to left, so the GreatName is correctly written 15596.png [image/15596.png] .I’m not going to delve deeply into qabalistic matters in this book, but I dowant you to remember that, according to tradition, these four broad categoriesinclude the magician’s will (Yod), heart (Heh), mind (Vav), and body (Heh), andthat the four tools or weapons of the magician represent these aspects of themagician’s own being. They are solid, tangible, and objective articles—objectsyou can touch, pick up, wave about, and even taste. But they representintangible (but very real), inward, subjective forces, powers, andprinciples—things most people can’t even identify, let alone touch with theirhands and fingers.According to qabalistic tradition, humans are made in the “image” of deity,therefore the human soul is the miniature (microcosmic) reflection of the divine(macrocosmic) world. Both the microcosm and the macrocosm are divided into fourcategories: four macrocosmic worlds that are reflected in four microcosmic partsof the human soul. The concepts of these magical worlds and parts of the soulare neatly wrapped into four little bundles and turned into actual objects thatare the four weapons of the magician.15600.png [image/15600.png] Yod—The Wand• In the macrocosm, Yod is Godhead itself.• In the microcosm, Yod is the essence of the universal life force within eachof us.• Yod’s magical weapon is the wand. No matter what material object youeventually use for your wand, you must have a spiritual connection to it. Itmust be as magically precious to you as if it had been personally placed in yourhand by the Supreme Being itself.15598.png [image/15598.png] Heh—The Cup• In the macrocosm, Heh is the archangelic world of titanic fundamental forcesof nature.• In the microcosm, Heh is the transcendent soul intuition within each of us.• Heh’s magical weapon is the cup. No matter what material object you eventuallyuse for your cup, you must have a spiritual connection to it. It must be asmagically precious to you as if it had been personally placed in your heart by aloving and breathtakingly beautiful archangel.15603.png [image/15603.png] Vav—The Sword• In the macrocosm, Vav is the angelic world of specific mechanical operationsin nature.• In the microcosm, Vav is our intellectual and reasoning process.• Vav’s magical weapon is the sword (or dagger). No matter what material objectyou eventually use for your sword, you must have a spiritual connection to it.It must be as magically precious to you as if it had been personally placed inyour hand by a brilliant, beautiful, and fierce angel.15605.png [image/15605.png] Heh—The Disk (or Pantacle)• In the macrocosm, the final Heh is the material universe itself—matter andenergy as manifested in the space-time dimension we perceive as “reality.”• In the microcosm, the final Heh includes our physical bodies.• The final Heh’s magical weapon is the disk or pantacle. No matter whatmaterial object you eventually use for your disk, you must have a spiritualconnection to it. It must be as magically precious to you as if it had beenpersonally placed in your hand by your own mother and father (idealized toperfection, of course).[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]12.

You’re clinging to thesurface of a sphere that is spinning over a thousand miles an hour, all thewhile you and the whole earth are being hurled at an unthinkable and variablespeed around a star 93 million miles away, which along with you and me and thewhole solar system is being dragged around some inscrutable center of ourgalaxy. Add to that the fact that the entire cosmos is expanding at an enormousspeed away from an incomprehensible, pre-existent singularity.Know where you are? Fat chance!You have absolutely no idea where you are in the universe. Can you really beexpected to know where your pretend self is positioned in the cosmos? The answeris simple: No! You can’t!But you’ve got to start somewhere. And to do that we have to first pretend weknow where we are. This is why neophytes of the mysteries learn and regularlypractice meditations and ceremonies like the rituals of the pentagram andhexagram that require us to presume that we are operating in a set positionsomewhere in the cosmos.The pentagram rituals oblige us to move about as if we were positioned on thesurface of the earth (an apparently flat earth) in the center of a circledemarcated by the four directions, north, south, east, and west. The pentagramrituals require the magician to become master of the local terrestrial(microcosmic) environment.The hexagram rituals, on the other hand, work in the bigger world of themacrocosm and force the magician to expand his or her consciousness to encompassa larger universe—literally placing the magician as the sun surrounded by thebelt of the zodiac. Both points of view are, of course, woefully inaccurate—butbecause you have to start somewhere, you put your pretend self in these pretendlocations.I learned these rituals very early on in my magical career because I wasinstructed by my teacher to do so. I really didn’t know why I was practicingthem. Only years later did it dawn on me what these exercises were doing to myconsciousness and my sense of position in the universe. Think about it. When youvisit a huge and crowded shopping mall, don’t you always feel better when youfind your location on the big YOU ARE HERE map? The tiny arrow points to aposition on the map. Of course you are not actually there on that little arrow,but by mentally projecting yourself there, you become armed with a degree ofknowledge and understanding that enables you to find your way around the mall.It also gives you an idea of your position and size in relationship toindividual stores and the immensity of the mall.As the magical weapon of the element of earth, the disk is your body and thespiritual food (bread) that sustains the body. It is the solid foundation uponwhich you will build your temple. It is also your YOU ARE HERE map. The disk isalso called the pantacle, because the design that you create and engrave uponits surface will represent in symbolic form all 14 that you presently understandthe universe to be.Obviously, coming up with a design that symbolizes absolutely everything in youruniverse is a pretty tall order and requires a lot of thought and meditation.You need to do it, however, for unless you are “grounded” by the disk, youcannot begin the Great Work. The pantacle is your Yellow Brick Road, and you’llnever get to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz until you first find theYellow Brick Road.This is my pantacle (see illustration).14939.png [image/14939.png]The Pantacle of Frater L.M.D.I designed it in August of 1976 following my First Degree initiation 15 in theO.T.O. My inspiration was a combination of Thelemic and qabalistic clichés;therefore, the terms I use when describing the universal principles I’mrepresenting are those commonly used by magicians who subscribe to the magick ofAleister Crowley’s Thelema. Other magicians of different spiritual backgroundscan and should work with the exact same images and concepts but describe themwith terms from their own traditions, such as Hindu, Buddhist, Christian,Jewish, Islamic, etc.My pantacle has served me well up to this point in my magical career. I can’tseem to come up with a better one, unlike with my motto. All aspects of myunderstanding of my (for lack of a better word) “reality” continue to berepresented to my satisfaction on this figure. Here is a description of it in anutshell. As you read it, try to understand what I was trying to do with thedesign, then think about how you will represent your understanding of theuniverse on your pantacle.The Pantacle of Frater L.M.D.The basic format of my pantacle was suggested to me by something I read inCrowley’s Magick: Liber ABA, Book IV, part II:16The Wand was the Will of man, his wisdom, his word; the Cup was hisunderstanding, the vehicle of grace; the Sword was his reason; and the Pantacleshall be his body, the Temple of the Holy Ghost.What is the length of this Temple?From North to South.What is the breadth of this Temple?From East to West.What is the height of this Temple?From Abyss to Abyss.… All Pantacles will contain the ultimate conceptions of the circle and thecross … the Tree of Life itself may be figured therein … the Pantacle will beimperfect unless each idea is contrasted in a balanced manner with its opposite,and unless there is a necessary connection between each pair of ideas and everyother pair.I first and foremost wanted my pantacle to represent three absolutes: theabsolute biggest thing in the universe, the absolute smallest thing in theuniverse, and absolutely everything in between those two absolutes. Let’s talkabout the rim of my pantacle first.The first two “ultimate conceptions” in my magical reality are two infinities:the infinite out and the infinite in. The infinite out is the outer limits ofour expanding universe—quite literally, the outermost reaches of expandingspace. In the specific language of Thelemic cosmology, this huge infinity isidentified as the goddess Nuit (also spelled Nuith), the Egyptian sky goddesswhose very body is the starry universe. You can’t get any bigger or moreouter-er than that! I chose to acknowledge this aspect of my universe on mypantacle by placing the name NUITH on the circumference.Furthermore, because “the Pantacle will be imperfect unless each idea iscontrasted in a balanced manner with its opposite,” I chose to also acknowledgeupon the rim of my pantacle the opposite infinity. (Yes, there can be twoinfinities.) Because the circumference (Nuith) is in a very real senseeverywhere, so too must be the theoretical center of this everywhere-ness. Thistiny infinite in-ness is identified as the god Hadit (also spelled Hadith), theinfinite point in the very center, the heart, of the body of Nuit.Because Nuit is the infinite out and Hadit is the infinite in, they are bothinfinitely everywhere—infinitely touching and rubbing and caressing—the infiniteheart of Hadit beating eternally in the infinite center of the body of Nuit.This is cosmic lovemaking on unimaginably large and minute scales, and resultsin the birth of an infinite baby, the child of Nuit and Hadit.The child is the creative vibration generated by the friction of the universalin uniting with the universal out. This ecstatic vibration creates the field ofoperation (mass, matter, and energy) upon which (and within which) the entireuniverse actually manifests in space-time. In the nomenclature of Thelemicmagick, the child is called Ra-Hoor-Khuit. I placed his name not on the outerperimeter of the pantacle, with his infinitely abstract and unmanifest parents,but on the inside of the perimeter of the pantacle—to illustrate the manifestnature of this field of operation. Nuit is the biggest thing in the universe,Hadit is the smallest thing in the universe, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit provides thefoundation for absolutely everything in between.The cross is the next major feature of my pantacle. Just as Hadit is at thecenter of Nuit’s body, I placed a small circle in the very center of the disk.For me this represents the first “One” of manifest creation. In qabalisticterms, it is Godhead, the Crown, Kether, the first emanation of the Tree ofLife.14950.png [image/14950.png]The Infinite “Out” (Nuith), the Infinite “In” (Hadith), and Their Infinite Pointof Contact (Ra-Hoor-Khuit)14959.png [image/14959.png]Infinities Concentrated into the Primal Singularity—Kether on the QabalisticTree of LifeWhat is the length of this Temple?From North to South.What is the breadth of this Temple?From East to West.This point is the primal One—Kether—the Crown, from which emanate the othersephiroth of the Tree of Life. But there are four Trees of Life representing thefour qabalistic worlds (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah) and the fourparts of the soul. The cross of my pantacle is made from four Trees of Lifebursting in the four directions from the primal Kether. This way of looking atthings shows a total of thirty-seven17 sephiroth.14968.png [image/14968.png]The Four Qabalistic Worlds and the Four Parts of the Soul All Emanating from thePrimal SingularityWhat is the height of this Temple?From Abyss to Abyss.I now draw your attention to the black eleven-sided abyss between the perimeterand the central field, and the black circle abyss that backs the supernal triadsof the four Trees of Life. These abysses (which are really one … really none!)guard the two border areas of being: (1) being coming forth from unmanifestpotentiality, and (2) fully realized being returning to unmanifest potentiality.Even if you don’t follow my thinking on these qabalistic matters, I hope you getthe general idea of what I was trying to achieve with my pantacle. On my map, Ican point out specific landmarks of creation and consciousness as I understandthem: fundamental forces of nature, parts of the soul, qabalistic worlds,elements, planets and planetary spheres, zodiac signs, even Tarot cards andinitiatory grades.Now it’s your turn. What does your universe look like? It could be as profoundlysimple as the yin-yang symbol, a pentagram, or a square and a triangle. But youmust ask yourself if you will be able to point out exactly where on that simplesymbol you could find, for example, the sun, or the element of air, or thezodiac sign Capricorn. What combination of words, symbols, and figures do youneed to assemble to represent your idea of infinite space or exactly where youcould pinpoint your present degree of initiation of illumination? Where is thenext step in your spiritual evolution?As with your magical motto, you will probably make several (perhaps many)different pantacles during your long and illustrious magical career. But youhave to start somewhere, and you have to start some time. That time is now.I would like you to create your own homemade magick pantacle in the blank diskon the next page. Sign it with your own magical motto. Give it some thought, butremember that your understanding of your universe is changing with every breathyou take. You will most likely change the design many times in the future, sodon’t take too much time now. There’s no time like the present, so do it now!14833.jpg [image/14833.jpg]The Magick Pantacle of ____________________………………………………………………………………………………………………. (date)Actually Making a PantacleI probably should apologize for rambling on and on about the importance of thedesign for your pantacle without offering any practical advice as to how youmight go about making the material object itself. Let’s change that right now.Here are a few thoughts and suggestions.Using standards set by the Golden Dawn, the pantacle should be eight inches indiameter and half an inch thick. It should be round, flat, and ratherheavy—round, because it should remind you of both the ring of the horizon thatsurrounds you as you stand on the surface of the earth and the disk of the sunthat circles you daily in the heavens; flat, because your work must be builtupon a foundation that is level; and heavy, because the magician’s work must befirmly and substantially grounded and (for the time being at least) fixed inplace.If the pantacle is made of metal, the ideal material is gold or gold-platedsilver. Not many of us today can afford a round slab of pure gold eight inchesin diameter and half an inch thick, so this is not an option for most magicians.Beeswax is also an ideal material for a pantacle and has been used for centuriesby magicians. Not only is beeswax infinitely more inexpensive than gold orindeed any metal, but it is very easy (indeed, pleasurable) to work with. Itsmells wonderful, too. If cared for properly, it will last hundreds of years. Itis the product of industrious labor and is actually a living substance. Amongits many other attributes, the pantacle represents the magician’s livelihood andmaterial sustenance. It is quite literally the food of the magician. When onelooks at one’s pantacle, one should feel a visceral urge to take a bite out ofit—like eating the earth … like eating the sun … like eating the body of God. Apantacle of beeswax fills the bill nicely!Beeswax is easy to obtain, if you know where to look. Most farmers’ markets haveat least one honey farmer (apiarist) who also sells blocks of beeswax. It isalso found in bulk at hardware stores, where it is sold as a bolt and screwlubricant. Food grade, however, is preferable. Candle wax or paraffin is alsoeasy to obtain and, while less desirable from a mystical perspective, is veryeasy to work with.Paraffin candle stubs are in no short supply at the DuQuette house. For manyyears we celebrated the Gnostic Mass in our living room at least once a month.The high altar of the lovely ceremony was illuminated by twenty-two candles,which we replaced after two or three usages. I have used recycled mass candlesto make several versions of my personal pantacle, my Enochian magick sigillum,and assorted other magick disks.Directions for Making a Homemade Wax Pantacle1. Find or buy a round biscuit tin or Christmas cookie tin approximately eightinches in diameter (a little more or less will be fine). Clean it thoroughly,then coat the inside with cooking oil spray or vegetable oil. You will not beusing the lid to the tin.2. Place your blocks of beeswax, paraffin, or candle stubs inside the container.(Estimate and use your own judgment as to how much wax it will take, so thatwhen melted, the disk will be approximately half an inch thick.)3. Place the biscuit tin with wax on a cookie sheet.4. Making sure none of the blocks of wax or candle stubs lean over the rim ofthe container, place the tin in your kitchen oven at a very low temperature.5. WATCH THE MELTING EVERY MINUTE! Do not leave the room for a moment! Keepchecking to make sure the wax is melting and not leaking onto the cookie sheetor the floor of the oven. At the first signs of leaking, remove everythingimmediately and turn off the oven. (I’m being so insistent about safety becauseI once set fire to the house doing this. It wasn’t pretty! Constance isstill upset.)6. Be patient. Everything will eventually melt into a beautiful liquid wax.7. Carefully remove the tin from the oven and allow to cool slowly at roomtemperature. Do not try to hurry the cooling process by placing the tin in therefrigerator or freezer, as you will risk cracking the wax.8. After the wax has cooled completely to room temperature (at least fourhours), turn the tin over and gently slam it on the countertop. If you oiled thetin sufficiently, a perfect wax disk will pop right out. The “bottom” willbecome the perfectly smooth “top” surface of your disk.9. Apply your pantacle’s design with a sharp-pointed object such as a compasspoint.Hints for Carving Your Design on a Wax Disk• First, draw your design on a sheet of paper. The drawing can be eight inchesin diameter, but you will want to make several photocopies of it, and thephotocopies should be enlarged (or reduced) to perfectly match the size of yourwax disk.• When you are ready to begin, cut out your paper drawing of the disk and secureit to the wax disk with several pieces of tape.• Then, using a thin sewing needle, pierce every place on your drawing where aline (1) starts, (2) ends, and (3) intersects another line. Make sure theperforations go completely through the paper and lightly into the wax. THIS CANTAKE A LONG TIME. Be patient and careful.• When you are absolutely certain you have marked every landmark on your design,remove the paper and, using your compass point and a straight edge, draw yourdesign on the surface of the wax.• For the lettering, you will have to more or less eyeball it and do the bestyou can. If you take your time and are careful, you will be rewarded with themost beautiful object of art you have ever created … and it will truly be yourmagick pantacle.Pantacle for the Impatient, Lazy, Inept,or Hopelessly Awkward MagicianIf working with beeswax or paraffin seems beyond your artistic skill level butyou still want to create a bona fide magick pantacle, you can do this:1. Go to an arts and crafts or hobby store and buy a round wooden disk, such asthose manufactured for plaques, photo mounting, etc.2. Lightly sand, smooth, and brush clean the disk.3. Take a photocopy of your design (carefully trimmed to fit handsomely to thewooden disk) and spray the back of the paper with spray adhesive (available atthe crafts store).4. Carefully adhere the paper drawing to the wood, being careful to avoidbubbles.5. Let dry overnight.6. Following the directions on the can, spray or brush-seal the disk, front andback, with a clear commercial glossy or semi-glossy finisher. Ask forsuggestions at the crafts store where you bought your wooden disk.Ideas for an On-the-Road,Improvised Homemade PantacleOnce you’ve designed and constructed your pantacle, you will have in essenceinstalled it permanently in your magical self. That’s where it truly exists.That’s where you use it. From that point on, any material object you choose tobe your pantacle is your pantacle. It’s desirable, however, that it be roundlike the disk of the sun and suggestive of the solid and nutritive spiritualattributes of earth.I travel a lot and often find myself quietly doing magick in hotel rooms and inthe guestrooms of friends and colleagues. I don’t usually travel with my formal,consecrated magical tools, so I improvise with what is at hand.Here are a few things I’ve used on the road for my magick pantacle:• A coin• The Ace of Disks Tarot card• My wristwatch• A round cocktail coaster from a pub or hotel bar• A tiny packet of salt from a cafe or restaurant• A CD or DVD• A tortilla, pita bread, or pancake (really!)[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]13.

Its function is to keep off the enemy or to force apassage through them—and though it must be wielded to gain admission to thepalace it cannot be worn to the wedding feast.18The pantacle is engraved with a symbol that represents the magician’s universe.The sword bears a word that represents the magician’s universe. This canactually be a word (a noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, adjective, preposition,conjunction, or interjection in some language that is meaningful to you)engraved upon the blade of an actual sword. Or the “word” of the sword can be amore subtle vibratory expression of your universe than that which can bearticulated by sounds originating in your meat larynx and pushed over yourflapping tongue and out your mouth.I would like to be able to tell you that I made my magick sword myself—that I,like the ancient magicians, dug the ore out of the ground with a shovel I hadfashioned myself; that I smelted the ore (in the heat of charcoal I made fromthe wood of a tree I had planted myself as a young boy and then chopped downmyself); that I hammered the raw metal into a blade, etc. I’d like to be able toshare with you the secret magick word I engraved upon its shining blade:“Shazam!” “Abracadabra!” “Etteuqud!” But I didn’t do any of those things.I bought my magick sword at an antique store near my home in Costa Mesa,California. But before you chastise me for being lazy and unmagical, I wouldlike to share with you the circumstances surrounding its acquisition and what mymagick sword means to me—how it qualifies to be my word. Hopefully the storywill give you some idea of what these homemade magical weapons are truly about,and what you will need to do to create or earn yours.My sword is a beautiful, but modest, Masonic Knights Templar ceremonial swordmade in the United States sometime between 1893 and 1923. There are thousands ofthem still cluttering the walls of antique stores and attics all over the world,and if you are lucky you can probably still find one for yourself for less thana hundred dollars.I had been shopping for a good ceremonial sword ever since I was made Master ofHeru-ra-ha Lodge, O.T.O., in January of 1978. Not only is a lightweight sword anecessary tool used in all the O.T.O.’s degree initiation ceremonies, but it isalso the weapon of the Priestess in the Gnostic Mass, the Order’s publiclycelebrated ritual. In other words, both Constance and I need a good sword in thehouse.I located the sword of my dreams at a local antique store. It was a MasonicKnights Templar Commander’s sword, in good shape (for something at least eightyyears old) and adorned with esoteric symbols that are just as appropriate toceremonial magick as they are to Freemasonry. It was the perfect length andweight and came with its original scabbard, also beautifully and appropriatelyadorned. It was reasonably priced, but at the time I didn’t have the money tobuy it. In fact, I didn’t have money to buy much of anything.Looking back, I’m happy that I didn’t have the funds to just purchase it when Ifirst saw it in the shop, because if I had just thrown it in my shopping cart,that particular sword might never have gotten itself infused with much magick.But I’ll get to that part of the story in a moment. I need to tell you that mymagick sword didn’t start out as a sword. First, it was a guitar—a very specialguitar.It was a handsome instrument—the finest I’d ever owned—a 1968 C.F. Martin D-28with a butter-smooth setup and rich response that was just perfect for my (then)primitive rhythm accompaniment style. I selected it from out of a dozen high-endguitars I sampled at Johnny Thompson Music, the legendary store in El Monte,California, that serviced the artists and bands that populated the touring andrecording culture of that golden age of popular music. Our producer at EpicRecords drove my partner Charley19 and me there one afternoon in early 1970 andtold us, “Pick out whatever you want!”I loved that guitar and broke it in writing songs and recording two singles, analbum, and playing more live performances than my hashish-addled years of sex,drugs, and rock ’n’ roll will permit me to remember.A friend and guitar student of mine, who happened to be a master woodworker,begged me to allow him (for an insanely reasonable price) to inlay the neck andheadstock with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell. He adorned the fret markerswith generous double triangles of mother-of-pearl, and at the twelfth fret heplaced the Roman numeral XCIII (93)20 in iridescent green, blue, and pinkabalone shell. On the headstock he inlaid in abalone shell the name “C. F.Martin,” which plunged proudly between the rows of gold Schaller™ tuning posts.The crowning glory of my sweet Martin was the inlaid Egyptian winged solar diskcentered at the top of the headstock. Every feather was a separate iridescentpiece of mother-of-pearl or abalone shell cut and ground individually at adifferent angle and polished so it caught and reflected light from a differentdirection. As the guitar moved under the stage lights, the feathers appeared toflutter and dazzled the eye.Did I say it was a handsome guitar? It was breathtaking—my most preciouspossession, the apple of my eye and ear. It was coveted by every guitarist wholaid eyes on it. In my mind, that guitar, more than anything else—more than mysongs, more than my live performances, more than my own talent (real orimagined), even more than my recording career—defined who and what I was as anartist. It was my Excalibur.But in December of 1978, magick had become my art. I no longer made my living onstage and in the studio. I had over-enjoyed the excesses of the aspiring rockstar. I was a married man with a beautiful wife and little son (born in 1972),and in spite of the wild and wonderful adventures I had experienced on the road,I really did want to be a good husband and stable father. The alcohol, thedrugs, and the ladies ultimately couldn’t compete with the love and warmth of mylittle family.For several years after I said goodbye to music, I worked a string of low-payingtechnical positions in the medical device manufacturing industry. The jobsbarely paid the rent on our little apartment in Costa Mesa, and there was verylittle left over every month for food. I must confess, the DuQuettes owed ourexistence to the almost supernatural thriftiness of my dear wife, Constance.Christmas that year fell on a Monday. The company I was working for gave us onlyone day off for the holiday. Management waited until the end of the day onFriday, December 22, to announce that regrettably there would be no Christmasbonuses or year-end gifts for the hourly employees.Even though the DuQuettes are not Christian, our family loves the Christmasseason and makes the most of the cultural celebration. That year Constance hadbrought home an inexpensive little tree (strapped to her bicycle). It was gailydecorated and had been emanating its Jovian perfume into our tiny living roomfor over a week. A handful of small, homemade gifts were already wrapped andunder the tree, but the real gifts I was planning to get for Constance andlittle Jean-Paul had yet to be purchased—awaiting the Christmas bonus money thatwas not going to come. I felt pretty much like Bob Cratchit in Dickens’s AChristmas Carol, faced with the grim prospect of delivering bad news to hisfamily on Christmas Eve.I sat in my little cubical at work and wallowed for a few minutes in self-pity.It was not a very dignified attitude for someone who was starting to identifyhimself as a serious magician. In fact, I didn’t feel like much of a magician atall. Poverty had dogged us from the moment I abandoned my recording career in1972. My real-world jobs to this point had served to barely keep our heads abovewater. I was hoping that this Christmas would be different—a cheery and festiveoccasion for Constance and little Jean-Paul—like the Christmases my hardworkingparents had managed to throw for my brother and me in the 1950s.It then occurred to me that I had one asset, one golden treasure that I mightsacrifice on the altar of Christmas to save the day: my Martin. Even without thecustom inlay work, it was easily worth a thousand dollars. I didn’t, however,have time to find a buyer to give me close to what it was worth. It was tooprecious an item to pawn for just a few dollars, so I set the insanely lowfigure of three hundred fifty dollars (the amount I had estimated my bonus wouldhave been) and resolved that if I could immediately get that much money for theinstrument, I would sell it and go Christmas shopping.I swung by our apartment after work and picked up my precious D-28, then drovedirectly to Coast Music in Costa Mesa. They knew me there. During our recordingyears, Charley and I were local “Hollywood” recording-star celebrities. Theowner also knew my guitar and was forever suggesting that I sell it to him.Late as it was in the day, the store was still full of customers, mostlyprofessional musicians shopping for supplies for holiday gigs. The owner washappy to see me and lamented the fact that I hadn’t been in for a while. I laidthe guitar case on the display case and said flatly, “I’m selling my Martin.”He looked surprised and genuinely sad. Still, there was a glint of greed in hiseyes. “Are you sure about this?” was his first response. I nodded in theaffirmative.He sighed and started to open the case. “Okay, I’ll write it up and put it onconsignment. What’s your asking price?”“I don’t want to put it on consignment,” I told him. “I want to sell it toyou—right now—for three hundred fifty dollars in cash.”He looked at me in complete disbelief. He flared his nostrils in a not-so-subtleattempt to sniff out alcohol or drugs on my breath. “I can’t do this, Lon. Givethis some thought.”“I’ve given it a lot of thought. It’s Christmas Eve. I need three hundred fiftydollars for the family’s Christmas.”He closed the case and said, “Sorry, man. I couldn’t live with myself. It’s yourbaby. You don’t want to do this.”“Okay,” I said. “If it will make you feel better, you can give me the money andthrow in a replacement guitar from off the wall.”He thought for a moment and said, “Okay!” He then walked over to the walldisplay of guitars and picked out a beautiful new Gibson J-45. “Will this do?”“Sure,” I said. “If it will make you feel better.”A Gibson J-45 is a pretty fine instrument and represented an extremely generoustrade. A few minutes later, I walked out of the store with three hundred fiftydollars in cash and a new guitar. I headed straight to the antique store andpurchased two items: a rocking chair Constance had admired and my magick sword.Constance and I spent the rest of the magick cash at the toy store.In the spring, I sold the Gibson to a friend, and for the next twenty-nineyears, I didn’t own or play a guitar. I left the world of music and embarked onthe study and practice of ceremonial magick and the associated arts. My sword—mystore-bought, inexpensive Masonic ceremonial blade—has gotten quite a workout inthe last forty years. I wouldn’t dream of trading it in for a new one. It is myExcalibur, my Sting, my Nothung. I carry it in dreams and visions. With it, Ihave done battle with the dragons of my own nightmares, banished demons, andstormed the gates of heaven. My cheap Masonic sword is the material metaphor ofmy word. I needed it to find my voice, the voice of my own Great Work for whichmy old Martin guitar was merely a pre-echo.With my sword, I banished the demons of indolence and laziness, invoked the godsof discipline and focus, and pierced the mysteries of my own soul until I cutthrough and found my magical voice—the word of my own Great Work. Every word Iwrite—every sentence, every poem, every book that pours onto the page—is myword. My sword is my tongue, my keyboard, my computer, my printer, my telephone,my network of Brothers and Sisters, friends and colleagues.What is your word ? The answer to that question will hand you your magick sword.It’s likely you will try out many lesser swords before you find the true one.But once again, you have to start somewhere, and there’s no time like thepresent. But before I give you a bit of sword-shopping advice, I’d like to sharethe latest episode in my magick sword adventure.It seems that my magick has come full circle. My original magick sword has comeback to me—as surely as if it had been returned newly forged from the hand ofthe Lady of the Lake. No, my old Martin D-28 didn’t reappear miraculously on mydoorstep. But something almost as amazing happened.A couple years ago, after a break of thirty-five years, I started writing songsagain. It seemed like a natural evolution of my writing and magical career. I’dbeen lucky to secure a song publisher and record label, and I really enjoyedplaying a few songs at my talks and workshops. Shortly before my sixty-fifthbirthday, I entered one of my newly recorded songs in a national songwritingcompetition. I shamelessly appealed to my family, friends, colleagues, andsocial-network contacts to listen to it and (if they absolutely didn’t hate it)vote for it. When the contest ended and the votes were counted, I won firstplace. The prize? A beautiful new (and rather expensive) Alvarez Masterworksguitar.Making (or Selecting) Your Homemade SwordAs I confessed earlier, I do not have the skill or the wherewithal to fabricatea proper sword. If you are blessed with those skills, or if you know someone whois, I encourage you to think long and hard about the design of both the bladeand handle, then commence or commission the project.If you resolve to buy or obtain an existing manufactured sword (which isprobably what most modern magicians must do), here are a few ideas that might behelpful:• Keep in mind that your magick sword is a ceremonial sword. If it is too largeor heavy, you will not be able to hold it up for the long periods of time thatare often necessary, especially in spirit evocations. An oversized sword willdefeat you faster than the most dangerous demon.• For symbolic reasons, a double-edged blade is preferable to one with a singleedge. This is a sword after all, not a big knife, ax, hatchet, or machete. Evena letter opener–type dagger is preferable to a knife. Your sword should come toa point at the end; however, neither the tip nor the edges should be dangerouslysharp. This is a symbolic weapon. The foes you will be conjuring, battling,banishing, and intimidating with the sword are spiritual adversaries and notflesh and blood. You will also likely be using your sword in group ceremonies,often in small, cramped temple spaces. Over the years I’ve been in too manyceremonies that were interrupted by accidental injuries inflicted by “magicians”brandishing razor-sharp “ceremonial” swords. It is very awkward explaining to anambulance driver why your bleeding “house guest” is wearing a black, hoodedrobe!• When shopping for your sword, pay attention to how it is balanced in yourhand. You will feel an indescribable pleasure and a powerful sense of confidencein the deepest recesses of your soul when you pick up a perfectly balancedsword. Pick up a thousand swords if you have to until you feel that power. Whenyou do, that’s your sword.Ideas for an On-the-Road,Improvised Homemade SwordOnce you’ve designed and made (or obtained) your sword, you will have in essenceinstalled it permanently in your magical self. That’s where it truly exists.That’s where you use it. From that point on, any material object you choose tobe your sword is your sword. It’s desirable, however, that it be somewhat“sword-like” or evocative of the spiritual attributes of air.Here are a few things I’ve used on the road for my magick sword:• A plastic cocktail sword. (Yes, the kind the bartender sticks through olivesand cocktail onions. Granted, it’s a little small, but in a pinch it worksgreat!)• A hotel silverware knife.• A fan. (A magick fan, the instrument of air, is the Eastern equivalent of thesword. A viable fan can be made in seconds by folding and pleating a sheet ofpaper or, better yet, the laminated card stock of hotel room-service menus.)• I always pack a tiny switchblade knife that looks like a miniature dagger whenthe blade is out.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]18.

The magick of the cupsimply comes from its ability to embody profound and perfect emptiness.The magick cup is the magician’s understanding—not so much the activeintellectual understanding (which is the function of the sword), but theprofound and passive understanding of the heart—an understanding that transcendsthe reasoning processes. It is through this understanding that the magician’swork is purified. The cup is the first letter H (Heh 18443.png [image/18443.png]) in the Great Name: Yod Heh Vav Heh, 18441.png [image/18441.png] . Itrepresents the element of water and the second-highest aspect of the human soul,the “soul intuition.”21It is impossible to properly comment on the nature of the cup without alsodiscussing the wand. Indeed, the cup and wand are a team, supreme cosmiclovers—the wand the ultimate active, positive projection of light, energy, andlove, and the cup the ultimate passive, negative receptacle of all light,energy, and love. If we were to use familiar astronomical allusions, the wand isthe sun, which projects and radiates light, and the cup is the moon, whichpassively receives and reflects the sun’s light. Continuing with that theme, thewand is all galaxies of stars, and the cup is the infinite womb of space itself.If we were to speak in religious terms, the wand is the active process ofworship, of chanting or of prayer, while the cup is the still, silent waitingfor deity’s response after the worship. Formal magical ceremonies usually beginwith cleansing of the temple. This is done with water from the cup. Even beforethe magician starts the ceremony, he or she bathes in pure water and puts onclean vestments. The cleansing of the body and clothes is a function of the cup.Christians are initially baptized, and Muslims perform Wudu before praying inthe mosque. Jews of old were fully immersed in the mikvah pool outside thetemple, and many initiatory societies ritualistically bathe the candidates forinitiation. The magician sees all these gestures of purification as the functionof the magick cup, and without a cup the magician is just not ready to dobusiness.Obviously all this translates neatly into the familiar allegories of humansexuality and all the wondrous issues that accompany the concepts of physicaland emotional love. For us, sex is the clearest, simplest magical metaphor forthe mechanics of creation, and the cup represents the female aspect ineverything … in everyone.Making (or Selecting) Your Homemade CupOnce again, I confess that I did not make my own magick cup. I just don’t havethe skill or resources to fashion a viable cup. My cup is a simple stemmed brasschalice that was given to me as a gift from a dear friend on the eve of the veryfirst Gnostic Mass that Constance and I celebrated in 1978. We have used it forevery mass since. I can think of no more sacred, magical, or precious cup for meto use in magical ceremonies.You could say I am in the process of perpetually consecrating my cup. For me,this process is the essence and the power of the cup, so I would like to take abit of space in this book to share what exactly that means to me. I hope it willhelp with your understanding of what your cup can mean to you in your magicaljourney.As I just mentioned, my cup is a simple brass chalice. Brass tarnishes easilyand quickly, so each time I intend to use my cup, I must first polish it topristine brilliance. You might think that taking time to polish brass prior toevery magical operation is an inconvenience—and you’d be right. It’s a realpain! I grumble out loud as I dodge the deadly black-widow spiders in the garageas I search for the brass polish and rags and newspapers and paper towels.The brass cleaner is nasty and toxic, which is why Constance makes me keep it inthe infernal depths of the garage. It stinks so strongly, I have to do mypolishing on the patio in the backyard. I don’t dare wear any clothes that Iever intend to wear again, so I strip down to just a pair of old swimming trunks(even in the bitter Southern California winters). I’m sure the neighbors overthe fence must be disgusted at the sight of a crabby, half-naked old wizardmuttering to himself, but I don’t care. Once I begin, I just want to get the jobover with. I’ve got magick to do!I vigorously shake the can of brass polish, pop off the crusty lid, and soak myrag with a generous dose of the caramel-colored liquid. I slather my cup insideand out with that vile-smelling poison and start to rub it in. Everything on thesurface of the cup almost immediately turns black, a sign that the chemicals areworking on the brass.Then, just like clockwork, my whole attitude changes. I become focused. I becomeinspired. I actually start to enjoy my work. I see my labor for what it reallyis—a magical operation, a consecration ceremony. This is not a household chore.It is alchemy, prayer, worship, devotion, adoration, love.Every smudge, every stain, and every lip mark and fingerprint left on the metalfrom the vicissitudes of my last magical operation—my last incarnation—I now seeas the traces of so many karmic debts, stains upon my soul; stains that I cannow wipe away with the polish of my devotion, my love, my understanding.I change rags and start to wipe away the excess polish. As my cup slowly turnsfrom black to gold, I begin to take an almost obsessive interest in buffing awayevery blemish. I turn the cup over and over in my hands, seeking out any remnantof past laziness, selfishness, thoughtlessness—anything that could have left itsshameful smear upon my beloved cup. Some marks are very stubborn, so I have toreapply the polish several times.My fingers are now black. The cuticles of my fingernails have become blackenedcrescent moons, but finally my beautiful cup (now warm from the friction of myardor) mirrors in immaculate detail the golden glory of the sun. In those fewmoments, I have become the soot-blackened Vulcan-Hephaestus clumsily caressingin my brutish hands the delicate pink body of my bride Venus.I stop polishing only when I understand in my soul that I now hold in my handsthe Holy Grail itself—until I understand that when I put this sacred vessel tomy lips I will be drinking the Life of the Sun, the Elixir of Life, and the Dewof Immortality.Your Magick CupNot everyone is as inept as I am in the workshop. You might be more handy withmetal or wood or glass and have all the necessary resources to fashion your owncup from scratch. If so, you might want to look at a few images of examples ofmagick cups that are found in abundance on the Internet. One classic example ofa magick cup has a triangular base, a spherical center stem, and a crescent moonfor a bowl.Because of its association with the moon and water, silver is a most appropriatemetal for a magick cup. But glass, brass, pewter, and wood are also popularmaterials. Blues, silvers, and sea greens are perfect colors.Even though I’ve never made a cup myself, a friend of ours described how herhusband once made one himself. Before her death in 2003, the DuQuettes wereprivileged to be friends with Helen Parsons Smith, the widow of two greatAmerican magicians, Jack Parsons and Wilfred Smith. Helen told us how Jack hadmade his own crude cup.He purchased two very thin sheets of pure silver, one perfectly round, abouteight inches in diameter, and the other square, about five inches square. Hetook the round piece of silver to a beach in Malibu and laid it on the wet sandat the water’s edge. He then carefully proceeded to pound the center of the diskwith a wooden pestle. It took quite a long time, but eventually he beat theround disk into a semblance of the bowl of a cup. Back in his home workshop, heused a jeweler’s saw to cut three identical crescent “moons” from the squarepiece of silver. Once those were cleaned and polished, he soldered the moons tothe sides of the bowl to form three legs. Simple, beautiful, and he did it allhimself.Ideas for an On-the-Road,Improvised Homemade CupAbout ten years ago, I was speaking in Oslo and had need of a magick cup for amagical operation I intended to perform the following evening. I was stayingwith friends, and my “temple” was the guestroom of their home. Before retiring,I performed the water section of the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia 22with the object of locating an appropriate “travel” magick cup. No sooner had Iconcluded the ritual than my host knocked on the door of my room and announcedwe would be visiting the Vigeland Sculpture Park in the morning.The park is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful places I have ever seen. Itoured with about a dozen local lodge members who had all been there many times.Before we headed home, we all wanted to visit the gift shop. A young lady fromour party called my name and motioned me over to an exhibit of tiny pewter winecups, replicas of ancient Norwegian ritual cups. My face lit up, and she sensedthat I liked them very much. “I buy one for you,” she said. I made a mostinsincere and feeble attempt at protest. It has been my travel cup ever since.Once you’ve designed and made (or obtained) your cup, you will have in essenceinstalled it permanently in your magical self. That’s where it truly exists.That’s where you use it. From that point on, any material receptacle you chooseto be your cup is your cup.

It is the spinal cord in the physical body,and the column of chakras in the psychic body. The wand is the Appian Way ofconsciousness that runs from Godhead to your head.The wand is all things active, all things positive, all things protrusive andpenetrating. The wand is the instrument of fatherhood, the phallus of creation,and the photons of sunlight. The wand is the hollow fennel stalk with whichPrometheus brought the gift of fire (stolen from the gods) to humankind. Thewand is firm; it is straight; it is singular. It is the undeviating Will ofGod—and ultimately, the Will of God must be the Will of the Magician.The wand is nothing less than the pure, one-pointed purpose for which you haveincarnated, and it is also the tool by which you must dispatch that sacred duty.If you think you don’t have a sacred duty in life, you are profoundly mistaken.No matter what your life circumstances are, there is a job that must be done, aneed that must be filled, a role that must be played in the grand comedy/dramaof existence that can only be done/filled/acted out by you and you alone. Youcan be certain of this, because you wouldn’t even be sitting here sucking andblowing air in and out of your lungs if there wasn’t something vitally importantstill left undone in the universe—something that only you can do.So why have you incarnated? What is your reason for existing? What is your wand?How are you using it to execute your sacred duty?You probably don’t have a good answer. Don’t worry. Finding out the answer iscalled the “Great Work,” but because you are a magician, you are actuallyobligated to do the Great Work. You can’t let a little temporary amnesia stopyou from getting on with your magical work. You have to start somewhere, sountil you get a handle on what is your true will, just go ahead and startpretending. Wrap your fingers around the nearest stick and for the time beinguse it as your homemade wand.Any pointy thing will work at first: a twig, a walking stick, a golf club, apencil or pen (a pen is a magick wand that has changed many a world!). I cut myfirst wand from an almond tree in the backyard of my initiators, Phyllis andGrady McMurtry. Years later, I would, with the help of a dear brother, cut ahazel wand from Boleskine House near Loch Ness, Scotland.Many of the traditions of ceremonial magick, especially those based on themythology of the Hebrew Qabalah, are drawn from the Bible; and there is perhapsno Bible story more magical or dramatic than that of Moses and hismiracle-working staff.26We first see the famous staff in action when Moses, in an attempt to impress thepharaoh and his team of crack magicians, tosses his rod upon the ground and loand behold it miraculously turns into a slithery snake. Not to be outdone, thepharaoh’s magicians whip out their wands and throw them down, and their rodsturn into snakes. But then, even as the pharaoh’s magicians are high-fiving eachother, Moses’s snake chases down the Egyptian snakes and one by one swallowsthem up. After that, Moses’s snake lets out a big biblical burp, straightensitself out, and stiffens back into a walking stick with a really cool handle.The pharaoh was fascinated by this bit of Freudian one-upmanship, but notimpressed enough to let the Hebrews go. Moses would have to wag his wand a fewmore times to finally prove to the pharaoh whose magick was bigger. With it,Moses would turn the Nile to blood and bring other deadly plagues down uponEgypt. Most memorably, the wand would save the fleeing Children of Israel fromthe pursuing Egyptian army when Moses created an escape route through the RedSea by waving his magick wand over the water while shouting (in his mostdramatic Charlton Heston voice), “Behold, His mighty hand!”Moses’s hand of God was quite a baton, and according to both magical andbiblical27 traditions, his wand was made of almond wood. Modern qabalisticmagicians are quick to point out that the words “rod of almond” in Hebrew(18451.png [image/18451.png]) enumerate to 463. The three Hebrew letters thatalso enumerate to 463 are Tav, Samekh, and Gimel (18453.png [image/18453.png]),which are associated with the three paths that form the spine (the MiddlePillar) on the Tree of Life. The Middle Pillar connects the gross matter ofsephirah number ten (Malkuth) to the Supreme Consciousness of sephirah numberone (Kether), the crown of absolute Godhead.The pontifical staffs of Roman Catholic Popes have traditionally been almondrods.28As a young magician, I naturally wanted an almond wand of my very own. I’vedescribed in painful detail in an earlier publication29 the tragic adventure ofmy first almond wand. For the reader who is unfamiliar with the story, I willsimply say that, after cutting the perfect wand from a blossoming branch of analmond tree in the Eden-esque garden of my magick teacher, Phyllis SecklerMcMurtry, in Dublin, California—and after straightening it for months on ahomemade straightening device—and after creating (and then executing) a two-weekconsecration ritual that involved invoking (as best I knew how) the spirits offire into the wand (a ceremony that culminated on the last night with a mostdramatic neighborhood calamity requiring the emergency services of the CostaMesa Fire Department)—I then (on the very first morning I was to use it inritual) accidentally and unceremoniously sat on my precious consecrated almondwand, snapping it cleanly in two.Luckily I had another “practice” almond wand that I had surreptitiously cut in amidnight wand raid of a backyard in Huntington Beach months earlier. This time,however, instead of repeating the entire exhausting two-week consecrationceremony, I simply transferred the magical charge from the broken wand into the“new” wand by solemnly burning the pieces of the broken wand in a thurible whileI rotated the new wand in the flames and repeatedly shouted, “Get in there,goddammit!”It must have worked, because my “practice wand” continues to serve me well tothis day.While almond wood is the preferred material for qabalistic ceremonial magicians,other cultures and traditions use other woods. European Pagan traditions alsoabound with magick wands and staffs, and the wood most associated with themagick of Witchcraft is hazel, a fact I discovered quite accidentally in 1967while thumbing through a very cheap occult dictionary with my songwritingpartner, Charles D. Harris, as we were looking for inspiration for new songs.Our divinatory technique was simple enough. We would get out our guitars andsmoke a joint of very weak commercial-grade (for 1967) Mexican marijuana, thenone of us would grab the dictionary, close our eyes, and pick a page at random.We’d write a song about whatever our finger landed on … such as a hazel wand:I have traveled very farTo sit here at your feet.To ask your favorAnd to make my life complete.Touch me with your hazel wand.Fill my heart with joy.Bring me from darkness into light.The naive lyrics of that refrain still blow my mind after all these years. Howcould we have known it was the perfect invocation, the perfect prayer? Themagick of the hazel wand certainly worked for Charley and me (at least for twoor three years), because just a couple months after we penned that song, aproducer from Columbia Records heard us sing it and signed us to a recordcontract (Epic Records). He named the company that would publish our two singlesand album30 “Hazelwand Publishing.”It took me thirty-seven years, but I finally got a first-class magical hazelwand of my own. Last year, I accompanied some dear friends to Boleskine House,overlooking Loch Ness near Inverness, Scotland. At the turn of the twentiethcentury, it was the home of Aleister Crowley and is arguably one of the mostlegendary magical residences in the world. The grounds are clearly marked“Private Property” and are protected (from sophomoric Crowley fans like myself)by fencing and, if the signs are to be believed, dogs. With the help of myfriends, I hopped the fence and made it close enough to the lovely house to snapa few pictures. We also brought home some hazel wands that we unceremoniouslyfilched from the property.Your Magick WandLet’s now get down to specifics about how you might go about creating yourmagick wand.• Material: As already noted, there are venerable traditions that suggest usingalmond or hazel wood cut in the springtime at the moment the branch isblossoming. If that is not possible, seize the opportunity whenever it presentsitself. In any case, wood is universally preferred. Wands made of stone,crystal, metal, plastic, clay, paper mache or bone resonate more with theelement of earth or otherwise point to other planetary associations.• Dimensions: Spiritually speaking, your wand needs to be long enough to reachup to the highest heaven and down to the lowest hell. Obviously, a stick thatlong is hard to come by, so you should probably settle for a wand that is theapproximate length of the area between the tips of your fingers and your elbow,and about as thick and round as your little finger or ring finger. It should beas straight as you can make it (more about this shortly).• Method of Harvesting: If possible, you should cut your wand from the tree witha single blow. The knife, ax, or hatchet itself should have some magicalsignificance to you. If possible, the cutting should take place on an auspiciousdate (your birthday, for example) or a date sacred to your own personalmythology. When you are 120 years old, you will want to be able to tell yourbiographer: “Why, I remember the moment I cut my magick wand. It was dawn onEaster Sunday (or noon on April Fool’s Day, or sunset on the Vernal Equinox, orwhatever).”• Preparation:• Straightening: After you have selected and cut your wand, you will want tomake it as straight as possible. This is easily done by creating a straighteningjig (with a board and a few nails) and letting your wand straighten and “cure”for about sixty days.• Stripping: After your wand has been straightened, strip off the excess bark(as much as possible by hand), then sand the rough areas, knots, and tips untilit is as smooth as possible. Be conscious of the natural patterns and colors ofthe wood, keeping an eye on the flame-like colors and designs that develop asyou sand your wand smooth. This is an opportunity to get to know your wand and,in truth, is an important part of the magical “charge” with which you areimbuing it.• Painting: If you wish, you may paint your wand. It is entirely up to you.Personally, I think it looks a bit cheesy, and the natural color of the woodprojects an elegance and a dignity that can only be diminished by theapplication of paint.• Sealing: Once you’ve sanded your wand smooth, you may wish to apply a clearsealer surface with a commercially available sealer, shellac, or lacquer.Personally, I don’t recommend coating your wand with anything other than anatural oil, such as a good olive oil, or the magician’s oil of Abramelin, orother anointing oil you might prefer. (After years of smelling magical oilsgrowing old and rancid, I am totally turned off by so-called magical oils andperfumes. I currently use good olive oil and very little of it.)Ideas for an On-the-Road,Improvised Homemade WandHere are a few things I’ve used on the road for my magick wand:• A cocktail swizzle stick• A wooden or plastic coffee stirrer• A pencil or pen• A chopstick• A toothbrush[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]23. “Touch Me with Your Hazel Wand,” Charles D. Harris and Lon Milo DuQuette(Charley D. & Milo), Epic Records/Hazelwand Publishing, 1968.24. The traditions of Paganism associate the athame (dagger or sword) with fireand the phallus principle, and the wand with air and the intellect. Indeed, thedramatic climax of the overtly sexual Great Rite of the Witches celebrates theunion of male and female, sun and moon, fire and water, by penetrating a cupwith the athame. All symbolism is ultimately arbitrary, of course, but in mymind there is a visceral disconnect here. The dagger is a weapon of injury thatstabs, slices, cuts, and severs flesh. Naturally, such a weapon penetrates theflesh, but in my mind it is a poor phallic symbol. I cannot imagine the femalepreferring a cold sharp blade of dagger piercing the “cup” of her vagina ratherthan the rounded tip of a warmly oiled wand.25. The chiah.26. Actually, Moses’s staff belonged to his brother-in-law Aaron, but nobodyseems to care who had the sales receipt, because Moses ended up getting most ofthe press.27.

Anypointy thing can be a wand, and any container can be a cup, but if the pointything has no meaning, no connection to your will; if the container has nomeaning, no connection to your capacity to love and be loved; if the sword hasno meaning or connection to your mind, your wit, your imagination; if the diskhas no meaning or connection to your body, your material life, your ability tofunction in this world; then there is no magick in any of these objects.Once you’ve constructed, purchased, or otherwise obtained your magical weapons,the final step is to magically charge and dedicate them to the service of yourGreat Work. This is done with a consecration ceremony—sort of a graduationceremony for magical tools. But no matter how formal or informal your ceremonyis, it will be worthless, ineffective, and a complete waste of time if itdoesn’t actually mean something to you—unless it is uniquely your own—unless itis homemade.The consecration ceremony can be as simple as holding the weapon in your handand announcing to the cosmos, “This is my disk (sword, cup, wand)! I hope itworks!” or as elaborate as a highly structured qabalistic ritual complete withpurifications, banishings, and multiple invocations of archangels, angels,spirits, and elementals.Your sincerity in the matter is the key to the success of the operation. Crowleyand the magicians of the Golden Dawn point to what they call the “formula of theNeophyte” as the format for a proper consecration ritual. The magician simplytreats the object being consecrated as if it were the candidate in an initiationritual.The landmarks of such a ritual are as follows:• The candidate is blindfolded and kept outside the temple in the outerdarkness.• Until the hour you have set aside for the consecration ritual, keep the objectto be consecrated wrapped in a black clothor bag.• The candidate is brought into the temple.• For most of my magical life, my temple has been my bedroom or (when the familyis out) my living room. For general workings, the temple is a circle (real orimagined) demarcated by the four quarters. For elemental workings, such as theconsecration of magical tools, the south is associated with fire and the wand;the west is associated with water and the cup; the east is associated with airand the sword; and the north is associated with earth and the disk or pantacle.• The candidate is examined, interrogated, allowed to pass, or, if for anyreason found unprepared, temporarily turned away.• Carefully inspect the object to be consecrated one last time to make sure it’sfinished and ready for use. If you are still dissatisfied in any way with theappearance of your tool, now is the time to make those final touch-ups.• The candidate is cleansed and purified (at least once) with water.• Thoroughly clean the object to be consecrated and sprinkle it (even the cup)with pure water.• The candidate takes an oath to remain loyal to the organization and to abideby its regulations.• Because the object to be consecrated can’t actually take such an oath, you’llneed to compose a “charge” detailing in your own words exactly what you expectfrom the tool. Spend some time carefully composing this charge, because if youare unclear in your own mind what the purpose of your magical tool actually is,it will be of little or no use to you.• The candidate is dedicated to the Great Work by a divineinvocation.• This invocation can be as brief or as elaborate as you see fit. At the veryleast, you must make some kind of symbolic gesture or prayer invoking thepresence and the benediction of the highest divine power you are capable ofimagining (even if you consider the highest divine power to be yourself).• After the invocation, you might want to evoke the appropriate elementalspirits: salamanders for the wand, undines for the cup, sylphs for the sword,and gnomes for the pantacle. There are many wonderful and inspiring classicalexamples of such operations in magical literature. One of my favorites isEliphas Levi’s “Prayers to the Elementals.”32 The full text is given at the endof this book.• The candidate is given a magical name, anointed, and robed, then takes his orher place among the initiates.• If you so choose, you may select a name for each of your magick weapons. Theconsecration ceremony is the most appropriate time to formally bestow that name.At the very least, you should seal the ceremony by anointing the weapon withsacred oil (olive oil if you have nothing else), and then place it in a new bag:a red bag for the wand, a blue or silver bag for the cup, a yellow bag for thesword, and a green bag for the disk.Note: Even if you end up purchasing your wand, cup, sword, or disk, I stronglyadvise that you sew the storage bags yourself. Anyone—even I—can buy and cut arectangular piece of colored cloth, fold it in half, and hand-sew two sides withcolored thread. The minutes you spend doing this are priceless magical momentsthat will be stored in your magical memory, forever linking to your weapons andthe powers they embody.Use your magical tools often—for your daily rituals and anytime you arrange youraltar. Keep them constantly in the forefront of your consciousness. Regularlytake them out of their bags and oil, polish, and clean them. Even these simpleacts of maintenance are magical meditations of the highest order. Care for yourwand, cup, sword, and disk as you would your most sacred and priceless treasuresin the universe, for that is exactly what they are.And please, try to not accidentally sit on them![contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]31.

But make no mistake: If you can’t transform a scrapof paper into a magick ring, then there will be no magick power in a goldenring. If you can’t transform a plastic cup into a magick cup, then there will beno magick power in a silver chalice.The magick comes from you, not the material.Late in the 1970s, Constance and I were studying and preparing to celebrate ourfirst Gnostic Mass. It is an elaborate eucharistic ceremony celebrating theGrail mysteries. The celebrants are the Priest and Priestess.The Priest bears a sacred lance, which was easy enough to make. (I painted abroom handle and topped it with a brass spear-point a friend borrowed from adecorative flag stand at the local American Legion Post.)During the ceremony, the Priestess crowns the Priest with a crown that isdescribed in detail in the text of the mass:The crown may be of gold or platinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no othermetals, save the small proportions necessary to a proper alloy. It may beadorned with divers jewels, at will. But it must have the Uraeus serpent twinedabout it … 33Obviously, obtaining a crown as described was just not going to happen. Soinstead of going to the jeweler and commissioning a gold or platinum or electrummagicum Uraeus serpent with jeweled eyes (yeah, right!), I did the next bestthing. I made my sacred Priest’s crown out of paper mache.I unwound a wire coat hanger and had Constance wrap it around my head until itfit (it hurt!). I twisted the hook in such a way that it was positioned above myforehead. I went into the garage and found a stack of newspapers, then scroungedaround under the kitchen sink and found an old plastic dish pan. I used ourpaper cutter to quickly and wildly cut a few days of newspapers into strips.Into the dish pan I dumped about a cup of Constance’s whole-wheat pastry flourand a big pinch of salt. I then added what we had left of a bottle of Elmer’swhite glue (I suppose it was almost a half cup). I then quickly added a littlemore than a cup of warm tap water. I used Constance’s best cooking whisk to mixit up (big mistake!) until I had a sticky paste.I had no idea what I was doing. I just started dipping strips of newspaper inthe paste and then wrapping the wire with the newspaper. After many layers, itactually began to look like something. I played with the wire as I went alongand stretched pieces of paper to form the serpent’s head and hood. I took a fewhours, but when I finally set it out in the patio to dry, it looked like itmight actually work.The next morning I tried it on, readjusted a few things, patched a few roughspots, and more accurately formed the head and hood with paper and a littlereconstituted paste. The next day I spray-painted it a brilliant metallic goldand glued two rhinestone rubies for its eyes.Every few years I have to repaint it and touch up a few things, but mycoat-hanger/paper-mache crown has served me well for over thirty-five years. Tome it is more precious, more magical, than gold or platinum, or electrummagicum.The magick comes from the magician, and a magician can make anything fromanything. Your creative potential is endless … like that of paper mache.004%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell.jpg [image/004creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]Constance and I celebrating a Gnostic Mass in the living room of our home inCosta Mesa, California, c. 1985.

Because the Rites of Eleusis tell the mythological andastrological stories of the seven traditional planetary spheres, two officers ineach rite are identified as the zodiac sign that the planet rules (or is exaltedin). In this photo, Constance has just set up two chairs, borrowed fromJean-Paul’s bedroom, to be the thrones for Brothers Aquarius and Capricorn(Saturn rules Aquarius and Capricorn).Behind the veil (representing the Abyss on the qabalistic Tree of Life) is thethrone of Saturn. The Saturn altar, seen between the pillars, displays the Sealof Saturn on the magick square of Saturn, and supports a human skull (real andperfectly legal) surrounded by red roses.

Yourbiography says you’ve taught magick for thirty-five years. Just what are your‘credentials’ to speak authoritatively on this unusual subject?”It was a good question, and one that deserved a good answer. Frankly, I didn’thave one. I’ve had no formal instruction or training in any spiritualdisciplines. I hold no academic degrees. I’ve attended no seminary. Hell, I onlygraduated from high school because I had the lead in the school musical.I scrambled for an on-air response, and the best I could come up with was onethat sounded impressive enough at the time but was a bit misleading and notaltogether accurate:“I’ve just been interested in magick and the occult since my late teens, and inthe 1970s I was lucky enough to come in contact with three people [IsraelRegardie, Phyllis Seckler, and Grady McMurtry] who were once students of thegreat English magician Aleister Crowley. After about thirty years of juststudying and practicing what I loved, I woke up one morning and realized thatmost of the people in the world who knew more than I about this stuff … were nowdead.”Up to a point, all that was true. I did indeed know and study with these threefamous and legendary magicians. I benefitted immeasurably from their counsel andinstruction. (Phyllis was actually my formal A∴A∴ superior). These magicalheroes and mentors, however, did not actually teach me magick. In fact, I reallydidn’t start to learn magick until I started to teach magick.As I mentioned earlier, Constance and I have been active in the magicalorganization Ordo Templi Orientis since the mid-1970s. In January of 1978, I wasauthorized to charter a lodge of O.T.O., initiate individuals into the Order,and host other events such as classes, Gnostic Masses, and social activities.The character of our lodge has evolved over the years along with the growth ofthis remarkable (and sometimes controversial) organization.Early on, Constance and I (by virtue of our relative seniority in the tiny,newly resurrected O.T.O.) were needed to initiate members into the lowerdegrees. A few years later, as other initiatory bodies began to form around thecountry and the world, we were needed to initiate members into the higherdegrees. Eventually, more and more initiates could fulfill those functions andour focus turned to other organizational areas that needed our attention. Theseduties were not burdens we bore for the sake of our magical evolution. On thecontrary, it was as if the universe was anticipating our every personal magicalneed, and our work in the Order was simply the most convenient way for us tofulfill and work out those issues on the material plane.Obviously, there are very few people in the world who will ever find themselvesin the particular position we found ourselves in, and I admit that our case was(and is) relatively unique. Nevertheless, our involvement in a highly structuredmagical organization does not in any way exempt us from the necessity ofcreating, building, and sustaining our magical world and careers from scratchout of entirely homemade elements.Our lodge, Heru-ra-ha Lodge, O.T.O., is the oldest local body chartered by aGrand Lodge in the Order. In the last thirty-five years, we’ve hosted over 1,700classes and performed hundreds of initiations, Gnostic Masses, and otherceremonies (some very complex, requiring multiple rooms festooned with elaboratefurnishings). We’ve fed multitudes of hungry candidates and initiates and hostedscores of public lectures, workshops, plays, feasts, weddings, memorials, andcelebrations.All these events (sometimes as many as five a week) were held in our home—whilewe raised a wonderful son to manhood, and while I worked a full-time job andConstance worked part-time. For thirty-five years, our modest, rented house—ourliving room, our dining room, our bedroom, our garage, our backyard—has beenabbey, temple, monastery, preceptory, cathedral, rectory, classroom, lecturehall, chapel, profess house, initiation chamber, magick space … holy ground.Our furniture has always had to do double duty. End tables transform into altarand font; decorative swords, lances, and banners are pulled from the walls andwielded in sacred ceremonies; dining room tables serve as altars or are coveredand adorned with blazing bowls of fire and statues and secret symbols—householditems that, after the mystic ceremony is over, quietly return to theircamouflaged stations as quaint household items and Grandma’s curiousbric-a-brac.DuQuette magick is patently homemade. We know no other way to operate. When youenter our home (which has been described as “Beatrix Potter meets H. P.Lovecraft”), you enter a temple—but you also enter a school.In 1978, shortly after our lodge was chartered, we started a weekly magick classin our home. It was (and still is) open to anyone prepared to behave themselvesin our house for a little over two hours. Class is free, though a donationbasket is painfully conspicuous. Even with my travel schedule, we seldom miss aMonday Night Magick Class. We’ve averaged fifty classes a year for the lastthirty-five years (and for three years we held class twice a week). We live forclass, for we learn far more than what we teach.In the early days, I was hard-pressed to stay one week ahead of the class in mymastery of the various magical subjects. Eventually, I gave up all pretense ofacting like some kind of authority (nobody believed it anyway) and surrenderedto the fact that I was learning magick as I was teaching it. By simply trying toexplain things to others, I discovered that I was also explaining them for thefirst time to myself. I truly didn’t realize how much I already knew until Istarted to teach. Perhaps more importantly, I didn’t know what I needed to learnuntil I started to teach. I didn’t know what I didn’t know.018.jpg [image/018_fmt.png]Enochian magick skrying session in the living room, c. 1979. Enochian visionmagick is one of the most dramatic and effectual of all the magical systemswe’ve practiced and taught. Often referred to as “angel magick,” it wasdeveloped in the late 1500s by Dr. John Dee, the brilliant scientist andcounselor to Queen Elizabeth I. The details of how the system was received havefascinated magicians, scholars, and linguists for centuries. The magician entersinto an altered state of consciousness as the result of intoning (or hearing)“calls” in the Angelic language. He or she then communicates directly in visionwith individual “angels” in a complex and anal-retentively organized cosmos.In this photo, a class member sits before a large, three-dimensional elementaltablet of union, made up of twenty colored truncated pyramids that are the“homes” to the letters of the names of the four great archangels of theelements: EXARP (air), HCOMA (water), NANTA (earth), and BITOM (fire). I havejust banished the living room temple with the wand, and Constance has purifiedthe temple and the holy table with water. One class member reads the call fromthe book while another sits before the tablet of union and describes what he isseeing in vision._____So, if you think you have nowhere to go to learn magick, you’re wrong. Your ownhome is the campus of the only true magical university you will ever attend, andyou are the dean, the faculty, and the janitor.If your life circumstances are such that you can accommodate a few guests inyour living room one night a week, I strongly encourage you to at least consideroffering an informal class right in your home. Don’t worry if you don’t thinkyou know enough. Just schedule the class and study the very things you most wishto learn. It works like magick. Post a small, attractive, and well-worded noticeat your local bookstore, college, or natural foods store. If you are concernedabout giving out your address, screen your prospective students by chatting afew times back and forth via e-mail or meeting them at a coffee shop.Schedule the class and then hold it. Even if only one person shows up, hold it.Even if no one shows up, hold it.What are you interested in? Magick? Grab a good book on magick and use it asyour text. Modern Magick36 by my friend Donald Michael Kraig is a greatinstructional text, as is my book The Magick of Aleister Crowley.37Interested in astrology? There are plenty of texts out there to begin with, andplenty of free online astrological calculators. Offer a class where everyonecasts their own natal chart from scratch using their birth information. (Don’tknow how to do that? Learn how along with the class.) Then, to understand alittle about the charts you cast, systematically learn about the planets, zodiacsigns, and aspects as they appear in each of your charts.Interested in Tarot? Lots of people are. Put up a flyer at a health food storeand your living room will be packed. Get a deck of Tarot cards and a good textby Mary Greer38 or Rachel Pollack,39 or even my Tarot of Ceremonial Magick40(and book by the same name41) or Crowley’s master text The Book of Thoth.42Spend a few weeks on the trumps. Learn which cards represent planets andelements and signs of the zodiac. Then spend a few weeks on the small cards, andby doing so learn the basics of Qabalah without even trying.Just schedule the time and host the class. The class itself is the magick. Thesubject matter is secondary to the fact that you and your guests are magiciansmeeting to discuss, practice, and live magick. Help each other. Soon your weeklygatherings will take on a life of their own; strangers become friends, friendsbecome colleagues, and colleagues become an informal homemade magical order.You can conduct your classes however you see fit, but we’d like to share a fewsecrets that we believe have helped our Monday Night Magick Class endure andthrive for thirty-five years.• Have a consistent and regular schedule. In the long run, more people willattend more often and consistently if the class is held every week rather thanbiweekly or monthly. Classes should not be shorter than ninety minutes or longerthan two hours. Special workshops can be longer.• With all due respects to the free-spirited traditions we might have held dearin our inconsiderate and unsophisticated youth, “Pagan Standard Time” is foramateurs. Start on time (within fifteen minutes) and end on time!• Conduct each class as if there were both complete novices and experiencedmagicians in attendance (there will be anyway!). In your comments, endeavor toput everything in basic, fundamental terms the neophyte can grasp, and at thesame time give the adept something new and provocative to think about. Theadepts will appreciate the review, and the newcomers will get a glimpse of whatis to come.• Don’t even dream about making class a money-making enterprise! Don’t chargemoney for class. Don’t even suggest a set donation amount. Five dollars will betoo much for a member who can’t afford it, and a hundred dollars won’t be enoughfor a member who can afford it. Point out the donation basket at the beginningand end of class and then take your chances that you’ll get enough to pay forthe tea and handouts.• Your house should be clean, vacuumed and uncluttered. If you can’t clean yourhouse for class, you can’t banish a demon from your temple. It’s the least youcan do for your students. In fact, for some people, the sight of a clean,organized, and attractive magician’s home will be evidence that you are inpossession of supernatural powers the likes of which they have never beforebeheld.• Provide tea at the beginning of class, but do not encourage food or snacks.Snacks, except on very special occasions, can take up half the class if you letthem, and have you cleaning up the kitchen until midnight.• Engage the class. If you are reading from a text, pass the book around (orprint out copies) and let each member read a few sentences or paragraphs.Round-robin reading is fun and it keeps everyone awake and focused on thematerial. Each week, ask for a class member to volunteer to have a dictionary athand to look up unfamiliar words that inevitably appear in magical literature.• If you are doing rituals, let as many class members as possible participate.• Do magick … just don’t talk about it. Make talismans, magick tools, and robes.Learn about these things as you make them. Group rituals, skrying sessions,chanting, even silent meditations take you from theory and thrust you intopractice.• Allow, even encourage, short bursts of silliness. Allow running gags todevelop. Reward class members who make comments that are particularly brilliantor funny by tossing them foreign coins or some other kind of worthless treasure.Prepare homemade diplomas and certificates for long-running class series. Aboveall, have fun!• Allow member interest to guide your choice of class subject, but class shouldnot be a democracy! (No one but you, however, should be aware of that fact.)Finally, I’ll end this chapter with a couple of “thou shalt nots”:• Thou shalt not be a megalomaniac. Nobody knows everything about magick and theoccult, so don’t act like you know everything or that you even know much morethan your students. Be prepared to say “I don’t know” a lot! Be prepared to say,“I stand corrected.” Rejoice in your students knowing more than you, becausethat means you’ve done well.• Thou shalt never say, “That is a question beyond your grade level.” In otherwords, thou shalt not be degree-exclusive. The best class is open to everyonewho is willing to behave in your house for two hours. Even if there are classmembers who belong to a particular coven or a certain magical order, while theyare in your house and at your class, everyone is equal, members and non-membersalike. Don’t be a snob! With the exception of the secret words, handshakes, andsigns of recognition, there is nothing secret in even the most secret societies.If someone asks you an advanced, esoteric question, answer it in the clearestway you can. If you don’t know the answer, say, “Good question! I don’t know!”• Finally, thou shalt not hit upon thy class members! If you need to troll forlovers, do it somewhere other than in your class. There is nothing moredespicable than a person in a perceived position of authority who attempts touse his or her position to seduce a student. It is unethical and evidence of aflawed character—and if there is one thing we should all avoid in the world ofmagick, it is hanging out with flawed characters.Good luck![contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]34.

When a child is present, you are inthe presence of a god. That little kid is the most powerful, awesome, andterrible magician in the room, and you will surely suffer if you don’t pay closeattention. The child will soon enough grow into a floundering grownup likeyourself, but for a few golden years you have the opportunity to learn from amaster.This doesn’t mean that you must put your magick on hold in order to raise achild. On the contrary, the moment the baby is born, your life gets reallymagical. But as a parent/magician, you must be perpetually mindful of the factthat the child is an ever-present and integral factor in the equation of yourmagical life. Try as you might, you cannot avoid the implications of thisimmutable fact of life.In the spring of 1971, Constance and I had been married for nearly four years.One afternoon we both were struck with the same irrational conviction that itwas time for us to have a baby. We did some quick calculating in our heads anddetermined that if conception happened immediately, the baby would be born onConstance’s birthday, February 27. Eschewing our usual contraceptive precautions(and ignoring the afternoon sun), we joyously (and with full intent) proceededto conceive a child. It was no trouble at all.About a month later, while attending church services at the Self-RealizationFellowship temple in Fullerton, Constance fainted (it was more like an ecstaticswoon) and I had to help her outside to the temple gardens. There, sitting on amarble bench in the cool, shaded garden, she blissfully announced that she wasnow sure she was pregnant. She was right, and on February 27, 1972, we woke upand said, “Today’s the day we’re having the baby!”We took a long walk to El Matador (our favorite Mexican restaurant) and gorgedon guacamole, chips, and cheese. Then, as if we were not stuffed enough, wewalked even farther away from home to Thrifty Drug Store for a double-scoop icecream cone.We waddled home from our gluttonous adventure in the late afternoon and amusedourselves by playing penny ante poker, and mused over the fact that we stillhadn’t chosen a name for the baby. Early in the evening, Constance’s water brokeand we were off to the hospital in my light-green 1950 Chrysler Windsor (whichwe named Martha).Constance brought along a framed picture of our favorite guru at the time,Paramahansa Yogananda, which she set up at her bedside in the labor room. Hisserene image comforted us both immensely during that long night. Our beautifulbaby boy was born a little over six hours later than we had calculated ninemonths earlier, and our lives instantly became even more profoundly magical.Several days later, we settled on the name, Jean-Paul. On our first date back inhigh school, Constance had told me she wanted six children. She had names forall of them. The first was to be named “Jean-Paul.” I was really hoping shewould forget the other five children idea.Even though for the next twenty years we would be operating a very activemagical lodge out of our house, we tried to raise our son in the most “normal”environment possible. It was as if the three of us were growing up together. Wenever excluded him from lodge activities (with the exception of the super-secretO.T.O. initiation ceremonies), and we took him with us everywhere. Lodge andclass members became our extended family and provided him with a collection ofcolorful aunts and uncles whose love continues to bless our lives.For his part, Jean-Paul was always a very good sport, sharing his home and hisparents with countless out-of-town guests, taking part in rites and plays (foryears he read the parts of all the fairies in our backyard performances of AMidsummer Night’s Dream), and helping move furniture to prepare for masses andinitiations. The three of us were a team. We amused ourselves, and we amusedeach other. We were and still are our own best audience and best friends. Weopened our home to Jean-Paul’s school friends, who also enjoyed the colorfulcraziness of the eccentric DuQuette household. We remain friends with all ofthem.001.jpg [image/001_fmt.png]Jupiter, c. 1982. Our son grew up amid a heavy schedule of magical events,public and private. Several of the seven planetary Rites of Eleusis afford richopportunities for children to dress up and be part of the fun.This photo is from the Rite of Jupiter. In mythology, Jupiter (or Zeus) is thejovial and beneficent father god. He is also the father of Dionysus, god of wineand ecstasy, and so the Rite of Jupiter is intended to be lots of fun for allinvolved. The costuming and decorations follow a strict color scheme dictated bythe particular planetary sphere on the qabalistic Tree of Life each riteconcerns itself with. The sphere of Jupiter (Chesed), being number four on theTree of Life, is dominated by blues and purples. The costumes includeaccessories sacred to Zeus (such as eagles and thunderbolts) and Dionysus (suchas snakes, leopard skins, and grapes). Here we see the boys wearing ivy wreaths,leopard skin (faux), grapes, and rubber snakes._____Magick is not a “belief system” as the term is commonly understood, so there wasreally not much doctrine with which we could indoctrinate Jean-Paul. Therefore,there was little for him to rebel against. Besides instructing him to always usecommon sense and logic when evaluating spiritual or philosophical ideas, weencouraged him to develop his own spiritual worldview. We exposed him to a broadspectrum of religious ideas and never pressured him to believe anything. As faras I can determine, our lifestyle provided a safe, nurturing, stimulating, and(for as wild and crazy as things were) wholesome environment for a child to growup in. We couldn’t be prouder of the man he has become.Constance and I are both of the opinion (although there is no way to prove this)that the child chooses the parents, and does so for reasons that none of us canor ever will completely understand with our meat brains. We may have ourpersonal opinions and theories of child rearing, but neither of us would everdream of telling another parent how to raise their child. That being said, Ihave a few suggestions that might be helpful for magicians with children.• Don’t make a big, spooky, dramatic deal about your magical studies andpractices. Your involvement in magick might be dark, spooky, and mysterious toyour parents and grandparents, but it shouldn’t be a dark or spooky thing foryour children. It should be intelligent, fun, logical, beautiful, and, aboveall, normal. To that end …• Don’t behave as if the rest of the world is persecuting you for your magicalbeliefs or lifestyle.• Don’t suggest that your involvement in magick is in any way dangerous, sinful,or illegal.• Don’t expect children to understand the metaphoric “reality” of angels,demons, and gods.• Set a positive example. If the practice of magick makes you happy, let yourchildren see and share in your happiness. If the practice of magick does notmake you happy … get into something else!Parenting is, always has been, and always shall be a challenging and sometimesfrustrating endeavor. Your parents weren’t perfect, and you won’t be perfecteither. Be prepared to forgive your parents for their imperfections, and ifyou’re lucky, your own children will someday forgive you for yours. Your magickwill not help you if you cannot free yourself of both the past and the future.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]43. Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet (New York: Alfred A.

I like to travel, and I am for the most part a good traveler. I enjoythe disciple and focus travel demands of me. I enjoy the solitude of thejourney. I enjoy the long hours of quiet self-sufficiency when I’m alone with mythoughts. I delight in a perpetual background meditation of not knowing exactlywhat adventures await me along the way and at my destination.Each trip is a complex magical “ceremony” within which are multiple smallerceremonies all needing artful coordination and precise timing. Funding must beinvoked. Scheduling obstacles must be banished. Spirits (manager, airlines,friends, colleagues, bookstore managers, club owners, guitar rental stores, cabdrivers, hotel reservation and desk clerks, etc.) must be conjured and charged(appeased, cajoled, directed, and compensated)—all this even before I am readyto focus on the main object of the operation (the initiation, business meeting,lecture, workshop, seminar, book signing, recording session, concert, etc.).Of course, you could say that I’m simply applying fancy magical terminology tomundane events, and you would be correct. But for a magician, there are nomundane events. I meant every word of what I wrote in chapter 0: “… once yourealize you are a magician, it will be impossible for you to remove the magickfrom any aspect of your existence.” It’s all magick, and every moment of yourexistence you are called upon to be a magician. Airport delays, waiting at thegate, and tedious hours in the air offer me opportunities to practice pranayamaand mentally banish, invoke, or silently chant my magical mantra. Even standingin slow-moving lines and passing through the dreadful security procedures atairports can be transformed into an initiation ceremony that echoes with uncannysimilarities the passing of the pylons of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, if onlyone has magical eyes to see it as such.But there are also occasions while traveling when I unexpectedly find itnecessary to perform a more formal impromptu or “emergency” magical operationusing improvised magical accoutrements and weapons. I can think of no clearerexample of homemade magick in action than these rituals that I have had to throwtogether in hotel rooms, public lavatories, or even the backseats of taxi cabs.Here are just a couple of examples of how I operate in the field, so to speak.Traveling as much as I do each year, I’m used to quickly setting up housekeepingin hotel rooms and living out of my suitcase. Obviously I don’t travel aroundthe world with all my magical furnishings and tools. I don’t bring my elementalbanners or symbolic decorations that festoon the working area of my home temple,nor do I bring along my magical robes or my wand, cup, sword, and disk. I’venever traveled with the heavy and elaborate furniture (holy table and elementaltablets) that I use to perform Enochian vision magick, and when I’m required tosummon spirits and demons in Goetic/Solomonic operations, I certainly don’t pullout of my suitcase a magic circle (nine feet in diameter) and a triangle andplacards of divine names.I do, however, always travel with a deck of Tarot cards, and the cards (togetherwith a few common items I can scavenge from the hotel) are usually all I need toconstruct a viable magick temple anywhere and execute a first-rate magicalceremony.A deck of Tarot cards is a magick temple (indeed, an entire universe) in a box.Each card represents a particular facet of the magical universe around us andwithin us. The deck is the ultimate pantacle—organized upon the purest ofqabalistic principles. There is no aspect of consciousness that cannot belocated on or represented by one or more Tarot cards. Even “nothingness” can befound in the formless inscrutability of the Tarot. In fact, everything I haveever needed to build a homemade temple while away from home, I have convenientlyfound in a deck of Tarot cards. Here’s a quick example of how it’s done.Hotel-Room Homemade TempleAfter performing my customary banishing ritual (most usually a version of thepentagram ritual), I create the perimeter of my temple space by acknowledgingand marking the sacred quarters in the cardinal directions. Of course I do thisin my mind, but in order to ground my understanding of where in the cosmos I am,I place the four aces of the Tarot in the quarters of the room as unmistakableemblems of the elements and the magick they embody.There are two distinctly different ways the four aces can be assigned to thequarters, depending on whether the temple is to be arranged for microcosmic ormacrocosmic workings.Elemental Temple (Microcosmic)For rituals based on the elements (fire, water, air, earth, and spirit), Icreate a “microcosmic” temple. I imagine myself standing on the surface of theearth with the four quarters assigned according to the classic elementalrulerships of the four terrestrial winds: Ace of Swords (air) in the east, Aceof Wands (fire) in the south, Ace of Cups (water) in the west, and Ace of Disks(earth) in the north.Planetary/Zodiacal Temple (Macrocosmic)For planetary or zodiacal (macrocosmic) workings, I project myself into a muchlarger universe, and imagine myself positioned as the sun surrounded by the beltof the zodiac. In this greater universe, the four quarters are assignedaccording to where the cardinal zodiac signs (one each for fire, water, air, andearth) are positioned: Ace of Wands (cardinal fire, Aries) in the east; Ace ofDisks (cardinal earth, Capricorn) in the south; Ace of Swords (cardinal air,Libra) in the west; and the Ace of Cups (cardinal water, Cancer) in the north.Note: For Enochian magick rituals, the four aces of the Tarot are alsorepresentative of the archangelic and angelic powers and personages of the fourelemental tablets. In my deck, the Tarot of Ceremonial Magick,44 the full imageof each Enochian elemental tablet is actually displayed on the appropriate ace.The use of these cards as the four “walls” of your magick temple, along with theproper rituals to charge them, is a most effective way to ceremonially createsacred space in which to perform magick operations or meditations.Very often the placing of the aces in the four quarters is all that is necessaryto create the sacred space I need. But for more elaborate workings, I also casta homemade magick circle in the center of the sacred space.Hotel-Room Homemade Magick CircleFor ceremonies of spirit evocation (Goetia, or Solomonic magick as presented intraditional texts such as the first book of the Lemegeton: The Lesser Key ofSolomon),45 the magician stands within a protective circle surrounded by alitany of divine names. Placed outside circle is the triangle, also surroundedby magick words of power. The triangle (theoretically) traps the spirit or demonthat has been summoned by the magician’s prayers and conjurations, andconstrains it long enough for it to receive its instructions from the magician.For years, when doing this kind of magick, I took a lot of time and expended agreat amount of energy (pushing my artistic skills to their limits) to createthe classic circle and triangle as described in the traditional texts. As theyears passed, I eventually became comfortable with my understanding of what wasactually going on inside my psyche during operations of this nature. As aconsequence, I have dramatically simplified my operating procedures, streamlinedmy circle and triangle, and abandoned much of the elaborate trappings andmedieval (and superstition-inspired) choreography that filled the ancient books.Today, my Goetic magick circle is simply a thin silk cord that I can wrap up andput in my pocket (or, when necessary, wrap around my body so I can “stay in thecircle” for extended periods of time), and my triangle is a segmentedcarpenter’s ruler.But the magick circle is (or should be) more than just a magical prophylacticthat we roll on before we penetrate the infernal realms of Goetic demons. Forcountless practices, the casting of the circle (and understanding what you aredoing when you cast the circle) is, in and of itself, a magical ceremony of thehighest order. The aces in the quarters establish the holy ground of our temple,but the circle is the Holy of Holies, where we elevate and unite ourconsciousness with that of the Supreme Consciousness, and where we stand tobanish or invoke elements, planets, and gods. It is the sacred space in which wesit or lie down to induce visions; it the high place from which we call forthangels; it is the sanctuary where we can safely leave our physical bodies duringout-of-body experiences. The circle is our workroom where we consecratetalismans and magical weapons; it is our monk’s cell, our meditation chamber,our alchemical laboratory, our wedding chamber, or, simply, a quiet place toworship and adore the Supreme Consciousness of the cosmos.Tarot Cards Again to the RescueI use Tarot cards to create a beautiful and powerful homemade magick circle thatI can construct anywhere in just a few minutes. Briefly, here’s how it works.For macrocosmic workings, the circle can be viewed as the belt of the zodiac,with you, the magician, as the sun at the center. Right off the bat, this is avery cool meditation!The cards we use to form the circle are the thirty-six small cards of the Tarot(the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of each of the four suits).Note: You might think there are forty small cards (the ace through 10 of eachsuit), but technically the aces are not small cards. The aces are actually themaster cards of their suits—the 2 through 10s of the suits live inside theiraces. Are you following me so far? Good.The thirty-six small cards represent the thirty-six decans (or periods of tendegrees) of the zodiac, and the zodiacal year. When laid out in acounterclockwise ring, these thirty-six cards will form our magick circle. Thesmall card/decans pass through the zodiacal year from Aries all the way throughPisces in a most elegant and logical manner.Recall that the suit of wands represents (among many other things) the elementof fire, the suit of cups represents water, the suit of swords represents air,and the suit of disks represents earth.Of the twelve signs of the zodiac, three are fire signs (Aries, Leo, andSagittarius), three water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces), three air signs(Libra, Aquarius, and Gemini), and three earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, andVirgo).There being nine small cards in each suit, the first three cards in the series(the 2s, 3s, and 4s) are assigned to the cardinal signs of the zodiac, thesecond three cards in the series (the 5s, 6s, and 7s) are assigned to the fixedsigns, and the final three cards in the series (the 8s, 9s, and 10s) areassigned to the mutable signs.Here’s how that works:• The 2s, 3s, and 4s of each suit represent the cardinal signs of the zodiac,thus:• 2-3-4 of Wands = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Aries (cardinal fire)• 2-3-4 of Cups = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Cancer (cardinal water)• 2-3-4 of Swords = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Libra (cardinal air)• 2-3-4 of Disks = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Capricorn (cardinal earth)• The 5s, 6s, and 7s of each suit represent the fixed signs of the zodiac, thus:• 5-6-7 of Wands = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Leo (fixed fire)• 5-6-7 of Cups = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Scorpio (fixed water)• 5-6-7 of Swords = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Aquarius (fixed air)• 5-6-7 of Disks = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Taurus (fixed earth)• The 8s, 9s, and 10s of each suit represent the mutable signs of the zodiac,thus:• 8-9-10 of Wands = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Sagittarius (mutable fire)• 8-9-10 of Cups = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Pisces (mutable water)• 8-9-10 of Swords = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Gemini (mutable air)• 8-9-10 of Disks = the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd decans of Virgo (mutable earth)So, to create a complete, beautiful, and most proper homemade magick circle,simply clear a space on the floor and surround yourself with the thirty-sixsmall cards of the Tarot laid out like this:Starting in the east, lay the cards around you in a counterclockwise direction,just like the wheel of the zodiac:Aries: 2 Wands, 3 Wands, 4 WandsTaurus: 5 Disks, 6 Disks, 7 DisksGemini: 8 Swords, 9 Swords, 10 SwordsCancer: 2 Cups, 3 Cups, 4 CupsLeo: 5 Wands, 6 Wands, 7 WandsVirgo: 8 Disks, 9 Disks, 10 DisksLibra: 2 Swords, 3 Swords, 4 SwordsScorpio: 5 Cups, 6 Cups, 7 CupsSagittarius: 8 Wands, 9 Wands, 10 WandsCapricorn: 2 Disks, 3 Disks, 4 DisksAquarius: 5 Swords, 6 Swords, 7 SwordsPisces: 8 Cups, 9 Cups, 10 CupsVoila! An elegant, accurate, and functional magick circle.When you think about it, the simple act of taking a well-shuffled deck of Tarotcards and reordering and reassembling them in neat and precise astrologicalorder is, in and of itself, a magical exercise of the highest order. After all,how many opportunities do you get every day to take your “shuffled deck” (yourscrewed-up and unorganized life and universe) and put it in perfect order?15634.png [image/15634.png]Tarot Card Magical Circle of the Zodiac[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]44.

Constance and Idiscovered in the early days of our marriage that when we discuss (argue about)important matters, each of us contributes a unique and ultimately accurateassessment of the issue. I am usually armed with an arsenal of facts andobjective observations, but I am quick to jump to conclusions and am inclined topragmatically (or emotionally) surrender my ideals under the inescapable weightof objective reality. Constance, on the other hand, possesses the absolutelyannoying ability to immediately grasp the deeper spiritual dimensions of anymanifested issue or question. Furthermore, to make matters doubly infuriating,she has the guileless audacity to give perfect voice to the moral, spiritual,and philosophical truth underlying the entire situation. In other words, I mayknow everything, but she is always right!A relationship such as ours could hardly be called serene, but when all is saidand done, it has produced a life of profound serenity. I won’t try to kid you.We argue. We argue a lot! Familiarity really does breed contempt, and so farwe’ve enjoyed forty-seven years of familiarity. We argue because occasionallyshe actually needs to hear the cold hard facts and the perspective of a flawedand perpetually adolescent mortal, and I ultimately always need to hear thevoice of God and understand what those cold hard facts actually mean to my soul.Together, since 1978, Constance and I have directed the activities of a lodge ofthe O.T.O. We’ve organized, set up, performed, torn down, and cleaned up afterhundreds of degree initiation ceremonies, Gnostic Masses, public rites, plays,and celebrations and literally thousands of classes and workshops. All of theseevents have taken place in classrooms, temples, and theaters created from thespace and the furnishings of our home—from our living room, from our garage,from our backyard. End tables become altars and fonts, plant pedestals becomeritual columns, and curtains become veils.017.jpg [image/017_fmt.png]Getting ready for homemade magick can be exhausting. I have to confess thatConstance does 99 percent of the hard work of setting up for our public eventsand lodge rituals. I caught her resting a moment on a shady coffin prior to abackyard Rite of Eleusis._____006%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell.jpg [image/006creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]Constance as Scorpio-Apophis dances to Albinoni’s Adagio in D minor and mournsthe death and entombment of the sun god (played this year by our son, Jean-Paul)in this scene from a backyard performance of the Rite of Sol (from the Rites ofEleusis). The columns in the background are our living-room plant stands. Theveil (barely visible) is strung between two backyard trees. The coffin was builtby a lodge brother. On other occasions it has served as the tomb in the GnosticMass._____It’s hard work, and because of her need for neatness and perfection (and becauseof my inherent laziness and sloppiness), Constance always ends up doing 99percent of the physical labor involved. Each event is preceded by prolonged andspirited “discussions” (in which I know everything about one thing or anotherand she is always right). But from out of all the tension and conflict is bornsomething very magical—a world rare and wonderful; a safe and relatively stableenvironment to raise our son; a cultural (or sub-cultural) atmosphere filledwith stimulating conversation, art, music, and literature; a universe peopledwith some of the most interesting, talented, brilliant, and colorful individualsin the world. Together our craziness has enriched and transformed our lives, andallowed two magicians with extremely different styles and temperaments thefreedom to do our individual Great Work while sharing our lives and our lovewith the world.Perhaps our most important collaboration has been the creation and presentationof “The Miracle of the Mass,” our all-day public seminar on the O.T.O.’s Mass ofthe Gnostic Catholic Church (more commonly referred to simply as the GnosticMass). In the last twenty years, we have presented this seminar from Tokyo toOslo and throughout the United States. It has recently been recorded andserialized on the Internet.The Gnostic Mass is a ceremonial tour de force of sexual alchemy, and in manyways is one of the most beautiful and important contributions from AleisterCrowley to Western esotericism. It is quite frankly the essence of the mysteriesof the Holy Grail. Our love for (and appreciation of) this ritual made ourcollaboration uncharacteristically civil, and our usual volatile chemistrytransmuted to create a serious and authoritative commentary on the ceremony (inparticular) and sex magick (in general).Constance and I have yet to collaborate on a full book or musical project (whichis perhaps a good thing). But in the early 1990s, we began collaboration on anart project that is likely to last long after we have both moved on to our nextincarnational adventures. I’m talking about the Tarot of Ceremonial Magick, ourdeck of Tarot cards. I believe there is perhaps no more perfect example of thechallenges, tribulations, and rewards of a homemade magick operation than thestory of the creation and eventual publication of this deck of cards.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]46.

Properly decoded itreveals not only the secrets of the Qabalah but also the mysteries of all otherQabalah-based systems … By learning Tarot properly you simultaneously master thefundamentals of Qabalah, Astrology and Ceremonial Magick.Constance and Lon DuQuette,in the Booklet to the Tarot of Ceremonial MagickIn chapter 13, I discussed how, whenever I’m away from home, I can construct ahomemade magick temple and circle using Tarot cards. The cards that I carry withme (indeed, the cards that I use exclusively for personal and professionalreadings) are my own homemade ones from the Tarot of Ceremonial Magick. Idesigned and penned the line drawings for each of the seventy-eight cards, andConstance painted them in watercolor. Together we wrote the little booklet thataccompanies the deck. It was quite literally a family project.First of all, I did not set out to create a Tarot deck. I simply wanted to makea handmade set of flashcards for Monday Night Magick Class.I accidentally found myself a job as office manager for a stockbroker in SanJuan Capistrano. (How I secured that position is a story in itself.) My boss wasa wonderful and brilliant and successful man whose clients were wealthy OrangeCounty physicians. He was usually out of the office, and most days I only sawhim in the morning and late afternoon. I had plenty of typing, filing, andmarketing duties to complete, but I also had quite a lot of time each day tostudy, write, or get ready for class.At the time, we were studying the magical tables of correspondences in Crowley’sLiber 777,47 and I was preparing to discuss the particular sets of tables thatdemonstrate how certain traditional qabalistic angels and demons are assigned tothe thirty-six decans of the zodiac in the same way that the thirty-six smallcards of the Tarot are assigned to those same decans. I thought it would be niceif each member could have thirty-six blank notecards so that we, as a class,could transfer the information from the tables to the cards.We started by labeling the thirty-six cards by degrees (decans) of the zodiac:(0°–10° Aries), (10°–20° Aries), (20°–30° Aries), (0°–10° Taurus), (10°–20°Taurus), (20°–30° Taurus), etc.We then added the approximate ten days of the year that those decans represent.We used red ink for the cards of the fire signs of the zodiac, blue for thewater signs, yellow for the air signs, and green for the earth signs.After the first class, each member had a nice neat stack of cards representingthe entire astrological year. The following week we added more information fromthe tables of correspondences, specifically the qabalistic angels of theShemhamphoras and the Goetic demons assigned to the decans of the zodiac. Wecarefully placed the names of these angels and the names and seals of the demonson the appropriate cards.The next week we added the planetary assignments to each of our thirty-six decancards, plus their Tarot card suit and number. Beginning at 0 degrees Leo andworking our way around the Wheel of the Year, we assigned planets to the decansin a repeating order of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon.(Mars was repeated at the last wintertime decan of Pisces and the firstspringtime decan of Aries.)The notecard project provided our class members with a wonderful introduction tothe fundamentals of astrology, but we needed to move on to other subjects. I,however, was hooked. I knew that if I proceeded, I would have the makings of aunique and magical Tarot deck. I bought a case of 4 x 6-inch unruled white indexcards and used my spare time at work experimenting with formatting images forthe cards. This was in the late 1980s, before the availability of more advancedcomputer imaging, so I had to do everything with plastic transparencies, a copymachine, and a word processor. I eventually included appropriate images andinformation from Enochian magick and the I Ching, where those systems correspondto the Tarot.The preliminary work took two years to complete. The original art consisted ofmy seventy-eight uncolored line drawings printed one at a time with a standardoffice copy machine on ordinary white index cards.In order to be qabalistically correct, each trump and the cards of each suit hadto conform to a strict color scale. Each zodiac sign, each planet, eachelemental suit, and each number of each suit vibrates at a specific frequency onthe color spectrum, and all these factors needed to be considered when selectingand blending the colors of any given card. I was, frankly, burned out on theproject and did not feel up to the task.Constance, on the other hand, is a fantastic artist. Throughout our years ofmarriage, she has amused us all with her ink drawings, pencil sketches, andcrayon and watercolor paintings. Her eye for color is precise and tasteful. Shedid not, however, jump up to volunteer to help with this project.Then I got an early-evening call from my dear friend and former boss, RickPotter. He was planning to drive to Miami to attend the American BooksellersAssociation trade show (now called BookExpo America) and asked if I’d like to goalong for the ride. He was leaving in ten days. It would be the perfectopportunity for me to pitch my Tarot deck, but an uncolored Tarot deck would notbe very impressive, no matter how “correct” it was.Later that night, the after-dinner conversation went something like this:“Oh, by the way, Rick called today and said he’s driving his new Mercedes toMiami to attend the booksellers convention. He wants to know if I’d like to ridealong, maybe spend a couple days in New Orleans on the way. He says we wouldonly be gone twenty days or so. My publishers would really like it if I couldspend a little time at their booths.”Constance, while not overly enthusiastic about such an adventure, wasnonetheless generally supportive of the whole idea.I added, “You know, while I’m there, I could pitch my Tarot cards to U.S. GamesSystems and maybe get Weiser to publish my new book on the cards.”She looked at me funny. “What book?”“The one I’ll write if they publish the cards.”“But you haven’t colored the cards yet.”The next part took real magical finesse.“I thought I’d give you a couple of color scale charts and let you take a crackat coloring in the cards. Should be a piece of cake for you.”“All seventy-eight cards?”“That’s right.”“How long do I have?”“Ten days … well … nine.”“That’d be about nine cards a day.”“Yeah. If you did a couple tonight, it would be more like eight a day.”The clocks stopped ticking, the crickets stopped chirping, the dog stoppedpanting, and I stopped breathing.“Okay. Show me those charts.”Bless her heart, she did it, too. Right on time. Rick and I drove from NewportBeach, California, to Miami, and I successfully pitched and inked the card dealwith U.S. Games Systems and the book deal with Weiser.The moment I arrived back home, Constance and I set to work on writing thelittle book that accompanies the cards, including her wise (and patentlyun-Lon-like) insights on the divinatory meanings of each card of our homemadeTarot deck.Our Tarot cards are much like our marriage: beautiful in some areas and not sobeautiful in others, homemade, and magically correct.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]47.

This is no mean task, and I doff mymagical cap to anyone who can achieve such a lifestyle.48In 1993 I was sitting in my underwear at my computer typing away at a new bookwhen Jean-Paul noticed how fast I was typing and suggested that could I apply ata local employment agency and easily get a few temporary office jobs. I told himthat such agencies didn’t want fat, middle-aged men, but that I’d think aboutit.Properly shamed into action by my own son (and to prove my inherent incapacityto secure honest work), I decided I would at least give it a try. I put on asuit and tie and hopped on my little motor scooter and headed off to the nearestagency. To my surprise, they were absolutely thrilled at my typing speed anddownright giddy over my mastery of the English alphabet and the fact that Icould speak in complete sentences. They immediately signed me up and sent me offto a job in a posh office building in Newport Beach.The company was a small, five-person branch office of a commercial real-estatefirm that negotiated on behalf of tenants in the process of securing newfacilities. I didn’t understand a thing about the business, but I soondiscovered I could type everyone’s letters, organize their files, and generallymanage the office while half-asleep and still have about five hours a day leftover to quietly sit in my cubicle and secretly work on my next book. Everyonewas happy with my work, so after a month or so they “bought” me from thetemporary agency and made me part of the family.I couldn’t believe my good fortune. I was actually being paid each day to writemy own books. The company was doing well also—so good, in fact, that we weresoon acquired by a much larger and more celebrated commercial real-estatecompany. I feared I wouldn’t be able to keep up the charade for long under thescrutiny of new management, but before I could be found out, the new company wasacquired by an even larger and more celebrated global real-estate institution. Iand my five old “bosses” moved to a gleaming new building overlooking theNewport Beach Back Bay.As luck would have it, the new organization was so big that nobody knew exactlywho I was or what exactly I did there. I still typed up a few letters and didsome filing for my pals from the old company, but for the most part I becamequite invisible. I had no supervisor and no supervision.Every day for the next nine years, I arrived to work, dressed smartly in theobligatory white shirt and tie. Every day for the next nine years, I expected tobe unmasked as an impostor and fired. I wrote six books49 in those nine years—atwork.Eventually, because of my exemplary work habits (always busy—arriving early andstaying late) but mostly because of my silver hair (which made me lookincredibly distinguished and competent), I was asked by the director of theaccounting department (who regularly had me read her Tarot cards) if I couldmake time in my busy day to help handle the firm’s checks and bank wiretransfers, along with the necessary documentation.This was finally starting to look like a real job, and indeed, my last couple ofyears with the firm actually gave me the opportunity to do some honest work andassuaged a bit of my guilt. I confess, however, that I was somewhat relievedwhen the company ultimately merged with the largest firm of its kind in theworld and I saw my opportunity to take, as it were, “early retirement.” In 2003I put on my modest “parachute,” stepped out of the corporate airplane, andplunged into the next phase of my life as a full-time Lon.Since 2003 I have been home all day long—and as much as we love each other,Constance and I have discovered that we can occasionally get on each other’snerves.

If nothing else, it quicklyproves just how much of our daily chatter is completely useless, unproductive,and hurtful.)Morning DevotionsAfter taking turns in the bathroom, we begin our morning devotions. Constancebegins by lighting a stick of incense and, moving through the entire house in aclockwise direction, censing and blessing each room. The censing is accompaniedby a profoundly simple ceremony—a breathing technique she developed whereby sheprojects her love with each exhalation of her breath, and accepts the love ofthe universe with each inhalation.The house duly blessed (and smelling great), she then retires upstairs to theloft (which also serves as my library), where she has a small floor altar setup. There she lights a candle and sits down to perform pranayama.51 She ends herdevotional period each morning by reading from what she calls her “desertisland” books.52Constance then stands up and opens the loft window and blesses the entireneighborhood and the world. Then she blows out the candle and goes downstairs todo laundry, feed the cat, and make our breakfast. I told you she was a saint.While Constance does her thing in the house, I take my morning devotionals tothe backyard patio. There I perform (for all the neighbors to witness) anot-so-quiet banishing pentagram ritual. I then do a few stretches and sit downfor a period of pranayama, followed by mentally chanting a mantra that I haveadopted. (During the three years we played monastery, my daily routine expandedand evolved considerably. My banishing developed into a combined ceremony ofinvocation and banishing that I use to this day.)My meditations continue until I hear the bell ring, which signals the end of theperiod of silence and breakfast.BreakfastConstance insists (and who am I to argue with Saint Constance?) that we eatbreakfast outside in the patio area of our backyard. (We do this every day. Theonly exception to this is when it is raining hard. If it is just very cold orjust sprinkling, we eat outside.)WillBefore eating, we break our period of silence by saying “Will”53 over our food.One of us knocks 11 times (3-5-3) with our knife (or spoon or chop stick) andsays, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.The other asks, What is thy will?The first replies, It is my will to eat and drink.The other asks, To what end?The first replies, That my body may be fortified thereby.The other asks, To what end?The first replies, That I may accomplish the Great Work.Then both say together, Love is the law, love under will.The first ends by saying, Fall to! and knocks once to end the ritual.After breakfast we go about our day as we normally would if we were not playingmonastery, pausing only to say Resh at noon, sunset, and midnight, and saying“Will” before our meals.Noon ReshAt noon or as close as possible, we stand together, facing south, and say:Hail unto Thee who art Ahathoor in Thy triumphing, even unto Thee who artAhathoor in Thy beauty, who travellest over the heavens in thy bark at theMid-course of the Sun. Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoorabideth at the helm. Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Morning!Sunset ReshAt sunset or as close as possible we stand together, facing west, and say:Hail unto Thee who art Tum in Thy setting, even unto Thee who art Tum in Thyjoy, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Down-going of the Sun.Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Day!Midnight ReshAt midnight or as close as possible, we stand together, facing north, and say:Hail unto thee who art Khephra in Thy hiding, even unto Thee who art Khephra inThy silence, who travellest over the heavens in Thy bark at the Midnight Hour ofthe Sun. Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth atthe helm. Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Evening.We played monastery like this for nearly three years, during which time ourindividual disciplines and devotional practices evolved considerably. Mostdramatically, Constance incorporated tai chi chih to her morning practices and Ibegan walking—seriously walking. In doing so, I lost 150 pounds and most likelyextended my life.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]50.

Many of its victims werechildren, and by 1951, when I was three years old, the disease had alreadyclaimed the lives of neighborhood boys and girls on all sides of our modest homein Lakewood, California. I can only imagine the terror that seized my parents’hearts when, only a few months after I took my first steps, I complained of painin my legs and found it difficult to walk.To everyone’s relief, I didn’t have polio. But I was diagnosed with a seriousbone disease called Perthes hip55 and was immediately immobilized and forbiddento walk or exercise below the waist. In an attempt to chemically mellow me outwhile lying on my back for the next few years, I was prescribed what weregenerically called “thyroid pills.” The pills must have worked, because Ilearned to absolutely wallow in the delights of quiet contemplation and physicalinactivity. Unfortunately, the medication did nothing to curb my appetite (orthe insecurities of youth) and I quickly fell into what would become a lifelongstruggle with my weight.By the time I was five, I was walking with crutches, and a year or so afterthat, I was allowed to walk on my own, but no running or jumping was allowed. Atthe age of fourteen, and after countless x-rays (that are probably responsiblefor the growth of my superfluous third nipple and the seventh toe on my leftfoot56), I was pronounced “cured” of Perthes disease, but with an ominous caveatfrom my doctor, who wrinkled his brow and told my mother I’d better secure asedentary desk job by the time I was thirty or I’d be crippled for the rest ofmy life.A “sedentary” lifestyle sounded great to me. I loved not moving around, and bymy late teens, my body’s metabolism was happy just to kick back, relax, andconvert my food’s energy almost directly into fat. Things didn’t get really bad,however, until the mid-1980s, when a painful and permanent back injury, a stringof comfy desk jobs, my new writing career, and a crippling injury that severedmy Achilles tendon encouraged me to surrender completely to the great-tastingdemon obesity.I invoked this gargantuan demon with the following ritual. Each weekday I got upat 3:00 am and wrote until I left for work at 7:30 am. I drank way too muchcoffee at work. Then I ate too much lunch to ease the coffee jitters. After workI religiously stopped at my neighborhood liquor store and bought two cannedmartinis, which I knocked back as I drove blissfully around the beautifulNewport Back Bay. Then, after watching a breathtaking sunset over CatalinaIsland, I arrived home for a great dinner (of which I ate far too much), thenfell blissfully asleep on a full stomach.I knew this cycle of behavior was killing me, but it was the structured rhythmthat drove one of the most remarkably productive and creative periods of myentire life. While it lasted, it was damn near heaven. Heaven, however, came ata heavy price. I blew up to 310 pounds and the elephant in the room that nobodywas talking about … was me.That’s not quite true. I would discover that there was someone talking about theelephant in the room—a demon. Actually, the demon was (is) a real person, amean-spirited and well-read magical blogger who actually had the brash audacityto publish his57 openly hostile opinions about Lon Milo DuQuette.Naturally, I would like everybody in the world to love me, but I know that’s notgoing to happen. People who are passionate about magick have very strongopinions about what it all means. Magick is an art, and artists are often odd,eccentric, and antisocial people. I’m used to fielding questions, suggestions,and criticisms from some pretty odd individuals, some of whom have been livingfar too long in their mother’s basement. However, most people who feel impelledto bring my name into the discussion, even when they disagree with me, aregenerally gracious and polite.This guy was a real jerk!What really hurt, though, was that every hurtful word he wrote about me in hishateful blogs had some measure of truth in it. He was actually seeing me asaccurately as he could from where he was standing. Irritating as he was, Ideveloped a perverse liking and respect for the guy.Somehow he got my private e-mail address and wrote to me directly. It wasobvious he wanted to pick a magical fight that he could later blog about. Theletter was a thinly disguised probe for a quote—asking me one of thoseimpossible-to-answer pharisee-esque trick questions of philosophy. Not wishingto take the bait and enmesh myself in some emotionally charged argument over thefiner points of Qabalah or the objective reality of Satan, I replied as politelyand truthfully as I could. I’m sure my response frustrated him to no end, for itgave him no opening to continue an argument.Then, after a few months of no communication, he dropped all pretense ofcivility and wrote me a very rude and insulting message. Like a schoolyard bullywho has run out of witty excuses to pick a fight with the class nerd, heresorted simply to ridiculing my physical appearance.He quoted my own words, The only thing I can change with magick is myself, andsuggested that if I really believed that, why didn’t I use my magick to evokethe spirits of diet and exercise to change myself from the grotesque, fat, andbloated monster I had allowed myself to grow into?Now, I’m a pretty thick-skinned guy, but you can probably imagine how much thosewords hurt and upset me. I found myself hating this fellow with a passion thatI’m sure eclipsed his hatred for me a thousand-fold. But then something very oddhappened that immediately caused me to stop hating him. I even stopped being madand irritated by him. I realized that despite the fact that this individual wasa pathetic and hate-poisoned bully, he was absolutely right! He wasn’t a lyingspirit. He was the angel of truth—the omniscient voice of God.Constance had for years urged me to heed her informed advice concerning diet andexercise, but did I listen to my angel? No! It took the hateful and unkind wordsof this asshole—this demon—to finally get the message through this thick skullof mine and snap me out of my suicidal nightmare. I finally admitted to myselfthat if my sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits continued, I would soonface the deadly consequences of diabetes, heart disease, and death. The demonblogger opened my eyes to the truth that I could change it all with oneprofoundly simple magical act.I only needed do one thing: obey Constance!She immediately put me on a nutritional supplement program and removed from mydiet alcohol, sugar (and things that turn to sugar in the body), most breads,and dairy products. I replaced fried foods and junk with whole grains and ten totwelve servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Almost immediately I startedfeeling better, sleeping better, and thinking better.Then I started to walk. At first I could walk only a few yards down the streetbefore the crippling pain in my back sent me howling back into the house. Eachday I walked a few steps farther down the street. Then I walked twice a day,each time a little farther. The first day I walked completely around the block,I celebrated with a big glass of Green Magma.Day after day I walked farther away from home and the pain in my back becamemore tolerable. Each day I watched my shadow on the sidewalk grow thinner andthinner. After six months on the Saint Constance Health and Beauty Program, Iwent to the doctor for a long overdue examination and blood work. All my numberswere better than normal—blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, everything.My daily routine now includes walking five miles a day (half in the morning,half in the afternoon or evening), a heroic vitamin and nutritional supplementprogram (which includes mushroom supplements that have corrected my metabolism),and eating whatever Saint Constance prepares for me. I lost 150 pounds and havemaintained my weight at 160 pounds for the last three years.Did I lose 150 pounds with magick?You’re damn right I did it with magick! And I did it with the divine assistanceof an angel who loves me and a perfectly unpleasant demon who hates my guts(only now, it seems he has less to hate). I honor them both and thank them fromthe bottom of my heart.[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]54. “The Magician,” translated from Eliphas Levi’s version of the famous hymn.Published in The Equinox, vol. 1, no. 1 (1909, Reprint: York Beach, ME: SamuelWeiser, 1992), p. 109.55. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons describes Perthes as “acondition in children characterized by a temporary loss of blood supply to thehip. Without an adequate blood supply, the rounded head of the femur (the ‘ball’of the ‘ball and socket’ joint of the hip) dies. The area becomes intenselyinflamed and irritated. Treatment of Perthes may require periods ofimmobilization or limitations on usual activities. The long-term prognosis isgood in most cases. After 18 months to 2 years of treatment, most childrenreturn to normal activities without major limitations.”56. Just kidding.57. I have assumed this person was/is a man.

And therefore God is not the maker and architect ofthe universe but the actor of it, and is playing all the parts at once, and thisconnects up with the idea of each one of us as persons, because a person is amask from the Latin persona, the mask worn by the actors in Greco-Roman drama.Alan Watts 58Hippolyta: This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.Theseus: The best in this kind are but shadows;and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Act 5, Scene 1There was a time when the term “home theater” meant the staging of an actualplay in the parlor of one’s own home. The vision harkens back to a quieter agebefore radio or television—to the genteel domesticity of Victorian Little Womenin painted mustaches brandishing paper swords from atop a piano-bench pirateship—a time when even grownups knew how to pretend and were not afraid to put onsilly hats and be a king or a queen or a villain for an evening. Such magickpenetrates deeper into our genetic history than the nineteenth century. Allmagick started as drama, and all drama started in the home.015%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell.jpg [image/015creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]Our homemade sun (son) god with (his mother) Scorpio-Apophis. Preparing foranother backyard Rite of Sol, c. 1989. This was the second or third yearJean-Paul volunteered to play the part of the martyred sun god. It looks herelike he’s thinking of retiring the role._____Constance and I have been turning our home into a theater since 1978. The O.T.O.degree initiation ceremonies and Gnostic Masses are fully costumed and elaborateaffairs, sometimes requiring several rooms furnished with heavy, custom-madepieces of equipment and paraphernalia. In 1982 we expanded our roles as magicalimpresarios and added the Rites of Eleusis to our playbill. Eventually we addedto our repertoire the Rite of Earth, which forms the last section of this book.But before we look at the rite itself, I’d like to offer some practical hints asto how almost anyone can mount a rather elaborate dramatic ritual presentationin their own home or apartment. It’s a lot of work, but it’s also a lot of fun,and it is (or can be) magick of the highest order.Our magical rites didn’t start out as magical rites at all. In fact, theystarted for us as an informal gathering of friends. One summer we simply inviteda dozen or so friends over to celebrate the summer solstice with a potluckdinner party in our backyard. After everyone was sated and mellow, I gave eachof our unsuspecting guests a script for Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.(I made the booklets of this delightful comedy by copying them from my own oldvolume of Shakespeare, then printing and stapling them at work when no one waswatching. I also carefully “highlighted” each script so it could be easily readby each individual character.)We poured each “actor” another glass of wine and lit some torches and candles.Then I assigned59 each confused partier a part and we were off! In short order,everyone was bitten by the thespian bug, and we discovered hidden talents in ourfriends that we never dreamed were there. The play was a roaring success!Everyone insisted we do it again the following year. After this informalread-through production, we knew we could do even more with our wonderfulfriends, and for the next twelve years or so, we did quite a bit more.011.jpg [image/011_fmt.png]“Children, what is your will with me?” From the performance of a dining-roomRite of Saturn, c. 1985.Constance, as Mater Cœli (Mother of Heaven), has just been pulled through theveil of the Abyss by Brother Aquarius to aid in the invocation of the Master ofthe Temple (Saturn—me), who is still hidden behind the veil.

I love this stuff!_____013.jpg [image/013_fmt.png]As Aries looks on, Soror Scorpio crowns Mars. Note the signs of Aries andScorpio on the thrones on either side of Mars. For this performance, Mars isplayed by David P. Wilson (S. Jason Black). From the Rite of Mars, c. 1986._____OutdoorsSome dramatic rituals can be presented outside, and our backyards have been thescene of many. Naturally the weather needs to cooperate, but when it does, yardspace is preferable to the cramped quarters of your living room or garage.The stage can be anywhere you want it to be, preferably in a well-lit area ofthe yard and easily visible to a maximum number of people. If the ritual is donein the daylight hours, it is of course preferable that the audience sit in theshade. If there is no shaded area for them, set up temporary awnings or issueumbrellas.If the ceremony requires veils (and many of them do), they can be strung onwires running between trees (and buildings) or between simply constructed poles.Perhaps the most simple and elegant way to “veil” a scene is by using two robedvolunteers to hold up a length of colored fabric. These two volunteers alsoserve as the left and right columns of the proscenium arch of your stage.Different locations and scenes can be represented by the placement of simplebits of “furniture.” For outdoor ceremonies, a garden birdbath can be a river,an ocean, an oasis, or a garden, and a garden pedestal can be a temple or acastle. Potted plants and trees can be moved around to demarcate differentscenes within the rite.Finally, what about the neighbors?You, of course, will want to be a good neighbor. If your neighbors can easilysee and hear what’s going on in your backyard, you will need to limit yourevents to those that are not secret, proprietary, or degree-sensitive to aparticular society, order, or organization. Also, if you have little or noprivacy from the neighbors, it is wise not to include elements of profanity,nudity, or overly loud music.Like it or not, it is probably best to inform your neighbors in advance that youare having a gathering of friends and are going to be putting on a littlehomemade play. In fact, it is polite and proper that you actually invite them tothe event. That can be a little scary, but chances are very slim that they willaccept your invitation, and even if they do, the world will probably not end ifthey see a well-organized (if completely incomprehensible) play in theneighbor’s backyard. Chances are they will just enjoy the beer.Once we got serious about mounting homemade dramatic rituals, we turned to theRites of Eleusis, which are a series of seven ritual dramas written by AleisterCrowley, each focusing on the character and mythology of one of the sevenplanetary gods of antiquity (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, andLuna). In 1910 Crowley publicly presented the ceremonies for the first time atCaxton Hall in London, where they were generally well received. They did notspring Minerva-like and fully formed from Crowley’s brain, however. They startedquite demurely as an evening of homemade theater.008%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell.jpg [image/008creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]“In my heart is fidelity, fidelity, fidelity!” A square of red cloth thrown overa plain white robe makes a comfortable and passable toga. Add a broom-handlelance and voilà! Instant Brother Leo for a backyard Rite of Sol._____Crowley and his disciple Miss Leila Waddell (a professional violinist) had justenjoyed a quiet dinner at the home of a friend, and volunteered to entertaintheir host and the other guests with a little poetry and music. Over cognac andcigars, Crowley recited one of his poems, then Leila played her violin. Everyoneseemed to enjoy the duel of verse and music, so they each did another round.Crowley observed a tangible change in consciousness in the mellow and satedaudience that swung wildly depending on the energy and character of theparticular poem or musical piece. Before the evening was over, Crowley wasconvinced that he had discovered the secret formula of the great mystery schoolsof antiquity—that theater, music, poetry, and dance could be used to profoundlyalter and elevate human consciousness. He went home and immediately started towrite the prototype ritual that would eventually become the Rites of Eleusis.60The Rites of Eleusis are not plays per se. The action is not driven by a clearlyrecognizable plot. One immediately observes that the poetry, music, and dancenumbers don’t always have a direct connection to the mythological theme of therite. The primary goal of the ceremony is instead to create a specific kind ofmood, reverie, or trance in the consciousness of the individual members of theaudience. If you feel melancholy and depressed at the conclusion of the Rite ofSaturn, good! If you are happy and in a generous mood after the Rite of Jupiter,good! If you are in love and a little horny after Venus, perfect!Largely due to the efforts of newly organized O.T.O. bodies in California, theRites of Eleusis were resurrected in the late 1970s, and our lodge mounted theentire series every year throughout most of the 1980s. They were very popularand gave us the opportunity to introduce magick (and our lodge) to a largercommunity. Everyone involved found themselves transformed in some way by theexperience.In 1985, while preparing for yet another season of the rites, someone suggestedthat it would be nice (and magically appropriate) if we added at the conclusionof the series a Rite of Earth, to bring us all the way down the Tree of Life toMalkuth—to ground us and properly seal our efforts for the year. The myth of theearth goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone seemed like the ideal themefor such a ceremony; after all, this was the central myth of the ancientEleusinian mysteries. So, completely ignoring my lack of talent for such things,I set to work to assemble a homemade Rite of Earth.I say “assemble” because I did not actually need to write very much of the Riteof Earth. I simply started with the classic story, which I drew from an oldtranslation of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter 61 and then weaved in various poemsand prose by Crowley that related in some way to elements of the story. I hopedthat when it was all put together and performed, it would evoke the appropriatemood. At least it would actually add a traditional Eleusinian rite to the Ritesof Eleusis.For several years we decorated our ancient garage as the underworld, and ourgroaning garage door opener served as the terrifying jaws of Hell, which yawnedopen to let Hades (me) snatch innocent Persephone (Constance) and carry her offto my underground kingdom—an act that thoroughly startled and delighted all inattendance.The rite was great fun to present and became for us a permanent epilogue to ouryearly rites season. In 1989, to observe the eleventh anniversary of thechartering of our lodge, I printed commemorative scripts of our Rite of Earth togive out as gifts to the cast, crew, and attending “mystes.” These have becomesomewhat of a collector’s item. It is now with the greatest pleasure that Ipresent this rite to you. It represents, I believe, a fitting end to this littlebook of homemade magick. I hope you enjoy it.The Rite of Earth(from the Commemorative Handout)Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Some of you might think it a bit presumptuous of me to add an eighth rite toAleister Crowley’s original seven Rites of Eleusis—and maybe you would becorrect. Crowley’s original series descends the Tree of Life from Binah (thesphere of Saturn) to Yesod (the sphere of Luna) but does not include a ritecorresponding to Malkuth (the sphere of Earth). I certainly don’t want people tothink that the Rite of Earth is some recently unearthed Crowley manuscript or alost Liber. It is not.It is merely our attempt to capture and present a modest echo of the ancientEleusinian Rite of Demeter. As no one knows exactly what the candidates (mystes)experienced at Eleusis, we can only speculate from the hints handed down throughthe works of Homer and a handful of others.For our purposes, I have relied heavily on my savagely edited treatment of theHomeric Hymn to Demeter 62 as the narrative, coupled with selections fromAleister Crowley’s epic poem Orpheus63 and his visionary works The Vision andthe Voice 64 and Liber LXV,65 which I have used to move the play along. Inaddition to these selections, I’ve clipped the short prose piece “The Earth”from The Equinox, vol. I, no. 6 66 (which is the same volume that originallycontained the seven Rites of Eleusis) and the poem “Nuit,” also from Orpheus.Crowley prefaced all his Rites of Eleusis with the astrologically appropriatesection from J. F. C. Fuller’s marvelous Treasure House of Images.67 I havetaken the liberty of doing the same with our little ritual.Over the years, many people who have experienced the Rite of Earth tell us it isa fitting ceremony to conclude our seasonal performance of the Rites of Eleusisand have encouraged us to make it available. We are happy to be able to presentit to you in this privately produced format. We hope you enjoy it.Konx Om Pax.Love is the law, love under will.Lon Milo DuQuetteMaster, Heru-ra-ha Lodge O.T.O., January 7, 1989The Rite of EarthDramatis PersonaeHERMES.

The audience participates throughout as the mystes—candidates forinitiation into the Eleusinian mysteries.ScenesThere are four scene locations (one indoors and three outdoors) that must bearranged so the officers and the audience en masse can move easily from scene toscene. They represent:1. The citadel of Eleusis. The rite opens and closes in this indoor room. Itshould be large and open enough to comfortably accommodate the audience andcast. Ideally it should have a hearth or fireplace, comfortable chairs for thosewho need them, and an array of floor cushions for everyone else. In the openingscene, the citadel is dimly lit with a few candles; in the closing scene, it isbrightly lit with many candles and lamps. Sweet-smelling incense is continuallyburning during both the opening and closing scenes.The backyard of the venue should be large enough to accommodate three outdoorscenes, two at opposite corners of the yard (the garden of Persephone and thethrone room of Hades) and a third directly in the center of the yard (the altarof Hecate).2. The garden of Persephone is an open space in one corner of the yard plantedwith (or displaying pots containing) narcissus flowers.3. The throne room of Hades (the underworld) is at the opposite corner of theyard and is an area enclosed by black hangings and strewn with skulls and bonesand emblems of death. It should be illuminated to reveal the throne of Hades andthe throne of his bride, Queen Persephone.4. The altar of Hecate is located in the center of the yard. It is simply awaist-high altar or small table stand supporting a bowl of flaming alcohol.There should be enough room around the altar for the mystes to circumambulateduring Demeter’s invocation of Hecate.The Rite of EarthThe rite begins in the dimly lit citadel of Eleusis, where the audience (themystes) are comfortably seated or lounging on floor pillows. The atmosphere isrelaxed. Candles and sweet-smelling incense are burning. For the moment,Persephone is the only cast member visible. When everything is ready, she standsand recites the “Twelvefold Renunciation of God and the Unity Thereof” fromLiber DCCCCLXIII (the Taurus chapter of the Treasure House of Images).PERSEPHONE:The Chapter known asThe Twelvefold Renunciation of Godand the Unity thereofIadoreThee by theTwelve Renunciationsand by the Unity thereof.1.

O my God, Thou Mighty One, Thou Creator of all things, I renounce unto Theethe goatish ache of the years, and the cryptic books, and all the majesty oftheir enshrouded words; so that I may be entangled in Thy wordless Wisdom, andbe consumed in the unutterable joy of Thine everlasting rapture.10. O my God, Thou Mighty One, Thou Creator of all things, I renounce unto Theethe wine-cups of merriment, and the eyes of the wanton bearers, and all the lureof their soft limbs; so that I may be made drunk on the vine of Thy splendour,and be consumed in the unutterable joy of Thine everlasting rapture.11. O my God, Thou Mighty One, Thou Creator of all things, I renounce unto Theethe hissing of mad waters, and the trumpeting of the thunder, and all Thytongues of dancing flame; so that I may be swept up in the breath of Thynostrils, and be consumed in the unutterable joy of Thine everlasting rapture.12. O my God, Thou Mighty One, Thou Creator of all things, I renounce unto Theethe crimson lust of the chase, and the blast of the brazen war-horns, and allthe gleaming of the spears; so that like an hart I may be brought to bay inThine arms, and be consumed in the unutterable joy of Thine everlasting rapture.13. O my God, Thou Mighty One, Thou Creator of all things, I renounce unto Theeall that Self which is myself, that black sun which shineth in Self’s day, whoseglory blindeth Thy Glory; so that I may become as a rushlight in Thine abode,and be consumed in the unutterable joy of Thine everlasting rapture.O Glory be unto Thee through all Timeand through all Space: Glory,Everlastingly. Amen,and Amen, andAmen.Persephone exits the citadel.The conductor, Hermes, enters and sits at the hearth. He encourages the mystesto make themselves comfortable and then relates to them the sacred story ofDemeter and Persephone.HERMES:Let me sing to you the song of Demeter, holy Deo, the lady of the harvest, thegreat mother goddess whose hair grew in rich plaits, and of her daughterPersephone, whom Hades, the lord of the underworld, seized for his bride. Zeus,the thunder god, gave the girl to him as she was playing far from her mothergathering flowers with the daughters of the ocean. Earth brought forth theNarcissus to lure her. Amazed at the beauty of the flower, she stretched outboth her hands to take it; as she did, the earth yawned open and Lord Hadesburst forth from the underworld in a golden chariot drawn by his immortalhorses. Screaming for pity and fighting him off, Persephone was dragged into thechariot, calling, “Father Zeus! Zeus!” But only the goddess Hecate, from hercave, and Lord Helius, the brilliant son of Hyperion, heard the poor girl’scries.The peaks of the mountains echoed with her voice until at last her mother alsoheard her cries. So bitter was the pain that seized Demeter’s heart that shetore the gossamer veil off her head and threw over her shoulders a great blackcloak, the mantle of death.Demeter flew swift as a bird over land and sea in search of her daughter, but noone, neither god nor mortal, dared tell her the truth. For nine days, holy Deowandered the earth carrying blazing torches in her hands. So great was her griefthat she refused the taste of ambrosia and the sweet nectar of the gods andshunned the bath. When dawn arrived on the tenth day, the goddess Hecate mether, holding a flame in her hand and bringing Demeter a message of herdaughter’s abduction—telling her of Lord Helius’s knowledge of the details ofthe divine conspiracy between Zeus and Hades. Hecate and Demeter then spedstraight to Helius, the sun, watchman of the gods and of men. Demeter said,“Helius, since we both are gods, you must help me! I bore a daughter, abeautiful child with a lovely face, whose cries I heard through uncharted skies,the cries of a captive—although I could not see anything with mine own eyes. Butyou, because you see everything, you must tell me the truth. Did you see whathappened to my child?Lord Helius replied, “Lady Demeter, you will know the truth. Zeus alone of theimmortals is to blame, for he gave the child to Hades, his own brother, to havefor his wife. But goddess, be comforted. Hades is your brother also, and is notan unfitting husband among the immortals. As for honor, he has his third of theworld that he received when the realms were first apportioned. He is the lordover all those he received and all with whom he dwells.”Hearing this, Demeter’s grief became anguish, and her heart swelled with wrath.Angry with Zeus, she shunned the assembly of gods on lofty Olympus and went indisguise to dwell among mortal men. No man or woman knew who she was. Shearrived at length at the holy city of Eleusis, where the citadel sits like acrown upon the city—home of the honored and Celeus, who at the time was lord ofEleusis. Coaxed by the four daughters of Celeus, Demeter (looking like a crone)became the nurse of the newborn son of Celeus and Lady Mataneira.During her stay with this blessed family the goddess refused all wine, takingonly a mixture of barley and water, and the tender leaves of glechon. She wouldlift the little baby in her immortal hands and hold him to her fragrant breastto nurse him. The child flourished and grew like a god, for he fed not onmother’s milk but on ambrosia with which Demeter anointed him—anointed as ifborn a god himself. She inspired him with her divine breath and sweetly rockedhim in her lap. At night, in a secret ceremony, she would bury him in the powersof the fire upon the hearth to forge within him the magic of immortality. Buthis parents knew none of this, and to them the child seemed a miracle—aprodigy—somehow divine. Demeter would have made him ageless and immortal if notfor the folly of Mataneira, his own mother.One night, watching from the sweet-smelling chamber, she spied on the goddess ather magick and, alarmed by what she saw, shrieked in terror for her child.Enraged at this mortal interruption, Demeter grabbed the child from the fire andhurled him to the ground.“All men are fools! They lack the sense to foresee their fate as it comes uponthem—good or ill—whatever it may be. I swear by the river Styx, I would havemade this child ageless for all time, and I would have granted him undyinghonor. Now he can never escape the demons that shall bring his death!”As she said this, she transformed herself to her true and glorious beauty. Thepalace was filled with the terrible brilliance of a thousand bolts of lightning.“I am Demeter, the one supreme in honor, for I am the source of life and joyboth for mortals and immortals. This is what you must do: Have all your peoplebuild me a temple with an altar before it. Let it be built beside the fortressof the high city. I myself shall institute my rites so that you may perform themand, by doing so, appease my wrath.”When the people had finished the temple, they went home, each to his own house.But Demeter remained there, sitting apart from all the blessed gods and wastingaway with longing for her daughter. Then she created a deadly year for mankind,withering the soil that once was so nourishing. The earth would not send upseeds because she kept them hidden.Seeing this, Zeus feared in his heart that if mankind should perish, who thenwould honor and give sacrifice to the gods? So he sent Iris, who flies on wingsof gold, to call upon Demeter and coax her back to the joys of Olympus. ButDemeter’s mind would not be changed. Then Father Zeus sent out all the blessedgods. One by one they went to her and gave her many splendid gifts and let herchoose as much honor as she might want among the immortals. But none couldpersuade her to change her mind. She said she would never again set foot onOlympus or let the earth bear fruit unless she saw her daughter with her owneyes.Finally Zeus sent Hermes to great Hades so that he might exhort him with softwords to let him lead holy Persephone out of the sunless west into the light.Then her mother would see her with her own eyes and change her mind.So, leaving the seat of Olympus, Hermes obeyed and rushed through the hollows ofthe earth. He found the lord of the dead seated in his house on a couch with hisawesome wife, but she was not there by her own will. She longed only to be withher mother, who was far away.Hermes said to Hades, “Lord of death, Father Zeus commanded me to lead gloriousPersephone out of Erebus and back to the gods to appease her mother’s wrath andhorrible anger against the gods. Demeter is planning a great act of vengeance.She is going to destroy the feeble race of mortals who dwell on earth and socause the honors that are paid to the gods to perish.”Hades smiled and told Persephone that she could go and rejoin her mother and thegods. But first, he suggested she refresh herself by eating of a pomegranate.Secretly, he knew that if she ate of the fruit of the underworld, she could notremain forever with her mother, but instead must return to the underworld andspend one third of each year as his bride.Hermes took Persephone to the temple of Demeter at Eleusis, where her motherawaited her. When she saw her daughter, Demeter ran to her like a maenad racingmadly through mountain woods. Persephone, for her part, when seeing her mother’sbeautiful eyes, leaped from the chariot of Hermes and fell on her knees,embracing her mother.The joyous reunion was marred by Demeter’s discovery of Hades’s trick, for sheknew that if her daughter had taken food of the underworld, then their reunionmust be broken for one third of each year. But their embrace finally softenedtheir grief, each giving and receiving joy.Then to them came Hecate, who wears a delicate veil. She also caressed thedaughter of holy Demeter, and from that time on, Lady Hecate was the companionof Persephone. Father Zeus then sent Rhea, his own mother, to escort Demeterback to the race of the gods. Then Zeus promised to give her whatever honors shewanted from the immortal gods, and he consented to the plan that Persephonespend one third of each spiraling year in the dark, where the sun goes down, andtwo thirds with her mother and the other immortals. Then Demeter made fruitsspring up from the rich plowlands and the whole world became heavy with leavesand flowers.PART IIHermes now marshals the mystes and prepares to lead them to the outdoor scenedepicting the garden of Persephone. They are stopped at the door by the Heraldof Darkness, who holds a torch and an urn of wine, which he empties onto theground in front of them.HERALD OF DARKNESS:The voice of my Undying and Secret Soul said unto me, “Let me enter the Path ofDarkness, and, peradventure, there I shall find the Light.”The Herald of Darkness then opens the door and lights the way for Hermes and themystes. They enter the garden, where they find Persephone and the daughters ofthe ocean gathering flowers. Hermes narrates:HERMES:This is the daughter of the king. This is the virgin of eternity. This is shethat the holy one hath wrested from the giant time, and the prize of them thathave overcome space. This is she that is set upon the throne of understanding.Holy, holy, holy is her name, not to be spoken among men. For Kore they havecalled her, and Malkah, and Betulah, and Persephone. And the poets have feignedsongs about her, and the prophets have spoken vain things and the young men havedreamed vain dreams; but this is she, that immaculate, the name of whose namemay not be spoken. Thought cannot pierce the glory that defendeth her, forthought is smitten dead before her presence. Memory is blank and in the mostancient books of magick are neither words to conjure her, nor adorations topraise her. Will bends like a reed in the tempests that sweep the borders of herkingdom and the imagination cannot figure so much as one petal of the lilieswhereon she standeth in the lake of crystal, in the sea of glass.68There was a maiden that strayed among the corn, and sighed; then grew a newbirth, a narcissus, and therein she forgot her sighing and her loneliness. Eveninstantly rode Hades heavily upon her and ravished her away.69The earth opens and Hades is seen abducting Persephone to his temple of theunderworld.PERSEPHONE:Zeus! Zeus!Following the abduction of Persephone, the temple of the underworld closesbehind Hades and Persephone. Hermes directs the mystes to join him and followDemeter on her journey in search of her missing daughter. In the process of herjourney, they bear witness to her invocation of Hecate. (Demeter stands in thecenter of the yard, at the altar of Hecate. She lights the bowl of alcohol andrecites the Invocation of Hecate. During the invocation, the mystescircumambulate Demeter and the flaming bowl nine times in a clockwisedirection.)DEMETER [Invoking HECATE]:70O triple form of darkness! Sombre splendour!Thou moon unseen of men! Thou huntress dread!Thou crowned demon of the crownless dead!O breasts of blood, too bitter and too tender!Unseen of gentle spring,Let me the offeringBring to thy shrine’s sepulchral glittering!I slay the swart beast! I bestow the bloomSown in the dusk, and gathered in the gloomUnder the waning moon,At midnight hardly lightening the East;And the black lamb from the black ewe’s dead wombI bring, and stir the slow infernal tuneFit for thy chosen priest.Here where the band of Ocean breaks the roadBlack-trodden, deeply-stooping, to the abyss,I shall salute thee with the nameless kissPronounced toward the uttermost abodeOf thy supreme desire.I shall illume the fireWhence thy wild stryges shall obey the lyre,Whence thy Lemurs shall gather and spring round,Girdling me in the sad funereal groundWith faces turned back,My face averted! I shall consummateThe awful act of worship, O renownedFear upon earth, and fear in hell, and blackFear in the sky beyond Fate!I hear the whining of thy wolves! I hearThe howling of the hounds about thy form,Who comest in the terror of thy storm,And night falls faster ere thine eyes appearGlittering through the mist.O face of woman unkissedSave by the dead whose love is taken ere they wist!Thee, thee I call! O dire one! O divine!I, the sole mortal, seek thy deadly shrine,Pour the dark stream of blood,A sleepy and reluctant riverEven as thou drawest, with thine eyes on mine,To me across the sense-bewildering floodThat holds my soul for ever!The night falls back;The shadows give place;The threefold formAppears in the black,As a direful faceHalf seen in the storm.I worship, I praiseThe wonderful waysWhere the smitten raysOf darkness sunder.The hand is lifted;The gates are rifted;The sound is as thunder!She comes to the summons,Her face as a woman’s,Her feet as a Fear’s,Turned back on her pathFor a sign of wrath: —She appears, she appears!At the conclusion of the invocation, the goddess Hecate appears before the altarof Hecate. She holds a lamp in her hands. She touches Demeter softly on thecheek, then points an accusatory finger toward the corner of the yard thatconceals the throne of Hades. But before they travel there, they are met by Irisand the gods of Olympus.IRIS:Ye fruits and corn,Gold, rose and greenVines purple-born,Pearl-hidden sheen,Trees waving in scornOf the grass betweenCome forth in your chorus and chant raise of you mother and queen.Most musical movesThe head of the corn;Strong glorious lovesOf its being are born.Dim shadows of grovesOf Demeter adornThe waves and the woods of the Earth, the heart of the mother forlorn.Turning to Demeter, Iris pleads:Olympus aloneOf Earth’s glories is takenFor Deity’s throneDeep-frozen, storm-shakenWhat glories are shownWhen their slumbers awaken!The avalanche thunders adown, and the gods of the gods are forsaken.POSEIDON (or other god or IRIS):Wan grows Aphroditeand Artemis frail;Apollo less mighty.Red Bacchus too pale.Dark Hades grows bright.He alone may availWhen the god andTurning to Demeter, Poseidon pleads:Olympus aloneOf Earth’s glories is takenFor Deity’s throneDeep-frozen, storm-shakenWhat glories are shownWhen their slumbers awaken!The avalanche thunders adown, and the gods of the gods are forsaken.APOLLO (or other god or IRIS):Ye trees many-frondedThat shake to the wind,Green leaves that have soundedMy harp in your kind,Light boughs that are rounded,Grey tops that are shrinedIn the tears of the heaven as they fall, in the blackening storm grown blind!As mountains upliftAs an arrow in air;Ice-crowned, rock-cliffed,Snow-Bosomed bare,I give you the giftOf a voice more fair,Leave echo, and wake, and proclaim that ye stand against death and despair!Turning to Demeter, Apollo pleads:Olympus aloneOf Earth’s glories is takenFor Deity’s throneDeep-frozen, storm-shakenWhat glories are shownWhen their slumbers awaken!The avalanche thunders adown, and the gods of the gods are forsaken.The mystes are now led from the scene to the area outside the temple of theunderworld. There they are met by Cerberus, who stands in the way. Hermes throwsa honey cake to distract the three-headed dog. As Cerberus chases the honeycakes, Hermes is able to reveal the scene inside the temple of the underworld.All now can see Lord Hades seated on his throne with his lovely bride.PERSEPHONE:Ah me! no fruit for guerdon,Who bore the blossom’s burden.There shines no sunlight toward Persephone.Ravished, O iron-eyed!From my young sisters’ side,Torn and dragged down below the sundered sea,No joy is mine in all thy bed,And all thy sorrow shaken on my head.HADES:Goddess, cease your great lament, for I am the brother of your father and motherand not an unfitting husband among the immortals. Zeus himself gave you to mefor my bride. I am the lord of death and all things return to me. As for honor,you share with me the rulership of one third of the world.PERSEPHONE:Cursed above gods be thouWhose blind unruffled browRules the grim place of unsubstantial things!Hated, to me thy faceTurns not the glance of grace.I rule unloved above the infernal kings,And only thee in all deep HellI charm in vain, despair my royal spell.Thou mockest me with power;Thy sceptre’s awful dowerAvails me nothing …Inexorable Lord!Accursed and abhorredOf men, begin in Hell to show thy grace!Not to a man’s weak life,Not to thy shuddering wife,But to the queen’s unfathomable faceDread beyond sorcery and prayer,And fearful even because it is so fair!Yea, from the ghastly throneUnchallenged and unknownLet the fierce accents roll athwart the skies!My voice is given, my powerFares forth to save the flowerBroken but plucked not by these fingers wise.I love the song — be thou not mute,But turn a lucky lot towards the suit!HERMES (addressing HADES):Lord of death, Father Zeus commanded me to lead glorious Persephone out ofErebus and back to the gods to appease her mother’s horrible anger against theimmortals. Demeter has a furious wrath and won’t mingle with the gods; instead,she sits apart from us in her fragrant temple, which is scented with incense,and she holds as her domain now the rocky citadel of Eleusis.HADES:This passes all. Relent. Release. Depart! I yield. My power is broken, and myheart riven, and all my pride ruined, and me compelled to earth to lose(Persephone).71Hades offers Persephone the pomegranate. She eats three seeds.HADES:Well be it so. O wizard, by this strength thou has availed in deepest Hell atlength. I grant thy prayer. Persephone72 is given to the sweet light andpleasant air of heaven! Even on this wise. With Hermes for a guide, up the dreadsteeps there followeth thee my bride.PART IIIHermes and Persephone and the Herald of Darkness lead the mystes back to the(now brightly lit) citadel. They are barred at the threshold by the Herald ofLight, who holds a torch and a full urn of wine. He empties the urn of wine onthe ground and says:HERALD OF LIGHT:Light dawning in Darkness is thy Name,Lord of the Universe … The vast and the Mighty One! Ruler of the Light and ofthe Darkness. We adore Thee and we invoke Thee!Look with favour upon these Mystes and Grant thine aid unto the higheraspirations of their souls.The Herald of Light stands aside and allows all to reenter the citadel, wherethey witness the reunion of Demeter and Persephone.PERSEPHONE:By the might of famine longAnd supplication strongDemeter won the swift Hermetic word!In bitter days of eldThus by great force compelledThe glad Earth saw me, careless of my lord.Rise to her crystal streams and sapphire seas.Mother and daughter embrace. Persephone continues:Ah me! I feel a stirring in my bloodPours through my veins a delicate paleflood of memory, not the pale andterrible Goddess whose throne is manifestin Hell. I am again a child, a playful child.INTERMISSIONThe mystes applaud and find seats or floor pillows. The “gods” serve water andwine, dates, figs, dried fruit, and other delicacies. All enjoy a briefintermission and refreshments. Hermes and our actors stay in character and neverallow the mystes to forget the ceremony is still in progress.When the intermission is over and everyone is quiet again, Demeter stands andrecites “The Earth.”DEMETER:The Earth73THE child of miracle to the world, greeting.I reach my hands to the leaves and dabble in the dew: I sprinkle dew on you forkisses. I kneel down and hold the grass of the black earth to my bosom; I crushthe earth to my lips as if it were a grape. And the wine of Demeter flushes mycheeks; they burn with joy of youth.Why should I greet the world? Because my heart is bursting with love for theworld. Love, say I? Why not lust? Is not lust strength, and merriment, and thefamine that only the infinite can stay?And why do I call myself the child of miracle? Because I have entered a secondtime into my mother’s womb and am born. Because to the knowledge of manhood hascome the passion, even the folly, of adolescence; with all its pride and purity.It is for this that you see me lying upon the thick wet grass, unquenchable; orrejoicing in the fat black loam.Now the manner of the miracle was this. In the beginning is given to a youth thevision of his mate. This one must he henceforth seek blindly; and many are theenchantments and disenchantments. Through this his vision fades; even his hungerdies away unless he be indeed Elect. But in the end it may be that God shallsend him the other half of that Token of Paradise. Then, if he have kept theholy fire alight, perhaps with much false fuel, that fire shall instant blazeand fill the temple of his soul. By its insistent energy it shall destroy eventhe memory of all those marsh-lights that came to greet it; and the priest shallbow down in the glory, and grasp the altar with his hands, and strike it withhis forehead seven times. Now this altar is the earthen altar of Demeter.Then understanding all things by the light of that love, he shall know that thisis love, that this is the soul of the earth, that this is fertility andunderstanding, the secret of Demeter. Nay, (even!) the Oracle may speak in hisheart and foretell or foreshadow the greater mysteries of Persephone, of Deaththe daughter of Love.Those, too, who are thus reborn will understand that I who write these words amstretched on the wet earth on the day of Spring. It is night, but only the seawhispers of Persephone, as the stars intimate Urania whose mystery is the third,and beyond. My body is absorbed in scent and touch; for the consuming fire of mysight has burnt itself out to blindness, and in my mouth is only the savour ofan infinite kiss. The moist earth burns my lips; my fingers search down aboutthe roots of the grass. The life of earth itself is my life: I shall be glad tobe buried in the earth. Let my body dissolve into hers, putrefy in her revivinglimbeck. He never loved who let them case him in a coffin from the supremeembrace.It is from the earth, bride of the sun, that all bodily strength derives. It isno figure that Antaeus regained all his force when he touched earth. It is nopedantry and folly of the Hindus, who (fearing bodily lust) isolate theiracolytes from earth, no futility their doctrine of Prana and the Tamo-Guna. Itis not mere faith healing, this hygiene of Father Kneipp, and his failures arethose who retain decorum and melancholy, who follow the letter and not thespirit, cold-blooded treaders upon earth instead of passionate lovers of itsstrength.It is no accident of mythology that the Titans made war upon the Gods, and inPrometheus overthrew them.It was when Canute failed to drive back the sea that his dynasty was lost tothat Norman William who caught hold of Mother Earth with both hands.When I was a child I fell; and the scars of the earth are on my forehead at thishour.When I was a boy I was hurt by the explosion of a buried jar of gunpowder; andthe scars of the earth are on my face at this hour.Since then I have been the lover of the earth, that wooed me thus roughly. Manya night have I slept upon her naked breast, in forest and on glacier, upon greatplains and upon lonely crags, in heat and cold, fair weather and foul; and myblood is the blood of the earth. My life is hers, and as she is a spark thrownoff from the whirling brilliance of the sun, so do I know myself to be a sparkof infinite God.Seek earth, and heaven shall be added unto you! Back to our mother, drive theshining spade into her womb! Wrinkle her with your furrows, she will only smilemore kindly!Let your sweat, the sweat of your toil, which is your passion, drip likebenediction from on High upon her; she will render corn and wine. Also your wifeshall be desirable in your eyes all the days of your life, and your childrenshall be strong and comely, and the blessing of the Most High shall be upon you.Then let your grasp relax in the satiety of death, and your weight shall cumberthe earth, and the little children of the earth shall make merry with you untilthe rose strike its root into your breast. Then shall your body be one againwith the mother, and your soul one with the Father, as it is written in the Bookof the Law.All this have I been taught by her whose purity and strength are even asEarth’s, chosen before the foundation of Time. Lioness with lion, may we walk bynight among the ruins of great cities, when, weary with happiness too great evenfor our immortality, we turn from the fragrance and fertility of Earth. And atthe sunrise return where the peopled valleys call us; where, bronzed andbuoyant, our children sing aloud as they drive home the spade.Glory be to the Earth and to the Sun and to the holy body and soul of Man; andglory be to Love and to the Father of Love, the secret Unity of things!Glory be to the Shrine within the Temple, and to the God within the Shrine, tothe Word and to the Silence that bore it unto Him that is beyond the Silence andthe Speech!Also thanksgiving in the Highest for the Gift of all these things, and for themaiden in whom all these things are found, for the holy body and soul of man,and for the sun, and for the earth. AMEN.Demeter sits among the mystes. Persephone stands and recites the “Exordium fromNuit.”74Exordium from NuitEnough. It is ended, the storyOf magical æons of song;The sun is gone down in his gloryTo the Houses of Hate and of Wrong.Would ye see if he rise?In Hesperian skiesYe may look for his rising for long.The magical æon beginnethOf song in the heart of desire,That smiteth and striveth and sinneth,But burns up the soul of the lyre:There is pain in the note:In the sorcerer’s throatIs a sword, and his brain is afire!Long after (to men: but a momentTo me in my mansion of rest)Is a sundawn to blaze what the glow meantSeen long after death in the west;A magical æon!Nor love-song nor pæan,But a flame with a silvery crest.There shall rise a sweet song of the soulFar deeper than love or distress;Beyond mortals and gods shall it roll;It shall find me, and crave, and caress.Ah! me it shall captureIn torrents of rapture;It shall flood me, and fill, and possess.For brighter from age unto ageThe weary old world shall renewIts life at the lips of the sage,Its love at the lips of the dew.With kisses and tearsThe return of the yearsIs sure as the starlight is true.Yet the drift of the stars is to beauty,To strength, and to infinite pleasure.The toil and worship and dutyShall turn them to laughter and leisure.Were the world understood Ye would see it was good,A dance to a delicate measure.Ye fools, interweaving in passionThe lyrical light of the mind!Go on in your drivelling fashion!Ye shall surely seek long and not find.From without ye may seeAll the beauty of me,And my lips, that their kisses are kind.For Eurodice once I lamented;For Orpheus I do not lament:Her days were a span, and demented;His days are for aye, and content.Mere love is as noughtTo the love that is Thought,And idea is more than event.O lovers! O poets! O mastersOf me, ye may ravish my frown!Aloof from my chocks and disasters!Impatient to kiss me, and crown!I am eager to yield.In the warrior fieldYe shall fight me, and fasten me down.O poets! O masters! O lovers!Sweet souls of the strength of the sun!The couch of eternity coversOur loves, and our dreams are as done.Reality closesOur life into roses;We are infinite space: we are one.There is one that hath sought me and found meIn the heart of the sand and the snow:He hath caught me, and held me, and bound me,In the lands where no flowers may grow.His voice is a spell,Hath enchanted me well!I am his, did I will it or no.But I will it, I will it, I will it!His speck of a soul in its carsShall lift up immensity! fill itWith light of his lyrical bars.His soul shall concentreAll space; he shall enterThe beautiful land of the stars.He shall know me eternally weddedTo the splendid and subtle of mind;For the pious, the arrogant-headed,He shall know they nor seek me nor find.O afloat in me curled!Cry aloud to the worldThat I and my kisses are kind!O lover! O poet! O maidenTo me in my magical way!Be thy songs with the wilderness laden!Thy lyre be adrift and astray:So to me thou shalt cling!So to me thou shalt singOf the beautiful law of the day!I forbid thee to weep or to worship;I forbid thee to sing or to write!The Star-Goddess guideth us her ship;The sails belly out with the light.Beautiful head!We will sing on our bedOf the beautiful law of the Night!We are lulled by the whirr of the stars;We are fanned by the whisper, the wind;We are locked in unbreakable bars,The love of the spirit and mind.The infinite powersOf rapture are ours;We are one, and our kisses are kind.HERMES:Then Demeter went forth to the kings who administer justice: Triptolemus, andDiocles (who drives horses), and mighty Eumolpus, and Celeus (the leader of hispeople). To them she showed the performance of her rites and taught hermysteries—holy rites that are awesome, that no one may transgress, nor reveal,nor express in word, for an overwhelming reverence for the gods stops his voice.Whoever among men walking the earth has seen these mysteries is blessed—butwhoever is uninitiated and has not received his share of the rite, he will nothave the same lot as the others—once he is dead and dwells in the mold where thesun goes down.The entire casts of gods and heralds enter the citadel and array themselvesaround Demeter and Persephone.HERMES (continues):And when the goddess among goddesses had taught them everything, she went toOlympus to be in the company of the other gods. There the two goddesses livewith Zeus, who delights in the thunderbolt, and they are holy and revered.Whomever the goddesses love among men who walk the earth, he is blessed, forthey soon send Plutus who gives wealth to mortal men.Hermes now kneels before Demeter and Persephone.HERMES (continues):But come now, you goddesses who preside over the city of Eleusis, where incenseperfumes the air—you two who also have domain on Paros, surrounded by the sea,and in mountainous Antron—you, Lady Deo, who brings in the seasons and givessplendid gifts; you and your beautiful daughter Persephone … come now, grant mean easy life for my song. And still again may I pray to sing you a song.ENTIRE CAST AND MYSTES:Konx Om Pax.THE END[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]58.

We open our house to our partygoingfriends who are traveling to or from bigger and wilder celebrations and givethem a chance to pause and refresh themselves before going on to the greatcelebrations or returning home to their cozy beds. Our home is convenientlylocated midway on the party caravan trail between Los Angeles and South OrangeCounty and San Diego, and a surprising number of vagabond revelers takeadvantage of our little way station.Besides tea and snacks, we offer them the opportunity during their short visitto divine their fortunes for the coming year. If requested, I’ll read theirTarot cards or help them with an I Ching or a geomantic reading. This quietoasis during an otherwise loud and raucous day and night provides for many ofour comrades a rare chance to truly reflect on their lives during the year thatis passing away and the possibilities for the year to come—to look both forwardand backward, like the two-faced Roman god Janus, god of gates and doors,beginnings and endings—and the month of January.Our wayfarers’ magical experience begins at the threshold of our front door.It’s a simple ritual that was inspired by Constance’s visit to the great templesof Japan. Before entering the temple, the pilgrims pause at an outdoor shrineand ceremonially wash their hands with pure water that is poured from a bambooladle. Then, with clean hands, they take a stick of incense and light it from aperpetual flame and place the burning incense in a container of sand. Sometimesthey clap their hands as if to call the gods’ attention to this offering, orelse pause for meditation and prayer. Finally, they leave a few coins in anothernearby vessel and continue their pilgrimage.While our shrine is not as ornate as those of the Japanese temples, Constancenevertheless creates a beautiful version of this array of ritual objects on thestone bench that graces our tiny outer portico. There she places three largechina bowls—one filled with pure water, one filled with sand, and one for coins.In the back of the bowl of sand, she places a lit votive candle. In front ofeverything, she stacks large amounts of Japanese stick incense.And how do our guests know how to behave? Well, many of them know either fromexperience or from spiritual instinct what to do. But just in case, Constanceposts a beautifully drawn and decorated sign that simply reads:AT THE GATE OF THE NEW YEARNew Year’s Ritual of WelcomePurify your hands with water so you may receive peace.Light a stick of incense so you may receive freedom.Offer a coin so you may receive stability.Can you think of better gifts for the New Year?016%20credit%20Richard%20T%20Wardell%20FULL%20PAGE.jpg[image/016creditRichardTWa_fmt.png]KONX OM PAX[contents] [Contents.xhtml#x-contents-]"},{"pageContent":"Eliphas Levi’s“Prayers to the Elementals” 75Prayer of the Gnomes or Earth SpiritsO Invisible King, who, taking the Earth for Foundation, didst hollow its depthsto fill them with Thy Almighty Power.
