These facts few psychologistswill dispute, and their admitted truth must establish for all time thegenuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale as a literary form.H.P. LOVECRAFT, Supernatural Horror in Literature“Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do you know of fear?Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deepand the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night,when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are bornand live and die all in darkness while the dire wolves grow gaunt and hungry,and the white walkers move through the woods.”GEORGE R.R. MARTIN, A Game of ThronesHorror is the literature of the damned; a demon-child art-form—conceived in thefertile depths of subconscious hell; gestated in the lonely womb of fear anddespair; brought to troubled birth by the midwife of tortured obsessions; andreared to grotesque maturity in the prison asylum of a terrified imagination.Horror, to be truly horror, must be more than a frightening story. It must be acloistered odyssey, a claustrophobic dance with madness. Above all, horror mustbe a traumatic and soul-mutating spiritual experience—sublime, elegant, andterrible.Sounds disturbing, doesn't it? I hope so. Horror should be disturbing. But, atfirst glance, classic horror seldom presents itself as the product of adisturbed mind. On the contrary, some of the best works of the genre areintroduced by a narrator who seems as sane and rational as you or I—an ordinarymind which, at the moment, is merely grappling with extraordinary psychologicalissues with which we all can more or less identify. But beware dear reader! Yourgentle empathy with the story's protagonist is a subtle poison that within abreathtakingly few paragraphs disrobes your soul and lulls you into a poppiedsleep. Naked and vulnerable (and now uncertain of your own sanity), horror drawsyou irresistibly into the mind of the main character of a nightmare.For me (or anyone who stubbornly refuses to grow up completely) literaturedoesn't get better than that.I turned nine years old in July of 1957, and was enduring my second melancholysummer of exile in the uncivilized wilderness of Nebraska.1 I realize the word“exile” probably sounds melodramatic, but I was a very melodramatic child in1957. Nebraska was for me an alien planet, cruel and hostile.I hadn't been born in Nebraska. I had been kidnapped by my own parents and takenthere against my will.2 I was a Southern California boy, and I thoroughlyenjoyed my first seven years in that hip and sunny fairyland where movies weremade; where rock-n-roll was evolving and the dreams and industries of the “SpaceAge” made us all feel like citizens of a bright and gleaming future. Thefamily's move to Nebraska in 1955 was in my eyes a doleful exodus back to thedark ages—a “trail of tears” from a twentieth-century beach paradise to anineteenth-century prairie hell. Powerless to change my circumstances, I poutedand steeped in a bitter broth of self-absorbed discontentment.I hated Nebraska. I hated Nebraskans. I hated the way they talked. I hated theway they laughed about butchering animals. I hated the way they preached abouttheir wrathful God—a God who hated Negroes and Chinese (even though there wasn'ta Negro or Chinese person within a hundred miles of our provincial town); a Godwho would condemn little boys to the flames of eternal torment just for the sinof not believing in a God who hated Negroes and Chinese. Most of all, I hatedthe way Nebraskans, young and old, actually took smug pride in their own lack ofsophistication. They wore their ingenuousness like a badge of honor, and rudelyridiculed and bullied anyone else who did not also proudly clothe themselveswith the same coarse robe of premeditated ignorance.I admit this must sound terribly unkind. “Hate” is a strong and unhealthypassion, especially for a nine-year-old boy. But hate springs from fear (real orimagined), and in my young mind there was much to fear in Nebraska. Even as ayoungster I sensed a palpable darkness; a prairie madness; a nameless evilbrooding just underneath the surface of the bib overalls and cotton housedresses; a slumbering beast just waiting to be awakened by the kiss of alcoholor jealousy or greed or lust; an evil that is ever mindful that the nearestpoliceman is many miles (and perhaps hours) away; a black and primitivewickedness that takes poisonous root in the solitary psyche of those who toilalone in the earth from dawn to dusk, season after season, year after year; anevil that smothers in the heart all breath of human compassion or empathy forthe pain and terror they inflict daily on the helpless beasts they breed forslaughter or the children they breed for labor and war; a twisted and perverseevil that feeds on guilt and self-loathing; an evil that incubates in thedeafening silence of sweltering summer nights or the perpetual darkness ofwinter and hideously hatches like a basilisk egg into monstrous acts of rape andincest, and murder, and suicide.The houses themselves are possessed of dark subconscious secrets—indeed, theyare built upon them. Unlike the sunny and uninsulated bungalows of SouthernCalifornia, Nebraska houses hide their own dungeons. Large as the footprint ofthe house itself, these cinder block chambers (the natives call them“basements”) offer a modicum of insulation from the frozen sod of winter, and anarea of damp coolness from the blistering heat of summer. Basements also provideresidents a dark hole in the ground in which to cower from the whirling deathclouds called tornadoes—tangible wind devils that regularly strike down frompus-green clouds and sweep across the earth, bringing grotesque death anddestruction to anything and everyone in their path.Yes. There was much for a young man to fear in Nebraska. I was lonely,depressed, and morose. One sweltering humid summer morning I became sodesperately bored I did something unthinkable for a nine-year-old boy inNebraska.I found something to read.That morning I lingered in my sweat-soaked bed until I knew I was alone in thehouse. I got up and turned on our old Raytheon television set in the living roombut could only get a scattered signal of a “farm report.” Like electricity andindoor toilets, television was new to rural Nebraska, and the few broadcaststations in operation were very far away. Reluctantly, I switched off thecrackling television and turned my attention to the living room bookcase. Ilooked for something—anything—that might alleviate my ennui or titillate my idlebrain.The family library had a few things that might distract me. My father was apretty interesting guy (a native Californian and very un-Nebraskan). He valuededucation and wanted his sons to cherish books, so he had recently purchased anew set of World Book Encyclopedia to display next to a few old sets of matchedvolumes of literature. I figured the encyclopedia would be too much likehomework, so I turned my attention to an old twenty-volume set of the World'sGreatest Literature.3At first glance The Last of the Mohicans looked like it might be fun, but I soondiscovered it much too grown-up and difficult. I finally settled on volume 8 ofthe series, Tales of Mystery and Imagination, by Edgar Allan Poe. I opened it upand saw to my delight that it was a collection of short stories with titles thatwere absolutely irresistible to a miserable nine-year-old boy: “The PrematureBurial,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Tell-Tale Heart,” and so on.Premature burials and red death sounded very promising indeed, but back inCalifornia I had actually seen a terrifying cartoon called “The Tell-Tale Heart”at the old Lakewood Theater.4 I recalled that my mother became very upset withmy older brother Marc for taking “little Lonnie” to see such an adult anddisturbing film. I poured myself a glass of buttermilk, plopped down in the bigchair by the open window, and opened the book.Once I started to read, however, I knew I was way out of my depth. There werelots of big words, incomprehensible foreign language phrases and epigrams, andgeographic references. Every other sentence seemed to make reference to someancient legend or myth or classic poem. I was forced to actually use thedictionary and encyclopedia just to plod my way through the first story, “ThePit and the Pendulum.” But I eventually did get through it, and after I closedthe book I realized I had become someone else—someone I liked who could use thedictionary and encyclopedia. I learned about the horrors of the SpanishInquisition (How delightfully evil was that!); I was exposed for the first timeto the melodically elegant use of the English language;5 most importantly, Idiscovered I was capable of being touched by art—capable of being possessed bypassion. My ennui lifted and was replaced by a pre-adolescent worship of themacabre and the genius and wit of its creators. This passion has yet to subside.I spent the rest of that summer with Poe . . . and the dictionary, and the WorldBook Encyclopedia.Ironically, the same nineteenth-century-esque liabilities I despised about 1950sNebraska life proved to be priceless assets of atmosphere that allowed me toconjure the perfect reading environment to savor the ecstasy of classic horror.Horror takes its time, and to properly appreciate it you must also take yourtime. It has a pace, a slow, incessant rhythm—like your own heartbeat, or yourown breath. After all, the great innovators of the art were writers of theGilded Age who wrote for a nineteenth- and early twentieth-century audience.6Nebraska in 1957 had both her feet planted firmly in the nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries. That summer morning in 1957 could have just as easily been1857, accompanied by the same soundtrack of bucolic silence; the same lightsearing through the same sun-stained yellow window shades; no hint of modernobjective reality, no diversions of bustling civilization; no diversions ofairplanes roaring overhead, no freeways in the distance, no sirens, notelevision, no radio, no air-conditioner; only the white noise of a millioncicadas and the hiss of my own blood running through my brain, the incessantswing of the pendulum of an ancient clock, the barking of a distant dog, thecawing of a crow, the almost imperceptible whisper of the delicate film ofcurtains as they billowed gently toward me like the gossamer negligée of alovesick ghost.This was the background music of my honeymoon with horror—playing as thehoney-sweet words of Edgar Allan Poe, lugubriously woven elegant phrases fromthe age of gilded manners into a symphony of tortured rapture. Only had I beenobliged to read the yellowing pages by the light of a whale oil lamp could myanachronistic reading experience have been more exquisitely atmospheric.I was so lucky.Today most of us find it almost impossible to recapture the sepiatoned worldthat best conducts horror from the page to the soul. Twenty-first-centuryreaders, spoiled by spectacular special effects of the cinema, demand instantgratification from the written word—explosive shocks and gore-splattered attacksupon the senses. We no longer allow ourselves time to refine the rapture ofterror. We wolf down the junk food snacks of violence and carnage when, withjust a little patience, we could leisurely savor a rich and soul-satisfyingbanquet of elegant horror. We are missing so much.That summer with Poe and my newly awakened love for the written word wouldeventually have profound effects upon my life, the most obvious being myeventual career as a writer. Writing is not only what I do for a living, it ismy art, my joy, my voice, my meditation, my prayer, my confession, mydeclaration of independence, my act of worship, my song of self-awareness. Myprofession, however, has taken many years to evolve and develop. My 1957 boyhoodlove affair with horror had more immediate and dramatic consequences. Simplyput—I woke up.Poe's narrative voice clearly revealed to me that I possessed my own narrativevoice. That hot summer morning, my consciousness instantly expanded. I no longerjust passively saw or heard or smelled or felt the things around me. I woke upand became consciously aware that I was seeing and hearing and smelling andfeeling the things around me. I became at once the observer and the observed ofmy own movie, and like the voice-over narration in a film-noir detective story Ibegan to tell myself the bedtime story of my own existence, and the narrationcontinues to this moment.Thank you, Edgar Allan Poe. Thank you, horror literature.The genre of classic horror has also changed the world. It can be argued thathorror is the mother of science fiction—and that science fiction has molded thefuture and touched the consciousness of countless millions of fans who now havegiven themselves permission to dream like gods. In its way, horror is thegrandmother of theoretical mathematics, quantum physics, and the mutation ofintelligence in this corner of the galaxy. But it all had to start somewhere,and the editors of this anthology have labored lovingly to pay homage to thefounding fathers of art form. Some of them, like Edgar Allan Poe, or H.P.Love-craft, or Bram Stoker, or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, require little or nointroduction. But others are perhaps less familiar to you. We have provided thebriefest of biographical sketches for all our authors at the beginning of eachselections, but I would like to take this opportunity to write a few extra wordsabout three of the stars of our production who also deserve, in my opinion, tobe recognized as founding fathers of horror:Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, who I believe should be credited with establishingearly in the nineteenth century the archetypal form and devices of the horrorgenre;Robert W. Chambers, who late in the nineteenth century broke the space-timemembrane of gothic horror and smashed open the doors of our subconscious—thesame doors from which H.P. Lovecraft's primordial “Old Ones” would ooze out,forcing us to cower before our shadow souls;and Aleister Crowley, a real-life, unapologetic black magician who early in thetwentieth century rolled up his sleeves and did battle with those shadows toturn demons of darkness into angels of light.SIR EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON (1803–1873)Have you ever heard these phrases?“It was a dark and stormy night...” or,“The pen is mightier than the sword...” or,“Pursuit of the almighty dollar”?These familiar clichés first poured forth from the pen of Sir EdwardBulwer-Lytton, the prolific English playwright, poet, and novelist. As might beexpected of a gentleman of his breeding, the noble Lord Lytton pursued theseliterary diversions as an amateur while he busied himself with the seriousduties of serving his Queen (Victoria) as Secretary of State for the Coloniesand a wide assortment of other stiff-collared diplomatic and politicalresponsibilities. He published his first book of poems in 1820, and in 1828,when his semi-titillating essay on the whimsical subject of nineteenth-centurydandyism was released, it was clear to the reading public that here was a fellowwho could be wryly entertaining as well as erudite.While his occult tales and horror stories have become favorites of lovers of themysterious and macabre, Lytton's most publicly beloved and familiar works remainhis post-biblical epic, The Last Days of Pompeii (1834), which has over theyears captured the imagination of filmmakers; and his dramatic historicalfiction, Rienzi (1835), which Richard Wagner turned into an enduring opera. Hispopularity with the general public notwithstanding, Lord Lytton deserves seriousrecognition as one of the primary godfathers of horror. This enduring admirationattests to his skill with words, but even more impressive are his impeccablecredentials among serious occultists.Although empirical evidence is absent, Lytton is said to have been an initiateof one or more of the mysterious continental magical secret societies thatobliquely claimed they were of ancient Rosicrucian origins. He was almostcertainly the friend and confidant of the great French magician, Alphonse LouisConstant (Eliphas Levi, 1810-1875), the father of modern ceremonial magic.As a young member of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC, I was instructed by my elderadepts (in no uncertain terms) that I was to read and study the works of LordLytton, especially his occult story Zanoni.7 Written in 1842 (a full generationbefore the founding of Madam Blavatsky's Theosophical Society or the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn), the opening words of Zanoni can be interpreted as aRosicrucian confession from Lord Lytton himself:It so chanced that some years ago, in my younger days, whether of authorship oflife, I felt the desire to make myself acquainted with the true origins andtenets of the singular sect known by the name of Rosicrucians.The plot of Zanoni is a darkly appealing love story that inaugurates all thegenteel devices of classic horror-love that we will (a few years later)recognize in the works of Edgar Allan Poe, Robert W. Chambers, and others. Butthe text of Zanoni also reveals (to the trained eye) the language of a fellowoccultist. In fact, it is clear that Zanoni could not possibly have been writtenby anyone other than a bona fide initiate of the mysteries. The story even makesindirect references to a magic book—a book that is undoubtedly the very realtome known to scholars today as The Book of Abra-Melin.8 This landmark occultgrimoire (c. 1378) would remain untranslated and unknown to the English-speakingworld (or indeed anyone but the most knowledgeable and serious student of theoccult) until 1888 when Golden Dawn adept S.L. MacGreggor Mathers translatedfragments of the text, which he found in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal in Paris.The Book of Abra-Melin is considered by many to be the Rosetta Stone of WesternMagick, elevating the misunderstood superstitions of the mediaeval sorcerers toa spiritual science as sacred and viable as the self-transformational traditionsof Eastern mysticism. As it would seem, His Lordship, Sir EdwardBulwer-Lytton—dandy, diplomat, and novelist—was rubbing elbows on a regularbasis with very same mystics and magicians who not only knew of the book'sexistence but were intimately familiar with its contents and significance.It is clear to me that where secret occult mysteries and practices are concernedit was not a case of Lord Lytton gleaning his occult knowledge fromnineteenth-century English Rosicrucian pretenders, but one of nineteenth-century“Rosicrucians” getting their occult knowledge from him!While we heap praise on Lytton for being a founding father of horror, we mustalso credit him for helping introduce the world to the genre of science fiction.His 1871 novel The Coming Race would prove to be a breathtaking and disturbinglook into the future. Unfortunately, early in the twentieth century theimaginative ideas put forth in The Coming Race would be seized and distortedinto a monstrous vision by the madmen of Germany's Third Reich, and employedlike some malevolent conjuration to invoke a great demon upon the earth in theform of the genocidal terrors of the Second World War. No horror fiction storycan possibly compare to such unimaginable evil—such incalculable pain and deathsuffered by millions upon millions of our fellow human beings.Of course, I am not suggesting that we blame Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton for thegenocidal horror of the Holocaust. However, we would all do well to be mindfulof Lytton's own words, “The pen is mightier than the sword,” and be aware of theawesome power the written word has to effect changes in human consciousness—forgood or for ill.ROBERT W. CHAMBERS (1865–1933)If H.P. Lovecraft is the Christ of horror, then most assuredly Robert W.Chambers was his John the Baptist.Recently it was my privilege to introduce and curate the series of short storiesfirst published in 1895 under the collective title The King in Yellow by RobertW. Chambers.9 To avoid paraphrasing myself, I append a portion of myintroduction below. While I refer specifically to The King in Yellow, myobservations of Chambers' style, technique, and imagination apply also to thisbook's Chambers selection, “The Messenger.”Perhaps you have heard of The King in Yellow? No? Neither had I until a fewyears ago, when a filmmaker contacted me and informed me he was making a film ofThe King in Yellow and asked if I would be interested in appearing in a cameorole in the production. Before I gave him my answer (the project was laterabandoned), I did a bit of digging and discovered a most remarkable treasure—aterrifying work of American horror that predates by a quarter century the firstshort story by H.P. Lovecraft. Indeed, The King in Yellow by Robert W. Chambersis arguably the archetypal inspiration for what would become an entire genre ofhorror fiction for which the immortal Lovecraft is ultimately credited.Robert W. Chambers (1865-1933) is not exactly a household name, but that has notalways been the case. Late in his career his romantic novels and historicalfictions were wildly popular, his books bestsellers, his magazine installmentseagerly awaited. For a time he was considered the most successful Americanliterary figure of the day. Yet his later and lighter offerings, while bringinghim fame and modest fortune, are forgettable bonbons when compared to the strongmeat and innovative brilliance of his horror fiction. The most notable of allhis work is The King in Yellow, a collection of short stories whose plots areloosely connected to an infamous imaginary book and play of the same titlebanned universally because of its ominous tendency to drive mad those who readit or came in contact with it. Indeed, the terror begins immediately, with thereader unsure whether or not madness and suicide will be the price he or shewill pay for turning the page.I was a bit disoriented when I began reading The King in Yellow's openingstory—a dizzying effect that I'm sure Chambers intended to induce in the mindsof his “gay-nineties” readers. The tale, called “The Repairer of Reputations,”takes place in the science fiction “future” of a 1920s New York City, ametropolis of street names, parks, and landmarks familiar to us still today,which Chambers meticulously paints from his rich palette of images (he was,after all, a classically trained and skilled artist and designer). However,there is something disturbingly tweaked with the entire milieu of the story. Itall takes place in a utopian and prosperous post-Civil War America—a blend ofaristocratic republic and military dictatorship that could have easily evolvedfrom the strange bed-fellows of the Gilded Age's contending movements:nationalistic laissez-faire capitalism and the liberal yet pragmatic ideals ofsocial progressivism. From the opening lines, we are instantly plunged into analternate reality where the comfortable and familiar past has been slightlyaltered and we are forced to confront the infinite “what ifs” of history—and indoing so calling into question the objective reality of the present.Nestled within this surreal environment, we are introduced to a well-spokennarrator who at first seems to be a faithful servant of the truth, but who willsoon give us reason to doubt both his sanity and our own. But I won't spoil thatfor you.Like Lovecraft would do decades later, Chambers allows the reader's ownimagination to do the heavy lifting of terror. Cassilda's Song, which serves asthe epigram for the entire work, is supposedly clipped from Act I, Scene 2 ofthe play, The King in Yellow, and without burdening the reader's imaginationwith concrete certitudes, conjures images of strange locales and vistas not ofthis earth, indeed, not of this universe, and only hints of characters ofunspeakable power and horror.Along the shore the cloud waves break,The twin suns sink beneath the lake,The shadows lengthenIn Carcosa.Strange is the night where black stars rise,And strange moons circle through the skiesBut stranger still isLost Carcosa.Songs that the Hyades shall sing,Where flap the tatters of the King,Must die unheard inDim Carcosa.Song of my soul, my voice is dead,Die thou, unsung, as tears unshedShall dry and die inLost Carcosa.Like all great works of horror, the story becomes disturbing, dark, andterrifying in direct proportion to the degree to which our own hearts and mindsare disturbed, dark, and frightened.ALEISTER CROWLEY (1875–1947)Unlike Lord Lytton and Robert Chambers, Aleister Crowley is not rememberedprimarily for his works of fiction. Admittedly, he was a prolific poet, and inthis capacity, even in his early twenties, he received a measure of criticalpraise and encouragement. His two novels, Moonchild (1917), and Diary of a DrugFiend (1922), also received a modicum of critical recognition and over the yearshave indirectly inspired a handful of film efforts. His short stories,10 plays,and essays (most privately published and now treasures coveted by collectors)were obviously written for an elite audience of highly educated eso-tericistsand close associates capable of appreciating his elaborate in-jokes,pornographic allusions, and obscure references. As much as he lamented hisrejection by the public, it appears he went to great lengths to openly court hisown vilification.For the reader who is completely unfamiliar with the person of Aleister CrowleyI highly recommend his own Confessions11 and the recent biography Perdurabo—TheLife of Aleister Crowley.12 I has been my pleasure and challenge to write ahandful of books concerning the life and work of this remarkable man. Thefollowing brief excerpt is from my book, Understanding Aleister Crowley's ThothTarot.13Paradoxes seem to define the life and career of Edward Alexander (Aleister)Crowley.14 Yes, in many ways he was a scoundrel. There is no doubt that hewallowed shamelessly in his carefully cultivated persona as England's literaryand spiritual bad-boy. At the same time he took life and himself very seriously.Among other distinctions, he was a world-class mountaineer,15 chess master,painter, poet, sportsman, novelist, critic, and theatrical producer. Heintroduced America to astrology,16 Isadora Duncan to the I Ching, Aldous Huxleyto mescaline, and the poet Victor Neuberg to hiking and high magick. As an agentprovocateur, writing for an English-language German propaganda newspaper in NewYork, he penned the outrageous and inflammatory editorials that provoked areluctant United States Congress to enter the First World War on England'sside.17During the Second World War, at the request of friend and Naval Intelligenceofficer Ian Fleming,18 Crowley provided Winston Churchill with valuable insightsinto the superstitions and magical mindset of the leaders of the Third Reich. Healso suggested to the Prime Minister, if reports can be believed, that heexploit the enemy's magical paranoia by being photographed as much as possiblegiving the two-fingered “V for Victory” gesture. This sign is the manual versionof the magical sign of Apophis-Typhon, a powerful symbol of destruction andannihilation, that, according to magical tradition, is capable of defeating thesolar energies represented by the swastika.Astonishingly, Crowley's adventures and achievements, more than any dozen men ofambition and genius could realistically hope to garner in a lifetime, seemalmost to be distractions when weighed against his monumental exploits ofself-discovery. His visionary writings and his efforts to synthesize andintegrate esoteric spiritual systems of East and West19 make him one of the mostfascinating cultural and religious figures of the twentieth century.Even though Crowley did not, like Edward Bulwer-Lytton, invent the genre thatwould define the format and atmosphere of classic horror; even though he wasn'tresponsible for transforming horror into the morbid-sweet love-song of atormented soul like Edgar Allan Poe; even though he didn't smash the dimensionalboundaries of space-time to plumb new depths of psychological hell like RobertChambers and H.P. Lovecraft; he did something none of them did. He actuallylived the terrifying and ecstatic events of the real life horror-lovestory-adventure of his own amazing life.Crowley is not important to us for the horror stories he wrote, but for themagnificent horror story he was.He didn't just write about demons, and devils, and angels, vampires—he invokedthem, evoked them, conjured them, battled them, conquered them; he didn't justwrite about the wonders and terrors of other dimensions, he willfully penetratedthem, navigated them, transcended them—then he wrote about them in exactingdetail.Nearly seventy years after his death, the man who the tabloids called the “mostdangerous man on earth,” the man they called the “wickedest man in the world,”the man who in all seriousness called himself the “Beast 666,” is now receivingthe academic and philosophical attention and recognition that eluded him inlife.Crowley's influence today on the literary art form of horror is incalculable.There isn't a modern writer of horror, science fiction or fantasy who has not insome fundamental way been directly or indirectly influenced by Crowley.Crowley's dead. But his “horror” reaches from beyond the grave. Robert Chamberswrote of an accursed book and play called The King in Yellow. Supposedly,everyone who read The King in Yellow went hideously insane. I think of that andsmile when I encounter people today who still fearfully hold the person ofAleister Crowley in superstitious awe.“Is it dangerous to study Aleister Crowley?” I am still asked. Aleister Crowleywas by no means perfect. He was not good with people, and often alienated thosewho loved him dearest. His bold explorations of human sexuality and drugs(always meticulously recorded and analyzed) are fascinating to study, but werenever intended to be casually emulated. I have never encountered anyone who knewhim that did not disapprove of some aspect of his character or behavior.But he is dead. For us, only his works remain as a measure of the man, and theyare currently more accessible to the general public than at any time during hislife. His influence on the modern world of art, literature, religion, andphilosophy is now widely acknowledged even by his most vehement critics.But is it dangerous for some people to study Aleister Crowley? I guess I have tosay “Yes.” For those whose belief in a God of goodness hinges upon the realityof Devil who is equally evil—for the superstitious, the ignorant, the lazy, theimmature, the unbalanced, the mentally ill, the paranoid, the faint-hearted; foranyone who for any reason cannot or will not take responsibility for their ownactions, their own lives, their own souls; for these people Aleister Crowley isstill a very dangerous man.20And now, dear reader, I will leave you to enjoy the works of these three mastersof horror and the choir of other luminaries of the genre. I sincerely hope youenjoy your time with them and will treasure this beautifully produced book.Perhaps when you have finished reading it you'll want to put it in your familylibrary—near the dictionary and encyclopedia.

They do not necessarily reflect my currentobjective opinions of the Great State of Nebraska or her remarkable andresilient citizens. I sincerely apologize to Nebraskans, past and present, whomight be offended by my words.2 Of course I wasn't actually “kidnapped.” Again, my flair for the overlydramatic is getting the best of me. (That happens, especially when writing aboutoverly dramatic subjects like horror stories.) My family moved from SouthernCalifornia to Nebraska so that my father could start a new business.

Much to the horror of the German ForeignMinistry, Crowley's editorials made it appear that it was Germany's intention(in fact its foreign policy) to engage in unrestricted submarine warfare againstcivilian shipping. Even though this was at the time an outrageous falsehood,Crowley's editorials were used to create an anti-German hysteria that wouldeventually sweep the United States into the conflict on England's side.

He served under Queen Victoria as Secretary of State for the Coloniesfrom 1858-1859. Ironically, he is probably most famous for having penned thewords, “It was a dark and stormy night,” which have become in the rarefiedschool of mystery writers a cliché example of a mediocre and unimaginative wayto begin a novel. Lord Lytton, however, was anything but mediocre andunimaginative. Among his many works of fiction were The Coming Race, whichbrought to the birth of the genre of science fiction literature A Strange Story,and Zanoni, whose spooky plots revealed his serious interest in (and mastery of)the occult. His story “The Haunters and the Haunted, or, The House and theBrain” was immensely popular in 1859, but was largely forgotten until the 1920 swhen H.P. Lovecraft made mention of it.THE HAUNTED AND THE HAUNTERS, OR, THE HOUSE AND THE BRAINA friend of mine, who is a man of letters and a philosopher, said to me one day,as if between jest and earnest—“Fancy! since we last met, I have discovered ahaunted house in the midst of London.”“Really haunted?—and by what?—ghosts?”“Well, I can't answer these questions—all I know is this—six weeks ago I and mywife were in search of a furnished apartment. Passing a quiet street, we saw onthe window of one of the houses a bill, ‘Apartments Furnished.’ The situationsuited us: we entered the house—liked the rooms—engaged them by the week—andleft them the third day. No power on earth could have reconciled my wife to staylonger, and I don't wonder at it.”“What did you see?”“Excuse me—I have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious dreamer—nor, onthe other hand, could I ask you to accept on my affirmation what you would holdto be incredible without the evidence of your own senses. Let me only say this,it was not so much what we saw or heard (in which you might fairly suppose thatwe were the dupes of our own excited fancy, or the victims of imposture inothers) that drove us away, as it was an undefinable terror which seized both ofus whenever we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room, in which weneither saw nor heard anything. And the strangest marvel of all was, that foronce in my life I agreed with my wife—silly woman though she be—and allowed,after the third night, that it was impossible to stay a fourth in that house.Accordingly, on the fourth morning, I summoned the woman who kept the house andattended on us, and told her that the rooms did not quite suit us, and we wouldnot stay out our week. She said, dryly: ‘I know why; you have stayed longer thanany other lodger; few ever stayed a second night; none before you, a third. ButI take it they have been very kind to you.’“‘They—who?’ I asked, affecting a smile.“‘Why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are. I don't mind them; I rememberthem many years ago, when I lived in this house, not as a servant; but I knowthey will be the death of me some day. I don't care—I'm old, and must die soon,anyhow; and then I shall be with them, and in this house still.’ The woman spokewith so dreary a calmness, that really it was a sort of awe that prevented myconversing with her farther. I paid for my week, and too happy were I and mywife to get off so cheaply.”“You excite my curiosity,” said I; “nothing I should like better than to sleepin a haunted house. Pray give me the address of the one which you left soignominiously.”My friend gave me the address; and when we parted, I walked straight towards thehouse thus indicated.It is situated on the north side of Oxford Street, in a dull but respectablethoroughfare. I found the house shut up—no bill at the window, and no responseto my knock. As I was turning away, a beer-boy, collecting pewter pots at theneighbouring areas, said to me, “Do you want anyone in that house, sir?”“Yes, I heard it was to let.”“Let!—why, the woman who kept it is dead—has been dead these three weeks, and noone can be found to stay there, though Mr J—offered ever so much. He offeredmother, who chars for him, £1 a week just to open and shut the windows, and shewould not.”“Would not!—and why?”“The house is haunted; and the old woman who kept it was found dead in her bed,with her eyes wide open. They say the devil strangled her.”“Pooh!—you speak of Mr J—. Is he the owner of the house?”“Yes.”“Where does he live?”“In G—Street, No. —.”“What is he?—in any business?”“No, sir—nothing particular; a single gentleman.”I gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned by his liberal information, and proceededto Mr J—, in G—Street, which was close by the street that boasted the hauntedhouse. I was lucky enough to find Mr J—at home—an elderly man, with intelligentcountenance and prepossessing manners.I communicated my name and my business frankly. I said I heard the house wasconsidered to be haunted—that I had a strong desire to examine a house with soequivocal a reputation—that I should be greatly obliged if he would allow me tohire it, though only for a night. I was willing to pay for that privilegewhatever he might be inclined to ask. “Sir,” said Mr J—, with great courtesy,“the house is at your service, for as short or as long a time as you please.Rent is out of the question—the obligation will be on my side should you be ableto discover the cause of the strange phenomena which at present deprive it ofall value. I cannot let it, for I cannot even get a servant to keep it in orderor answer the door. Unluckily the house is haunted, if I may use thatexpression, not only by night, but by day; though at night the disturbances areof a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming character.“The poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom I took outof a workhouse, for in her childhood she had been known to some of my family,and had once been in such good circumstances that she had rented that house ofmy uncle. She was a woman of superior education and strong mind, and was theonly person I could ever induce to remain in the house. Indeed, since her death,which was sudden, and the coroner's inquest, which gave it a notoriety in theneighbourhood, I have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of it,much more a tenant, that I would willingly let it rent free for a year to anyonewho would pay its rates and taxes.”“How long is it since the house acquired this sinister character?”“That I can scarcely tell you, but very many years since. The old woman I spokeof said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and forty years ago.The fact is that my life has been spent in the East Indies and in the civilservice of the Company. I returned to England last year on inheriting thefortune of an uncle, amongst whose possessions was the house in question. Ifound it shut up and uninhabited. I was told that it was haunted, that no onewould inhabit it. I smiled at what seemed to me so idle a story. I spent somemoney in repainting and roofing it—added to its old-fashioned furniture a fewmodern articles—advertised it, and obtained a lodger for a year. He was acolonel retired on half-pay. He came in with his family, a son and a daughter,and four or five servants: they all left the house the next day, and althoughthey deponed that they had all seen something different, that something wasequally terrible to all. I really could not in conscience sue, or even blame,the colonel for breach of agreement.“Then I put in the old woman I have spoken of, and she was empowered to let thehouse in apartments. I never had one lodger who stayed more than three days. Ido not tell you their stories—to no two lodgers have there been exactly the samephenomena repeated. It is better that you should judge for yourself, than enterthe house with an imagination influenced by previous narratives; only beprepared to see and to hear something or other, and take whatever precautionsyou yourself please.”“Have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house?”“Yes. I passed not a night, but three hours in broad daylight alone in thathouse. My curiosity is not satisfied, but it is quenched. I have no desire torenew the experiment. You cannot complain, you see, sir, that I am notsufficiently candid; and unless your interest be exceedingly eager and yournerves unusually strong, I honestly add that I advise you not to pass a night inthat house.”“My interest is exceedingly keen,” said I, “and though only a coward will boastof his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him, yet my nerves have beenseasoned in such variety of danger that I have the right to rely on them—even ina haunted house.”Mr J—said very little more; he took the keys of the house out of his bureau,gave them to me,—and thanking him cordially for his frankness, and his urbaneconcession to my wish, I carried off my prize.Impatient for the experiment, as soon as I reached home I summoned myconfidential servant,—a young man of gay spirits, fearless temper, and as freefrom superstitious prejudice as anyone I could think of.“F—,” said I, “you remember in Germany how disappointed we were at not finding aghost in that old castle, which was said to be haunted by a headless apparition?Well, I have heard of a house in London which, I have reason to hope, isdecidedly haunted. I mean to sleep there to-night. From what I hear, there is nodoubt that something will allow itself to be seen or to be heard—something,perhaps, excessively horrible. Do you think, if I take you with me, I may relyon your presence of mind, whatever may happen?”“Oh, sir! pray trust me,” answered F—, grinning with delight.“Very well—then here are the keys of the house—this is the address. Gonow—select for me any bedroom you please; and since the house has not beeninhabited for weeks, make up a good fire—air the bed well—see, of course, thatthere are candles as well as fuel. Take with you my revolver and my dagger—somuch for my weapons—arm yourself equally well; and if we are not a match for adozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry couple of Englishmen.”I was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that I had notleisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which I had plighted myhonour. I dined alone, and very late, and while dining, read, as is my habit.The volume I selected was one of Macaulay's Essays. I thought to myself that Iwould take the book with me; there was so much of healthfulness in the style,and practical life in the subjects, that it would serve as an antidote againstthe influences of superstitious fancy.Accordingly, about half-past nine, I put the book into my pocket, and strolledleisurely towards the haunted house. I took with me a favourite dog—anexceedingly sharp, bold, and vigilant bull-terrier—a dog fond of prowling aboutstrange ghostly corners and passages at night in search of rats—a dog of dogsfor a ghost.It was a summer night, but chilly, the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast. Still,there was a moon—faint and sickly, but still a moon—and if the clouds permitted,after midnight it would be brighter.I reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful smile.“All right, sir, and very comfortable.”“Oh!” said I, rather disappointed; “have you not seen nor heard anythingremarkable?”“Well, sir, I must own I have heard something queer.”“What?—what?”“The sound of feet pattering behind me; and once or twice small noises likewhispers close at my ear—nothing more.”“You are not at all frightened?”“I! Not a bit of it, sir”; and the man's bold look reassured me on onepoint—viz. that, happen what might, he would not desert me.We were in the hall, the street-door closed, and my attention was now drawn tomy dog. He had at first ran in eagerly enough, but had sneaked back to the door,and was scratching and whining to get out. After patting him on the head, andencouraging him gently, the dog seemed to reconcile himself to the situation andfollowed me and F—through the house, but keeping close at my heels instead ofhurrying inquisitively in advance, which was his usual and normal habit in allstrange places. We first visited the subterranean apartments, the kitchen andother offices, and especially the cellars, in which last there were two or threebottles of wine still left in a bin, covered with cobwebs, and evidently, bytheir appearance, undisturbed for many years. It was clear that the ghosts werenot wine-bibbers.For the rest we discovered nothing of interest. There was a gloomy littlebackyard, with very high walls. The stones of this yard were very damp—and whatwith the damp, and what with the dust and smoke-grime on the pavement, our feetleft a slight impression where we passed. And now appeared the first strangephenomenon witnessed by myself in this strange abode. I saw, just before me, theprint of a foot suddenly form itself, as it were. I stopped, caught hold of myservant, and pointed to it. In advance of that footprint as suddenly droppedanother. We both saw it. I advanced quickly to the place; the footprint keptadvancing before me, a small footprint—the foot of a child: the impression wastoo faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape, but it seemed to us both that itwas the print of a naked foot. This phenomenon ceased when we arrived at theopposite wall, nor did it repeat itself on returning.We remounted the stairs, and entered the rooms on the ground floor, a diningparlour, a small back-parlour, and a still smaller third room that had beenprobably appropriated to a footman—all still as death. We then visited thedrawing-rooms, which seemed fresh and new. In the front room I seated myself inan armchair. F—placed on the table the candlestick with which he had lighted us.I told him to shut the door. As he turned to do so, a chair opposite to me movedfrom the wall quickly and noiselessly, and dropped itself about a yard from myown chair, immediately fronting it.“Why, this is better than the turning-tables,” said I, with a half-laugh—and asI laughed, my dog put back his head and howled.F—, coming back, had not observed the movement of the chair. He employed himselfnow in stilling the dog. I continued to gaze on the chair, and fancied I saw onit a pale blue misty outline of a human figure, but an outline so indistinctthat I could only distrust my own vision. The dog now was quiet. “Put back thatchair opposite to me,” said I to F—; “put it back to the wall.”F—obeyed. “Was that you, sir?” said he, turning abruptly.“I—what!”“Why, something struck me. I felt it sharply on the shoulder—just here.”“No,” said I. “But we have jugglers present, and though we may not discovertheir tricks, we shall catch them before they frighten us.”We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms—in fact, they felt so damp and sochilly that I was glad to get to the fire upstairs. We locked the doors of thedrawing-rooms—a precaution which, I should observe, we had taken with all therooms we had searched below. The bedroom my servant had selected for me was thebest on the floor—a large one, with two windows fronting the street. Thefour-posted bed, which took up no inconsiderable space, was opposite to thefire, which burned clear and bright; a door in the wall to the left, between thebed and the window, communicated with the room which my servant appropriated tohimself.This last was a small room with a sofa-bed, and had no communication with thelanding-place—no other door but that which conducted to the bedroom I was tooccupy. On either side of my fireplace was a cupboard, without locks, flushedwith the wall, and covered with the same dull-brown paper. We examined thesecupboards—only hooks to suspend female dresses—nothing else; we sounded thewalls—evidently solid—the outer walls of the building. Having finished thesurvey of these apartments, warmed myself a few moments, and lighted my cigar, Ithen, still accompanied by F—, went forth to complete my reconnoitre. In thelanding-place there was another door; it was closed firmly. “Sir,” said myservant in surprise, “I unlocked this door with all the others when I firstcame; it cannot have got locked from the inside, for it is a—”Before he had finished his sentence the door, which neither of us then wastouching, opened quietly of itself. We looked at each other a single instant.The same thought seized both—some human agency might be detected here. I rushedin first, my servant followed. A small blank dreary room without furniture—a fewempty boxes and hampers in a corner—a small window—the shutters closed—not evena fireplace—no other door but that by which we had entered—no carpet on thefloor, and the floor seemed very old, uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and there,as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood; but no living being, and novisible place in which a living being could have hidden. As we stood gazingaround, the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as it had beforeopened: we were imprisoned.For the first time I felt a creep of undefinable horror. Not so my servant.“Why, they don't think to trap us, sir; I could break that trumpery door with akick of my foot.”“Try first if it will open to your hand,” said I, shaking off the vagueapprehension that had seized me, “while I open the shutters and see what iswithout.”I unbarred the shutters—the window looked on the little backyard I have beforedescribed; there was no ledge without—nothing but sheer descent. No man gettingout of that window would have found any footing till he had fallen on the stonesbelow.F—, meanwhile, was vainly attempting to open the door. He now turned round tome, and asked my permission to use force. And I should here state, in justice tothe servant, that, far from evincing any superstitious terrors, his nerve,composure, and even gaiety amidst circumstances so extraordinary compelled myadmiration, and made me congratulate myself on having secured a companion inevery way fitted to the occasion. I willingly gave him the permission herequired. But though he was a remarkably strong man, his force was as idle ashis milder efforts; the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick. Breathlessand panting, he desisted. I then tried the door myself, equally in vain.As I ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror came over me; but thistime it was more cold and stubborn. I felt as if some strange and ghastlyexhalation were rising up from the chinks of that rugged floor, and filling theatmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life. The door now veryslowly and quietly opened as of its own accord. We precipitated ourselves intothe landing-place. We both saw a large pale light—as large as the human figure,but shapeless and unsubstantial—move before us, and ascend the stairs that ledfrom the landing into the attics. I followed the light, and my servant followedme. It entered, to the right of the landing, a small garret, of which the doorstood open. I entered in the same instant. The light then collapsed into a smallglobule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid; rested a moment on a bed in thecorner, quivered, and vanished. We approached the bed and examined it—ahalf-tester, such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants. On thedrawers that stood near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief, with theneedle still left in a rent half repaired. The kerchief was covered with dust;probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that house, andthis might have been her sleeping-room.I had sufficient curiosity to open the drawers; there were a few odds and endsof female dress, and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of fadedyellow. I took the liberty to possess myself of the letters. We found nothingelse in the room worth noticing—nor did the light reappear; but we distinctlyheard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the floor—just before us. Wewent through the other attics (in all, four), the footfall still preceding us.Nothing to be seen—nothing but the footfall heard. I had the letters in my hand;just as I was descending the stairs I distinctly felt my wrist seized, and afaint, soft effort made to draw the letters from my clasp. I only held them themore tightly, and the effort ceased.We regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and I then remarked that mydog had not followed us when we had left it. He was thrusting himself close tothe fire, and trembling. I was impatient to examine the letters; and while Iread them, my servant opened a little box in which he had deposited the weaponsI had ordered him to bring, took them out, placed them on a table close at mybed-head, and then occupied himself in soothing the dog, who, however, seemed toheed him very little.The letters were short—they were dated; the dates exactly thirty-five years ago.They were evidently from a lover to his mistress, or a husband to some youngwife. Not only the terms of expression, but a distinct reference to a formervoyage indicated the writer to have been a seafarer. The spelling andhandwriting were those of a man imperfectly educated, but still the languageitself was forcible. In the expressions of endearment there was a kind of roughwild love; but here and there were dark unintelligible hints at some secret notof love—some secret that seemed of crime. “We ought to love each other,” was oneof the sentences I remember, “for how everyone else would execrate us if all wasknown.” Again: “Don't let anyone be in the same room with you at night—you talkin your sleep.” And again: “What's done can't be undone; and I tell you there'snothing against us unless the dead could come to life.” Here there wasunderlined in a better handwriting (a female's), “They do!” At the end of theletter latest in date the same female hand had written these words: “Lost at seathe 4th of June, the same day as—”I put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents.Fearing, however, that the train of thought into which I fell might unsteady mynerves, I fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to cope with whateverof marvellous the advancing night might bring forth. I roused myself—laid theletters on the table—stirred up the fire, which was still bright andcheering—and opened my volume of Macaulay. I read quietly enough till abouthalf-past eleven. I then threw myself dressed upon the bed, and told my servanthe might retire to his own room, but must keep himself awake. I bade him leaveopen the door between the two rooms. Thus alone, I kept two candles burning onthe table by my bed-head. I placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmlyresumed my Macaulay.Opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the hearth-rug, seemingly asleep,lay the dog. In about twenty minutes I felt an exceedingly cold air pass by mycheek, like a sudden draught. I fancied the door to my right, communicating withthe landing-place, must have got open; but no—it was closed. I then turned myglance to my left, and saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by awind. At the same moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from thetable—softly, softly—no visible hand—it was gone. I sprang up, seizing therevolver with the one hand, the dagger with the other; I was not willing that myweapons should share the fate of the watch. Thus armed, I looked round thefloor—no sign of the watch. Three slow, loud, distinct knocks were now heard atthe bed-head; my servant called out, “Is that you, sir?”“No; be on your guard.”The dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving quicklybackwards and forwards. He kept his eyes fixed on me with a look so strange thathe concentrated all my attention on himself. Slowly he rose up, all his hairbristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the same wild stare. I had notime, however, to examine the dog. Presently my servant emerged from his room;and if ever I saw horror in the human face, it was then. I should not haverecognised him had we met in the streets, so altered was every lineament. Hepassed by me quickly, saying in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from hislips, “Run—run! it is after me!” He gained the door to the landing, pulled itopen, and rushed forth. I followed him into the landing involuntarily, callinghim to stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging tothe balusters, and taking several steps at a time. I heard, where I stood, thestreet door open—heard it again clap to. I was left alone in the haunted house.It was but for a moment that I remained undecided whether or not to follow myservant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a flight. I re-enteredmy room, closing the door after me, and proceeded cautiously into the interiorchamber. I encountered nothing to justify my servant's terror. I again carefullyexamined the walls, to see if there were any concealed door. I could find notrace of one—not even a seam in the dull-brown paper with which the room washung. How, then, had the Thing, whatever it was, which had so scared him,obtained ingress except through my own chamber?I returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon the interiorone, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared. I now perceived that thedog had slunk into an angle of the wall, and was pressing himself close againstit, as if literally trying to force his way into it. I approached the animal andspoke to it; the poor brute was evidently beside itself with terror. It showedall its teeth, the slaver dropping from its jaws, and would certainly havebitten me if I had touched it. It did not seem to recognise me. Whoever has seenat the Zoological Gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent, cowering in acorner, may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited. Finding allefforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his bite might be asvenomous in that state as if in the madness of hydrophobia, I left him alone,placed my weapons on the table beside the fire, seated myself, and recommencedmy Macaulay.Perhaps in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or rather acoolness, which the reader may conceive I exaggerate, I may be pardoned if Ipause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks.As I hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be preciselyproportioned to familiarity with the circumstance that lead to it, so I shouldsay that I had been long sufficiently familiar with all experiments thatappertain to the Marvellous. I had witnessed many very extraordinary phenomenain various parts of the world—phenomena that would be either totally disbelievedif I stated them, or ascribed to supernatural agencies. Now, my theory is thatthe Supernatural is the Impossible, and that what is called supernatural is onlya something in the laws of nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant.Therefore, if a ghost rise before me, I have not the right to say, “So, then,the supernatural is possible,” but rather, “So, then, the apparition of a ghostis, contrary to received opinion, within the laws of nature—i.e. notsupernatural.”Now, in all that I had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in all the wonders whichthe amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts, a material living agency isalways required. On the Continent you will find still magicians who assert thatthey can raise spirits. Assume for the moment that they assert truly, still theliving material form of the magician is present; and he is the material agencyby which from some constitutional peculiarities, certain strange phenomena arerepresented to your natural senses.Accept again, as truthful, the tales of Spirit Manifestation in America—musicalor other sounds—writings on paper, produced by no discernible hand—articles offurniture moved without apparent human agency—or the actual sight and touch ofhands, to which no bodies seem to belong—still there must be found the medium orliving being, with constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining thesesigns. In fine, in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no imposture,there must be a human being like ourselves, by whom, or through whom, theeffects presented to human beings are produced. It is so with the now familiarphenomena of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the person operated on isaffected through a material living agent. Nor, supposing it true that amesmerised patient can respond to the will or passes of a mesmeriser a hundredmiles distant, is the response less occasioned by a material being; it may bethrough a material fluid—call it Electric, call it Odic, call it what youwill—which has the power of traversing space and passing obstacles, that thematerial effect is communicated from one to the other.Hence all that I had hitherto witnessed, or expected to witness, in this strangehouse, I believed to be occasioned through some agency or medium as mortal asmyself; and this idea necessarily prevented the awe with which those who regardas supernatural things that are not within the ordinary operations of nature,might have been impressed by the adventures of that memorable night.As, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or would bepresented, to my senses, must originate in some human being gifted byconstitution with the power so to present them, and having some motive so to do,I felt an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather philosophical thansuperstitious. And I can sincerely say that I was in as tranquil a temper forobservation as any practical experimentalist could be in awaiting the effects ofsome rare though perhaps perilous chemical combination. Of course, the more Ikept my mind detached from fancy, the more the temper fitted for observationwould be obtained; and I therefore riveted eye and thought on the strongdaylight sense in the page of my Macaulay.I now became aware that something interposed between the page and the light—thepage was overshadowed; I looked up, and I saw what I shall find it verydifficult, perhaps impossible, to describe.It was a Darkness shaping itself out of the air in very undefined outline. Icannot say it was of a human form, and yet it had more resemblance to a humanform, or rather shadow, than anything else. As it stood, wholly apart anddistinct from the air and the light around it, its dimensions seemed gigantic,the summit nearly touching the ceiling. While I gazed, a feeling of intense coldseized me. An iceberg before me could not more have chilled me; nor could thecold of an iceberg have been more purely physical. I feel convinced that it wasnot the cold caused by fear. As I continued to gaze, I thought—but this I cannotsay with precision—that I distinguished two eyes looking down on me from theheight. One moment I seemed to distinguish them clearly, the next they seemedgone; but still two rays of a pale-blue light frequently shot through thedarkness, as from the height on which I half-believed, half-doubted, that I hadencountered the eyes.I strove to speak—my voice utterly failed me; I could only think to myself, “Isthis fear? it is not fear!” I strove to rise—in vain; I felt as if weighed downby an irresistible force. Indeed, my impression was that of an immense andoverwhelming Power opposed to my volition; that sense of utter inadequacy tocope with a force beyond men's, which one may feel physically in a storm at sea,in a conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast, or rather,perhaps, the shark of the ocean, I felt morally. Opposed to my will was anotherwill, as far superior to its strength as storm, fire, and shark are superior inmaterial force to the force of men.And now, as this impression grew on me, now came, at last, horror—horror to adegree that no words can convey. Still I retained pride, if not courage; and inmy own mind I said, “This is horror, but it is not fear; unless I fear, I cannotbe harmed; my reason rejects this thing; it is an illusion—I do not fear.” Witha violent effort I succeeded at last in stretching out my hand towards theweapon on the table; as I did so, on the arm and shoulder I received a strangeshock, and my arm fell to my side powerless. And now, to add to my horror, thelight began slowly to wane from the candles—they were not, as it were,extinguished, but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn; it was the samewith the fire—the light was extracted from the fuel; in a few minutes the roomwas in utter darkness.The dread that came over me, to be thus in the dark with that dark Thing, whosepower was so intensely felt, brought a reaction of nerve. In fact, terror hadreached that climax, that either my senses must have deserted me, or I must haveburst through the spell. I did burst through it. I found voice, though the voicewas a shriek. I remember that I broke forth with words like these—“I do notfear, my soul does not fear”; and at the same time I found the strength to rise.Still in that profound gloom I rushed to one of the windows—tore aside thecurtain—flung open the shutters; my first thought was—light. And when I saw themoon high, clear, and calm, I felt a joy that almost compensated for theprevious terror. There was the moon, there was also the light from the gas-lampsin the deserted slumberous street. I turned to look back into the room; the moonpenetrated its shadow very palely and partially—but still there was light. Thedark Thing, whatever it might be, was gone—except that I could yet see a dimshadow which seemed the shadow of that shade, against the opposite wall.My eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was withoutcloth or cover—an old mahogany round table) there rose a hand, visible as far asthe wrist. It was a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh and blood as my own, butthe hand of an aged person—lean, wrinkled, small too—a woman's hand.That hand very softly closed on the two letters that lay on the table: hand andletters both vanished. There then came the same three loud measured knocks I hadheard at the bed-head before this extraordinary drama had commenced.As those sounds slowly ceased, I felt the whole room vibrate sensibly; and atthe far end there rose, as from the floor, sparks or globules like bubbles oflight, many-coloured—green, yellow, fire-red, azure. Up and down, to and fro,hither, thither, as tiny will-o'-the-wisps, the sparks moved, slow or swift,each at its own caprice. A chair (as in the drawing-room below) was now advancedfrom the wall without apparent agency, and placed at the opposite side of thetable. Suddenly, as forth from the chair, there grew a shape—a woman's shape. Itwas distinct as a shape of life—ghastly as a shape of death. The face was thatof youth, with a strange mournful beauty; the throat and shoulders were bare,the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white. It began sleeking its longyellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its eyes were not turned towards me,but to the door; it seemed listening, watching, waiting. The shadow of the shadein the background grew darker; and again I thought I beheld the eyes gleamingout from the summit of the shadow—eyes fixed upon that shape.As if from the door, though it did not open, there grew out another shapeequally distinct, equally ghastly—a man's shape—a young man's. It was in thedress of the last century, or rather in a likeness of such dress; for both themale shape and the female, though defined, were evidently unsubstantial,impalpable—simulacra—phantasms; and there was something incongruous, grotesque,yet fearful, in the contrast between the elaborate finery, the courtly precisionof that old-fashioned garb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles, and thecorpse-like aspect and ghost-like stillness of the flitting wearer. Just as themale shape approached the female, the dark Shadow started from the wall, allthree for a moment wrapped in darkness. When the pale light returned, the twophantoms were as if in the grasp of the Shadow that towered between them; andthere was a bloodstain on the breast of the female; and the phantom-male wasleaning on its phantom-sword, and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles,from the lace; and the darkness of the intermediate Shadow swallowed themup—they were gone. And again the bubbles of light shot, and sailed, andundulated, growing thicker and thicker and more wildly confused in theirmovements.The closet-door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from the aperturethere came the form of a woman, aged. In her hand she held letters—the veryletters over which I had seen the Hand close; and behind her I heard a footstep.She turned round as if to listen, then she opened the letters and seemed toread; and over her shoulder I saw a livid face, the face as of a man longdrowned—bloated, bleached—seaweed tangled in its dripping hair; and at her feetlay a form as of a corpse and beside the corpse there cowered a child, amiserable, squalid child, with famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes. And asI looked in the old woman's face, the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it becamea face of youth—hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and the Shadow darted forth,and darkened over these phantoms as it had darkened over the last.Nothing now was left but the Shadow, and on that my eyes were intently fixed,till again eyes grew out of the Shadow—malignant, serpent eyes. And the bubblesof light again rose and fell, and in their disordered, irregular, turbulentmaze, mingled with the wan moonlight. And now from these globules themselves asfrom the shell of an egg, monstrous things burst out; the air grew filled withthem; larvae so bloodless and so hideous that I can in no way describe themexcept to remind the reader of the swarming life which the solar microscopebrings before his eyes in a drop of water—things transparent, supple, agile,chasing each other, devouring each other—forms like nought ever beheld by thenaked eye. As the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were withoutorder. In their very vagrancies there was no sport; they came round me andround, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over my head, crawling over myright arm, which was outstretched in involuntary command against all evilbeings.Sometimes I felt myself touched, but not by them; invisible hands touched me.Once I felt the clutch as of cold soft fingers at my throat. I was still equallyconscious that if I gave way to fear I should be in bodily peril; and Iconcentrated all my faculties in the single focus of resisting, stubborn will.And I turned my sight from the Shadow—above all, from those strange serpenteyes—eyes that had now become distinctly visible. For there, though in noughtelse around me, I was aware that there was a will, and a will of intense,creative, working evil, which might crush down my own.The pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air of somenear conflagration. The larva grew lurid as things that live in fire. Again theroom vibrated; again were heard the three measured knocks; and again all thingswere swallowed up in the darkness of the dark Shadow, as if out of that darknessall had come, into that darkness all returned.As the gloom receded, the Shadow was wholly gone. Slowly as it had beenwithdrawn, the flame grew again into the candles on the table, again into thefuel in the grate. The whole room came once more calmly, healthfully into sight.The two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the servants' roomstill locked. In the corner of the wall, into which he had so convulsivelyniched himself, lay the dog. I called to him—no movement; I approached—theanimal was dead; his eyes protruded; his tongue out of his mouth; the frothgathered round his jaws. I took him in my arms; I brought him to the fire; Ifelt acute grief for the loss of my poor favourite—acute self-reproach; Iaccused myself of his death; I imagined he had died of fright. But what was mysurprise on finding that his neck was actually broken—actually twisted out ofthe vertebræ. Had this been done in the dark?—must it not have been by a handhuman as mine?—must there not have been a human agency all the while in thatroom? Good cause to suspect it. I cannot tell. I cannot do more than state thefact fairly; the reader may draw his own inference.Another surprising circumstance—my watch was restored to the table from which ithad been so mysteriously withdrawn; but it had stopped at the very moment it wasso withdrawn; nor, despite all the skill of the watchmaker, has it ever gonesince—that is, it will go in a strange erratic way for a few hours, and thencomes to a dead stop—it is worthless.Nothing more chanced for the rest of the night. Nor, indeed, had I long to waitbefore the dawn broke. Not till it was broad daylight did I quit the hauntedhouse. Before I did so, I revisited the little blind room in which my servantand myself had been for a time imprisoned. I had a strong impression—for which Icould not account—that from that room had originated the mechanism of thephenomena—if I may use the term—which had been experienced in my chamber. Andthough I entered it now in the clear day, with the sun peering through the filmywindow, I still felt, as I stood on its floor, the creep of the horror which Ihad first there experienced the night before, and which had been so aggravatedby what had passed in my own chamber. I could not, indeed, bear to stay morethan half a minute within those walls. I descended the stairs, and again I heardthe footfall before me; and when I opened the street door, I thought I coulddistinguish a very low laugh. I gained my own home, expecting to find my runawayservant there. But he had not presented himself; nor did I hear more of him forthree days, when I received a letter from him, dated from Liverpool, to thiseffect:—“Honoured Sir,—I humbly entreat your pardon, though I can scarcely hope that youwill think I deserve it, unless—which Heaven forbid!—you saw what I did. I feelthat it will be years before I can recover myself; and as to being fit forservice, it is out of the question. I am therefore going to my brother-in-law atMelbourne. The ship sails to-morrow. Perhaps the long voyage may set me up. I donothing now but start and tremble, and fancy It is behind me. I humbly beg you,honoured sir, to order my clothes, and whatever wages are due to me, to be sentto my mother's, at Walworth—John knows her address.”The letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat incoherent, and explanatorydetails as to effects that had been under the writer's charge.This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go toAustralia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the eventsof the night. I say nothing in refutation of that conjecture; rather, I suggestit as one that would seem to many persons the most probable solution ofimprobable occurrences. My own theory remained unshaken. I returned in theevening to the house, to bring away in a hack cab the things I had left there,with my poor dog's body. In this task I was not disturbed, nor did any incidentworth note befall me, except that still, on ascending, and descending the stairsI heard the same footfall in advance. On leaving the house, I went to Mr J—'s.He was at home. I returned him the keys, told him that my curiosity wassufficiently gratified, and was about to relate quickly what had passed, when hestopped me, and said, though with much politeness, that he had no longer anyinterest in a mystery which none had ever solved.I determined at least to tell him of the two letters I had read, as well as ofthe extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared, and I then inquired ifhe thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died in the house, andif there were anything in her early history which could possibly confirm thedark suspicions to which the letters gave rise. Mr J—seemed startled, and, aftermusing a few moments, answered, “I know but little of the woman's earlierhistory, except, as I before told you, that her family were known to mine. Butyou revive some vague reminiscences to her prejudice. I will make inquiries, andinform you of their result. Still, even if we could admit the popularsuperstition that a person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim ofdark crimes in life could revisit, as a restless spirit, the scene in whichthose crimes had been committed, I should observe that the house was infested bystrange sights and sounds before the old woman died—you smile—what would yousay?”“I would say this, that I am convinced, if we could get to the bottom of thesemysteries, we should find a living human agency.”“What! you believe it is all an imposture? For what object?”“Not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word. If suddenly I were to sinkinto a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me, but in that sleep couldanswer questions with an accuracy which I could not pretend to when awake—tellyou what money you had in your pocket—nay, describe your very thoughts—it is notnecessarily an imposture, any more than it is necessarily supernatural. I shouldbe, unconsciously to myself, under a mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from adistance by a human being who had acquired power over me by previous rapport.”“Granting mesmerism, so far carried, to be a fact, you are right. And you wouldinfer from this that a mesmeriser might produce the extraordinary effects youand others have witnessed over inanimate objects—fill the air with sights andsounds?”“Or impress our senses with the belief in them—we never having been en rapportwith the person acting on us? No. What is commonly called mesmerism could not dothis; but there may be a power akin to mesmerism, and superior to it—the powerthat in the old days was called Magic. That such a power may extend to allinanimate objects of matter, I do not say; but if so, it would not be againstnature, only a rare power in nature which might be given to constitutions withcertain peculiarities, and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree.That such a power might extend over the dead—that is, over certain thoughts andmemories that the dead may still retain—and compel, not that which oughtproperly to be called the soul, and which is far beyond human reach, but rathera phantom of what has been most earth-stained on earth, to make itself apparentto our senses—is a very ancient though obsolete theory, upon which I will hazardno opinion. But I do not conceive the power would be supernatural.“Let me illustrate what I mean from an experiment which Paracelsus describes asnot difficult, and which the author of the Curiosities of Literature cites ascredible: A flower perishes; you burn it. Whatever were the elements of thatflower while it lived are gone, dispersed, you know not whither; you can neverdiscover nor re-collect them. But you can, by chemistry, out of the burnt dustof that flower, raise a spectrum of the flower, just as it seemed in life. Itmay be the same with the human being. The soul has so much escaped you as theessence or elements of the flower. Still you may make a spectrum of it. And thisphantom, though in the popular superstition it is held to be the soul of thedeparted, must not be confounded with the true soul; it is but the eidolon ofthe dead form.“Hence, like the best-attested stories of ghosts or spirits, the thing that moststrikes us is the absence of what we hold to be soul—that is, of superioremancipated intelligence. They come for little or no object—they seldom speak,if they do come; they utter no ideas above that of an ordinary person on earth.These American spirit-seers have published volumes of communications in proseand verse, which they assert to be given in the names of the most illustriousdead—Shakespeare, Bacon—heaven knows whom. Those communications, taking thebest, are certainly not a whit of higher order than would be communications fromliving persons of fair talent and education; they are wondrously inferior towhat Bacon, Shakespeare, and Plato said and wrote when on earth.“Nor, what is more notable, do they ever contain an idea that was not on theearth before. Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may be (granting them tobe truthful), I see much that philosophy may question, nothing that it isincumbent on philosophy to deny—viz. nothing supernatural. They are but ideasconveyed somehow or other (we have not yet discovered the means) from one mortalbrain to another. Whether, in so doing, tables walk of their own accord, orfiend-like shapes appear in a magic circle, or bodyless hands rise and removematerial objects, or a Thing of Darkness, such as presented itself to me, freezeour blood—still am I persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed, as byelectric wires, to my own brain from the brain of another. In some constitutionsthere is a natural chemistry, and those may produce chemic wonders—in others anatural fluid, call it electricity, and these produce electric wonders. But theydiffer in this from Normal Science—they are alike objectless, purposeless,puerile, frivolous. They lead on to no grand results; and therefore the worlddoes not heed, and true sages have not cultivated them. But sure I am, that ofall I saw or heard, a man, human as myself, was the remote originator; and Ibelieve unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced, for thisreason: no two persons, you say, have ever told you that they experiencedexactly the same thing. Well, observe, no two persons ever experience exactlythe same dream. If this were an ordinary imposture, the machinery would bearranged for results that would but little vary; if it were a supernaturalagency permitted by the Almighty, it would surely be for some definite end.“These phenomena belong to neither class; my persuasion is, that they originatein some brain now far distant; that that brain had no distinct volition inanything that occurred; that what does occur reflects but its devious, motley,ever-shifting, half-formed thoughts; in short, that it has been but the dreamsof such a brain put into action and invested with a semisubstance. That thisbrain is of immense power, that it can set matter into movement, that it ismalignant and destructive, I believe: some material force must have killed mydog; it might, for aught I know, have sufficed to kill myself, had I been assubjugated by terror as the dog—had my intellect or my spirit given me nocountervailing resistance in my will.”“It killed your dog! that is fearful! indeed, it is strange that no animal canbe induced to stay in that house; not even a cat. Rats and mice are never foundin it.”“The instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to theirexistence. Man's reason has a sense less subtle, because it has a resistingpower more supreme. But enough; do you comprehend my theory?”“Yes, though imperfectly—and I accept any crotchet (pardon the word), howeverodd, rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibedin our nurseries. Still, to my unfortunate house the evil is the same. What onearth can I do with the house?”“I will tell you what I would do. I am convinced from my own internal feelingsthat the small unfurnished room at right angles to the door of the bedroom whichI occupied, forms a starting-point or receptacle for the influences which hauntthe house; and I strongly advise you to have the walls opened, the floorremoved—nay, the whole room pulled down. I observe that it is detached from thebody of the house, built over the small back-yard, and could be removed withoutinjury to the rest of the building.”“And you think, if I did that—”“You would cut off the telegraph wires. Try it. I am so persuaded that I amright, that I will pay half the expense if you will allow me to direct theoperations.”“Nay, I am well able to afford the cost; for the rest, allow me to write toyou.”About ten days afterwards I received a letter from Mr J—, telling me that he hadvisited the house since I had seen him; that he had found the two letters I haddescribed, replaced in the drawer from which I had taken them; that he had readthem with misgivings like my own; that he had instituted a cautious inquiryabout the woman to whom I rightly conjectured they had been written. It seemedthat thirty-six years ago (a year before the date of the letters), she hadmarried against the wish of her relatives, an American of very suspiciouscharacter; in fact, he was generally believed to have been a pirate. She herselfwas the daughter of very respectable tradespeople, and had served in thecapacity of a nursery governess before her marriage. She had a brother, awidower, who was considered wealthy, and who had one child of about six yearsold. A month after the marriage, the body of this brother was found in theThames, near London Bridge; there seemed some marks of violence about histhroat, but they were not deemed sufficient to warrant the inquest in any otherverdict than that of “found drowned.”The American and his wife took charge of the little boy, the deceased brotherhaving by his will left his sister the guardian of his only child—and in theevent of the child's death, the sister inherited. The child died about sixmonths afterwards—it was supposed to have been neglected and ill-treated. Theneighbours deposed to have heard it shriek at night. The surgeon who hadexamined it after death, said that it was emaciated as if from want ofnourishment, and the body was covered with livid bruises. It seemed that onewinter night the child had sought to escape—crept out into the back-yard—triedto scale the wall—fallen back exhausted, and been found at morning on the stonesin a dying state. But though there was some evidence of cruelty, there was noneof murder; and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate cruelty byalleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of the child, who wasdeclared to be half-witted. Be that as it may, at the orphan's death the auntinherited her brother's fortune.Before the first wedded year was out, the American quitted England abruptly, andnever returned to it. He obtained a cruising vessel, which was lost in theAtlantic two years afterwards. The widow was left in affluence; but reverses ofvarious kinds had befallen her: a bank broke—an investment failed—she went intoa small business and became insolvent—then she entered into service, sinkinglower and lower, from housekeeper down to maid-of-all-work—never long retaininga place, though nothing peculiar against her character was ever alleged. She wasconsidered sober, honest, and peculiarly quiet in her ways; still nothingprospered with her. And so she had dropped into the workhouse, from which MrJ—had taken her, to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rentedas mistress in the first year of her wedded life.Mr J—added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room which I hadurged him to destroy, and that his impressions of dread while there were sogreat, though he had neither heard nor seen anything, that he was eager to havethe walls bared and the floors removed as I had suggested. He had engagedpersons for the work, and would commence any day I would name.The day was accordingly fixed. I repaired to the haunted house—we went into theblind dreary room, took up the skirting, and then the floors. Under the rafters,covered with rubbish, was found a trap-door, quite large enough to admit a man.It was closely nailed down, with clamps and rivets of iron. On removing these wedescended into a room below, the existence of which had never been suspected. Inthis room there had been a window and a flue, but they had been bricked over,evidently for many years. By the help of candles we examined this place; itstill retained some mouldering furniture—three chairs, an oak settle, atable—all of the fashion of about eighty years ago. There was a chest of drawersagainst the wall, in which we found, half-rotted away, old-fashioned articles ofa man's dress, such as might have been worn eighty or a hundred years ago by agentleman of some rank—costly steel buckles and buttons, like those yet worn incourt dresses—a handsome court sword—in a waistcoat which had once been richwith gold lace, but which was now blackened and foul with damp, we found fiveguineas, a few silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably for some place ofentertainment long since passed away. But our main discovery was in a kind ofiron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of which it cost us much trouble to getpicked.In this safe were three shelves and two small drawers. Ranged on the shelveswere several small bottles of crystal, hermetically stopped. They containedcolourless volatile essences, of what nature I shall say no more than that theywere not poisons—phosphor and ammonia entered into some of them. There were alsosome very curious glass tubes, and a small pointed rod of iron, with a largelump of rock-crystal, and another of amber—also a loadstone of great power.In one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold, and retainingthe freshness of its colours most remarkably, considering the length of time ithad probably been there. The portrait was that of a man who might be somewhatadvanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven or forty-eight.It was a most peculiar face—a most impressive face. If you could fancy somemighty serpent transformed into man, preserving in the human lineaments the oldserpent type, you would have a better idea of that countenance than longdescriptions can convey: the width and flatness of frontal—the tapering eleganceof contour disguising the strength of the deadly jaw—the long, large, terribleeye, glittering and green as the emerald—and withal a certain ruthless calm, asif from the consciousness of an immense power. The strange thing was this—theinstant I saw the miniature I recognised a startling likeness to one of therarest portraits in the world—the portrait of a man of a rank only below that ofroyalty, who in his own day had made a considerable noise. History says littleor nothing of him; but search the correspondence of his contemporaries, and youfind reference to his wild daring, his bold profligacy, his restless spirit, histaste for the occult sciences. While still in the meridian of life he died andwas buried, so say the chronicles, in a foreign land. He died in time to escapethe grasp of the law, for he was accused of crimes which would have given him tothe headsman.After his death, the portraits of him, which had been numerous, for he had beena munificent encourager of art, were bought up and destroyed—it was supposed byhis heirs, who might have been glad could they have razed his very name fromtheir splendid line. He had enjoyed a vast wealth; a large portion of this wasbelieved to have been embezzled by a favourite astrologer or soothsayer—at allevents, it had unaccountably vanished at the time of his death. One portraitalone of him was supposed to have escaped the general destruction; I had seen itin the house of a collector some months before. It had made on me a wonderfulimpression, as it does on all who behold it—a face never to be forgotten; andthere was that face in the miniature that lay within my hand. True, that in theminiature the man was a few years older than in the portrait I had seen, or thanthe original was even at the time of his death. But a few years!—why, betweenthe date in which flourished that direful noble and the date in which theminiature was evidently painted, there was an interval of more than twocenturies. While I was thus gazing, silent and wondering, Mr J—said:“But is it possible? I have known this man.”“How—where?” I cried.“In India. He was high in the confidence of the Rajah of —, and wellnigh drewhim into a revolt which would have lost the Rajah his dominions. The man was aFrenchman—his name de V—, clever, bold, lawless. We insisted on his dismissaland banishment: it must be the same man—no two faces like his—yet this miniatureseems nearly a hundred years old.”Mechanically I turned round the miniature to examine the back of it, and on theback was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle a ladder, and thethird step of the ladder was formed by the date 1765. Examining still moreminutely, I detected a spring; this, on being pressed, opened the back of theminiature as a lid. Within-side the lid was engraved “Mariana to thee—Befaithful in life and in death to —.” Here follows a name that I will notmention, but it was not unfamiliar to me. I had heard it spoken of by old men inmy childhood as the name borne by a dazzling charlatan, who had made a greatsensation in London for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge ofa double murder within his own house—that of his mistress and his rival. I saidnothing of this to Mr J—, to whom reluctantly I resigned the miniature.We had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron safe; wefound great difficulty in opening the second: it was not locked, but it resistedall efforts till we inserted in the chinks the edge of a chisel. When we hadthus drawn it forth, we found a very singular apparatus in the nicest order.Upon a small thin book, or rather tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal; thissaucer was filled with a clear liquid—on that liquid floated a kind of compass,with a needle shifting rapidly round, but instead of the usual points of acompass were seven strange characters, not very unlike those used by astrologersto denote the planets. A very peculiar, but not strong nor displeasing odour,came from this drawer, which was lined with a wood that we afterwards discoveredto be hazel. Whatever the cause of this odour, it produced a material effect onthe nerves. We all felt it, even the two workmen who were in the room—a creepingtingling sensation from the tips of the fingers to the roots of the hair.Impatient to examine the tablet, I removed the saucer. As I did so the needle ofthe compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness, and I felt a shockthat ran through my whole frame, so that I dropped the saucer on the flo or. Theliquid was spilt—the saucer was broken—the compass rolled to the end of theroom—and at that instant the walls shook to and fro, as if a giant had swayedand rocked them.The two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which we haddescended from the trap-door; but seeing that nothing more happened, they wereeasily induced to return.Meanwhile I had opened the tablet: it was bound in a plain red leather, with asilver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick vellum, and on that sheet wereinscribed, within a double pentacle, words in old monkish Latin, which areliterally to be translated thus:—“On all that it can reach within thesewalls—sentient or inanimate, living or dead—as moves the needle, so work mywill! Accursed be the house, and restless be the dwellers therein.”We found no more. Mr J—burnt the tablet and its anathema. He razed to thefoundations the part of the building containing the secret room with the chamberover it. He had then the courage to inhabit the house himself for a month, and aquieter, better-conditioned house could not be found in all London. Subsequentlyhe let it to advantage, and his tenant has made no complaints.But my story is not yet done. A few days after Mr J—had removed into the house,I paid him a visit. We were standing by the open window and conversing. A vancontaining some articles of furniture which he was moving from his former housewas at the door. I had just urged on him my theory that all those phenomenaregarded as supermundane had emanated from a human brain; adducing the charm, orrather curse, we had found and destroyed in support of my philosophy. Mr J—wasobserving in reply, “That even if mesmerism, or whatever analogous power itmight be called, could really thus work in the absence of the operator, andproduce effects so extraordinary, still could those effects continue when theoperator himself was dead? and if the spell had been wrought, and, indeed, theroom walled up, more than seventy years ago, the probability was, that theoperator had long since departed this life”; Mr J—, I say, was thus answering,when I caught hold of his arm and pointed to the street below.A well-dressed man had crossed from the opposite side, and was accosting thecarrier in charge of the van. His face, as he stood, was exactly fronting ourwindow. It was the face of the miniature we had discovered; it was the face ofthe portrait of the noble three centuries ago.“Good Heavens!” cried Mr J—, “that is the face of de V—, and scarcely a dayolder than when I saw it in the Rajah's court in my youth!”Seized by the same thought, we both hastened downstairs. I was first in thestreet; but the man had already gone. I caught sight of him, however, not manyyards in advance, and in another moment I was by his side.I had resolved to speak to him, but when I looked into his face I felt as if itwere impossible to do so. That eye—the eye of the serpent—fixed and held mespellbound. And withal, about the man's whole person there was a dignity, an airof pride and station and superiority, that would have made anyone, habituated tothe usages of the world, hesitate long before venturing upon a liberty orimpertinence. And what could I say? what was it I would ask? Thus ashamed of myfirst impulse, I fell a few paces back, still, however, following the stranger,undecided what else to do. Meanwhile he turned the corner of the street; a plaincarriage was in waiting, with a servant out of livery, dressed like avalet-de-place, at the carriage door. In another moment he had stepped into thecarriage, and it drove off. I returned to the house. Mr J—was still at thestreet door. He had asked the carrier what the stranger had said to him.“Merely asked whom that house now belonged to.”The same evening I happened to go with a friend to a place in town called theCosmopolitan Club, a place open to men of all countries, all opinions, alldegrees. One orders one's coffee, smokes one's cigar. One is always sure to meetagreeable, sometimes remarkable, persons.I had not been two minutes in the room before I beheld at a table, conversingwith an acquaintance of mine, whom I will designate by the initial G—, theman—the Original of the Miniature. He was now without his hat, and the likenesswas yet more startling, only I observed that while he was conversing there wasless severity in the countenance; there was even a smile, though a very quietand very cold one. The dignity of mien I had acknowledged in the street was alsomore striking; a dignity akin to that which invests some prince of theEast—conveying the idea of supreme indifference and habitual, indisputable,indolent, but resistless power.G—soon after left the stranger, who then took up a scientific journal, whichseemed to absorb his attention.I drew G—aside. “Who and what is that gentleman?”“That? Oh, a very remarkable man indeed. I met him last year amidst the caves ofPetra—the scriptural Edom. He is the best Oriental scholar I know. We joinedcompany, had an adventure with robbers, in which he showed a coolness that savedour lives; afterwards he invited me to spend a day with him in a house he hadbought at Damascus—a house buried amongst almond blossoms and roses—the mostbeautiful thing! He had lived there for some years, quite as an Oriental, ingrand style. I half suspect he is a renegade, immensely rich, very odd; by theby, a great mesmeriser. I have seen him with my own eyes produce an effect oninanimate things. If you take a letter from your pocket and throw it to theother end of the room, he will order it to come to his feet, and you will seethe letter wriggle itself along the floor till it has obeyed his command. ‘Ponmy honour, ‘tis true: I have seen him affect even the weather, disperse orcollect clouds, by means of a glass tube or wand. But he does not like talkingof these matters to strangers. He has only just arrived in England; says he hasnot been here for a great many years; let me introduce him to you.”“Certainly! He is English, then? What is his name?”“Oh!—a very homely one—Richards.”“And what is his birth—his family?”“How do I know? What does it signify?—no doubt some parvenu, but rich—soinfernally rich!”G—drew me up to the stranger, and the introduction was effected. The manners ofMr Richards were not those of an adventurous traveller. Travellers are ingeneral constitutionally gifted with high animal spirits: they are talkative,eager, imperious. Mr Richards was calm and subdued in tone, with manners whichwere made distant by the loftiness of punctilious courtesy—the manners of aformer age. I observed that the English he spoke was not exactly of our day. Ishould even have said that the accent was slightly foreign. But then Mr Richardsremarked that he had been little in the habit for many years of speaking in hisnative tongue. The conversation fell up on the changes in the aspect of Londonsince he had last visited our metropolis. G—then glanced off to the moralchanges—literary, social, political—the great men who were removed from thestage within the last twenty years—the new great men who were coming on. In allthis Mr Richards evinced no interest. He had evidently read none of our livingauthors, and seemed scarcely acquainted by name with our younger statesmen. Onceand only once he laughed; it was when G—asked him whether he had any thoughts ofgetting into Parliament. And the laugh was inward—sarcastic—sinister—a sneerraised into a laugh. After a few minutes G—left us to talk to some otheracquaintances who had just lounged into the room, and I then said quietly:“I have seen a miniature of you, Mr Richards, in the house you once inhabited,and perhaps built, if not wholly, at least in part, in—Street. You passed bythat house this morning.”Not till I had finished did I raise my eyes to his, and then his fixed my gazeso steadfastly that I could not withdraw it—those fascinating serpent eyes. Butinvoluntarily, and if the words that translated my thought were dragged from me,I added in a low whisper, “I have been a student in the mysteries of life andnature; of those mysteries I have known the occult professors. I have the rightto speak to you thus.” And I uttered a certain pass-word.“Well,” said he, dryly, “I concede the right—what would you ask?” “To whatextent human will in certain temperaments can extend?” “To what extent canthought extend? Think, and before you draw breath you are in China!”“True. But my thought has no power in China.”“Give it expression, and it may have: you may write down a thought which, sooneror later, may alter the whole condition of China. What is a law but a thought?Therefore thought is infinite—therefore thought has power; not in proportion toits value—a bad thought may make a bad law as potent as a good thought can makea good one.”“Yes; what you say confirms my own theory. Through invisible currents one humanbrain may transmit its ideas to other human brains with the same rapidity as athought promulgated by visible means. And as thought is imperishable—as itleaves its stamp behind it in the natural world even when the thinker has passedout of this world—so the thought of the living may have power to rouse up andrevive the thoughts of the dead—such as those thoughts were in life—though thethought of the living cannot reach the thoughts which the dead now mayentertain. Is it not so?”“I decline to answer, if, in my judgment, thought has the limit you would fix toit; but proceed. You have a special question you wish to put.”“Intense malignity in an intense will, engendered in a peculiar temperament, andaided by natural means within the reach of science, may produce effects likethose ascribed of old to evil magic. It might thus haunt the walls of a humanhabitation with spectral revivals of all guilty thoughts and guilty deeds onceconceived and done within those walls; all, in short, with which the evil willclaims rapport and affinity—imperfect, incoherent, fragmentary snatches at theold dramas acted therein years ago. Thoughts thus crossing each other haphazard,as in the nightmare of a vision, growing up into phantom sights and sounds, andall serving to create horror, not because those sights and sounds are reallyvisitations from a world without, but that they are ghastly monstrous renewalsof what have been in this world itself, set into malignant play by a malignantmortal.“And it is through the material agency of that human brain that these thingswould acquire even a human power—would strike as with the shock of electricity,and might kill, if the thought of the person assailed did not rise superior tothe dignity of the original assailer—might kill the most powerful animal ifunnerved by fear, but not injure the feeblest man, if, while his flesh crept,his mind stood out fearless. Thus, when in old stories we read of a magicianrent to pieces by the fiends he had evoked—or still more, in Eastern legends,that one magician succeeds by arts in destroying another—there may be so fartruth, that a material being has clothed, from its own evil propensities certainelements and fluids, usually quiescent or harmless, with awful shape andterrific force—just as the lightning that had lain hidden and innocent in thecloud becomes by natural law suddenly visible, takes a distinct shape to theeye, and can strike destruction on the object to which it is attracted.”“You are not without glimpses of a very mighty secret,” said Mr Richards,composedly. “According to your view, could a mortal obtain the power you speakof, he would necessarily be a malignant and evil being.”“If the power were exercised as I have said, most malignant and most evil—thoughI believe in the ancient traditions that he could not injure the good. His willcould only injure those with whom it has established an affinity, or over whomit forces unresisted sway. I will now imagine an example that may be within thelaws of nature, yet seem wild as the fables of a bewildered monk.“You will remember that Albertus Magnus, after describing minutely the processby which spirits may be invoked and commanded, adds emphatically that theprocess will instruct and avail only to the few—that a man must be born amagician!—that is, born with a peculiar physical temperament, as a man is born apoet. Rarely are men in whose constitution lurks this occult power of thehighest order of intellect;—usually in the intellect there is some twist,perversity, or disease. But, on the other hand, they must possess, to anastonishing degree, the faculty to concentrate thought on a single object—theenergic faculty that we call will. Therefore, though their intellect be notsound, it is exceedingly forcible for the attainment of what it desires. I willimagine such a person, pre-eminently gifted with this constitution and itsconcomitant forces. I will place him in the loftier grades of society. I willsuppose his desires emphatically those of the sensualist—he has, therefore, astrong love of life. He is an absolute egotist—his will is concentrated inhimself—he has fierce passions—he knows no enduring, no holy affections, but hecan covet eagerly what for the moment he desires—he can hate implacably whatopposes itself to his objects—he can commit fearful crimes, yet feel smallremorse—he resorts rather to curses upon others, than to penitence for hismisdeeds. Circumstances, to which his constitution guides him, lead him to arare knowledge of the natural secrets which may serve his egotism. He is a closeobserver where his passions encourage observation, he is a minute calculator,not from love of truth, but where love of self sharpens his faculties—thereforehe can be a man of science.“I suppose such a being, having by experience learned the power of his arts overothers, trying what may be the power of will over his own frame, and studyingall that in natural philosophy may increase that power. He loves life, he dreadsdeath; he wills to live on. He cannot restore himself to youth, he cannotentirely stay the progress of death, he cannot make himself immortal in theflesh and blood; but he may arrest for a time so prolonged as to appearincredible, if I said it—that hardening of the parts which constitutes old age.A year may age him no more than an hour ages another. His intense will,scientifically trained into system, operates, in short, over the wear and tearof his own frame. He lives on. That he may not seem a portent and a miracle, hedies from time to time, seemingly, to certain persons. Having schemed thetransfer of a wealth that suffices to his wants, he disappears from one cornerof the world, and contrives that his obsequies shall be celebrated. He reappearsat another corner of the world, where he resides undetected, and does notrevisit the scenes of his former career till all who could remember his featuresare no more. He would be profoundly miserable if he had affections—he has nonebut for himself. No good man would accept his longevity, and to no men, good orbad, would he or could he communicate its true secret. Such a man might exist;such a man as I have described I see now before me!—Duke of—, in the court of —,dividing time between lust and brawl, alchemists and wizards;—again, in the lastcentury, charlatan and criminal, with name less noble, domiciled in the house atwhich you gazed to-day, and flying from the law you had outraged, none knewwhither; traveller once more revisiting London, with the same earthly passionswhich filled your heart when races now no more walked through yonder streets;outlaw from the school of all the nobler and diviner mystics; execrable Image ofLife in Death and Death in Life, I warn you back from the cities and homes ofhealthful men; back to the ruins of departed empires; back to the deserts ofnature unredeemed!”There answered me a whisper so musical, so potently musical, that it seemed toenter into my whole being, and subdue me despite myself. Thus it said:“I have sought one like you for the last hundred years. Now I have found you, wepart not till I know what I desire. The vision that sees through the Past, andcleaves through the veil of the Future, is in you at this hour; never before,never to come again. The vision of no puling fantastic girl, of no sick-bedsomnambule, but of a strong man, with a vigorous brain. Soar and look forth!”As he spoke I felt as if I rose out of myself upon eagle wings. All the weightseemed gone from air—roofless the room, roofless the dome of space. I was not inthe body—where I knew not—but aloft over time, over earth.Again I heard the melodious whisper,—“You say right. I have mastered greatsecrets by the power of Will; true, by Will and by Science I can retard theprocess of years: but death comes not by age alone. Can I frustrate theaccidents which bring death upon the young?”“No; every accident is a providence. Before a providence snaps every humanwill.”“Shall I die at last, ages and ages hence, by the slow, though inevitable,growth of time, or by the cause that I call accident?”“By a cause you call accident.”“Is not the end still remote?” asked the whisper, with a slight tremor.“Regarded as my life regards time, it is still remote.”“And shall I, before then, mix with the world of men as I did ere I learnedthese secrets, resume eager interest in their strife and their trouble—battlewith ambition, and use the power of the sage to win the power that belongs tokings?”“You will yet play a part on the earth that will fill earth with commotion andamaze. For wondrous designs have you, a wonder yourself, been permitted to liveon through the centuries. All the secrets you have stored will then have theiruses—all that now makes you a stranger amidst the generations will contributethen to make you their lord. As the trees and the straws are drawn into awhirlpool—as they spin round, are sucked to the deep, and again tossed aloft bythe eddies, so shall races and thrones be plucked into the charm of your vortex.Awful Destroyer—but in destroying, made, against your own will, a Constructor!”“And that date, too, is far off?”“Far off; when it comes, think your end in this world is at hand!”“How and what is the end? Look east, west, south, and north.”“In the north, where you never yet trod towards the point whence your instinctshave warned you, there a spectre will seize you. ‘Tis Death! I see a ship—it ishaunted—‘tis chased—it sails on. Baffled navies sail after that ship. It entersthe region of ice. It passes a sky red with meteors. Two moons stand on high,over ice-reefs. I see the ship locked between white defiles—they are ice-rocks.I see the dead strew the decks—stark and livid, green mould on their limbs. Allare dead but one man—it is you! But years, though so slowly they come, have thenscathed you. There is the coming of age on your brow, and the will is relaxed inthe cells of the brain. Still that will, though enfeebled, exceeds all that manknew before you, through the will you live on, gnawed with famine; and nature nolonger obeys you in that death-spreading region; the sky is a sky of iron, andthe air has iron clamps, and the ice-rocks wedge in the ship. Hark how it cracksand groans. Ice will imbed it as amber imbeds a straw. And a man has gone forth,living yet, from the ship and its dead; and he has clambered up the spikes of aniceberg, and the two moons gaze down on his form. That man is yourself; andterror is on you—terror; and terror has swallowed your will. And I see swarmingup the steep ice-rock, grey grisly things. The bears of the north have scentedtheir quarry—they come near you and nearer, shambling and rolling their bulk.And in that day every moment shall seem to you longer than the centuries throughwhich you have passed. And heed this—after life, moments continued make thebliss or the hell of eternity.”“Hush,” said the whisper; “but the day, you assure me, is far off—very far! I goback to the almond and rose of Damascus!—sleep!”The room swam before my eyes. I became insensible. When I recovered, I foundG—holding my hand and smiling. He said, “You who have always declared yourselfproof against mesmerism have succumbed at last to my friend Richards.”“Where is Mr Richards?”“Gone, when you passed into a trance—saying quietly to me, ‘Your friend will notwake for an hour.’“I asked, as collectedly as I could, where Mr Richards lodged.“At the Trafalgar Hotel.”“Give me your arm,” said I to G—; “let us call on him; I have something to say.”When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that Mr Richards had returned twentyminutes before, paid his bill, left directions with his servant (a Greek) topack his effects and proceed to Malta by the steamer that should leaveSouthampton the next day. Mr Richards had merely said of his own movements thathe had visits to pay in the neighbourhood of London, and it was uncertainwhether he should be able to reach Southampton in time for that steamer; if not,he should follow in the next one.The waiter asked me my name. On my informing him, he gave me a note that MrRichards had left for me, in case I called.The note was as follows: “I wished you to utter what was in your mind. Youobeyed. I have therefore established power over you. For three months from thisday you can communicate to no living man what has passed between us—you cannoteven show this note to the friend by your side. During three months, silencecomplete as to me and mine. Do you doubt my power to lay on you thiscommand?—try to disobey me. At the end of the third month, the spell is raised.For the rest I spare you. I shall visit your grave a year and a day after it hasreceived you.”So ends this strange story, which I ask no one to believe. I write it downexactly three months after I received the above note. I could not write itbefore, nor could I show to G—, in spite of his urgent request, the note which Iread under the gas-lamp by his side."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] CASTING THE RUNES Image [images/u4.jpg]by Montague Rhodes JamesMontague Rhodes James has an intelligent and scientific knowledge of humannerves and feelings; and knows just how to apportion statement, imagery, andsubtle suggestions in order to secure the best results with his readers.H.P. LOVECRAFTSuch high praise from the god of modern horror is not undeserved. MontagueRhodes James (1862-1936) was, and still remains by many accounts, the undisputedmaster of the horror ghost story. An English academic and mediaeval scholar, heserved in the position of provost at King's College, Cambridge and later Eton.He enjoyed delighting his friends and family on Christmas Eve with hiscontemporary, realistic ghost stories, which he read aloud while sitting next toa cozy fire. (It is likely that gin punch or brandy may have been involved.)James' style of storytelling (now known as “Jamesian”) dispensed with all theGothic clichés we might expect from a classic ghost story, and often follows theplot formula of an older scholar as protagonist and some ancient and mysteriousobject that summons a supernatural presence.A James ghost story is meant to be read aloud. So if you possibly can, arrangeit sit down with some friends or perhaps your children, get comfortable, andslowly and deliberately read aloud “Casting of Runes.”CASTING THE RUNESApril 15th, 190-Dear Sir,I am requested by the Council of the—Association to return to you the draft of apaper on The Truth of Alchemy, which you have been good enough to offer to readat our forthcoming meeting, and to inform you that the Council do not see theirway to including it in the programme.I am,Yours faithfully,—Secretary.* * * * *April 18thDear Sir,I am sorry to say that my engagements do not permit of my affording you aninterview on the subject of your proposed paper. Nor do our laws allow of yourdiscussing the matter with a Committee of our Council, as you suggest. Pleaseallow me to assure you that the fullest consideration was given to the draftwhich you submitted, and that it was not declined without having been referredto the judgment of a most competent authority. No personal question (it canhardly be necessary for me to add) can have had the slightest influence on thedecision of the Council.Believe me (ut supra).* * * * *April 20thThe Secretary of the—Association begs respectfully to inform Mr Karswell that itis impossible for him to communicate the name of any person or persons to whomthe draft of Mr Karswell's paper may have been submitted; and further desires tointimate that he cannot undertake to reply to any further letters on thissubject.* * * * *“And who is Mr Karswell?” inquired the Secretary's wife. She had called at hisoffice, and (perhaps unwarrantably) had picked up the last of these threeletters, which the typist had just brought in.“Why, my dear, just at present Mr Karswell is a very angry man. But I don't knowmuch about him otherwise, except that he is a person of wealth, his address isLufford Abbey, Warwickshire, and he's an alchemist, apparently, and wants totell us all about it; and that's about all—except that I don't want to meet himfor the next week or two. Now, if you're ready to leave this place, I am.”“What have you been doing to make him angry?” asked Mrs Secretary.“The usual thing, my dear, the usual thing: he sent in a draft of a paper hewanted to read at the next meeting, and we referred it to Edward Dunning—almostthe only man in England who knows about these things—and he said it wasperfectly hopeless, so we declined it. So Karswell has been pelting me withletters ever since. The last thing he wanted was the name of the man we referredhis nonsense to; you saw my answer to that. But don't you say anything about it,for goodness' sake.”“I should think not, indeed. Did I ever do such a thing? I do hope, though, hewon't get to know that it was poor Mr Dunning.”“Poor Mr Dunning? I don't know why you call him that; he's a very happy man, isDunning. Lots of hobbies and a comfortable home, and all his time to himself.”“I only meant I should be sorry for him if this man got hold of his name, andcame and bothered him.”“Oh, ah! yes. I dare say he would be poor Mr Dunning then.”The Secretary and his wife were lunching out, and the friends to whose housethey were bound were Warwickshire people. So Mrs Secretary had already settledit in her own mind that she would question them judiciously about Mr Karswell.But she was saved the trouble of leading up to the subject, for the hostess saidto the host, before many minutes had passed, “I saw the Abbot of Lufford thismorning.” The host whistled. “Did you? What in the world brings him up to town?”“Goodness knows; he was coming out of the British Museum gate as I drove past.”It was not unnatural that Mrs Secretary should inquire whether this was a realAbbot who was being spoken of. “Oh no, my dear: only a neighbour of ours in thecountry who bought Lufford Abbey a few years ago. His real name is Karswell.”“Is he a friend of yours?” asked Mr Secretary, with a private wink to his wife.The question let loose a torrent of declamation. There was really nothing to besaid for Mr Karswell. Nobody knew what he did with himself: his servants were ahorrible set of people; he had invented a new religion for himself, andpractised no one could tell what appalling rites; he was very easily offended,and never forgave anybody; he had a dreadful face (so the lady insisted, herhusband somewhat demurring); he never did a kind action, and whatever influencehe did exert was mischievous. “Do the poor man justice, dear,” the husbandinterrupted. “You forget the treat he gave the school children.” “Forget it,indeed! But I'm glad you mentioned it, because it gives an idea of the man. Now,Florence, listen to this. The first winter he was at Lufford this delightfulneighbour of ours wrote to the clergyman of his parish (he's not ours, but weknow him very well) and offered to show the school children some magic-lanternslides. He said he had some new kinds, which he thought would interest them.Well, the clergyman was rather surprised, because Mr Karswell had shown himselfinclined to be unpleasant to the children—complaining of their trespassing, orsomething of the sort; but of course he accepted, and the evening was fixed, andour friend went himself to see that everything went right. He said he never hadbeen so thankful for anything as that his own children were all prevented frombeing there: they were at a children's party at our house, as a matter of fact.Because this Mr Karswell had evidently set out with the intention of frighteningthese poor village children out of their wits, and I do believe, if he had beenallowed to go on, he would actually have done so. He began with somecomparatively mild things. Red Riding Hood was one, and even then, Mr Farrersaid, the wolf was so dreadful that several of the smaller children had to betaken out: and he said Mr Karswell began the story by producing a noise like awolf howling in the distance, which was the most gruesome thing he had everheard. All the slides he showed, Mr Farrer said, were most clever; they wereabsolutely realistic, and where he had got them or how he worked them he couldnot imagine. Well, the show went on, and the stories kept on becoming a littlemore terrifying each time, and the children were mesmerized into completesilence. At last he produced a series which represented a little boy passingthrough his own park—Lufford, I mean—in the evening. Every child in the roomcould recognize the place from the pictures. And this poor boy was followed, andat last pursued and overtaken, and either torn to pieces or somehow made awaywith, by a horrible hopping creature in white, which you saw first dodging aboutamong the trees, and gradually it appeared more and more plainly. Mr Farrer saidit gave him one of the worst nightmares he ever remembered, and what it musthave meant to the children doesn't bear thinking of. Of course this was toomuch, and he spoke very sharply indeed to Mr Karswell, and said it couldn't goon. All he said was: ‘Oh, you think it's time to bring our little show to an endand send them home to their beds? Very well!’ And then, if you please, heswitched on another slide, which showed a great mass of snakes, centipedes, anddisgusting creatures with wings, and somehow or other he made it seem as if theywere climbing out of the picture and getting in amongst the audience; and thiswas accompanied by a sort of dry rustling noise which sent the children nearlymad, and of course they stampeded. A good many of them were rather hurt ingetting out of the room, and I don't suppose one of them closed an eye thatnight. There was the most dreadful trouble in the village afterwards. Of coursethe mothers threw a good part of the blame on poor Mr Farrer, and, if they couldhave got past the gates, I believe the fathers would have broken every window inthe Abbey. Well, now, that's Mr Karswell: that's the Abbot of Lufford, my dear,and you can imagine how we covet his society.”“Yes, I think he has all the possibilities of a distinguished criminal, hasKarswell,” said the host. “I should be sorry for anyone who got into his badbooks.”“Is he the man, or am I mixing him up with someone else?” asked the Secretary(who for some minutes had been wearing the frown of the man who is trying torecollect something). “Is he the man who brought out a History of Witchcraftsome time back—ten years or more?”“That's the man; do you remember the reviews of it?”“Certainly I do; and what's equally to the point, I knew the author of the mostincisive of the lot. So did you: you must remember John Harrington; he was atJohn's in our time.”“Oh, very well indeed, though I don't think I saw or heard anything of himbetween the time I went down and the day I read the account of the inquest onhim.”“Inquest?” said one of the ladies. “What has happened to him?”“Why, what happened was that he fell out of a tree and broke his neck. But thepuzzle was, what could have induced him to get up there. It was a mysteriousbusiness, I must say. Here was this man—not an athletic fellow, was he? and withno eccentric twist about him that was ever noticed—walking home along a countryroad late in the evening—no tramps about—well known and liked in the place—andhe suddenly begins to run like mad, loses his hat and stick, and finally shinsup a tree—quite a difficult tree—growing in the hedgerow: a dead branch givesway, and he comes down with it and breaks his neck, and there he's found nextmorning with the most dreadful face of fear on him that could be imagined. Itwas pretty evident, of course, that he had been chased by something, and peopletalked of savage dogs, and beasts escaped out of menageries; but there wasnothing to be made of that. That was in ‘89, and I believe his brother Henry(whom I remember as well at Cambridge, but you probably don't) has been tryingto get on the track of an explanation ever since. He, of course, insists therewas malice in it, but I don't know. It's difficult to see how it could have comein.”After a time the talk reverted to the History of Witchcraft. “Did you ever lookinto it?” asked the host.“Yes, I did,” said the Secretary. “I went so far as to read it.”“Was it as bad as it was made out to be?”“Oh, in point of style and form, quite hopeless. It deserved all the pulverizingit got. But, besides that, it was an evil book. The man believed every word ofwhat he was saying, and I'm very much mistaken if he hadn't tried the greaterpart of his receipts.”“Well, I only remember Harrington's review of it, and I must say if I'd been theauthor it would have quenched my literary ambition for good. I should never haveheld up my head again.”“It hasn't had that effect in the present case. But come, it's half-past three;I must be off.”On the way home the Secretary's wife said, “I do hope that horrible man won'tfind out that Mr Dunning had anything to do with the rejection of his paper.” “Idon't think there's much chance of that,” said the Secretary. “Dunning won'tmention it himself, for these matters are confidential, and none of us will forthe same reason. Karswell won't know his name, for Dunning hasn't publishedanything on the same subject yet. The only danger is that Karswell might findout, if he was to ask the British Museum people who was in the habit ofconsulting alchemical manuscripts: I can't very well tell them not to mentionDunning, can I? It would set them talking at once. Let's hope it won't occur tohim.”However, Mr Karswell was an astute man.* * * * *This much is in the way of prologue. On an evening rather later in the sameweek, Mr Edward Dunning was returning from the British Museum, where he had beenengaged in research, to the comfortable house in a suburb where he lived alone,tended by two excellent women who had been long with him. There is nothing to beadded by way of description of him to what we have heard already. Let us followhim as he takes his sober course homewards.* * * * *A train took him to within a mile or two of his house, and an electric tram astage farther. The line ended at a point some three hundred yards from his frontdoor. He had had enough of reading when he got into the car, and indeed thelight was not such as to allow him to do more than study the advertisements onthe panes of glass that faced him as he sat. As was not unnatural, theadvertisements in this particular line of cars were objects of his frequentcontemplation, and, with the possible exception of the brilliant and convincingdialogue between Mr Lamplough and an eminent K.C. on the subject of PyreticSaline, none of them afforded much scope to his imagination. I am wrong: therewas one at the corner of the car farthest from him which did not seem familiar.It was in blue letters on a yellow ground, and all that he could read of it wasa name—John Harrington—and something like a date. It could be of no interest tohim to know more; but for all that, as the car emptied, he was just curiousenough to move along the seat until he could read it well. He felt to a slightextent repaid for his trouble; the advertisement was not of the usual type. Itran thus: “In memory of John Harrington, F.S.A., of The Laurels, Ashbrooke. DiedSept. 18th, 1889. Three months were allowed.”The car stopped. Mr Dunning, still contemplating the blue letters on the yellowground, had to be stimulated to rise by a word from the conductor. “I beg yourpardon,” he said, “I was looking at that advertisement; it's a very odd one,isn't it?” The conductor read it slowly. “Well, my word,” he said, “I never seethat one before. Well, that is a cure, ain't it? Someone bin up to their jokes‘ere, I should think.” He got out a duster and applied it, not without saliva,to the pane and then to the outside. “No,” he said, returning, “that ain't notransfer; seems to me as if it was reg'lar in the glass, what I mean in thesubstance, as you may say. Don't you think so, sir?” Mr Dunning examined it andrubbed it with his glove, and agreed. “Who looks after these advertisements, andgives leave for them to be put up? I wish you would inquire. I will just take anote of the words.” At this moment there came a call from the driver: “Lookalive, George, time's up.” “All right, all right; there's something else what'sup at this end. You come and look at this ‘ere glass.” “What's gorn with theglass?” said the driver, approaching. “Well, and oo's ‘Arrington? What's it allabout?” “I was just asking who was responsible for putting the advertisements upin your cars, and saying it would be as well to make some inquiry about thisone.” “Well, sir, that's all done at the Company's office, that work is: it'sour Mr Timms, I believe, looks into that. When we put up tonight I'll leaveword, and per'aps I'll be able to tell you tomorrer if you ‘appen to be comingthis way.”This was all that passed that evening. Mr Dunning did just go to the trouble oflooking up Ashbrooke, and found that it was in Warwickshire.Next day he went to town again. The car (it was the same car) was too full inthe morning to allow of his getting a word with the conductor: he could only besure that the curious advertisement had been made away with. The close of theday brought a further element of mystery into the transaction. He had missed thetram, or else preferred walking home, but at a rather late hour, while he was atwork in his study, one of the maids came to say that two men from the tramwayswas very anxious to speak to him. This was a reminder of the advertisement,which he had, he says, nearly forgotten. He had the men in—they were theconductor and driver of the car—and when the matter of refreshment had beenattended to, asked what Mr Timms had had to say about the advertisement. “Well,sir, that's what we took the liberty to step round about,” said the conductor.“Mr Timms ‘e give William ‘ere the rough side of his tongue about that: ‘cordin’to ‘im there warn't no advertisement of that description sent in, nor ordered,nor paid for, nor put up, nor nothink, let alone not bein’ there, and we wasplaying the fool takin' up his time. ‘Well,’ I says, ‘if that's the case, all Iask of you, Mr Timms,’ I says, ‘is to take and look at it for yourself,’ I says.‘Of course if it ain't there,’ I says, ‘you may take and call me what you like.’‘Right,’ he says, ‘I will’: and we went straight off. Now, I leave it to you,sir, if that ad, as we term ‘em, with ‘Arrington on it warn't as plain as everyou see anythink—blue letters on yeller glass, and as I says at the time, andyou borne me out, reg'lar in the glass, because, if you remember, you recollectof me swabbing it with my duster.” “To be sure I do, quite clearly—well?” “Youmay say well, I don't think. Mr Timms he gets in that car with a light—no, hetelled William to ‘old the light outside. ‘Now,’ he says, ‘where's your preciousad. what we've ‘eard so much about?’ ‘Ere it is,’ I says, ‘Mr Timms,’ and I laidmy ‘and on it.’” The conductor paused.“Well,” said Mr Dunning, “it was gone, I suppose. Broken?”“Broke!—not it. There warn't, if you'll believe me, no more trace of themletters—blue letters they was—on that piece o' glass, than—well, it's no good metalkin'. I never see such a thing. I leave it to William here if—but there, as Isays, where's the benefit in me going on about it?”“And what did Mr Timms say?”“Why ‘e did what I give ‘im leave to—called us pretty much any-think he liked,and I don't know as I blame him so much neither. But what we thought, Williamand me did, was as we seen you take down a bit of a note about that—well, thatletterin'—”“I certainly did that, and I have it now. Did you wish me to speak to Mr Timmsmyself, and show it to him? Was that what you came in about?”“There, didn't I say as much?” said William. “Deal with a gent if you can get onthe track of one, that's my word. Now perhaps, George, you'll allow as I ain'ttook you very far wrong tonight.”“Very well, William, very well; no need for you to go on as if you'd ‘ad tofrog's-march me ‘ere. I come quiet, didn't I? All the same for that, we ‘adn'tought to take up your time this way, sir; but if it so ‘appened you could findtime to step round to the Company orfice in the morning and tell Mr Timms whatyou seen for yourself, we should lay under a very ‘igh obligation to you for thetrouble. You see it ain't bein' called—well, one thing and another, as we mind,but if they got it into their ‘ead at the orfice as we seen things as warn'tthere, why, one thing leads to another, and where we should be a twelvemunce‘ence—well, you can understand what I mean.”Amid further elucidations of the proposition, George, conducted by William, leftthe room.The incredulity of Mr Timms (who had a nodding acquaintance with Mr Dunning) wasgreatly modified on the following day by what the latter could tell and showhim; and any bad mark that might have been attached to the names of William andGeorge was not suffered to remain on the Company's books; but explanation therewas none.Mr Dunning's interest in the matter was kept alive by an incident of thefollowing afternoon. He was walking from his club to the train, and he noticedsome way ahead a man with a handful of leaflets such as are distributed topassers-by by agents of enterprising firms. This agent had not chosen a verycrowded street for his operations: in fact, Mr Dunning did not see him get ridof a single leaflet before he himself reached the spot. One was thrust into hishand as he passed: the hand that gave it touched his, and he experienced a sortof little shock as it did so. It seemed unnaturally rough and hot. He looked inpassing at the giver, but the impression he got was so unclear that, howevermuch he tried to reckon it up subsequently, nothing would come. He was walkingquickly, and as he went on glanced at the paper. It was a blue one. The name ofHarrington in large capitals caught his eye. He stopped, startled, and felt forhis glasses. The next instant the leaflet was twitched out of his hand by a manwho hurried past, and was irrecoverably gone. He ran back a few paces, but wherewas the passer-by? and where the distributor?It was in a somewhat pensive frame of mind that Mr Dunning passed on thefollowing day into the Select Manuscript Room of the British Museum, and filledup tickets for Harley 3586, and some other volumes. After a few minutes theywere brought to him, and he was settling the one he wanted first up on the desk,when he thought he heard his own name whispered behind him. He turned roundhastily, and in doing so, brushed his little portfolio of loose papers on to thefloor. He saw no one he recognized except one of the staff in charge of theroom, who nodded to him, and he proceeded to pick up his papers. He thought hehad them all, and was turning to begin work, when a stout gentleman at the tablebehind him, who was just rising to leave, and had collected his own belongings,touched him on the shoulder, saying, “May I give you this? I think it should beyours,” and handed him a missing quire. “It is mine, thank you,” said MrDunning. In another moment the man had left the room. Upon finishing his workfor the afternoon, Mr Dunning had some conversation with the assistant incharge, and took occasion to ask who the stout gentleman was. “Oh, he's a mannamed Karswell,” said the assistant; “he was asking me a week ago who were thegreat authorities on alchemy, and of course I told him you were the only one inthe country. I'll see if I can catch him: he'd like to meet you, I'm sure.”“For heaven's sake don't dream of it!” said Mr Dunning, “I'm particularlyanxious to avoid him.”“Oh! very well,” said the assistant, “he doesn't come here often: I dare say youwon't meet him.”More than once on the way home that day Mr Dunning confessed to himself that hedid not look forward with his usual cheerfulness to a solitary evening. Itseemed to him that something ill-defined and impalpable had stepped in betweenhim and his fellow-men—had taken him in charge, as it were. He wanted to sitclose up to his neighbours in the train and in the tram, but as luck would haveit both train and car were markedly empty. The conductor George was thoughtful,and appeared to be absorbed in calculations as to the number of passengers. Onarriving at his house he found Dr Watson, his medical man, on his doorstep.“I've had to upset your household arrangements, I'm sorry to say, Dunning. Bothyour servants hors de combat. In fact, I've had to send them to the NursingHome.”“Good heavens! what's the matter?”“It's something like ptomaine poisoning, I should think: you've not sufferedyourself, I can see, or you wouldn't be walking about. I think they'll pullthrough all right.”“Dear, dear! Have you any idea what brought it on?” “Well, they tell me theybought some shell-fish from a hawker at their dinner-time. It's odd. I've madeinquiries, but I can't find that any hawker has been to other houses in thestreet. I couldn't send word to you; they won't be back for a bit yet. You comeand dine with me tonight, anyhow, and we can make arrangements for going on.Eight o'clock. Don't be too anxious.” The solitary evening was thus obviated; atthe expense of some distress and inconvenience, it is true. Mr Dunning spent thetime pleasantly enough with the doctor (a rather recent settler), and returnedto his lonely home at about 11.30. The night he passed is not one on which helooks back with any satisfaction. He was in bed and the light was out. He waswondering if the charwoman would come early enough to get him hot water nextmorning, when he heard the unmistakable sound of his study door opening. No stepfollowed it on the passage floor, but the sound must mean mischief, for he knewthat he had shut the door that evening after putting his papers away in hisdesk. It was rather shame than courage that induced him to slip out into thepassage and lean over the banister in his nightgown, listening. No light wasvisible; no further sound came: only a gust of warm, or even hot air played foran instant round his shins. He went back and decided to lock himself into hisroom. There was more unpleasantness, however. Either an economical suburbancompany had decided that their light would not be required in the small hours,and had stopped working, or else something was wrong with the meter; the effectwas in any case that the electric light was off. The obvious course was to finda match, and also to consult his watch: he might as well know how many hours ofdiscomfort awaited him. So he put his hand into the well-known nook under thepillow: only, it did not get so far. What he touched was, according to hisaccount, a mouth, with teeth, and with hair about it, and, he declares, not themouth of a human being. I do not think it is any use to guess what he said ordid; but he was in a spare room with the door locked and his ear to it before hewas clearly conscious again. And there he spent the rest of a most miserablenight, looking every moment for some fumbling at the door: but nothing came.The venturing back to his own room in the morning was attended with manylistenings and quiverings. The door stood open, fortunately, and the blinds wereup (the servants had been out of the house before the hour of drawing themdown); there was, to be short, no trace of an inhabitant. The watch, too, was inits usual place; nothing was disturbed, only the wardrobe door had swung open,in accordance with its confirmed habit. A ring at the back door now announcedthe charwoman, who had been ordered the night before, and nerved Mr Dunning,after letting her in, to continue his search in other parts of the house. It wasequally fruitless.The day thus begun went on dismally enough. He dared not go to the Museum: inspite of what the assistant had said, Karswell might turn up there, and Dunningfelt he could not cope with a probably hostile stranger. His own house wasodious; he hated sponging on the doctor. He spent some little time in a call atthe Nursing Home, where he was slightly cheered by a good report of hishousekeeper and maid. Towards lunch-time he betook himself to his club, againexperiencing a gleam of satisfaction at seeing the Secretary of the Association.At luncheon Dunning told his friend the more material of his woes, but could notbring himself to speak of those that weighed most heavily on his spirits. “Mypoor dear man,” said the Secretary, “what an upset! Look here: we're alone athome, absolutely. You must put up with us. Yes! no excuse: send your things inthis afternoon.” Dunning was unable to stand out: he was, in truth, becomingacutely anxious, as the hours went on, as to what that night might have waitingfor him. He was almost happy as he hurried home to pack up.His friends, when they had time to take stock of him, were rather shocked at hislorn appearance, and did their best to keep him up to the mark. Not altogetherwithout success: but, when the two men were smoking alone later, Dunning becamedull again. Suddenly he said, “Gayton, I believe that alchemist man knows it wasI who got his paper rejected.” Gayton whistled. “What makes you think that?” hesaid. Dunning told of his conversation with the Museum assistant, and Gaytoncould only agree that the guess seemed likely to be correct. “Not that I caremuch,” Dunning went on, “only it might be a nuisance if we were to meet. He's abad-tempered party, I imagine.” Conversation dropped again; Gayton became moreand more strongly impressed with the desolateness that came over Dunning's faceand bearing, and finally—though with a considerable effort—he asked himpoint-blank whether something serious was not bothering him. Dunning gave anexclamation of relief. “I was perishing to get it off my mind,” he said. “Do youknow anything about a man named John Harrington?” Gayton was thoroughlystartled, and at the moment could only ask why. Then the complete story ofDunning's experiences came out—what had happened in the tramcar, in his ownhouse, and in the street, the troubling of spirit that had crept over him, andstill held him; and he ended with the question he had begun with. Gayton was ata loss how to answer him. To tell the story of Harrington's end would perhaps beright; only, Dunning was in a nervous state, the story was a grim one, and hecould not help asking himself whether there were not a connecting link betweenthese two cases, in the person of Karswell. It was a difficult concession for ascientific man, but it could be eased by the phrase “hypnotic suggestion.” Inthe end he decided that his answer tonight should be guarded; he would talk thesituation over with his wife. So he said that he had known Harrington atCambridge, and believed he had died suddenly in 1889, adding a few details aboutthe man and his published work. He did talk over the matter with Mrs Gayton,and, as he had anticipated, she leapt at once to the conclusion which had beenhovering before him. It was she who reminded him of the surviving brother, HenryHarrington, and she also who suggested that he might be got hold of by means oftheir hosts of the day before. “He might be a hopeless crank,” objected Gayton.“That could be ascertained from the Bennetts, who knew him,” Mrs Gaytonretorted; and she undertook to see the Bennetts the very next day.* * * * *It is not necessary to tell in further detail the steps by which HenryHarrington and Dunning were brought together.* * * * *The next scene that does require to be narrated is a conversation that tookplace between the two. Dunning had told Harrington of the strange ways in whichthe dead man's name had been brought before him, and had said something,besides, of his own subsequent experiences. Then he had asked if Harrington wasdisposed, in return, to recall any of the circumstances connected with hisbrother's death. Harrington's surprise at what he heard can be imagined: but hisreply was readily given.“John,” he said, “was in a very odd state, undeniably, from time to time, duringsome weeks before, though not immediately before, the catastrophe. There wereseveral things; the principal notion he had was that he thought he was beingfollowed. No doubt he was an impressionable man, but he never had had suchfancies as this before. I cannot get it out of my mind that there was ill-willat work, and what you tell me about yourself reminds me very much of my brother.Can you think of any possible connecting link?”“There is just one that has been taking shape vaguely in my mind. I've been toldthat your brother reviewed a book very severely not long before he died, andjust lately I have happened to cross the path of the man who wrote that book ina way he would resent.”“Don't tell me the man was called Karswell.”“Why not? that is exactly his name.”Henry Harrington leant back. “That is final to my mind. Now I must explainfurther. From something he said, I feel sure that my brother John was beginningto believe—very much against his will—that Karswell was at the bottom of histrouble. I want to tell you what seems to me to have a bearing on the situation.My brother was a great musician, and used to run up to concerts in town. He cameback, three months before he died, from one of these, and gave me his programmeto look at—an analytical programme: he always kept them. ‘I nearly missed thisone,’ he said. ‘I suppose I must have dropped it: anyhow, I was looking for itunder my seat and in my pockets and so on, and my neighbour offered me his, said“might he give it me, he had no further use for it,” and he went away justafterwards. I don't know who he was—a stout, clean-shaven man. I should havebeen sorry to miss it; of course I could have bought another, but this cost menothing.’ At another time he told me that he had been very uncomfortable both onthe way to his hotel and during the night. I piece things together now inthinking it over. Then, not very long after, he was going over these programmes,putting them in order to have them bound up, and in this particular one (whichby the way I had hardly glanced at), he found quite near the beginning a stripof paper with some very odd writing on it in red and black—most carefullydone—it looked to me more like Runic letters than anything else. ‘Why,’ he said,‘this must belong to my fat neighbour. It looks as if it might be worthreturning to him; it may be a copy of something; evidently someone has takentrouble over it. How can I find his address?’ We talked it over for a little andagreed that it wasn't worth advertising about, and that my brother had betterlook out for the man at the next concert, to which he was going very soon. Thepaper was lying on the book and we were both by the fire; it was a cold, windysummer evening. I suppose the door blew open, though I didn't notice it: at anyrate a gust—a warm gust it was—came quite suddenly between us, took the paperand blew it straight into the fire: it was light, thin paper, and flared andwent up the chimney in a single ash. ‘Well,’ I said, ‘you can't give it backnow.' He said nothing for a minute: then rather crossly, ‘No, I can't; but whyyou should keep on saying so I don't know.' I remarked that I didn't say it morethan once. ‘Not more than four times, you mean,’ was all he said. I remember allthat very clearly, without any good reason; and now to come to the point. Idon't know if you looked at that book of Karswell's which my unfortunate brotherreviewed. It's not likely that you should: but I did, both before his death andafter it. The first time we made game of it together. It was written in no styleat all—split infinitives, and every sort of thing that makes an Oxford gorgerise. Then there was nothing that the man didn't swallow: mixing up classicalmyths, and stories out of the Golden Legend with reports of savage customs oftoday—all very proper, no doubt, if you know how to use them, but he didn't: heseemed to put the Golden Legend and the Golden Bough exactly on a par, and tobelieve both: a pitiable exhibition, in short. Well, after the misfortune, Ilooked over the book again. It was no better than before, but the impressionwhich it left this time on my mind was different. I suspected—as I told you—thatKarswell had borne ill-will to my brother, even that he was in some wayresponsible for what had happened; and now his book seemed to me to be a verysinister performance indeed. One chapter in particular struck me, in which hespoke of ‘casting the Runes’ on people, either for the purpose of gaining theiraffection or of getting them out of the way—perhaps more especially the latter:he spoke of all this in a way that really seemed to me to imply actualknowledge. I've not time to go into details, but the upshot is that I am prettysure from information received that the civil man at the concert was Karswell: Isuspect—I more than suspect—that the paper was of importance: and I do believethat if my brother had been able to give it back, he might have been alive now.Therefore, it occurs to me to ask you whether you have anything to put besidewhat I have told you.”By way of answer, Dunning had the episode in the Manuscript Room at the BritishMuseum to relate.“Then he did actually hand you some papers; have you examined them? No? becausewe must, if you'll allow it, look at them at once, and very carefully.”They went to the still empty house—empty, for the two servants were not yet ableto return to work. Dunning's portfolio of papers was gathering dust on thewriting-table. In it were the quires of small-sized scribbling paper which heused for his transcripts: and from one of these, as he took it up, there slippedand fluttered out into the room with uncanny quickness, a strip of thin lightpaper. The window was open, but Harrington slammed it to, just in time tointercept the paper, which he caught. “I thought so,” he said; “it might be theidentical thing that was given to my brother. You'll have to look out, Dunning;this may mean something quite serious for you.”A long consultation took place. The paper was narrowly examined. As Harringtonhad said, the characters on it were more like Runes than anything else, but notdecipherable by either man, and both hesitated to copy them, for fear, as theyconfessed, of perpetuating whatever evil purpose they might conceal. So it hasremained impossible (if I may anticipate a little) to ascertain what wasconveyed in this curious message or commission. Both Dunning and Harrington arefirmly convinced that it had the effect of bringing its possessors into veryundesirable company. That it must be returned to the source whence it came theywere agreed, and further, that the only safe and certain way was that ofpersonal service; and here contrivance would be necessary, for Dunning was knownby sight to Karswell. He must, for one thing, alter his appearance by shavinghis beard. But then might not the blow fall first? Harrington thought they couldtime it. He knew the date of the concert at which the “black spot” had been puton his brother: it was June 18th. The death had followed on Sept. 18th. Dunningreminded him that three months had been mentioned on the inscription on thecar-window. “Perhaps,” he added, with a cheerless laugh, “mine may be a bill atthree months too. I believe I can fix it by my diary. Yes, April 23rd was theday at the Museum; that brings us to July 23rd. Now, you know, it becomesextremely important to me to know anything you will tell me about the progressof your brother's trouble, if it is possible for you to speak of it.” “Ofcourse. Well, the sense of being watched whenever he was alone was the mostdistressing thing to him. After a time I took to sleeping in his room, and hewas the better for that: still, he talked a great deal in his sleep. What about?Is it wise to dwell on that, at least before things are straightened out? Ithink not, but I can tell you this: two things came for him by post during thoseweeks, both with a London postmark, and addressed in a commercial hand. One wasa woodcut of Bewick's, roughly torn out of the page: one which shows a moonlitroad and a man walking along it, followed by an awful demon creature. Under itwere written the lines out of the ‘Ancient Mariner’ (which I suppose the cutillustrates) about one who, having once looked round—walks on,And turns no more his head,Because he knows a frightful fiendDoth close behind him tread.The other was a calendar, such as tradesmen often send. My brother paid noattention to this, but I looked at it after his death, and found that everythingafter Sept. 18 had been torn out. You may be surprised at his having gone outalone the evening he was killed, but the fact is that during the last ten daysor so of his life he had been quite free from the sense of being followed orwatched.”The end of the consultation was this. Harrington, who knew a neighbour ofKarswell's, thought he saw a way of keeping a watch on his movements. It wouldbe Dunning's part to be in readiness to try to cross Karswell's path at anymoment, to keep the paper safe and in a place of ready access.They parted. The next weeks were no doubt a severe strain upon Dunning's nerves:the intangible barrier which had seemed to rise about him on the day when hereceived the paper, gradually developed into a brooding blackness that cut himoff from the means of escape to which one might have thought he might resort. Noone was at hand who was likely to suggest them to him, and he seemed robbed ofall initiative. He waited with inexpressible anxiety as May, June, and earlyJuly passed on, for a mandate from Harrington. But all this time Karswellremained immovable at Lufford.At last, in less than a week before the date he had come to look upon as the endof his earthly activities, came a telegram: “Leaves Victoria by boat trainThursday night. Do not miss. I come to you to-night. Harrington.”He arrived accordingly, and they concocted plans. The train left Victoria atnine and its last stop before Dover was Croydon West. Harrington would mark downKarswell at Victoria, and look out for Dunning at Croydon, calling to him ifneed were by a name agreed upon. Dunning, disguised as far as might be, was tohave no label or initials on any hand luggage, and must at all costs have thepaper with him.Dunning's suspense as he waited on the Croydon platform I need not attempt todescribe. His sense of danger during the last days had only been sharpened bythe fact that the cloud about him had perceptibly been lighter; but relief wasan ominous symptom, and, if Karswell eluded him now, hope was gone: and therewere so many chances of that. The rumour of the journey might be itself adevice. The twenty minutes in which he paced the platform and persecuted everyporter with inquiries as to the boat train were as bitter as any he had spent.Still, the train came, and Harrington was at the window. It was important, ofcourse, that there should be no recognition: so Dunning got in at the fartherend of the corridor carriage, and only gradually made his way to the compartmentwhere Harrington and Karswell were. He was pleased, on the whole, to see thatthe train was far from full.Karswell was on the alert, but gave no sign of recognition. Dunning took theseat not immediately facing him, and attempted, vainly at first, then withincreasing command of his faculties, to reckon the possibilities of making thedesired transfer. Opposite to Karswell, and next to Dunning, was a heap ofKarswell's coats on the seat. It would be of no use to slip the paper intothese—he would not be safe, or would not feel so, unless in some way it could beproffered by him and accepted by the other. There was a handbag, open, and withpapers in it. Could he manage to conceal this (so that perhaps Karswell mightleave the carriage without it), and then find and give it to him? This was theplan that suggested itself. If he could only have counselled with Harrington!but that could not be. The minutes went on. More than once Karswell rose andwent out into the corridor. The second time Dunning was on the point ofattempting to make the bag fall off the seat, but he caught Harrington's eye,and read in it a warning.Karswell, from the corridor, was watching: probably to see if the two menrecognized each other. He returned, but was evidently restless: and, when herose the third time, hope dawned, for something did slip off his seat and fallwith hardly a sound to the floor. Karswell went out once more, and passed out ofrange of the corridor window. Dunning picked up what had fallen, and saw thatthe key was in his hands in the form of one of Cook's ticket-cases, with ticketsin it. These cases have a pocket in the cover, and within very few seconds thepaper of which we have heard was in the pocket of this one. To make theoperation more secure, Harrington stood in the doorway of the compartment andfiddled with the blind. It was done, and done at the right time, for the trainwas now slowing down towards Dover.In a moment more Karswell re-entered the compartment. As he did so, Dunning,managing, he knew not how, to suppress the tremble in his voice, handed him theticket-case, saying, “May I give you this, sir? I believe it is yours.” After abrief glance at the ticket inside, Karswell uttered the hoped-for response,“Yes, it is; much obliged to you, sir,” and he placed it in his breast pocket.Even in the few moments that remained—moments of tense anxiety, for they knewnot to what a premature finding of the paper might lead—both men noticed thatthe carriage seemed to darken about them and to grow warmer; that Karswell wasfidgety and oppressed; that he drew the heap of loose coats near to him and castit back as if it repelled him; and that he then sat upright and glancedanxiously at both. They, with sickening anxiety, busied themselves in collectingtheir belongings; but they both thought that Karswell was on the point ofspeaking when the train stopped at Dover Town. It was natural that in the shortspace between town and pier they should both go into the corridor.At the pier they got out, but so empty was the train that they were forced tolinger on the platform until Karswell should have passed ahead of them with hisporter on the way to the boat, and only then was it safe for them to exchange apressure of the hand and a word of concentrated congratulation. The effect uponDunning was to make him almost faint. Harrington made him lean up against thewall, while he himself went forward a few yards within sight of the gangway tothe boat, at which Karswell had now arrived. The man at the head of it examinedhis ticket, and, laden with coats he passed down into the boat. Suddenly theofficial called after him, “You, sir, beg pardon, did the other gentleman showhis ticket?” “What the devil do you mean by the other gentleman?” Karswell'ssnarling voice called back from the deck. The man bent over and looked at him.“The devil? Well, I don't know, I'm sure,” Harrington heard him say to himself,and then aloud, “My mistake, sir; must have been your rugs! ask your pardon.”And then, to a subordinate near him, “‘Ad he got a dog with him, or what? Funnything: I could ‘a’ swore ‘e wasn't alone. Well, whatever it was, they'll ‘ave tosee to it aboard. She's off now. Another week and we shall be gettin' the‘oliday customers.” In five minutes more there was nothing but the lesseninglights of the boat, the long line of the Dover lamps, the night breeze, and themoon.Long and long the two sat in their room at the “Lord Warden.” In spite of theremoval of their greatest anxiety, they were oppressed with a doubt, not of thelightest. Had they been justified in sending a man to his death, as theybelieved they had? Ought they not to warn him, at least? “No,” said Harrington;“if he is the murderer I think him, we have done no more than is just. Still, ifyou think it better—but how and where can you warn him?” “He was booked toAbbeville only,” said Dunning. “I saw that. If I wired to the hotels there inJoanne's Guide, ‘Examine your ticket-case, Dunning,’ I should feel happier. Thisis the 21st: he will have a day. But I am afraid he has gone into the dark.” Sotelegrams were left at the hotel office.It is not clear whether these reached their destination, or whether, if theydid, they were understood. All that is known is that, on the afternoon of the23rd, an English traveller, examining the front of St Wulfram's Church atAbbeville, then under extensive repair, was struck on the head and instantlykilled by a stone falling from the scaffold erected round the north-westerntower, there being, as was clearly proved, no workman on the scaffold at thatmoment: and the traveller's papers identified him as Mr Karswell.Only one detail shall be added. At Karswell's sale a set of Bewick, sold withall faults, was acquired by Harrington. The page with the woodcut of thetraveller and the demon was, as he had expected, mutilated. Also, after ajudicious interval, Harrington repeated to Dunning something of what he hadheard his brother say in his sleep: but it was not long before Dunning stoppedhim."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] LUELLA MILLER Image [images/u4.jpg]by Mary E. Wilkins FreemanMary E. Wilkins Freeman (1852-1930) is a rare but notable example of anineteenth-century American woman who became commercially successfulwriter—fellow New Englander Louisa May Alcott being the most prominent other.Freeman's earliest works were children's stories and poems which she pennedwhile holding down the responsible position of secretary to Oliver WendellHolmes, Sr. Freeman's novels and stories were richly descriptive of New Englandlife and evocative and atmospheric. When she became interested in thesupernatural she melded horror with her talent for natural realism—a verysuccessful (and distinctly American) marriage.In 1926, just four years before her death, she became the first recipient of theWilliam Dean Howells Medal for Distinction in Fiction from the American Academyof Arts and Letters.LUELLA MILLERClose to the village street stood the one-story house in which Luella Miller,who had an evil name in the village, had dwelt. She had been dead for years, yetthere were those in the village who, in spite of the clearer light which comeson a vantage-point from a long-past danger, half believed in the tale which theyhad heard from their childhood. In their hearts, although they scarcely wouldhave owned it, was a survival of the wild horror and frenzied fear of theirancestors who had dwelt in the same age with Luella Miller. Young people evenwould stare with a shudder at the old house as they passed, and children neverplayed around it as was their wont around an untenanted building. Not a windowin the old Miller house was broken: the panes reflected the morning sunlight inpatches of emerald and blue, and the latch of the sagging front door was neverlifted, although no bolt secured it. Since Luella Miller had been carried out ofit, the house had had no tenant except one friendless old soul who had no choicebetween that and the far-off shelter of the open sky. This old woman, who hadsurvived her kindred and friends, lived in the house one week, then one morningno smoke came out of the chimney, and a body of neighbours, a score strong,entered and found her dead in her bed. There were dark whispers as to the causeof her death, and there were those who testified to an expression of fear soexalted that it showed forth the state of the departing soul upon the dead face.The old woman had been hale and hearty when she entered the house, and in sevendays she was dead; it seemed that she had fallen a victim to some uncanny power.The minister talked in the pulpit with covert severity against the sin ofsuperstition; still the belief prevailed. Not a soul in the village but wouldhave chosen the almshouse rather than that dwelling. No vagrant, if he heard thetale, would seek shelter beneath that old roof, unhallowed by nearly half acentury of superstitious fear.There was only one person in the village who had actually known Luella Miller.That person was a woman well over eighty, but a marvel of vitality and unextinctyouth. Straight as an arrow, with the spring of one recently let loose from thebow of life, she moved about the streets, and she always went to church, rain orshine. She had never married, and had lived alone for years in a house acrossthe road from Luella Miller's.This woman had none of the garrulousness of age, but never in all her life hadshe ever held her tongue for any will save her own, and she never spared thetruth when she essayed to present it. She it was who bore testimony to the life,evil, though possibly wittingly or designedly so, of Luella Miller, and to herpersonal appearance. When this old woman spoke—and she had the gift ofdescription, although her thoughts were clothed in the rude vernacular of hernative village—one could seem to see Luella Miller as she had really looked.According to this woman, Lydia Anderson by name, Luella Miller had been a beautyof a type rather unusual in New England. She had been a slight, pliant sort ofcreature, as ready with a strong yielding to fate and as unbreakable as awillow. She had glimmering lengths of straight, fair hair, which she wore softlylooped round a long, lovely face. She had blue eyes full of soft pleading,little slender, clinging hands, and a wonderful grace of motion and attitude.“Luella Miller used to sit in a way nobody else could if they sat up and studieda week of Sundays,” said Lydia Anderson, “and it was a sight to see her walk. Ifone of them willows over there on the edge of the brook could start up and getits roots free of the ground, and move off, it would go just the way LuellaMiller used to. She had a green shot silk she used to wear, too, and a hat withgreen ribbon streamers, and a lace veil blowing across her face and outsideways, and a green ribbon flyin' from her waist. That was what she came outbride in when she married Erastus Miller. Her name before she was married wasHill. There was always a sight of “l's” in her name, married or single. ErastusMiller was good lookin', too, better lookin' than Luella. Sometimes I used tothink that Luella wa'n't so handsome after all. Erastus just about worshipedher. I used to know him pretty well. He lived next door to me, and we went toschool together. Folks used to say he was waitin' on me, but he wa'n't. I neverthought he was except once or twice when he said things that some girls mighthave suspected meant somethin'. That was before Luella came here to teach thedistrict school. It was funny how she came to get it, for folks said she hadn'tany education, and that one of the big girls, Lottie Henderson, used to do allthe teachin' for her, while she sat back and did embroidery work on a cambricpocket-handkerchief. Lottie Henderson was a real smart girl, a splendid scholar,and she just set her eyes by Luella, as all the girls did. Lottie would havemade a real smart woman, but she died when Luella had been here about ayear—just faded away and died: nobody knew what ailed her. She dragged herselfto that schoolhouse and helped Luella teach till the very last minute. Thecommittee all knew how Luella didn't do much of the work herself, but theywinked at it. It wa'n't long after Lottie died that Erastus married her. Ialways thought he hurried it up because she wa'n't fit to teach. One of the bigboys used to help her after Lottie died, but he hadn't much government, and theschool didn't do very well, and Luella might have had to give it up, for thecommittee couldn't have shut their eyes to things much longer. The boy thathelped her was a real honest, innocent sort of fellow, and he was a goodscholar, too. Folks said he overstudied, and that was the reason he was tookcrazy the year after Luella married, but I don't know. And I don't know whatmade Erastus Miller go into consumption of the blood the year after he wasmarried: consumption wa'n't in his family. He just grew weaker and weaker, andwent almost bent double when he tried to wait on Luella, and he spoke feeble,like an old man. He worked terrible hard till the last trying to save up alittle to leave Luella. I've seen him out in the worst storms on a wood-sled—heused to cut and sell wood—and he was hunched up on top lookin' more dead thanalive. Once I couldn't stand it: I went over and helped him pitch some wood onthe cart—I was always strong in my arms. I wouldn't stop for all he told me to,and I guess he was glad enough for the help. That was only a week before hedied. He fell on the kitchen floor while he was gettin' breakfast. He always gotthe breakfast and let Luella lay abed. He did all the sweepin' and the washin'and the ironin' and most of the cookin'. He couldn't bear to have Luella lifther finger, and she let him do for her. She lived like a queen for all the workshe did. She didn't even do her sewin'. She said it made her shoulder ache tosew, and poor Erastus's sister Lily used to do all her sewin'. She wa'n't ableto, either; she was never strong in her back, but she did it beautifully. Shehad to, to suit Luella, she was so dreadful particular. I never saw anythin'like the fagottin' and hemstitchin' that Lily Miller did for Luella. She madeall Luella's weddin' outfit, and that green silk dress, after Maria Babbit cutit. Maria she cut it for nothin', and she did a lot more cuttin' and fittin' fornothin' for Luella, too. Lily Miller went to live with Luella after Erastusdied. She gave up her home, though she was real attached to it and wa'n't a miteafraid to stay alone. She rented it and she went to live with Luella right awayafter the funeral.”Then this old woman, Lydia Anderson, who remembered Luella Miller, would go onto relate the story of Lily Miller. It seemed that on the removal of Lily Millerto the house of her dead brother, to live with his widow, the village peoplefirst began to talk. This Lily Miller had been hardly past her first youth, anda most robust and blooming woman, rosy-cheeked, with curls of strong, black hairovershadowing round, candid temples and bright dark eyes. It was not six monthsafter she had taken up her residence with her sister-in-law that her rosy colourfaded and her pretty curves became wan hollows. White shadows began to show inthe black rings of her hair, and the light died out of her eyes, her featuressharpened, and there were pathetic lines at her mouth, which yet wore always anexpression of utter sweetness and even happiness. She was devoted to her sister;there was no doubt that she loved her with her whole heart, and was perfectlycontent in her service. It was her sole anxiety lest she should die and leaveher alone.“The way Lily Miller used to talk about Luella was enough to make you mad andenough to make you cry,” said Lydia Anderson. “I've been in there sometimestoward the last when she was too feeble to cook and carried her some blanc-mangeor custard—somethin' I thought she might relish, and she'd thank me, and when Iasked her how she was, say she felt better than she did yesterday, and asked meif I didn't think she looked better, dreadful pitiful, and say poor Luella hadan awful time takin' care of her and doin' the work—she wa'n't strong enough todo anythin'—when all the time Luella wa'n't liftin' her finger and poor Lilydidn't get any care except what the neighbours gave her, and Luella eat upeverythin' that was carried in for Lily. I had it real straight that she did.Luella used to just sit and cry and do nothin'. She did act real fond of Lily,and she pined away considerable, too. There was those that thought she'd go intoa decline herself. But after Lily died, her Aunt Abby Mixter came, and thenLuella picked up and grew as fat and rosy as ever. But poor Aunt Abby begun todroop just the way Lily had, and I guess somebody wrote to her married daughter,Mrs. Sam Abbot, who lived in Barre, for she wrote her mother that she must leaveright away and come and make her a visit, but Aunt Abby wouldn't go. I can seeher now. She was a real good-lookin' woman, tall and large, with a big, squareface and a high forehead that looked of itself kind of benevolent and good. Shejust tended out on Luella as if she had been a baby, and when her marrieddaughter sent for her she wouldn't stir one inch. She'd always thought a lot ofher daughter, too, but she said Luella needed her and her married daughterdidn't. Her daughter kept writin' and writin', but it didn't do any good.Finally she came, and when she saw how bad her mother looked, she broke down andcried and all but went on her knees to have her come away. She spoke her mindout to Luella, too. She told her that she'd killed her husband and everybodythat had anythin' to do with her, and she'd thank her to leave her mother alone.Luella went into hysterics, and Aunt Abby was so frightened that she called meafter her daughter went. Mrs. Sam Abbot she went away fairly cryin' out loud inthe buggy, the neighbours heard her, and well she might, for she never saw hermother again alive. I went in that night when Aunt Abby called for me, standin'in the door with her little green-checked shawl over her head. I can see hernow. ‘Do come over here, Miss Anderson,’ she sung out, kind of gasping forbreath. I didn't stop for anythin'. I put over as fast as I could, and when Igot there, there was Luella laughin' and cryin' all together, and Aunt Abbytrying to hush her, and all the time she herself was white as a sheet andshakin' so she could hardly stand. ‘For the land sakes, Mrs. Mixter,’ says I,‘you look worse than she does. You ain't fit to be up out of your bed.’“‘Oh, there ain't anythin' the matter with me,’ says she. Then she went ontalkin' to Luella. ‘There, there, don't, don't, poor little lamb,’ says she.‘Aunt Abby is here. She ain't goin' away and leave you. Don't, poor littlelamb.’“‘Do leave her with me, Mrs. Mixter, and you get back to bed,’ says I, for AuntAbby had been layin' down considerable lately, though somehow she contrived todo the work.“‘I'm well enough,’ says she. ‘Don't you think she had better have the doctor,Miss Anderson?’“‘The doctor,’ says I, ‘I think YOU had better have the doctor. I think you needhim much worse than some folks I could mention.’ And I looked right straight atLuella Miller laughin' and cryin' and goin' on as if she was the centre of allcreation. All the time she was actin' so—seemed as if she was too sick to senseanythin'—she was keepin' a sharp lookout as to how we took it out of the cornerof one eye. I see her. You could never cheat me about Luella Miller. Finally Igot real mad and I run home and I got a bottle of valerian I had, and I pouredsome boilin' hot water on a handful of catnip, and I mixed up that catnip teawith most half a wineglass of valerian, and I went with it over to Luella's. Imarched right up to Luella, a-holdin' out of that cup, all smokin'. ‘Now,’ saysI, ‘Luella Miller, ‘YOU SWALLER THIS!’“‘What is—what is it, oh, what is it?’ she sort of screeches out. Then she goesoff a-laughin' enough to kill.“‘Poor lamb, poor little lamb,’ says Aunt Abby, standin' over her, all kind oftottery, and tryin' to bathe her head with camphor.“‘YOU SWALLER THIS RIGHT DOWN,’ says I. And I didn't waste any ceremony. I justtook hold of Luella Miller's chin and I tipped her head back, and I caught hermouth open with laughin', and I clapped that cup to her lips, and I fairlyhollered at her: ‘Swaller, swaller, swaller!’ and she gulped it right down. Shehad to, and I guess it did her good. Anyhow, she stopped cryin' and laughin' andlet me put her to bed, and she went to sleep like a baby inside of half an hour.That was more than poor Aunt Abby did. She lay awake all that night and I stayedwith her, though she tried not to have me; said she wa'n't sick enough forwatchers. But I stayed, and I made some good cornmeal gruel and I fed her ateaspoon every little while all night long. It seemed to me as if she was jestdyin' from bein' all wore out. In the mornin' as soon as it was light I run overto the Bisbees and sent Johnny Bisbee for the doctor. I told him to tell thedoctor to hurry, and he come pretty quick. Poor Aunt Abby didn't seem to knowmuch of anythin' when he got there. You couldn't hardly tell she breathed, shewas so used up. When the doctor had gone, Luella came into the room lookin' likea baby in her ruffled nightgown. I can see her now. Her eyes were as blue andher face all pink and white like a blossom, and she looked at Aunt Abby in thebed sort of innocent and surprised. ‘Why,’ says she, ‘Aunt Abby ain't got upyet?’“‘No, she ain't,’ says I, pretty short.“‘I thought I didn't smell the coffee,’ says Luella.“‘Coffee,’ says I. ‘I guess if you have coffee this mornin’ you'll make ityourself.’“‘I never made the coffee in all my life,’ says she, dreadful astonished.‘Erastus always made the coffee as long as he lived, and then Lily she made it,and then Aunt Abby made it. I don't believe I CAN make the coffee, MissAnderson.’“‘You can make it or go without, jest as you please,’ says I.“‘Ain't Aunt Abby goin' to get up?’ says she.“‘I guess she won't get up,’ says I, ‘sick as she is.’ I was gettin' madder andmadder. There was somethin' about that little pink-and-white thing standin'there and talkin' about coffee, when she had killed so many better folks thanshe was, and hadjest killed another, that made me feel ‘most as if I wishedsomebody would up and kill her before she had a chance to do any more harm.“‘Is Aunt Abby sick?’ says Luella, as if she was sort of aggrieved and injured.“‘Yes,’ says I, ‘she's sick, and she's goin' to die, and then you'll be leftalone, and you'll have to do for yourself and wait on yourself, or do withoutthings.’ I don't know but I was sort of hard, but it was the truth, and if I wasany harder than Luella Miller had been I'll give up. I ain't never been sorrythat I said it. Well, Luella, she up and had hysterics again at that, and I jestlet her have ‘em. All I did was to bundle her into the room on the other side ofthe entry where Aunt Abby couldn't hear her, if she wa'n't past it—I don't knowbut she was—and set her down hard in a chair and told her not to come back intothe other room, and she minded. She had her hysterics in there till she gottired. When she found out that nobody was comin' to coddle her and do for hershe stopped. At least I suppose she did. I had all I could do with poor AuntAbby tryin' to keep the breath of life in her. The doctor had told me that shewas dreadful low, and give me some very strong medicine to give to her in dropsreal often, and told me real particular about the nourishment. Well, I did as hetold me real faithful till she wa'n't able to swaller any longer. Then I had herdaughter sent for. I had begun to realize that she wouldn't last any time atall. I hadn't realized it before, though I spoke to Luella the way I did. Thedoctor he came, and Mrs. Sam Abbot, but when she got there it was too late; hermother was dead. Aunt Abby's daughter just give one look at her mother layin'there, then she turned sort of sharp and sudden and looked at me.“‘Where is she?’ says she, and I knew she meant Luella.“‘She's out in the kitchen,’ says I. ‘She's too nervous to see folks die. She'safraid it will make her sick.’“The Doctor he speaks up then. He was a young man. Old Doctor Park had died theyear before, and this was a young fellow just out of college. ‘Mrs. Miller isnot strong,’ says he, kind of severe, ‘and she is quite right in not agitatingherself.’“‘You are another, young man; she's got her pretty claw on you,’ thinks I, but Ididn't say anythin' to him. I just said over to Mrs. Sam Abbot that Luella wasin the kitchen, and Mrs. Sam Abbot she went out there, and I went, too, and Inever heard anythin' like the way she talked to Luella Miller. I felt prettyhard to Luella myself, but this was more than I ever would have dared to say.Luella she was too scared to go into hysterics. She jest flopped. She seemed tojest shrink away to nothin' in that kitchen chair, with Mrs. Sam Abbot standin'over her and talkin' and tellin' her the truth. I guess the truth was most toomuch for her and no mistake, because Luella presently actually did faint away,and there wa'n't any sham about it, the way I always suspected there was aboutthem hysterics. She fainted dead away and we had to lay her flat on the floor,and the Doctor he came runnin' out and he said somethin' about a weak heartdreadful fierce to Mrs. Sam Abbot, but she wa'n't a mite scared. She faced himjest as white as even Luella was layin' there lookin' like death and the Doctorfeelin' of her pulse.“‘Weak heart,’ says she, ‘weak heart; weak fiddlesticks! There ain't nothin'weak about that woman. She's got strength enough to hang onto other folks tillshe kills ‘em. Weak? It was my poor mother that was weak: this woman killed heras sure as if she had taken a knife to her.’“But the Doctor he didn't pay much attention. He was bendin' over Luella layin'there with her yellow hair all streamin' and her pretty pink-and-white face allpale, and her blue eyes like stars gone out, and he was holdin' onto her handand smoothin' her forehead, and tellin' me to get the brandy in Aunt Abby'sroom, and I was sure as I wanted to be that Luella had got somebody else to hangonto, now Aunt Abby was gone, and I thought of poor Erastus Miller, and I sortof pitied the poor young Doctor, led away by a pretty face, and I made up mymind I'd see what I could do.“I waited till Aunt Abby had been dead and buried about a month, and the Doctorwas goin' to see Luella steady and folks were beginnin' to talk; then oneevenin', when I knew the Doctor had been called out of town and wouldn't beround, I went over to Luella's. I found her all dressed up in a blue muslin withwhite polka dots on it, and her hair curled jest as pretty, and there wa'n't ayoung girl in the place could compare with her. There was somethin' about LuellaMiller seemed to draw the heart right out of you, but she didn't draw it out ofME. She was settin' rocking in the chair by her sittin'-room window, and MariaBrown had gone home. Maria Brown had been in to help her, or rather to do thework, for Luella wa'n't helped when she didn't do anythin'. Maria Brown was realcapable and she didn't have any ties; she wa'n't married, and lived alone, soshe'd offered. I couldn't see why she should do the work any more than Luella;she wa'n't any too strong; but she seemed to think she could and Luella seemedto think so, too, so she went over and did all the work—washed, and ironed, andbaked, while Luella sat and rocked. Maria didn't live long afterward. She beganto fade away just the same fashion the others had. Well, she was warned, but sheacted real mad when folks said anythin': said Luella was a poor, abused woman,too delicate to help herself, and they'd ought to be ashamed, and if she diedhelpin' them that couldn't help themselves she would—and she did.“‘I s'pose Maria has gone home,’ says I to Luella, when I had gone in and satdown opposite her.“‘Yes, Maria went half an hour ago, after she had got supper and washed thedishes,’ says Luella, in her pretty way.“‘I suppose she has got a lot of work to do in her own house to-night,’ says I,kind of bitter, but that was all thrown away on Luella Miller. It seemed to herright that other folks that wa'n't any better able than she was herself shouldwait on her, and she couldn't get it through her head that anybody should thinkit WA'N'T right.“‘Yes,’ says Luella, real sweet and pretty, ‘yes, she said she had to do herwashin’ to-night. She has let it go for a fortnight along of comin' over here.’“‘Why don't she stay home and do her washin' instead of comin' over here anddoin' YOUR work, when you are just as well able, and enough sight more so, thanshe is to do it?’ says I.“Then Luella she looked at me like a baby who has a rattle shook at it. She sortof laughed as innocent as you please. ‘Oh, I can't do the work myself, MissAnderson,’ says she. ‘I never did. Maria HAS to do it.’“Then I spoke out: ‘Has to do it I’ says I. ‘Has to do it!’ She don't have to doit, either. Maria Brown has her own home and enough to live on. She ain'tbeholden to you to come over here and slave for you and kill herself.’“Luella she jest set and stared at me for all the world like a doll-baby thatwas so abused that it was comin' to life.“‘Yes,’ says I, ‘she's killin' herself. She's goin' to die just the way Erastusdid, and Lily, and your Aunt Abby. You're killin' her jest as you did them. Idon't know what there is about you, but you seem to bring a curse,’ says I. ‘Youkill everybody that is fool enough to care anythin' about you and do for you.’“She stared at me and she was pretty pale.“‘And Maria ain't the only one you're goin' to kill,’ says I. ‘You're goin' tokill Doctor Malcom before you're done with him.’“Then a red colour came flamin' all over her face. ‘I ain't goin' to kill him,either,’ says she, and she begun to cry.“‘Yes, you BE!’ says I. Then I spoke as I had never spoke before. You see, Ifelt it on account of Erastus. I told her that she hadn't any business to thinkof another man after she'd been married to one that had died for her: that shewas a dreadful woman; and she was, that's true enough, but sometimes I havewondered lately if she knew it—if she wa'n't like a baby with scissors in itshand cuttin' everybody without knowin' what it was doin’.“Luella she kept gettin' paler and paler, and she never to ok her eyes off myface. There was somethin' awful about the way she looked at me and never spokeone word. After awhile I quit talkin' and I went home. I watched that night, buther lamp went out before nine o'clock, and when Doctor Malcom came drivin' pastand sort of slowed up he see there wa'n't any light and he drove along. I sawher sort of shy out of meetin' the next Sunday, too, so he shouldn't go homewith her, and I begun to think mebbe she did have some conscience after all. Itwas only a week after that that Maria Brown died—sort of sudden at the last,though everybody had seen it was comin'. Well, then there was a good deal offeelin' and pretty dark whispers. Folks said the days of witchcraft had comeagain, and they were pretty shy of Luella. She acted sort of offish to theDoctor and he didn't go there, and there wa'n't anybody to do anythin' for her.I don't know how she DID get along. I wouldn't go in there and offer to helpher—not because I was afraid of dyin' like the rest, but I thought she was justas well able to do her own work as I was to do it for her, and I thought it wasabout time that she did it and stopped killin' other folks. But it wa'n't verylong before folks began to say that Luella herself was goin' into a decline jestthe way her husband, and Lily, and Aunt Abby and the others had, and I sawmyself that she looked pretty bad. I used to see her goin' past from the storewith a bundle as if she could hardly crawl, but I remembered how Erastus used towait and ‘tend when he couldn't hardly put one foot before the other, and Ididn't go out to help her.“But at last one afternoon I saw the Doctor come drivin' up like mad with hismedicine chest, and Mrs. Babbit came in after supper and said that Luella wasreal sick.“‘I'd offer to go in and nurse her,’ says she, ‘but I've got my children toconsider, and mebbe it ain't true what they say, but it's queer how many folksthat have done for her have died.’“I didn't say anythin', but I considered how she had been Erastus's wife and howhe had set his eyes by her, and I made up my mind to go in the next mornin',unless she was better, and see what I could do; but the next mornin' I see herat the window, and pretty soon she came steppin' out as spry as you please, anda little while afterward Mrs. Babbit came in and told me that the Doctor had gota girl from out of town, a Sarah Jones, to come there, and she said she waspretty sure that the Doctor was goin' to marry Luella.“I saw him kiss her in the door that night myself, and I knew it was true. Thewoman came that afternoon, and the way she flew around was a caution. I don'tbelieve Luella had swept since Maria died. She swept and dusted, and washed andironed; wet clothes and dusters and carpets were flyin' over there all day, andevery time Luella set her foot out when the Doctor wa'n't there there was thatSarah Jones helpin' of her up and down the steps, as if she hadn't learned towalk.“Well, everybody knew that Luella and the Doctor were goin' to be married, butit wa'n't long before they began to talk about his lookin' so poorly, jest asthey had about the others; and they talked about Sarah Jones, too.“Well, the Doctor did die, and he wanted to be married first, so as to leavewhat little he had to Luella, but he died before the minister could get there,and Sarah Jones died a week afterward.“Well, that wound up everything for Luella Miller. Not another soul in the wholetown would lift a finger for her. There got to be a sort of panic. Then shebegan to droop in good earnest. She used to have to go to the store herself, forMrs. Babbit was afraid to let Tommy go for her, and I've seen her goin' past andstoppin' every two or three steps to rest. Well, I stood it as long as I could,but one day I see her comin' with her arms full and stoppin' to lean against theBabbit fence, and I run out and took her bundles and carried them to her house.Then I went home and never spoke one word to her though she called after medreadful kind of pitiful. Well, that night I was taken sick with a chill, and Iwas sick as I wanted to be for two weeks. Mrs. Babbit had seen me run out tohelp Luella and she came in and told me I was goin' to die on account of it. Ididn't know whether I was or not, but I considered I had done right by Erastus'swife.“That last two weeks Luella she had a dreadful hard time, I guess. She waspretty sick, and as near as I could make out nobody dared go near her. I don'tknow as she was really needin' anythin' very much, for there was enough to eatin her house and it was warm weather, and she made out to cook a little flourgruel every day, I know, but I guess she had a hard time, she that had been sopetted and done for all her life.“When I got so I could go out, I went over there one morning. Mrs. Babbit hadjust come in to say she hadn't seen any smoke and she didn't know but it wassomebody's duty to go in, but she couldn't help thinkin' of her children, and Igot right up, though I hadn't been out of the house for two weeks, and I went inthere, and Luella she was layin' on the bed, and she was dyin'.“She lasted all that day and into the night. But I sat there after the newdoctor had gone away. Nobody else dared to go there. It was about midnight thatI left her for a minute to run home and get some medicine I had been takin', forI begun to feel rather bad.“It was a full moon that night, and just as I started out of my door to crossthe street back to Luella's, I stopped short, for I saw something.”Lydia Anderson at this juncture always said with a certain defiance that she didnot expect to be believed, and then proceeded in a hushed voice:“I saw what I saw, and I know I saw it, and I will swear on my death bed that Isaw it. I saw Luella Miller and Erastus Miller, and Lily, and Aunt Abby, andMaria, and the Doctor, and Sarah, all goin' out of her door, and all but Luellashone white in the moonlight, and they were all helpin' her along till sheseemed to fairly fly in the midst of them. Then it all disappeared. I stood aminute with my heart poundin', then I went over there. I thought of goin' forMrs. Babbit, but I thought she'd be afraid. So I went alone, though I knew whathad happened. Luella was layin' real peaceful, dead on her bed.”This was the story that the old woman, Lydia Anderson, told, but the sequel wastold by the people who survived her, and this is the tale which has becomefolklore in the village.Lydia Anderson died when she was eighty-seven. She had continued wonderfullyhale and hearty for one of her years until about two weeks before her death.One bright moonlight evening she was sitting beside a window in her parlour whenshe made a sudden exclamation, and was out of the house and across the streetbefore the neighbour who was taking care of her could stop her. She followed asfast as possible and found Lydia Anderson stretched on the ground before thedoor of Luella Miller's deserted house, and she was quite dead.The next night there was a red gleam of fire athwart the moonlight and the oldhouse of Luella Miller was burned to the ground. Nothing is now left of itexcept a few old cellar stones and a lilac bush, and in summer a helpless trailof morning glories among the weeds, which might be considered emblematic ofLuella herself."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] AN INHABITANT OF CARCOSA Image [images/u4.jpg]by Ambrose BierceCHRISTIAN, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspiredhook admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One who followsthe teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life ofsin.AMBROSE BIERCE, The Devil's DictionaryAmbrose Gwinnet Bierce (1842-1913? 1914? or ?) was a brilliant journalist andwriter of short stories, fables, and satire. The reason we don't have definitivedate for the death of Ambrose Gwinnet Bierce is because quite frankly nobodyknows when or how he died. He left his comfortable (and now historic) home inWashington, D.C. in October of 1913 (he was seventy-one years old at the time)and by December had crossed into Mexico and joined Pancho Villa's army to get agood look at the Mexican Revolution. That's the last we hear of him.The works of Ambrose Bierce are not usually associated with the horror genre.However, because he is such a singularly unique fixture in nineteenth-centuryAmerican literature (not to mention his breathtaking penchant for beingshockingly frank, even macabre) he offers us no better category in which toplace him. It is almost certain that his fictional alternate realities andspeculations on future events were enjoyed by the founding fathers of horror,especially Robert W. Chambers, whose terrible mythological King in Yellowkingdom of Carcosa—its landmarks and characters—are lifted directly fromBierce's story, “The Inhabitant of Carcosa.” I encourage the reader who is notfamiliar with Bierce to do a little homework. I will go so far as to promisethat if you enjoy Mark Twain, you will love Ambrose Bierce. His life story is anadventure no novelist could invent.AN INHABITANT OF CARCOSAFor there be divers sorts of death—some wherein the body remaineth; and in someit vanisheth quite away with the spirit. This commonly occurreth only insolitude (such is God's will) and, none seeing the end, we say the man is lost,or gone on a long journey—which indeed he hath; but sometimes it hath happenedin sight of many, as abundant testimony showeth. In one kind of death the spiritalso dieth, and this it hath been known to do while yet the body was in vigorfor many years. Sometimes, as is veritably attested, it dieth with the body, butafter a season is raised up again in that place where the body did decay.Pondering these words of Hali (whom God rest) and questioning their fullmeaning, as one who, having an intimation, yet doubts if there be not somethingbehind, other than that which he has discerned, I noted not whither I hadstrayed until a sudden chill wind striking my face revived in me a sense of mysurroundings. I observed with astonishment that everything seemed unfamiliar. Onevery side of me stretched a bleak and desolate expanse of plain, covered with atall overgrowth of sere grass, which rustled and whistled in the autumn windwith heaven knows what mysterious and disquieting suggestion. Protruded at longintervals above it, stood strangely shaped and somber-colored rocks, whichseemed to have an understanding with one another and to exchange looks ofuncomfortable significance, as if they had reared their heads to watch the issueof some foreseen event. A few blasted trees here and there appeared as leadersin this malevolent conspiracy of silent expectation.The day, I thought, must be far advanced, though the sun was invisible; andalthough sensible that the air was raw and chill my consciousness of that factwas rather mental than physical—I had no feeling of discomfort. Over all thedismal landscape a canopy of low, lead-colored clouds hung like a visible curse.In all this there were a menace and a portent—a hint of evil, an intimation ofdoom. Bird, beast, or insect there was none. The wind sighed in the barebranches of the dead trees and the gray grass bent to whisper its dread secretto the earth; but no other sound nor motion broke the awful repose of thatdismal place.I observed in the herbage a number of weather-worn stones, evidently shaped withtools. They were broken, covered with moss and half sunken in the earth. Somelay prostrate, some leaned at various angles, none was vertical. They wereobviously headstones of graves, though the graves themselves no longer existedas either mounds or depressions; the years had leveled all. Scattered here andthere, more massive blocks showed where some pompous tomb or ambitious monumenthad once flung its feeble defiance at oblivion. So old seemed these relics,these vestiges of vanity and memorials of affection and piety, so battered andworn and stained—so neglected, deserted, forgotten the place, that I could nothelp thinking myself the discoverer of the burial-ground of a prehistoric raceof men whose very name was long extinct.Filled with these reflections, I was for some time heedless of the sequence ofmy own experiences, but soon I thought, “How came I hither?” A moment'sreflection seemed to make this all clear and explain at the same time, though ina disquieting way, the singular character with which my fancy had invested allthat I saw or heard. I was ill. I remembered now that I had been prostrated by asudden fever, and that my family had told me that in my periods of delirium Ihad constantly cried out for liberty and air, and had been held in bed toprevent my escape out-of-doors. Now I had eluded the vigilance of my attendantsand had wandered hither to—to where? I could not conjecture. Clearly I was at aconsiderable distance from the city where I dwelt—the ancient and famous city ofCarcosa.No signs of human life were anywhere visible nor audible; no rising smoke, nowatch-dog's bark, no lowing of cattle, no shouts of children at play—nothing butthat dismal burial-place, with its air of mystery and dread, due to my owndisordered brain. Was I not becoming again delirious, there beyond human aid?Was it not indeed all an illusion of my madness? I called aloud the names of mywives and sons, reached out my hands in search of theirs, even as I walked amongthe crumbling stones and in the withered grass.A noise behind me caused me to turn about. A wild animal—a lynx—was approaching.The thought came to me: If I break down here in the desert—if the fever returnand I fail, this beast will be at my throat. I sprang toward it, shouting. Ittrotted tranquilly by within a hand's breadth of me and disappeared behind arock.A moment later a man's head appeared to rise out of the ground a short distanceaway. He was ascending the farther slope of a low hill whose crest was hardly tobe distinguished from the general level. His whole figure soon came into viewagainst the background of gray cloud. He was half naked, half clad in skins. Hishair was unkempt, his beard long and ragged. In one hand he carried a bow andarrow; the other held a blazing torch with a long trail of black smoke. Hewalked slowly and with caution, as if he feared falling into some open graveconcealed by the tall grass. This strange apparition surprised but did notalarm, and taking such a course as to intercept him I met him almost face toface, accosting him with the familiar salutation, “God keep you.”He gave no heed, nor did he arrest his pace.“Good stranger,” I continued, “I am ill and lost. Direct me, I beseech you, toCarcosa.”The man broke into a barbarous chant in an unknown tongue, passing on and away.An owl on the branch of a decayed tree hooted dismally and was answered byanother in the distance. Looking upward, I saw through a sudden rift in theclouds Aldebaran and the Hyades! In all this there was a hint of night—the lynx,the man with the torch, the owl. Yet I saw—I saw even the stars in absence ofthe darkness. I saw, but was apparently not seen nor heard. Under what awfulspell did I exist?I seated myself at the root of a great tree, seriously to consider what it werebest to do. That I was mad I could no longer doubt, yet recognized a ground ofdoubt in the conviction. Of fever I had no trace. I had, withal, a sense ofexhilaration and vigor altogether unknown to me—a feeling of mental and physicalexaltation. My senses seemed all alert; I could feel the air as a ponderoussubstance; I could hear the silence.A great root of the giant tree against whose trunk I leaned as I sat heldenclosed in its grasp a slab of stone, a part of which protruded into a recessformed by another root. The stone was thus partly protected from the weather,though greatly decomposed. Its edges were worn round, its corners eaten away,its surface deeply furrowed and scaled. Glittering particles of mica werevisible in the earth about it—vestiges of its decomposition. This stone hadapparently marked the grave out of which the tree had sprung ages ago. Thetree's exacting roots had robbed the grave and made the stone a prisoner.A sudden wind pushed some dry leaves and twigs from the upper-most face of thestone; I saw the low-relief letters of an inscription and bent to read it. Godin Heaven! my name in full!—the date of my birth!—the date of my death!A level shaft of light illuminated the whole side of the tree as I sprang to myfeet in terror. The sun was rising in the rosy east. I stood between the treeand his broad red disk—no shadow darkened the trunk!A chorus of howling wolves saluted the dawn. I saw them sitting on theirhaunches, singly and in groups, on the summits of irregular mounds and tumulifilling a half of my desert prospect and extending to the horizon. And then Iknew that these were ruins of the ancient and famous city of Carcosa.Such are the facts imparted to the medium Bayrolles by the spirit Hoseib AlarRobardin."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] NO. 252 RUE M. LE PRINCE Image [images/u4.jpg]by Ralph Adams Cram... the eminent architect and medievalist Ralph Adams Cram achieves a memorablypotent degree of vague regional horror through subtleties of atmosphere anddescription.H.P. LOVECRAFTRalph Adams Cram was an architectural genius of near divine stature. His passionand specialty was Gothic revival churches, cathedrals, monasteries, chapels,courthouses, government buildings, and college and university edifices; but hewas equally the pioneering master of the Art Deco style that dominated thelatter half of his life.In 1887, while studying architecture in Rome, he experienced dramatic spiritualepiphany while attending a Christmas Eve Mass. He became a zealous convert tothe Anglo-Catholicism and for the rest of his life identified himself as a “HighChurch Anglican.” His passion for the faith coupled with his almost superhumanoutput of churches earned him his own liturgical Feast Day (December 16th) inthe Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church in America.Despite his patently orthodox credentials and leanings, he secretly harbored alove and fascination for the magical arts, and quietly wrote some of the finestoccult fiction ever penned. “No. 252 Rue M. le Prince” was the first story inhis classic 1895 collection of short stories Black Spirits and White—a Book ofGhost Stories.Black spirits and white, red spirits and gray, mingle, mingle, mingle, ye thatmingle may.NO. 252 RUE M. LE PRINCEWhen in May, 1886, I found myself at last in Paris, I naturally determined tothrow myself on the charity of an old chum of mine, Eugene Marie d'Ardeche, whohad forsaken Boston a year or more ago on receiving word of the death of an auntwho had left him such property as she possessed. I fancy this windfall surprisedhim not a little, for the relations between the aunt and nephew had never beencordial, judging from Eugene's remarks touching the lady, who was, it seems, amore or less wicked and witch-like old person, with a penchant for black magic,at least such was the common report.Why she should leave all her property to d'Ardeche, no one could tell, unless itwas that she felt his rather hobbledehoy tendencies towards Buddhism andoccultism might some day lead him to her own unhallowed height of questionableillumination. To be sure d'Ardeche reviled her as a bad old woman, being himselfin that state of enthusiastic exaltation which sometimes accompanies a boyishfancy for occultism; but in spite of his distant and repellent attitude, Mlle.Blaye de Tartas made him her sole heir, to the violent wrath of a questionableold party known to infamy as the Sar Torrevieja, the “King of the Sorcerers.”This malevolent old portent, whose gray and crafty face was often seen in theRue M. le Prince during the life of Mlle. de Tartas had, it seems, fullyexpected to enjoy her small wealth after her death; and when it appeared thatshe had left him only the contents of the gloomy old house in the QuartierLatin, giving the house itself and all else of which she died possessed to hernephew in America, the Sar proceeded to remove everything from the place, andthen to curse it elaborately and comprehensively, together with all those whoshould ever dwell therein.Whereupon he disappeared.This final episode was the last word I received from Eugene, but I knew thenumber of the house, 252 Rue M. le Prince. So, after a day or two given to afirst cursory survey of Paris, I started across the Seine to find Eugene andcompel him to do the honors of the city.Every one who knows the Latin Quarter knows the Rue M. le Prince, running up thehill towards the Garden of the Luxembourg. It is full of queer houses and oddcorners,—or was in ‘86,—and certainly No. 252 was, when I found it, quite asqueer as any. It was nothing but a doorway, a black arch of old stone betweenand under two new houses painted yellow. The effect of this bit ofseventeenth-century masonry, with its dirty old doors, and rusty broken lanternsticking gaunt and grim out over the narrow sidewalk, was, in its frame of freshplaster, sinister in the extreme.I wondered if I had made a mistake in the number; it was quite evident that noone lived behind those cobwebs. I went into the doorway of one of the new hotelsand interviewed the concierge.No, M. d'Ardeche did not live there, though to be sure he owned the mansion; hehimself resided in Meudon, in the country house of the late Mlle. de Tartas.Would Monsieur like the number and the street?Monsieur would like them extremely, so I took the card that the concierge wrotefor me, and forthwith started for the river, in order that I might take asteamboat for Meudon. By one of those coincidences which happen so often, beingquite inexplicable, I had not gone twenty paces down the street before I randirectly into the arms of Eugene d'Ardeche. In three minutes we were sitting inthe queer little garden of the Chien Bleu, drinking vermouth and absinthe, andtalking it all over.“You do not live in your aunt's house?” I said at last, interrogatively.“No, but if this sort of thing keeps on I shall have to. I like Meudon muchbetter, and the house is perfect, all furnished, and nothing in it newer thanthe last century. You must come out with me to-night and see it. I have got ajolly room fixed up for my Buddha. But there is something wrong with this houseopposite. I can't keep a tenant in it,—not four days. I have had three, allwithin six months, but the stories have gone around and a man would as soonthink of hiring the Cour des Comptes to live in as No. 252. It is notorious. Thefact is, it is haunted the worst way.”I laughed and ordered more vermouth.“That is all right. It is haunted all the same, or enough to keep it empty, andthe funny part is that no one knows how it is haunted. Nothing is ever seen,nothing heard. As far as I can find out, people just have the horrors there, andhave them so bad they have to go to the hospital afterwards. I have oneex-tenant in the Bicêtre now. So the house stands empty, and as it coversconsiderable ground and is taxed for a lot, I don't know what to do about it. Ithink I'll either give it to that child of sin, Torrevieja, or else go and livein it myself. I shouldn't mind the ghosts, I am sure.”“Did you ever stay there?”“No, but I have always intended to, and in fact I came up here to-day to see acouple of rake-hell fellows I know, Fargeau and Duchesne, doctors in theClinical Hospital beyond here, up by the Parc Mont Souris. They promised thatthey would spend the night with me some time in my aunt's house,—which is calledaround here, you must know, ‘la Bouche d'Enfer,’—and I thought perhaps theywould make it this week, if they can get off duty. Come up with me while I seethem, and then we can go across the river to Véfour's and have some luncheon,you can get your things at the Chatham, and we will go out to Meudon, where ofcourse you will spend the night with me.”The plan suited me perfectly, so we went up to the hospital, found Fargeau, whodeclared that he and Duchesne were ready for anything, the nearer the real“bouche d'enfer” the better; that the following Thursday they would both be offduty for the night, and that on that day they would join in an attempt to outwitthe devil and clear up the mystery of No. 252.“Does M. l'Américain go with us?” asked Fargeau.“Why of course,” I replied, “I intend to go, and you must not refuse me,d'Ardeche; I decline to be put off. Here is a chance for you to do the honors ofyour city in a manner which is faultless. Show me a real live ghost, and I willforgive Paris for having lost the Jardin Mabille.”So it was settled.Later we went down to Meudon and ate dinner in the terrace room of the villa,which was all that d'Ardeche had said, and more, so utterly was its atmospherethat of the seventeenth century. At dinner Eugene told me more about his lateaunt, and the queer goings on in the old house.Mlle. Blaye lived, it seems, all alone, except for one female servant of her ownage; a severe, taciturn creature, with massive Breton features and a Bretontongue, whenever she vouchsafed to use it. No one ever was seen to enter thedoor of No. 252 except Jeanne the servant and the Sar Torrevieja, the lattercoming constantly from none knew whither, and always entering, never leaving.Indeed, the neighbors, who for eleven years had watched the old sorcerer sidlecrab-wise up to the bell almost every day, declared vociferously that never hadhe been seen to leave the house. Once, when they decided to keep absolute guard,the watcher, none other than Maître Garceau of the Chien Bleu, after keeping hiseyes fixed on the door from ten o'clock one morning when the Sar arrived untilfour in the afternoon, during which time the door was unopened (he knew this,for had he not gummed a ten-centime stamp over the joint and was not the stampunbroken) nearly fell down when the sinister figure of Torrevieja slid wickedlyby him with a dry “Pardon, Monsieur!” and disappeared again through the blackdoorway.This was curious, for No. 252 was entirely surrounded by houses, its onlywindows opening on a courtyard into which no eye could look from the hôtels ofthe Rue M. le Prince and the Rue de l'Ecole, and the mystery was one of thechoice possessions of the Latin Quarter.Once a year the austerity of the place was broken, and the denizens of the wholequarter stood open-mouthed watching many carriages drive up to No. 252, many ofthem private, not a few with crests on the door panels, from all of themdescending veiled female figures and men with coat collars turned up. Thenfollowed curious sounds of music from within, and those whose houses joined theblank walls of No. 252 became for the moment popular, for by placing the earagainst the wall strange music could distinctly be heard, and the sound ofmonotonous chanting voices now and then. By dawn the last guest would havedeparted, and for another year the hotel of Mlle. de Tartas was ominouslysilent.Eugene declared that he believed it was a celebration of “Walpurgisnacht,” andcertainly appearances favored such a fancy.“A queer thing about the whole affair is,” he said, “the fact that every one inthe street swears that about a month ago, while I was out in Concarneau for avisit, the music and voices were heard again, just as when my revered aunt wasin the flesh. The house was perfectly empty, as I tell you, so it is quitepossible that the good people were enjoying an hallucination.”I must acknowledge that these stories did not reassure me; in fact, as Thursdaycame near, I began to regret a little my determination to spend the night in thehouse. I was too vain to back down, however, and the perfect coolness of the twodoctors, who ran down Tuesday to Meudon to make a few arrangements, caused me toswear that I would die of fright before I would flinch. I suppose I believedmore or less in ghosts, I am sure now that I am older I believe in them, thereare in fact few things I can not believe. Two or three inexplicable things hadhappened to me, and, although this was before my adventure with Rendel inPastum, I had a strong predisposition to believe some things that I could notexplain, wherein I was out of sympathy with the age.Well, to come to the memorable night of the twelfth of June, we had made ourpreparations, and after depositing a big bag inside the doors of No. 252, wentacross to the Chien Bleu, where Fargeau and Duchesne turned up promptly, and wesat down to the best dinner Pere Garceau could create.I remember I hardly felt that the conversation was in good taste. It began withvarious stories of Indian fakirs and Oriental jugglery, matters in which Eugenewas curiously well read, swerved to the horrors of the great Sepoy mutiny, andthus to reminiscences of the dissecting-room. By this time we had drunk more orless, and Duchesne launched into a photographic and Zolaesque account of theonly time (as he said) when he was possessed of the panic of fear; namely, onenight many years ago, when he was locked by accident into the dissecting-room ofthe Loucine, together with several cadavers of a rather unpleasant nature. Iventured to protest mildly against the choice of subjects, the result being aperfect carnival of horrors, so that when we finally drank our last créme decacao and started for “la Bouche d'Enfer,” my nerves were in a somewhat rockycondition.It was just ten o'clock when we came into the street. A hot dead wind drifted ingreat puffs through the city, and ragged masses of vapor swept the purple sky;an unsavory night altogether, one of those nights of hopeless lassitude when onefeels, if one is at home, like doing nothing but drink mint juleps and smokecigarettes.Eugene opened the creaking door, and tried to light one of the lanterns; but thegusty wind blew out every match, and we finally had to close the outer doorsbefore we could get a light. At last we had all the lanterns going, and I beganto look around curiously. We were in a long, vaulted passage, partlycarriageway, partly footpath, perfectly bare but for the street refuse which haddrifted in with eddying winds. Beyond lay the courtyard, a curious placerendered more curious still by the fitful moonlight and the flashing of fourdark lanterns. The place had evidently been once a most noble palace. Oppositerose the oldest portion, a three-story wall of the time of Francis I., with agreat wisteria vine covering half. The wings on either side were more modern,seventeenth century, and ugly, while towards the street was nothing but a flatunbroken wall.The great bare court, littered with bits of paper blown in by the wind,fragments of packing cases, and straw, mysterious with flashing lights andflaunting shadows, while low masses of torn vapor drifted overhead, hiding, thenrevealing the stars, and all in absolute silence, not even the sounds of thestreets entering this prison-like place, was weird and uncanny in the extreme. Imust confess that already I began to feel a slight disposition towards thehorrors, but with that curious inconsequence which so often happens in the caseof those who are deliberately growing scared, I could think of nothing morereassuring than those delicious verses of Lewis Carroll's:—“Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice, That alone should encouragethe crew. Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice, What I tell youthree times is true,”—which kept repeating themselves over and over in my brainwith feverish insistence.Even the medical students had stopped their chaffing, and were studying thesurroundings gravely.“There is one thing certain,” said Fargeau, “anything might have happened herewithout the slightest chance of discovery. Did ever you see such a perfect placefor lawlessness?”“And anything might happen here now, with the same certainty of impunity,”continued Duchesne, lighting his pipe, the snap of the match making us allstart. “D'Ardeche, your lamented relative was certainly well fixed; she had fullscope here for her traditional experiments in demonology.”“Curse me if I don't believe that those same traditions were more or lessfounded on fact,” said Eugene. “I never saw this court under these conditionsbefore, but I could believe anything now. What's that!”“Nothing but a door slamming,” said Duchesne, loudly.“Well, I wish doors wouldn't slam in houses that have been empty eleven months.”“It is irritating,” and Duchesne slipped his arm through mine; “but we must takethings as they come. Remember we have to deal not only with the spectral lumberleft here by your scarlet aunt, but as well with the supererogatory curse ofthat hell-cat Torrevieja. Come on! let's get inside before the hour arrives forthe sheeted dead to squeak and gibber in these lonely halls. Light your pipes,your tobacco is a sure protection against ‘your whoreson dead bodies’; light upand move on.”We opened the hall door and entered a vaulted stone vestibule, full of dust, andcobwebby.“There is nothing on this floor,” said Eugene, “except servants' rooms andoffices, and I don't believe there is anything wrong with them. I never heardthat there was, any way. Let's go up stairs.”So far as we could see, the house was apparently perfectly uninteresting inside,all eighteenth-century work, the façade of the main building being, with thevestibule, the only portion of the Francis I. work.“The place was burned during the Terror,” said Eugene, “for my great-uncle, fromwhom Mlle. de Tartas inherited it, was a good and true Royalist; he went toSpain after the Revolution, and did not come back until the accession of CharlesX., when he restored the house, and then died, enormously old. This explains whyit is all so new.”The old Spanish sorcerer to whom Mlle. de Tartas had left her personal propertyhad done his work thoroughly. The house was absolutely empty, even the wardrobesand bookcases built in had been carried away; we went through room after room,finding all absolutely dismantled, only the windows and doors with theircasings, the parquet floors, and the florid Renaissance mantels remaining.“I feel better,” remarked Fargeau. “The house may be haunted, but it don't lookit, certainly; it is the most respectable place imaginable.”“Just you wait,” replied Eugene. “These are only the state apartments, which myaunt seldom used, except, perhaps, on her annual ‘Walpurgisnacht.’ Come upstairs and I will show you a better mise en scéne.”On this floor, the rooms fronting the court, the sleeping-rooms, were quitesmall,—(“They are the bad rooms all the same,” said Eugene,)—four of them, alljust as ordinary in appearance as those below. A corridor ran behind themconnecting with the wing corridor, and from this opened a door, unlike any ofthe other doors in that it was covered with green baize, somewhat moth-eaten.Eugene selected a key from the bunch he carried, unlocked the door, and withsome difficulty forced it to swing inward; it was as heavy as the door of asafe.“We are now,” he said, “on the very threshold of hell itself; these rooms inhere were my scarlet aunt's unholy of unholies. I never let them with the restof the house, but keep them as a curiosity. I only wish Torrevieja had kept out;as it was, he looted them, as he did the rest of the house, and nothing is leftbut the walls and ceiling and floor. They are something, however, and maysuggest what the former condition must have been. Tremble and enter.”The first apartment was a kind of anteroom, a cube of perhaps twenty feet eachway, without windows, and with no doors except that by which we entered andanother to the right. Walls, floor, and ceiling were covered with a blacklacquer, brilliantly polished, that flashed the light of our lanterns in athousand intricate reflections. It was like the inside of an enormous Japanesebox, and about as empty. From this we passed to another room, and here we nearlydropped our lanterns. The room was circular, thirty feet or so in diameter,covered by a hemispherical dome; walls and ceiling were dark blue, spotted withgold stars; and reaching from floor to floor across the dome stretched acolossal figure in red lacquer of a nude woman kneeling, her legs reaching outalong the floor on either side, her head touching the lintel of the door throughwhich we had entered, her arms forming its sides, with the fore arms extendedand stretching along the walls until they met the long feet. The mostastounding, misshapen, absolutely terrifying thing, I think, I ever saw. Fromthe navel hung a great white object, like the traditional roe's egg of theArabian Nights. The floor was of red lacquer, and in it was inlaid a pentagramthe size of the room, made of wide strips of brass. In the centre of thispentagram was a circular disk of black stone, slightly saucer-shaped, with asmall outlet in the middle.The effect of the room was simply crushing, with this gigantic red figurecrouched over it all, the staring eyes fixed on one, no matter what hisposition. None of us spoke, so oppressive was the whole thing.The third room was like the first in dimensions, but instead of being black itwas entirely sheathed with plates of brass, walls, ceiling, and floor,—tarnishednow, and turning green, but still brilliant under the lantern light. In themiddle stood an oblong altar of porphyry, its longer dimensions on the axis ofthe suite of rooms, and at one end, opposite the range of doors, a pedestal ofblack basalt.This was all. Three rooms, stranger than these, even in their emptiness, itwould be hard to imagine. In Egypt, in India, they would not be entirely out ofplace, but here in Paris, in a commonplace hotel, in the Rue M. le Prince, theywere incredible.We retraced our steps, Eugene closed the iron door with its baize covering, andwe went into one of the front chambers and sat down, looking at each other.“Nice party, your aunt,” said Fargeau. “Nice old party, with amiable tastes; Iam glad we are not to spend the night in those rooms.”“What do you suppose she did there?” inquired Duchesne. “I know more or lessabout black art, but that series of rooms is too much for me.”“My impression is,” said d'Ardeche, “that the brazen room was a kind ofsanctuary containing some image or other on the basalt base, while the stone infront was really an altar,—what the nature of the sacrifice might be I don'teven guess. The round room may have been used for invocations and incantations.The pentagram looks like it. Any way it is all just about as queer and fin desiécle as I can well imagine. Look here, it is nearly twelve, let's dispose ofourselves, ifwe are going to hunt this thing down.”The four chambers on this floor of the old house were those said to be haunted,the wings being quite innocent, and, so far as we knew, the floors below. It wasarranged that we should each occupy a room, leaving the doors open with thelights burning, and at the slightest cry or knock we were all to rush at once tothe room from which the warning sound might come. There was no communicationbetween the rooms to be sure, but, as the doors all opened into the corridor,every sound was plainly audible.The last room fell to me, and I looked it over carefully.It seemed innocent enough, a commonplace, square, rather lofty Parisiansleeping-room, finished in wood painted white, with a small marble mantel, adusty floor of inlaid maple and cherry, walls hung with an ordinary Frenchpaper, apparently quite new, and two deeply embrasured windows looking out onthe court.I opened the swinging sash with some trouble, and sat down in the window seatwith my lantern beside me trained on the only door, which gave on the corridor.The wind had gone down, and it was very still without,—still and hot. The massesof luminous vapor were gathering thickly overhead, no longer urged by the gustywind. The great masses of rank wisteria leaves, with here and there a secondblossoming of purple flowers, hung dead over the window in the sluggish air.Across the roofs I could hear the sound of a belated fiacre in the streetsbelow. I filled my pipe again and waited.For a time the voices of the men in the other rooms were a companionship, and atfirst I shouted to them now and then, but my voice echoed rather unpleasantlythrough the long corridors, and had a suggestive way of reverberating around theleft wing beside me, and coming out at a broken window at its extremity like thevoice of another man. I soon gave up my attempts at conversation, and devotedmyself to the task of keeping awake.It was not easy; why did I eat that lettuce salad at Pére Garceau's? I shouldhave known better. It was making me irresistibly sleepy, and wakefulness wasabsolutely necessary. It was certainly gratifying to know that I could sleep,that my courage was by me to that extent, but in the interests of science I mustkeep awake. But almost never, it seemed, had sleep looked so desirable. Half ahundred times, nearly, I would doze for an instant, only to awake with a start,and find my pipe gone out. Nor did the exertion of relighting it pull metogether. I struck my match mechanically, and with the first puff dropped offagain. It was most vexing. I got up and walked around the room. It was mostannoying. My cramped position had almost put both my legs to sleep. I couldhardly stand. I felt numb, as though with cold. There was no longer any soundfrom the other rooms, nor from without. I sank down in my window seat. How darkit was growing! I turned up the lantern. That pipe again, how obstinately itkept going out! and my last match was gone. The lantern, too, was that goingout? I lifted my hand to turn it up again. It felt like lead, and fell besideme.Then I awoke,—absolutely. I remembered the story of “The Haunters and theHaunted.” This was the Horror. I tried to rise, to cry out. My body was likelead, my tongue was paralyzed. I could hardly move my eyes. And the light wasgoing out. There was no question about that. Darker and darker yet; little bylittle the pattern of the paper was swallowed up in the advancing night. Aprickling numbness gathered in every nerve, my right arm slipped without feelingfrom my lap to my side, and I could not raise it,—it swung helpless. A thin,keen humming began in my head, like the cicadas on a hillside in September. Thedarkness was coming fast.Yes, this was it. Something was subjecting me, body and mind, to slow paralysis.Physically I was already dead. If I could only hold my mind, my consciousness, Imight still be safe, but could I? Could I resist the mad horror of this silence,the deepening dark, the creeping numbness? I knew that, like the man in theghost story, my only safety lay here.It had come at last. My body was dead, I could no longer move my eyes. They werefixed in that last look on the place where the door had been, now only adeepening of the dark.Utter night: the last flicker of the lantern was gone. I sat and waited; my mindwas still keen, but how long would it last? There was a limit even to theendurance of the utter panic of fear.Then the end began. In the velvet blackness came two white eyes, milky,opalescent, small, far away,—awful eyes, like a dead dream. More beautiful thanI can describe, the flakes of white flame moving from the perimeter inward,disappearing in the centre, like a never ending flow of opal water into acircular tunnel. I could not have moved my eyes had I possessed the power: theydevoured the fearful, beautiful things that grew slowly, slowly larger, fixed onme, advancing, growing more beautiful, the white flakes of light sweeping moreswiftly into the blazing vortices, the awful fascination deepening in its insaneintensity as the white, vibrating eyes grew nearer, larger.Like a hideous and implacable engine of death the eyes of the unknown Horrorswelled and expanded until they were close before me, enormous, terrible, and Ifelt a slow, cold, wet breath propelled with mechanical regularity against myface, enveloping me in its fetid mist, in its charnel-house deadliness.With ordinary fear goes always a physical terror, but with me in the presence ofthis unspeakable Thing was only the utter and awful terror of the mind, the madfear of a prolonged and ghostly nightmare. Again and again I tried to shriek, tomake some noise, but physically I was utterly dead. I could only feel myself gomad with the terror of hideous death. The eyes were close on me,—their movementso swift that they seemed to be but palpitating flames, the dead breath wasaround me like the depths of the deepest sea.Suddenly a wet, icy mouth, like that of a dead cuttle-fish, shapeless,jelly-like, fell over mine. The horror began slowly to draw my life from me,but, as enormous and shuddering folds of palpitating jelly swept sinuouslyaround me, my will came back, my body awoke with the reaction of final fear, andI closed with the nameless death that enfolded me.What was it that I was fighting? My arms sunk through the unresisting mass thatwas turning me to ice. Moment by moment new folds of cold jelly swept round me,crushing me with the force of Titans. I fought to wrest my mouth from this awfulThing that sealed it, but, if ever I succeeded and caught a single breath, thewet, sucking mass closed over my face again before I could cry out. I think Ifought for hours, desperately, insanely, in a silence that was more hideous thanany sound,—fought until I felt final death at hand, until the memory of all mylife rushed over me like a flood, until I no longer had strength to wrench myface from that hellish succubus, until with a last mechanical struggle I felland yielded to death.Then I heard a voice say, “If he is dead, I can never forgive myself; I was toblame.”Another replied, “He is not dead, I know we can save him if only we reach thehospital in time. Drive like hell, cocher! twenty francs for you, if you getthere in three minutes.”Then there was night again, and nothingness, until I suddenly awoke and staredaround. I lay in a hospital ward, very white and sunny, some yellowfleurs-de-lis stood beside the head of the pallet, and a tall sister of mercysat by my side.To tell the story in a few words, I was in the Hotel Dieu, where the men hadtaken me that fearful night of the twelfth of June. I asked for Fargeau orDuchesne, and by and by the latter came, and sitting beside the bed told me allthat I did not know.It seems that they had sat, each in his room, hour after hour, hearing nothing,very much bored, and disappointed. Soon after two o'clock Fargeau, who was inthe next room, called to me to ask if I was awake. I gave no reply, and, aftershouting once or twice, he took his lantern and came to investigate. The doorwas locked on the inside! He instantly called d'Ardeche and Duchesne, andtogether they hurled themselves against the do or. It resisted. Within theycould hear irregular footsteps dashing here and there, with heavy breathing.Although frozen with terror, they fought to destroy the door and finallysucceeded by using a great slab of marble that formed the shelf of the mantel inFargeau's room. As the door crashed in, they were suddenly hurled back againstthe walls of the corridor, as though by an explosion, the lanterns wereextinguished, and they found themselves in utter silence and darkness.As soon as they recovered from the shock, they leaped into the room and fellover my body in the middle of the floor. They lighted one of the lanterns, andsaw the strangest sight that can be imagined. The floor and walls to the heightof about six feet were running with something that seemed like stagnant water,thick, glutinous, sickening. As for me, I was drenched with the same cursedliquid. The odor of musk was nauseating. They dragged me away, stripped off myclothing, wrapped me in their coats, and hurried to the hospital, thinking meperhaps dead. Soon after sunrise d'Ardeche left the hospital, being assured thatI was in a fair way to recovery, with time, and with Fargeau went up to examineby daylight the traces of the adventure that was so nearly fatal. They were toolate. Fire engines were coming down the street as they passed the Académie. Aneighbor rushed up to d'Ardeche: “O Monsieur! what misfortune, yet what fortune!It is true la Bouche d'Enfer—I beg pardon, the residence of the lamented Mlle.de Tartas,—was burned, but not wholly, only the ancient building. The wings weresaved, and for that great credit is due the brave firemen. Monsieur willremember them, no doubt.”It was quite true. Whether a forgotten lantern, overturned in the excitement,had done the work, or whether the origin of the fire was more supernatural, itwas certain that “the Mouth of Hell” was no more. A last engine was pumpingslowly as d'Ardeche came up; half a dozen limp, and one distended, hosestretched through the porte cochère, and within only the façade of Francis I.remained, draped still with the black stems of the wisteria. Beyond lay a greatvacancy, where thin smoke was rising slowly. Every floor was gone, and thestrange halls of Mlle. Blaye de Tartas were only a memory.With d'Ardeche I visited the place last year, but in the stead of the ancientwalls was then only a new and ordinary building, fresh and respectable; yet thewonderful stories of the old Bouche d'Enfer still lingered in the quarter, andwill hold there, I do not doubt, until the Day of Judgment."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] THE TESTAMENT OF MAGDALEN BLAIR Image [images/u4.jpg]by Aleister CrowleyRalph Adams Cram might be honored with a Feast Day in the liturgical calendar ofthe Anglican Church, but Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) is worshipped by thousandsof devotees throughout the world as the Prophet of the magicalreligion/philosophy Thelema, and Logos of the Aeon of Horus.It is impossible to acknowledge even a fraction of the highlights of the life ofthis larger-than-life personage. Even if we were to focus exclusively on hisliterary output—his poetry, his essays, his magazine articles, his reviews, hisnovels, his short stories, his plays—we would soon run out of space allotted usfor the production of this book. Even if we were to rashly judge that he was amad, wicked scoundrel and con-man, we would still be forced to conclude by thesheer weight of evidence that he was the most magnificently brilliantmadman-wicked-scoundrel con-man to appear on earth since the Apostle Paul.If “The Testament of Magdalen Blair” is to be your first taste of Crowley, Irespectfully suggest that you keep in mind the most exquisitely deliciousdelicacies are often an acquired taste, but a taste well worth cultivating.THE TESTAMENT OF MAGDALEN BLAIRPART ONEIn my third term at Newnham I was already Professor Blair's favourite pupil.Later, he wasted a great deal of time praising my slight figure and my piquantface, with its big round grey eyes and their long black lashes; but the firstattraction was my singular gift. Few men, and, I believe, no other women, couldapproach me on one of the most priceless qualifications for scientific study,the faculty of apprehending minute differences. My memory was poor,extraordinarily so; I had the utmost trouble to enter Cambridge at all. But Icould adjust a micrometer better than either students or professor, and read avernier with an accuracy to which none of them could even aspire. To this Iadded a faculty of subconscious calculation which was really uncanny. If I wereengaged in keeping a solution between (say) 70° and 80° I had no need to watchthe thermometer. Automatically I became aware that the mercury was close to thelimit, and would go over from my other work and adjust the Bunsen without athought.More remarkable still, if any object were placed on my bench without myknowledge and then removed, I could, if asked within a few minutes, describe theobject roughly, especially distinguishing the shape of its base and the degreeof its opacity to heat and light. From these data I could make a pretty goodguess at what the object was.This faculty of mine was repeatedly tested, and always with success. Extremesensitiveness to minute degrees of heat was its obvious cause.I was also a singularly good thought-reader, even at this time. The other girlsfeared me absolutely. They need not have done so; I had neither ambition norenergy to make use of any of my powers. Even now, when I bring to mankind thismessage of a doom so appalling that at the age of twenty-four I am a shrivelled,blasted, withered wreck, I am supremely weary, supremely indifferent.I have the heart of a child and the consciousness of Satan, the lethargy of Iknow not what disease; and yet, thank—oh! there can be no God!—the resolution towarn mankind to follow my example, and then to explode a dynamite cartridge inmy mouth.IIn my third year at Newnham I spent four hours of every day at Professor Blair'shouse. All other work was neglected, gone through mechanically, if at all. Thiscame about gradually, as the result of an accident.The chemical laboratory has two rooms, one small and capable of being darkened.On this occasion (the May term of my second year) this room was in use. It wasthe first week of June, and extremely fine. The door was shut. Within was agirl, alone, experimenting with the galvanometer.I was absorbed in my own work. Quite without warning I looked up. “Quick,” saidI, “Gladys is going to faint.” Every one in the room stared at me. I took adozen steps towards the door, when the fall of a heavy body sent the laboratoryinto hysterics.It was only the heat and confined atmosphere, and Gladys should not have come towork that day at all, but she was easily revived, and then the demonstratoracquiesced in the anarchy that followed. “How did she know?” was the universalquery; for that I knew was evident. Ada Brown (Athanasia contra mundum)pooh-poohed the whole affair; Margaret Letchmere thought I must have heardsomething; perhaps a cry inaudible to the others, owing to their occupiedattention; Doris Leslie spoke of second sight, and Amy Gore of “sympathy.” Allthe theories, taken together, went round the clock of conjecture. ProfessorBlair came in at the most excited part of the discussion, calmed the room in twominutes, elicited the facts in five, and took me off to dine with him. “Ibelieve it's this human thermopile affair of yours,” he said. “Do you mind if wetry a few parlour tricks after dinner?” His aunt, who kept house for him,protested in vain, and was appointed Grand Superintendent in Ordinary of my fivesenses.My hearing was first tested, and found normal, or thereabouts. I was thenblindfolded, and the aunt (by excess of precaution) stationed between me and theProfessor. I found that I could describe even small movements that he made, solong as he was between me and the western window, not at all when he moved roundto other quarters. This is in conformity with the “Thermopile” theory; it wascontradicted completely on other occasions. The results (in short) were veryremarkable and very puzzling; we wasted two precious hours in futile theorizing.In the event, the aunt (cowed by a formidable frown) invited me to spend theLong Vacation in Cornwall.During these months the Professor and I assiduously worked to discover exactlythe nature and limit of my powers. The result, in a sense, was nil.For one thing, these powers kept on “breaking out in a new place.” I seemed todo all I did by perception of minute differences; but then it seemed as if I hadall sorts of different apparatus. “One down, t'other come on,” said ProfessorBlair.Those who have never made scientific experiments cannot conceive how numerousand subtle are the sources of error, even in the simplest matters. In so obscureand novel a field of research no result is trustworthy until it has beenverified a thousand times. In our field we discovered no constants, allvariables.Although we had hundreds of facts any one of which seemed capable ofoverthrowing all accepted theories of the means of communication between mindand mind, we had nothing, absolutely nothing, which we could use as the basis ofa new theory.It is naturally impossible to give even an outline of the course of ourresearch. Twenty-eight closely written note books referring to the first periodare at the disposal of my executors.IIIn the middle of the day, in my third year, my father was dangerously ill. Ibicycled over to Peterborough at once, never thinking of my work. (My father isa canon of Peter-borough Cathedral.) On the third day I received a telegram fromProfessor Blair, “Will you be my wife?” I had never realized myself as a woman,or him as a man, till that moment, and in that moment I knew that I loved himand had always loved him. It was a case of what one might call “Love at firstabsence.” My father recovered rapidly; I returned to Cambridge; we were marriedduring the May week, and went immediately to Switzerland. I beg to be spared anyrecital of so sacred a period of my life; but I must record one fact.We were sitting in a garden by Lago Maggiore after a delightful tramp fromChamounix over the Col du Geant to Courmayeur, and thence to Aosta, and so bydegrees to Pallanza. Arthur rose, apparently struck by some idea, and began towalk up and down the terrace. I was quite suddenly impelled to turn my head toassure myself of his presence.This may seem nothing to you who read, unless you have true imagination. Butthink of yourself talking to a friend in full light, and suddenly leaningforward to touch him. “Arthur!” I cried, “Arthur!”The distress in my tone brought him running to my side. “What is it, Magdalen?”he cried, anxiety in every word.I closed my eyes. “Make gestures!” said I. (He was directly between me and thesun.)He obeyed, wondering.“You are—you are—” I stammered, “No! I don't know what you are doing. I amblind!”He sawed his arm up and down. Useless; I had become absolutely insensitive. Werepeated a dozen experiments that night. All failed.We concealed our disappointment, and it did not cloud our love. The sympathybetween us grew even subtler and stronger, but only as it grows between all menand women who love with their whole hearts, and love unselfishly.IIIWe returned to Cambridge in October, and Arthur threw himself vigorously intothe new year's work. Then I fell ill, and the hope we had indulged wasdisappointed. Worse, the course of the illness revealed a condition whichdemanded the most complete series of operations which a woman can endure. Notonly the past hope, but all future hope, was annihilated.It was during my convalescence that the most remarkable incident of my life tookplace.I was in great pain one afternoon, and wished to see the doctor. The nurse wentto the study to telephone for him.“Nurse!” I said, as she returned, “don't lie to me. He's not gone to Royston;he's got cancer, and is too upset to come.”“Whatever next?” said the nurse. “It's right he can't come, and I was going totell you he had gone to Royston; but I never heard nothing about no cancer.”This was true; she had not been told. But the next morning we heard that my“intuition” was correct.As soon as I was well enough, we began our experiments again. My powers hadreturned, and in triple force.Arthur explained my “intuition” as follows: “The doctor (when you last saw him)did not know consciously that he had cancer; but subconsciously Nature gavewarning. You read this subconsciously, and it sprang into your consciousnesswhen you read on the nurse's face that he was ill.”This, far-fetched as it may seem, at least avoids the shallow theories about“telepathy.”From this time my powers constantly increased. I could read my husband'sthoughts from imperceptible movements of his face as easily as a traineddeaf-mute can sometimes read the speech of a distant man from the movements ofhis lips. Gradually as we worked, day by day, I found my grasp of detail everfuller. It is not only that I could read emotions; I could tell whether he wasthinking 3465822 or 3456822. In the year following my illness, we made 436experiments of this kind, each extending over several hours; in all 9363, withonly 122 failures, and these all, without exception, partial.The year following, our experiments were extended to a reading of his dreams. Inthis I proved equally successful. My practice was to leave the room before hewoke, write down the dream that he had dreamt, and await him at the breakfasttable, where he would compare his record with mine.Invariably they were identical, with this exception, that my record was alwaysmuch fuller than his. He would nearly always, however, purport to remember thedetails supplied by me; but this detail has (I think) no real scientific value.But what does it all matter, when I think of the horror impending?IVThat my only means of discovering Arthur's thought was by muscle-reading becamemore than doubtful during the third year of our marriage. We practised“telepathy” unashamed. We excluded the “muscle-reader” and the “super-auditor”and the “human thermopile” by elaborate precautions; yet still I was able toread every thought of his mind. On our holiday in North Wales at Easter one yearwe separated for a week, at the end of that week he to be on the leeward, I onthe windward side of Tryfan, at the appointed hour, he there to open and read tohimself a sealed packet given him by “some stranger met at Pen-y-Pass during theweek.” The experiment was entirely successful; I reproduced every word of thedocument. If the “telepathy” is to be vitiated, it is on the theory that I hadpreviously met the “stranger” and read from him what he would write in suchcircumstances! Surely direct communication of mind with mind is an easiertheory!Had I known in what all this was to culminate, I suppose I should have gone mad.Thrice fortunate that I can warn humanity of what awaits each one. The greatestbenefactor of his race will be he who discovers an explosive indefinitelyswifter and more devastating than dynamite. If I could only trust myself toprepare Chloride of Nitrogen in sufficient quantity . . .VArthur became listless and indifferent. The perfection of love that had been ourmarriage failed without warning, and yet by imperceptible gradations. Myawakening to the fact was, however, altogether sudden. It was one summerevening; we were paddling on the Cam. One of Arthur's pupils, also in a Canadiancanoe, challenged us to a race. At Magdalen Bridge we were a lengthahead—suddenly I heard my husband's thought. It was the most hideous andhorrible laugh that it is possible to conceive. No devil could laugh so. Iscreamed, and dropped my paddle. Both the men thought me ill. I assured myselfthat it was not the laugh of some townee on the bridge, distorted by myover-sensitive organization. I said no more; Arthur looked grave. At night heasked abruptly after a long period of brooding, “Was that my thought?” I couldonly stammer that I did not know.Incidentally he complained of fatigue, and the listlessness, which before hadseemed nothing to me, assumed a ghastly shape. There was something in him thatwas not he! The indifference had appeared transitory; I now became aware of itas constant and increasing. I was at this time twenty-three years old. Youwonder that I write with such serious attitude of mind. I sometimes think that Ihave never had any thoughts of my own; that I have always been reading thethoughts of another, or perhaps of Nature. I seem only to have been a woman inthose first few months of marriage.VIThe six months following held for me nothing out of the ordinary, save that sixor seven times I had dreams, vivid and terrible. Arthur had no share in these.Yet I knew, I cannot say how, that they were his dreams and not mine; or ratherthat they were in his subconscious waking self, for one occurred in theafternoon, when he was out shooting, and not in the least asleep.The last of them occurred towards the end of the October term. He was lecturingas usual, I was at home, lethargic after a too heavy breakfast following awakeful night. I saw suddenly a picture of the lecture-room, enormously greaterthan in reality, so that it filled all space; and in the rostrum, bulging overit in all directions, was a vast, deadly pale devil with a face which was ablasphemy on Arthur's. The evil joy of it was indescribable. So wan and bloated,its lips so loose and bloodless; fold after fold of its belly flopping over therostrum and pushing the students out of the ball, it leered unspeakably. Thendribbled from its mouth these words; “Ladies and gentlemen, the course isfinished. You may go home.” I cannot hope even to suggest the wickedness andfilth of these simple expressions. Then, raising its voice to a grating scream,it yelled:“White of egg! White of egg! White of egg!” again and again for twenty minutes.The effect on me was shocking. It was as if I had a vision of Hell.Arthur found me in a very hysterical condition, but soon soothed me. “Do youknow,” he said at dinner, “I believe I have got a devilish bad chill?”It was the first time I had known him to complain of his health. In six years hehad not had as much as a headache.I told him my “dream” when we were in bed, and he seemed unusually grave, as ifhe understood where I had failed in its interpretation. In the morning he wasfeverish; I made him stay in bed and sent for the doctor. The same afternoon Ilearnt that Arthur was seriously ill, had been ill, indeed, for months. Thedoctor called it Bright's disease.VIII said “the last of the dreams.” For the next year we travelled, and triedvarious treatments. My powers remained excellent, but I received none of thesubconscious horrors. With few fluctuations, he grew steadily worse; daily hebecame more listless, more indifferent, more depressed. Our experiments werenecessarily curtailed. Only one problem exercised him, the problem of hispersonality. He began to wonder who he was. I do not mean that he suffered fromdelusions, I mean that the problem of the true Ego took hold of his imagination.One perfect summer night at Contrexeville he was feeling much better; thesymptoms had (temporarily) disappeared almost entirely under the treatment of avery skillful doctor at that Spa, a Dr. Barbezieux, a most kind and thoughtfulman.“I am going to try,” said Arthur, “to penetrate myself. Am I an animal, and isthe world without a purpose? Or am I a soul in a body? Or am I, one andindivisible in some incredible sense, a spark of the infinite light of God? I amgoing to think inwards; I shall possibly go into some form of trance,unintelligible to myself. You may be able to interpret it.” The experiment hadlasted about half-an-hour when he sat up gasping with effort.“I have seen nothing, heard nothing,” I said. “Not one thought has passed fromyou to me.” But at that very moment what had been in his mind flashed into mine.“It is a blind abyss,” I told him, “and there hangs in it a vulture vaster thanthe whole starry system.”“Yes,” he said, “that was it. But that was not all. I could not get beyond it. Ishall try again.”He tried. Again I was cut off from his thought, although his face was twitchingso that one might have said that any one might read his mind.“I have been looking in the wrong place,” said he suddenly, but very quietly andwithout moving. “The thing I want lies at the base of the spine.”This time I saw. In a blue heaven was coiled an infinite snake of gold andgreen, with four eyes of fire, black fire and red, that darted rays in everydirection; held within its coils was a great multitude of laughing children. Andeven as I looked, all this was blotted out. Crawling rivers of blood spread overthe heaven, of blood purulent with nameless forms—mangy dogs with their bowelsdragging behind them; creatures half elephant, half beetle; things that were buta ghastly bloodshot eye, set about with leathery tentacles; women whose skinsheaved and bubbled like boiling sulphur, giving off clouds that condensed into athousand other shapes, more hideous than their mother; these were the least ofthe denizens of these hateful rivers. The most were things impossible to name orto describe.I was brought back from the vision by the stertorous and strangling breath ofArthur, who had been seized with a convulsion.From this he never really rallied. The dim sight grew dimmer, the speech slowerand thicker, the headaches more persistent and acute.Torpor succeeded to his old splendid energy and activity; his days becamecontinual lethargy ever deepening towards coma. Convulsions now and then alarmedme for his immediate danger.Sometimes his breath came hard and hissing like a snake in anger; towards theend it assumed the Cheyne-Strokes type in bursts of ever increasing duration andseverity.In all this, however, he was still himself; the horror that was and yet was nothimself did not peer from behind the veil.“So long as I am consciously myself,” he said in one of his rare fits ofbrightness, “I can communicate to you what I am consciously thinking; as soon asthis conscious ego is absorbed, you get the subconscious thought which I fear—ohhow I fear!—is the greater and truer part of me. You have brought unguessedexplanations from the world of sleep; you are the one woman in the world—perhapsthere may never be another—who has such an opportunity to study the phenomena ofdeath.”He charged me earnestly to suppress my grief, to concentrate wholly on thethoughts that passed through his mind when he could no longer express them, andalso on those of his subconsciousness when coma inhibited consciousness.It is this experiment that I now force myself to narrate. The prologue has beenlong; it has been necessary to put the facts before mankind in a simple way sothat they may seize the opportunity of the proper kind of suicide. I beg myreaders most earnestly not to doubt my statements; the notes, of ourexperiments, left in my will to the greatest thinker now living, Professor vonBuehle, will make clear the truth of my relation, and the great and terriblenecessity of immediate, drastic action.PART TWOThe stunning physical fact of my husband's illness was the immense prostration.So strong a body, as too often the convulsions gave proof; such inertia with it!He would lie all day like a log; then without warning or apparent cause theconvulsions would begin. Arthur's steady scientific brain stood it well; it wasonly two days before his death that delirium began. I was not with him, worn outas I was, and yet utterly unable to sleep, the doctor had insisted on my takinga long motor drive. In the fresh air I slumbered. I awoke to hear an unfamiliarvoice saying in my ear. “Now for the fun of the fair!” There was no one there.Quick on its heels followed my husband's voice as I had long since known andloved it, clear, strong, resonant, measured: “Get this down right; it is veryimportant. I am passing into the power of the subconsciousness. I may not beable to speak to you again. But I am here; I am not to be touched by all that Imay suffer; I can always think; you can always read my—” The voice broke offsharply to inquire, “But will it ever end?” as if some one had spoken to it. Andthen I heard the laugh. The laugh that I had heard by Magdalen Bridge washeavenly music beside that! The face of Calvin (even) as he gloated over theburning of Servetus would have turned pitiful had he heard it, so perfectly didit express the quintessence of damnation.Now then my husband's thought seemed to have changed places with the other. Itwas below, within, withdrawn. I said to myself, “He is dead!”Then came Arthur's thought, “I had better pretend to be mad. It will save her,perhaps; and it will be a change. I shall pretend I have killed her with an axe.Damn it! I hope she is not listening.” I was now thoroughly awake, and told thedriver to get home quickly. “I hope she is killed in the motor; I hope she issmashed into a million pieces. O God! Hear my one prayer! Let an Anarchist throwa bomb and smash Magdalen into a million pieces! Especially the brain! And thebrain first. O God! my first and last prayer; smash Magdalen into a millionpieces!”The horror of this thought was my conviction—then and now—that it representedperfect sanity and coherence of thought. For I dreaded utterly to think whatsuch words might imply.At the door of the sick-room I was met by the male nurse, who asked me not toenter. Uncontrollably, I asked, “Is he dead?” and though Arthur lay absolutelysenseless on the bed I read the answering thought “Dead!” silently pronounced insuch tones of mockery, horror, cynicism and despair as I never thought to hear.There was a something or somebody who suffered infinitely, and yet who gloatedinfinitely upon that very suffering. And that something was a veil between meand Arthur.The hissing breath recommenced; Arthur seemed to be trying to expresshimself—the self I knew. He managed to articulate feebly, “Is that the police?Let me get out of the house! The police are coming for me. I killed Magdalenwith an axe.” The symptoms of delirium began to appear. “I killed Magdalen” hemuttered a dozen times, then changing to “Magdalen with” again and again; thevoice low, slow, thick, yet reiterated. Then suddenly, quite clear and loud,attempting to rise in the bed: “I smashed Magdalen into a million pieces with anaxe.” After a moment's pause: “a million is not very many now-a-days.” Fromthis—which I now see to have been the speech of a sane Arthur—he dropped againinto delirium. “A million pieces,” “a cool million,” “a million million millionmillion million million” and so on; then abruptly: “Fanny's dog's dead.”I cannot explain the last sentence to my readers; I may, however, remark that itmeant everything to me. I burst into tears. At that moment I caught Arthur'sthought, “You ought to be busy with the note-book, not crying.” I resolutelydried my eyes, took courage, and began to write.IThe doctor came in at this moment and begged me to go and rest. “You are onlydistressing yourself, Mrs. Blair,” he said, “and needlessly, for he isabsolutely unconscious and suffers nothing.” A pause. “My God! why do you lookat me like that?” he exclaimed, frightened out of his wits. I think my face hadcaught something of that devil's, something of that sneer, that loathing, thatmire of contempt and stark despair.I sank back into myself, ashamed already that mere knowledge—and such mean vileknowledge—should so puff one up with hideous pride. No wonder Satan fell! Ibegan to understand all the old legends, and far more—I told Doctor Kershaw thatI was carrying out Arthur's last wishes. He raised no further opposition; but Isaw him sign to the male nurse to keep an eye on me.The sick man's finger beckoned us. He could not speak; he traced circles on thecounterpane. The doctor (with characteristic intelligence) having counted thecircles, nodded, and said: “Yes it is nearly seven o'clock. Time for yourmedicine, eh?”“No,” I explained, “he means that he is in the seventh circle of Dante's Hell.”At that instant he entered on a period of noisy delirium. Wild and prolongedhowls burst from his throat; he was being chewed unceasingly by “Dis”; each howlsignaled the meeting of the monster's teeth. I explained this to the doctor.“No,” said he, “he is perfectly unconscious.“Well,” said I, “he will howl about eighty times more.”Doctor Kershaw looked at me curiously, but began to count. My calculation wascorrect. He turned to me, “Are you a woman?”“No,” said I. “I am my husband's colleague.”“I think it is suggestion. You have hypnotized him?” “Never; but I can read histhoughts.”“Yes, I remember now; I read a very remarkable paper on Mind, two years ago.”“That was child's play. But let me go on with my work.”He gave some final instructions to the nurse, and went out.The suffering of Arthur was at this time unspeakable. Chewed as he was into amere pulp that passed over the tongue of “Dis,” each bleeding fragment kept itsown identity and his.The papillae of the tongue were serpents, and each one gnashed its poisonedteeth upon that fodder.And yet, though the sensorium of Arthur was absolutely unimpaired, indeedhyperaesthetic, his consciousness of pain seemed to depend upon the opening ofthe mouth. As it closed in mastication, oblivion fell upon him like athunderbolt. A merciful oblivion? Oh! what a master stroke of cruelty! Again andagain he woke from nothing to a hell of agony, of pure ecstasy of agony, untilhe understood that this would continue for all his life, the alternation was butsystole and diastole; the throb of his envenomed pulse, the reflection inconsciousness of his blood-beat. I became conscious of his intense longing fordeath to end the torture.The blood circulated ever slower and more painfully; I could feel him hoping forthe end.This dreadful rose-dawn suddenly greyed and sickened with doubt. Hope sank toits nadir; fear rose like a dragon, with leaden wings. Suppose, thought he, thatafter all death does not end me!I cannot express this conception. It is not that the heart sank, it had nowhither to sink; it knew itself immortal, and immortal in a realm of unimaginedpain and terror, unlighted by one glimpse of any other light than that paleglare of hate and of pestilence. This thought took shape in these words:I AM THAT I AM.One cannot say that the blasphemy added to the horror; rather it was the essenceof the horror. It was the gnashing of the teeth of a damned soul.IIThe demon-shape, which I now clearly recognise as that which had figured in mylast “dream” at Cambridge, seemed to gulp. At that instant a convulsion shookthe dying man and a coughing eructation took the “demon.” Instantly the wholetheory dawned on me, that this “demon” was an imaginary personification of thedisease. Now at once I understood demonology, from Bodin and Weirus to themodems, without a flaw. But was it imaginary or was it real? Real enough toswallow up the “sane” thought!At that instant the old Arthur reappeared. “I am not the monster! I am ArthurBlair, of Fettes and Trinity. I have passed through a paroxysm.”The sick man stirred feebly. A portion of his brain had shaken off the poisonfor the moment, and was working furiously against time.“I am going to die.“The consolation of death is Religion. “There is no use for Religion in life.“How many atheists have I not known sign the articles for the sake offellowships and livings! Religion in life is either an amusement and asoporific, or a sham and a swindle.“I was brought up a Presbyterian.“How easily I drifted into the English Church! And now where is God?“Where is the Lamb of God?“Where is the Saviour?“Where is the Comforter?“Why was I not saved from that devil?”“Is he going to eat me again? To absorb me into him? O fate inconceivablyhideous! It is quite clear to me—I hope you've got it down, Magdalen!—that thedemon is made of all those that have died of Bright's disease. There must bedifferent ones for each disease. I thought I once caught sight of a coughing bogof bloody slime.“Let me pray.”A frenzied appeal to the Creator followed. Sincere as it was, it would read likeirreverence in print.And then there came the cold-drawn horror of stark blasphemy against thisGod—who would not answer. Followed the bleak black agony of the conviction—theabsolute certitude—“There is no God!” combined with a wave of frenzied wrathagainst the people who had so glibly assured him that there was, an almostmaniac hope that they would suffer more than he, if it were possible.(Poor Arthur! He had not yet brushed the bloom off Suffering's grape; he was todrink its fiercest distillation to the dregs.)“No!” thought he, “perhaps I lack their ‘faith.’“Perhaps if I could really persuade myself of God and Christ—perhaps if I coulddeceive myself, could make believe—”Such a thought is to surrender one's honesty, to abdicate one's reason. Itmarked the final futile struggle of his will.The demon caught and crunched him, and the noisy delirium began anew.My flesh and blood rebelled. Taken with a deathly vomit, I rushed from the room,and resolutely, for a whole hour, diverted my sensorium from thought. I hadalways found that the slightest trace of tobacco smoke in a room greatlydisturbed my power. On this occasion I puffed cigarette after cigarette withexcellent effect. I knew nothing of what had been going on.IIIArthur, stung by the venomous chyle, was tossing in that vast arched belly,which resembled the dome of hell, churned in its bubbling slime. I felt that hewas not only disintegrated mechanically, but chemically, that his being wasloosened more and more into parts, that these were being absorbed into new andhateful things, but that (worst of all) Arthur stood immune from all, behind it,unimpaired, memory and reason ever more acute as ever new and ghastlierexperience informed them. It seemed to me as if some mystic state weresuper-added to the torment; for while he was not, emphatically not, thistortured mass of consciousness, yet that was he. There are always at least twoof us! The one who feels and the one who knows are not radically one person.This double personality is enormously accentuated at death..Another point was that the time-sense, which with men is usually soreliable—especially in my own case—was decidedly deranged, if not abrogatedaltogether.We all judge of the lapse of time in relation to our daily habits or somesimilar standard. The conviction of immortality must naturally destroy allvalues for this sense. If I am immortal, what is the difference between a longtime and a short time? A thousand years and a day are obviously the same thingfrom the point of view of “for ever.”There is a sub-conscious clock in us, a clock wound up by the experience of therace to go for seventy years or so. Five minutes is a very long time to us if weare waiting for an omnibus, an age if we are waiting for a lover, nothing at allif we are pleasantly engaged or sleeping.21We think of seven years as a long time in connection with penal servitude; as anegligibly small period in dealing with geology.But, given immortality, the age of the stellar system itself is nothing.This conviction had not fully impregnated the consciousness of Arthur; it hungover him like a threat, while the intensification of that consciousness, itsliberation from the sense of time natural to life, caused each act of the demonto appear of vast duration, although the intervals between the howls of the bodyon the bed were very short. Each pang of torture or suspense was born, rose toits crest, and died to be reborn again through what seemed countless aeons.Still more was this the case in the process of his assimilation by the “demon.”The coma of the dying man was a phenomenon altogether out of time. Theconditions of “digestion” were new to Arthur, he had no reason to suppose, nodata from which to calculate the distance of, an end. It is impossible to domore than sketch this process; as he was absorbed, so did his consciousnessexpand into that of the “demon”; he became one with all its hunger andcorruption. Yet always did lie suffer as himself in his own person the tearingasunder of his finest molecules; and this was confirmed by a most filthyhumiliation of that part of him that was rejected.I shall not attempt to describe the final process; suffice it that the demoniacconsciousness drew away; he was but the excrement of the demon, and as thatexcrement he was flung filthily further into the abyss of blackness and of nightwhose name is death.I rose with ashen cheeks. I stammered; “He is dead.” The male nurse bent overthe body. “Yes!” he echoed, “he is dead.” And it seemed as if the whole Universegathered itself into one ghastly laugh of hate and horror. “Dead!”IVI resumed my seat. I felt that I must know that all was well, that death hadended all. Woe to humanity! The consciousness of Arthur was more alive thanever. It was the black fear of falling, a dumb ecstasy of changeless fear. Therewere no waves upon that sea of shame, no troubling of those accursed Waters byany thought. There was no hope of any ground to that abyss, no thought that itmight stop. So tireless was that fall that even acceleration was absent; it wasconstant and level as the fall of a star. There was not even a feeling of pace;infinitely fast as it must be, judging from the peculiar dread which itinspired, it was yet infinitely slow, having regard to the infinitude of theabyss.I took measures not to be disturbed by the duties that men—how foolishly!—pay tothe dead; and I took refuge in a cigarette.It was now for the first time, strangely enough, that I began to consider thepossibility of helping him.I analysed the position. It must be his thought, or I could not read it. I hadno reason to conjecture that any other thoughts could reach me. He must be alivein the true sense of the word; it was he and not another that was the prey ofthis fear ineffable. Of this fear it was evident that there must be a physicalbasis in the constitution of his brain and body. All the other phenomena hadbeen shown to correspond exactly with a physical condition; it was thereflection in a consciousness from which human limitation had fallen away, ofthings actually taking place in the body.It was a false interpretation perhaps; but it was his interpretation; and it wasthat which caused suffering so beyond all that poets have ever dreamt of theinfernal.I am ashamed to say that my first thought was of the Catholic Church and itsmasses for the repose of the dead. I went to the Cathedral, revolving as I wentall that had ever been said—the superstitions of a hundred savage tribes. Atbottom I could find no difference between their barbarous rites and those ofChristianity. However that might be, I was baffled. The priests refused to prayfor the soul of a heretic.I hurried back to the house, resumed my vigil. There was no change, except adeepening of the fear, an intensification of the loneliness, a more utterabsorption in the shame. I could but hope that in the ultimate stagnation of allvital forces, death would become final, hell merged into annihilation.This started a train of thought which ended in a determination to hasten theprocess. I thought of blowing out the brains, remembered that I had no means ofdoing so. I thought of freezing the body, imagined a story for the nurse,reflected that no cold could excite in his soul aught icier than thatillimitable void of black.I thought of telling the doctor that he had wished to bequeath his body to thesurgeons, that he had been afraid of being buried alive, anything that mightinduce him to remove the brain. At that moment I looked into the mirror. I sawthat I must not speak. My hair was white, my face drawn, my eyes wild andbloodshot.In utter helplessness and misery I flung myself on the couch in the study, andpuffed greedily at cigarettes. The relief was so immense that my sense ofloyalty and duty had a hard fight to get me to resume the task. The mingling ofhorror, curiosity, and excitement must have aided.I threw away my fifth cigarette, and returned to the death chamber.VBefore I had sat at the table ten minutes a change burst out with startlingsuddenness. At one point in the void the blackness gathered, concentrated,sprang into an evil flame that gushed aimlessly forth from nowhere into nowhere.This was accompanied by the most noxious stench.It was gone before I could realize it. As lightning precedes thunder, it wasfollowed by a hideous clamour that I can only describe as the cry of a machinein pain.This recurred constantly for an hour and five minutes, then ceased as suddenlyas it began. Arthur still fell.It was succeeded after the lapse of five hours by another paroxysm of the samekind, but fiercer and more continuous. Another silence followed, age upon age offear and loneliness and shame.About midnight there appeared a grey ocean of bowels below the falling soul.This ocean seemed to be limitless. It fell headlong into it, and the splashawakened it to a new consciousness of things.This sea, though infinitely cold, was boiling like tubercles. Itself a more orless homogeneous slime, the stench of which is beyond all human conception(human language is singularly deficient in words that describe smell and taste;we always refer our sensations to things generally known) it constantly buddedinto greenish boils with angry red craters, whose jagged edges were of a lividwhite; and from these issued pus formed of all things known of man—each onedistorted, degraded, blasphemed.22Things innocent, things happy, things holy! Every one unspeakably deified,loathsome, sickening! During the vigil of the day following I recognized onegroup. I saw Italy. First the Italy of the Map, a booted leg. But this legchanged rapidly through myriad phases. It was in turn the leg of every beast andbird, and in every case each leg was suffering with all diseases from leprosyand elephantiasis to scrofula and syphilis. There was also the consciousnessthat this was inalienably and for ever part of Arthur.Then Italy itself, in every detail foul. Then I myself, seen as every woman thathas ever been, each one with every disease and torture that Nature and man haveplotted in their hellish brains, each ended with a death, a death like Arthur's,whose infinite pangs were added to his own, recognized and accepted as his own.The same with our child that never was. All children of all nations, incrediblyaborted, deformed, tortured, torn in pieces, abused by every foulness that theimagination of an arch-devil could devise.And so for every thought. I realized that the putrefactive changes in the deadman's brain were setting in motion every memory of his, and smearing them withhell's own paint.I timed one thought, despite its myriad million details, each one clear, vividand prolonged, it occupied but three seconds of earthly time. I considered theincalculable array of the thoughts in his well-furnished mind; I saw thatthousands of years would not exhaust them.But, perhaps, when the brain was destroyed beyond recognition of its componentparts. We have always casually assumed that consciousness depends upon a properflow of blood in the vessels of the brain; we have never stopped to thinkwhether the records might not be excited in some other manner. And yet we knowhow tumour of the brain begets hallucinations. Consciousness works strangely;the least disturbance of the blood supply, and it goes out like a candle, orelse takes monstrous forms.Here was the overwhelming truth; in death man lives again, and lives for ever.Yet we might have thought of it; the phantasmagoria of life which throng themind of a drowning man might have suggested something of the sort to any manwith a sympathetic and active imagination.Worse even than the thoughts themselves was the apprehension of the thoughts erethey arose. Carbuncles, boils, ulcers, cancers, there is no equivalent for thesepustules of the bowels of hell, into whose seething convulsions Arthur sank,deeper, ever deeper.The magnitude of this experience is not to be apprehended by the human mind aswe know it. I was convinced that an end must come, for me, with the cremation ofthe body. I was infinitely glad that he had directed this to be done. But forhim, end and beginning seemed to have no meaning. Through it all I seemed tohear the real Arthur's thought. “Though all this is I, yet it is only anaccident of me; I stand behind it all, immune, eternal.”It must not be supposed that this in any way detracted from the intensity of thesuffering. Rather it added to it. To be loathsome is less than to be linked toloathsomeness. To plunge into impurity is to become deadened to disgust. But todo so and yet remain pure—every vileness adds a pang. Think of Madonnaimprisoned in a body of a prostitute, and compelled to acknowledge “This is I,”while never losing her abhorrence. Not only immured in hell, but compelled topartake of its sacraments; not only high priest at its agape, but begetter andmanifestor of its cult; a Christ nauseated at the kiss of Judas, and yet awarethat the treachery was his own.VIAs the putrefaction of the brain advanced, the bursting of the pustulesoccasionally overlapped, with the result that the confusion and exaggeration ofmadness with all its poignancy was super added to the simpler hell. One mighthave thought that any confusion would have been a welcome relief to a lucidityso appalling; but this was not so. The torture was infused with a shatteringsense of alarm.The images rose up threatening, disappeared only by blasting themselves intopultaceous coprolite which was, as it were, the main body of the army whichcomposed Arthur. Deeper and deeper as he dropped the phenomena grew constantlyin every sense. Now they were a jungle in which the obscurity and terror of thewhole gradually overshadowed even the abhorrence due to every part.The madness of the living is a thing so abominable and fearful as to chill everyhuman heart with horror; it is less than nothing in comparison with the madnessof the dead!A further complication now arose, in the destruction irrevocable and complete ofthat compensating mechanism of the brain, which is the basis of the sense oftime. Hideously distorted and deformed as it had been in the derangement of thebrain like a shapeless jelly shooting out, of a sudden, vast, unsuspectedtentacles, the destruction of it cut a thousandfold deeper. The sense ofconsecution itself was destroyed; things sequent appeared as things superposedor concurrent spatially; a new dimension unfolded; a new destruction of alllimitation exposed a new and unfathomable abyss.To all the rest was added the bewilderment and fear which earthly agoraphobiafaintly shadows forth; and at the same time the close immurement weighted uponhim, since from infinitude there can be no escape.Add to this the hopelessness of the monotony of the situation. Infinitely as thephenomena were varied, they were yet recognised as essentially the same. Allhuman tasks are lightened by the certainty that they must end. Even our joyswould be intolerable were we convinced that they must endure, throughirksomeness and disgust, through weariness and satiety, even for ever and forevermore. In this inhuman, this praeterdiabolic inferno was a wearisomerepetition, a harping on the same hateful discord, a continuous nagging whoseintervals afforded no relief, only a suspense brimming with the anticipation ofsome fresh terror.For hours which were to him eternities this stage continued as each cell thatheld the record of a memory underwent the degenerative changes which awoke itinto hyperbromic purulence.VIIThe minute bacterial corruption now assumed a gross chemistry. The gases ofputrefaction forming in the brain and interpenetrating it were represented inhis consciousness by the denizens of the pustules becoming formless andimpersonal—Arthur had not yet fathomed the abyss.Creeping, winding, embracing, the Universe enfolded him, violated him with anameless and intimate contamination, involved his being in a more suffocatingterror.Now and again it drowned that consciousness in a gulf which his thought couldnot express to me; and indeed the first and least of his torments is utterlybeyond human expression.It was a woe ever expanded, ever intensified, by each vial of wrath. Memoryincreased, and understanding grew; the imagination had equally got rid of limit.What this means who can tell? The human mind cannot really appreciate numbersbeyond a score or so; it can deal with numbers by ratiocination, it cannotapprehend them by direct impression. It requires a highly trained intelligenceto distinguish between fifteen and sixteen matches on a plate without countingthem. In death this limitation is entirely removed. Of the infinite content ofthe Universe every item was separately realized. The brain of Arthur had becomeequal in power to that attributed by theologians to the Creator; yet ofexecutive power there was no seed. The impotence of man before circumstance wasin him magnified indefinitely, yet without loss of detail or of mass. Heunderstood that The Many was The One without losing or fusing the conception ofeither. He was God, but a God irretrievably damned; a being infinite, yetlimited by the nature of things, and that nature solely compact of loathliness.VIIII have little doubt that the cremation of my husband's body cut short a processwhich in the normally buried man continues until no trace of organic substanceremains.The first kiss of the furnace awoke an activity so violent and so vivid that allthe past paled in its lurid light.The quenchless agony of the pang is not to be described; if alleviation therewere, it was but the exultation of feeling that this was final.Not only time, but all expansions of time, all monsters of time's womb were tobe annihilated; even the ego might hope some end.The ego is the “worm that dieth not,” and existence the “fire that is notquenched.” Yet in this universal pyre, in this barathrum of liquid lava, jettedfrom the volcanoes of the infinite, this “lake of fire that is reserved for thedevil and his angels,” might not one at last touch bottom? Ah! but time was nomore, neither any eidolon thereof.The shell was consumed; the gases of the body, combined and recombined, flamedoff, free from organic form.Where was Arthur?His brain, his individuality, his life, were utterly destroyed. As separatethings, yes: Arthur had entered the universal consciousness.And I heard this utterance; or rather this is my translation into English of asingle thought whose synthesis is “Woe.”Substance is called spirit or matter.Spirit and matter are one, indivisible, eternal, indestructible. Infinite andeternal change!Infinite and eternal pain!No absolute; no truth, no beauty, no idea, nothing but the whirlwinds of form,unresting, unappeasable.Eternal hunger! Eternal wart Change and pain infinite and increasing.There is no individuality but in illusion. And the illusion is change and pain,and its destruction is change and pain, and its new segregation from theinfinite and eternal is change and pain; and substance infinite and eternal ischange and pain unspeakable.Beyond thought, which is change and pain, lies being, which is change and pain.These were the last words intelligible; they lapsed into the eternal moan, Woe!Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! in unceasing monotony that rings always in my earsif I let my thought fall from the height of activity, listen to the voice of mysensorium.In my sleep I am partially protected, and I keep a lamp constantly alight toburn tobacco in the room; yet too often my dreams throb with that reiteratedWoe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe!IXThe final stage is clearly enough inevitable, unless we believe the Buddhisttheories, which I am somewhat inclined to do, as their theory of the Universe isprecisely confirmed in every detail by the facts here set down. But it is onething to recognise a disease, another to discover a remedy. Frankly my wholebeing revolts from their methods, and I had rather acquiesce in the ultimatedestiny and achieve it as quickly as may be. My earnest preoccupation is toavoid the preliminary tortures, and I am convinced that the explosion of adynamite cartridge in the mouth is the most practicable method of effectingthis. There is just the possibility that if all thinking minds, all “spiritualbeings,” were thus destroyed, and especially if all organic life could beannihilated, the Universe might cease to be, since (as Bishop Berkeley hasshown) it can only exist in some thinking mind. And there is really no evidence(in spite of Berkeley) for the existence of any extra-human consciousness.Matter in itself may think, in a sense, but its monotony of woe is less awfulthan its abomination, the building up of high and holy things only to drag themthrough infamy and terror to the old abyss.I shall consequently cause this record to be widely distributed. The note-booksof my work with Arthur (Vols. I-ccxiv) will be edited by Professor von Buehle,whose marvellous mind may perhaps discover some escape from the destiny whichmenaces mankind. Everything is in order in these notebooks; and I am free todie, for I can endure no more, and above all things I dread the onset ofillness, and the possibility of natural or accidental death.NOTESI am glad to have the opportunity of publishing, in a medium so widely read bythe medical profession, the MS. of the widow of the late Professor Blair.Her mind undoubtedly became unhinged through grief at her husband's death; themedical man who attended him in his last illness grew alarmed at her condition,and had her watched. She tried (fruitlessly) to purchase dynamite at severalshops, but on her going to the laboratory of her late husband, and attempting tomanufacture Chloride of Nitrogen, obviously for the purpose of suicide, she wasseized, certified insane, and placed in my care.The case is most unusual in several respects.I have never known her inaccurate in any statement of verifiable fact.She can undoubtedly read thoughts in an astonishing manner. In particular, sheis actually useful to me by her ability to foretell attacks of acute insanity inmy patients. Some hours before they occur she can predict them to a minute. Onan early occasion my disbelief in her power led to the dangerous wounding of oneof my attendants.She combines a fixed determination of suicide (in the extraordinary mannerdescribed by her) with an intense fear of death. She smokes uninterruptedly, andI am obliged to allow her to fumigate her room at night with the same drug.She is certainly only twenty-four years old, and any competent judge would withequal certainty declare her sixty.Professor von Buehle, to whom the notebooks were sent, addressed to me a longand urgent telegram, begging her release on condition that she would promise notto commit suicide, but go to work with him in Bonn. I have yet to learn,however, that German professors, however eminent, have any voice in themanagement of a private asylum in England, and I am certain that the LunacyCommissioners will uphold me in my refusal to consider the question.It will then be clearly understood that this document is published with allreserve as the lucubration of a very peculiar, perhaps unique, type of insanity.V. ENGLISH, M.D.21 It is one of the greatest cruelties of nature that all painful or depressingemotions seem to lengthen time; pleasant thoughts and exalted moods make timefly. Thus, in summing up a life from an outside standpoint, it would seem that,supposing pleasure and pain to have occupied equal periods, the impression wouldbe that pain was enormously greater than pleasure. This may be controverted.Virgil writes: “Forsitan haec olim meminisse juvabit,” and there is at least onemodern writer thoroughly conversant with pessimism who is very optimistic. Butthe new facts which I here submit overthrow the whole argument; they cast asword of infinite weight on that petty trembling scale.22 This is my general complaint, and that of all research students on the onehand and imaginative writers on the other. We can only express a new idea bycombining two or more old ideas, or by the use of metaphor; just so any numbercan be formed from two others. James Hinton had undoubtedly a perfectly crisp,simple, and concise idea of the “fourth dimension of space”; he found the utmostdifficulty in conveying it to others, even when they were advancedmathematicians. It is (I believe) the greatest factor that militates againsthuman progress that great men assume that they will be understood by others."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] THE MESSENGER Image [images/u4.jpg]by Robert W. ChambersAs I wrote in the Introduction, If H.P. Lovecraft is the Christ of horror, thenmost assuredly Robert W. Chambers (1865-1933) was his John the Baptist. It isironic that as influential as Chambers would become to the horror and sciencefiction genre, he was even more celebrated during his life for his popularnovels, short stories, war adventure stories, and romantic fictions. He was aformally trained artist whose illustrations graced the pages of Life, Truth, andVogue magazines. But, it is his innovative and imaginative works of horror thathave made him one the brightest stars in the firmament of horror.Little gray messenger,Robed like painted Death,Your robe is dust.Whom do you seekAmong lilies and closed budsAt dusk?Among lilies and closed budsAt dusk,Whom do you seek,Little gray messenger,Robed in the awful panoplyOf painted Death?All-wise,Hast thou seen all there is to see with thy two eyes?Dost thou know all there is to know, and so,Omniscient,Darest thou still to say thy brother lies?R.W.C., 1897THE MESSENGERI“The bullet entered here,” said Max Fortin, and he placed his middle finger overa smooth hole exactly in the center of the forehead.I sat down upon a mound of dry seaweed and unslung my fowling piece.The little chemist cautiously felt the edges of the shot-hole, first with hismiddle finger, and then with his thumb.“Let me see the skull again,” said I.Max Fortin picked it up from the sod.“It's like all the others,” he repeated, wiping his glasses on his handkerchief.“I thought you might care to see one of the skulls, so I brought this over fromthe gravel pit. The men from Bannalec are digging yet. They ought to stop.”“How many skulls are there altogether?” I inquired.“They found thirty-eight skulls; there are thirty-nine noted in the list. Theylie piled up in the gravel pit on the edge of Le Bihan's wheat field. The menare at work yet. Le Bihan is going to stop them.”“Let's go over,” said I; and I picked up my gun and started across the cliffs,Portin on one side, Môme on the other.“Who has the list?” I asked, lighting my pipe. “You say there is a list?”“The list was found rolled up in a brass cylinder,” said the chemist. He added:“You should not smoke here. You know that if a single spark drifted into thewheat—”“Ah, but I have a cover to my pipe,” said I, smiling.Fortin watched me as I closed the pepper-box arrangement over the glowing bowlof the pipe. Then he continued:“The list was made out on thick yellow paper; the brass tube has preserved it.It is as fresh to-day as it was in 1760. You shall see it.”“Is that the date?”“The list is dated ‘April, 1760.’ The Brigadier Durand has it. It is not writtenin French.”“Not written in French!” I exclaimed.“No,” replied Fortin solemnly, “it is written in Breton.”“But,” I protested, “the Breton language was never written or printed in 1760.”“Except by priests,” said the chemist.“I have heard of but one priest who ever wrote the Breton language,” I began.Fortin stole a glance at my face.“You mean—the Black Priest?” he asked.I nodded.Fortin opened his mouth to speak again, hesitated, and finally shut his teethobstinately over the wheat stem that he was chewing.“And the Black Priest?” I suggested encouragingly. But I knew it was useless;for it is easier to move the stars from their courses than to make an obstinateBreton talk. We walked on for a minute or two in silence.“Where is the Brigadier Durand?” I asked, motioning Môme to come out of thewheat, which he was trampling as though it were heather. As I spoke we came insight of the farther edge of the wheat field and the dark, wet mass of cliffsbeyond.“Durand is down there—you can see him; he stands just behind the mayor of St.Gildas.”“I see,” said I; and we struck straight down, following a sun-baked cattle pathacross the heather.When we reached the edge of the wheat field, Le Bihan, the mayor of St. Gildas,called to me, and I tucked my gun under my arm and skirted the wheat to where hestood.“Thirty-eight skulls,” he said in his thin, high-pitched voice; “there is butone more, and I am opposed to further search. I suppose Fortin told you?”I shook hands with him, and returned the salute of the Brigadier Durand.“I am opposed to further search,” repeated Le Bihan, nervously picking at themass of silver buttons which covered the front of his velvet and broadclothjacket like a breastplate of scale armor.Durand pursed up his lips, twisted his tremendous mustache, and hooked histhumbs in his saber belt.“As for me,” he said, “I am in favor of further search.”“Further search for what—for the thirty-ninth skull?” I asked.Le Bihan nodded. Durand frowned at the sunlit sea, rocking like a bowl of moltengold from the cliffs to the horizon. I followed his eyes. On the dark glisteningcliffs, silhouetted against the glare of the sea, sat a cormorant, black,motionless, its horrible head raised toward heaven.“Where is that list, Durand?” I asked.The gendarme rummaged in his despatch pouch and produced a brass cylinder abouta foot long. Very gravely he unscrewed the head and dumped out a scroll of thickyellow paper closely covered with writing on both sides. At a nod from Le Bihanhe handed me the scroll. But I could make nothing of the coarse writing, nowfaded to a dull brown.“Come, come, Le Bihan,” I said impatiently, “translate it, won't you? You andMax Fortin make a lot of mystery out of nothing, it seems.”Le Bihan went to the edge of the pit where the three Bannalec men were digging,gave an order or two in Breton, and turned to me.As I came to the edge of the pit the Bannalec men were removing a square pieceof sailcloth from what appeared to be a pile of cobblestones.“Look!” said Le Bihan shrilly. I looked. The pile below was a heap of skulls.After a moment I clambered down the gravel sides of the pit and walked over tothe men of Bannalec. They saluted me gravely, leaning on their picks andshovels, and wiping their sweating faces with sunburned hands.“How many?” said I in Breton.“Thirty-eight,” they replied.I glanced around. Beyond the heap of skulls lay two piles of human bones. Besidethese was a mound of broken, rusted bits of iron and steel. Looking closer, Isaw that this mound was composed of rusty bayonets, saber blades, scythe blades,with here and there a tarnished buckle attached to a bit of leather hard asiron.I picked up a couple of buttons and a belt plate. The buttons bore the royalarms of England; the belt plate was emblazoned with the English arms and alsowith the number “27.”“I have heard my grandfather speak of the terrible English regiment, the 27thFoot, which landed and stormed the fort up there,” said one of the Bannalec men.“Oh!” said I; “then these are the bones of English soldiers?”“Yes,” said the men of Bannalec.Le Bihan was calling to me from the edge of the pit above, and I handed the beltplate and buttons to the men and climbed the side of the excavation.“Well,” said I, trying to prevent Môme from leaping up and licking my face as Iemerged from the pit, “I suppose you know what these bones are. What are yougoing to do with them?”“There was a man,” said Le Bihan angrily, “an Englishman, who passed here in adog-cart on his way to Quimper about an hour ago, and what do you suppose hewished to do?”“Buy the relics?” I asked, smiling.“Exactly—the pig!” piped the mayor of St. Gildas. “Jean Marie Tregunc, who foundthe bones, was standing there where Max Fortin stands, and do you know what heanswered? He spat upon the ground, and said: ‘Pig of an Englishman, do you takeme for a desecrator of graves?’“I knew Tregunc, a sober, blue-eyed Breton, who lived from one year's end to theother without being able to afford a single bit of meat for a meal.“How much did the Englishman offer Tregunc?” I asked.“Two hundred francs for the skulls alone.”I thought of the relic hunters and the relic buyers on the battle-fields of ourcivil war.“Seventeen hundred and sixty is long ago,” I said.“Respect for the dead can never die,” said Fortin.“And the English soldiers came here to kill your fathers and burn your homes,” Icontinued.“They were murderers and thieves, but—they are dead,” said Tregunc, coming upfrom the beach below, his long sea rake balanced on his dripping jersey.“How much do you earn every year, Jean Marie?” I asked, turning to shake handswith him.“Two hundred and twenty francs, monsieur.”“Forty-five dollars a year,” I said. “Bah! you are worth more, Jean. Will youtake care of my garden for me? My wife wished me to ask you. I think it would beworth one hundred francs a month to you and to me. Come on, Le Bihan—come along,Fortin—and you, Durand. I want somebody to translate that list into French forme.”Tregunc stood gazing at me, his blue eyes dilated.“You may begin at once,” I said, smiling, “if the salary suits you?”“It suits,” said Tregunc, fumbling for his pipe in a silly way that annoyed LeBihan.“Then go and begin your work,” cried the mayor impatiently; and Tregunc startedacross the moors toward St. Gildas, taking off his velvet-ribboned cap to me andgripping his sea rake very hard.“You offer him more than my salary,” said the mayor, after a moment'scontemplation of his silver buttons.“Pooh!” said I, “what do you do for your salary except play dominoes with MaxPortin at the Groix Inn?”Le Bihan turned red, but Durand rattled his saber and winked at Max Fortin, andI slipped my arm through the arm of the sulky magistrate, laughing.“There's a shady spot under the cliff,” I said; “come on, Le Bihan, and read mewhat is in the scroll.”In a few moments we reached the shadow of the cliff, and I threw myself upon theturf, chin on hand, to listen.The gendarme, Durand, also sat down, twisting his mustache into needlelikepoints. Fortin leaned against the cliff, polishing his glasses and examining uswith vague, near-sighted eyes; and Le Bihan, the mayor, planted himself in ourmidst, rolling up the scroll and tucking it under his arm.“First of all,” he began in a shrill voice, “I am going to light my pipe, andwhile lighting it I shall tell you what I have heard about the attack on thefort yonder. My father told me; his father told him.”He jerked his head in the direction of the ruined fort, a small, square stonestructure on the sea cliff, now nothing but crumbling walls. Then he slowlyproduced a tobacco pouch, a bit of flint and tinder, and a long-stemmed pipefitted with a microscopical bowl of baked clay. To fill such a pipe requires tenminutes' close attention. To smoke it to a finish takes but four puffs. It isvery Breton, this Breton pipe. It is the crystallization of everything Breton.“Go on,” said I, lighting a cigarette.“The fort,” said the mayor, “was built by Louis XIV, and was dismantled twice bythe English. Louis XV restored it in 1730. In 1760 it was carried by assault bythe English. They came across from the island of Groix—three shiploads, and theystormed the fort and sacked St. Julien yonder, and they started to burn St.Gildas—you can see the marks of their bullets on my house yet; but the men ofBannalec and the men of L orient fell up on them with pike and scythe andblunderbuss, and those who did not run away lie there below in the gravel pitnow—thirty-eight of them.”“And the thirty-ninth skull?” I asked, finishing my cigarette.The mayor had succeeded in filling his pipe, and now he began to put his tobaccopouch away.“The thirty-ninth skull,” he mumbled, holding the pipe stem between hisdefective teeth—”the thirty-ninth skull is no business of mine. I have told theBannalec men to cease digging.”“But what is—whose is the missing skull?” I persisted curiously.The mayor was busy trying to strike a spark to his tinder. Presently he set itaglow, applied it to his pipe, took the prescribed four puffs, knocked the ashesout of the bowl, and gravely replaced the pipe in his pocket.“The missing skull?” he asked.“Yes,” said I, impatiently.The mayor slowly unrolled the scroll and began to read, translating from theBreton into French. And this is what he read:On the Cliffs of St. Gildas,April 13, 1760.On this day, by order of the Count of Soisic, general in chief of the Bretonforces now lying in Kerselec Forest, the bodies of thirty-eight English soldiersof the 27th, 50th, and 72nd regiments of Foot were buried in this spot, togetherwith their arms and equipments.The mayor paused and glanced at me reflectively.“Go on, Le Bihan,” I said.“With them,” continued the mayor, turning the scroll and reading on the otherside, “was buried the body of that vile traitor who betrayed the fort to theEnglish. The manner of his death was as follows: By order of the most nobleCount of Soisic, the traitor was first branded upon the forehead with the brandof an arrowhead. The iron burned through the flesh and was pressed heavily sothat the brand should even burn into the bone of the skull. The traitor was thenled out and bidden to kneel. He admitted having guided the English from theisland of Groix. Although a priest and a Frenchman, he had violated his priestlyoffice to aid him in discovering the password to the fort. This password heextorted during confession from a young Breton girl who was in the habit ofrowing across from the island of Groix to visit her husband in the fort. Whenthe fort fell, this young girl, crazed by the death of her husband, sought theCount of Soisic and told how the priest had forced her to confess to him all sheknew about the fort. The priest was arrested at St. Gildas as he was about tocross the river to Lorient. When arrested he cursed the girl, Marie Trevec—”“What!” I exclaimed, “Marie Trevec!”“Marie Trevec,” repeated Le Bihan; “the priest cursed Marie Trevec, and all herfamily and descendants. He was shot as he knelt, having a mask of leather overhis face, because the Bretons who composed the squad of execution refused tofire at a priest unless his face was concealed. The priest was l'Abbé Sorgue,commonly known as the Black Priest on account of his dark face and swarthyeyebrows. He was buried with a stake through his heart.”Le Bihan paused, hesitated, looked at me, and handed the manuscript back toDurand. The gendarme took it and slipped it into the brass cylinder.“So,” said I, “the thirty-ninth skull is the skull of the Black Priest.”“Yes,” said Fortin. “I hope they won't find it.”“I have forbidden them to proceed,” said the mayor querulously. “You heard me,Max Fortin.”I rose and picked up my gun. Môme came and pushed his head into my hand.“That's a fine dog,” observed Durand, also rising.“Why don't you wish to find his skull?” I asked Le Bihan. “It would be curiousto see whether the arrow brand really burned into the bone.”“There is something in that scroll that I didn't read to you,” said the mayorgrimly. “Do you wish to know what it is?”“Of course,” I replied in surprise.“Give me the scroll again, Durand,” he said; then he read from the bottom: “I,l'Abbé Sorgue, forced to write the above by my executioners, have written it inmy own blood; and with it I leave my curse. My curse on St. Gildas, on MarieTrevec, and on her descendants. I will come back to St. Gildas when my remainsare disturbed. Woe to that Englishman whom my branded skull shall touch!”“What rot!” I said. “Do you believe it was really written in his own blood?”“I am going to test it,” said Fortin, “at the request of Monsieur le Maire. I amnot anxious for the job, however.”“See,” said Le Bihan, holding out the scroll to me, “it is signed, ‘L'AbbéSorgue.’“I glanced curiously over the paper.“It must be the Black Priest,” I said. “He was the only man who wrote in theBreton language. This is a wonderfully interesting discovery, for now, at last,the mystery of the Black Priest's disappearance is cleared up. You will, ofcourse, send this scroll to Paris, Le Bihan?”“No,” said the mayor obstinately, “it shall be buried in the pit below where therest of the Black Priest lies.”I looked at him and recognized that argument would be useless. But still I said,“It will be a loss to history, Monsieur Le Bihan.”“All the worse for history, then,” said the enlightened Mayor of St. Gildas.We had sauntered back to the gravel pit while speaking. The men of Bannalec werecarrying the bones of the English soldiers toward the St. Gildas cemetery, onthe cliffs to the east, where already a knot of white-coiffed women stood inattitudes of prayer; and I saw the somber robe of a priest among the crosses ofthe little graveyard.“They were thieves and assassins; they are dead now,” muttered Max Fortin.“Respect the dead,” repeated the Mayor of St. Gildas, looking after the Bannalecmen.“It was written in that scroll that Marie Trevec, of Groix Island, was cursed bythe priest—she and her descendants,” I said, touching Le Bihan on the arm.“There was a Marie Trevec who married an Yves Trevec of St. Gildas—”“It is the same,” said Le Bihan, looking at me obliquely.“Oh!” said I; “then they were ancestors of my wife.”“Do you fear the curse?” asked Le Bihan.“What?” I laughed.“There was the case of the Purple Emperor,” said Max Fortin timidly.Startled for a moment, I faced him, then shrugged my shoulders and kicked at asmooth bit of rock which lay near the edge of the pit, almost embedded ingravel.“Do you suppose the Purple-Emperor drank himself crazy because he was descendedfrom Marie Trevec?” I asked contemptuously.“Of course not,” said Max Fortin hastily.“Of course not,” piped the mayor. “I only—Hellow! what's that you're kicking?”“What?” said I, glancing down, at the same time involuntarily giving anotherkick. The smooth bit of rock dislodged itself and rolled out of the loosenedgravel at my feet.“The thirty-ninth skull!” I exclaimed. “By jingo, it's the noddle of the BlackPriest! See! there is the arrowhead branded on the front!”The mayor stepped back. Max Fortin also retreated. There was a pause, duringwhich I looked at them, and they looked anywhere but at me.“I don't like it,” said the mayor at last, in a husky, high voice. “I don't likeit! The scroll says he will come back to St. Gildas when his remains aredisturbed. I—I don't like it, Monsieur Darrel—”“Bosh!” said I; “the poor wicked devil is where he can't get out. For Heaven'ssake, Le Bihan, what is this stuff you are talking in the year of grace 1896?”The mayor gave me a look.“And he says ‘Englishman.’ You are an Englishman, Monsieur Darrel,” heannounced.“You know better. You know I'm an American.”“It's all the same,” said the Mayor of St. Gildas, obstinately.“No, it isn't!” I answered, much exasperated, and deliberately pushed the skulltill it rolled into the bottom of the gravel pit below.“Cover it up,” said I; “bury the scroll with it too, if you insist, but I thinkyou ought to send it to Paris. Don't look so gloomy, Fortin, unless you believein werewolves and ghosts. Hey! what the—what the devil's the matter with you,anyway? What are you staring at, Le Bihan?”“Come, come,” muttered the mayor in a low, tremulous voice, “it's time we gotout of this. Did you see? Did you see, Fortin?”“I saw,” whispered Max Fortin, pallid with fright.The two men were almost running across the sunny pasture now, and I hastenedafter them, demanding to know what was the matter.“Matter!” chattered the mayor, gasping with exasperation and terror. “The skullis rolling up hill again,” and he burst into a terrified gallop, Max Fortinfollowed close behind.I watched them stampeding across the pasture, then turned toward the gravel pit,mystified, incredulous. The skull was lying on the edge of the pit, exactlywhere it had been before I pushed it over the edge. For a second I stared at it;a singular chilly feeling crept up my spinal column, and I turned and walkedaway, sweat starting from the root of every hair on my head. Before I had gonetwenty paces the absurdity of the whole thing struck me. I halted, hot withshame and annoyance, and retraced my steps.There lay the skull.“I rolled a stone down instead of the skull,” I muttered to myself. Then withthe butt of my gun I pushed the skull over the edge of the pit and watched itroll to the bottom; and as it struck the bottom of the pit, Môme, my dog,suddenly whipped his tail between his legs, whimpered, and made off across themoor.“Môme!” I shouted, angry and astonished; but the dog only fled the faster, and Iceased calling from sheer surprise.“What the mischief is the matter with that dog!” I thought. He had never beforeplayed me such a trick.Mechanically I glanced into the pit, but I could not see the skull. I lookeddown. The skull lay at my feet again, touching them.“Good heavens!” I stammered, and struck at it blindly with my gunstock. Theghastly thing flew into the air, whirling over and over, and rolled again downthe sides of the pit to the bottom. Breathlessly I stared at it, then, confusedand scarcely comprehending, I stepped back from the pit, still facing it, one,ten, twenty paces, my eyes almost starting from my head, as though I expected tosee the thing roll up from the bottom of the pit under my very gaze. At last Iturned my back to the pit and strode out across the gorse-covered moorlandtoward my home. As I reached the road that winds from St. Gildas to St. Julien Igave one hasty glance at the pit over my shoulder. The sun shone hot on the sodabout the excavation. There was something white and bare and round on the turfat the edge of the pit. It might have been a stone; there were plenty of themlying about.IIWhen I entered my garden I saw Môme sprawling on the stone door-step. He eyed mesideways and flopped his tail.“Are you not mortified, you idiot dog?” I said, looking about the upper windowsfor Lys.Môme rolled over on his back and raised one deprecating forepaw, as though toward off calamity.“Don't act as though I was in the habit of beating you to death,” I said,disgusted. I had never in my life raised whip to the brute. “But you are a fooldog,” I continued. “No, you needn't come to be babied and wept over; Lys can dothat, if she insists, but I am ashamed of you, and you can go to the devil.”Môme slunk off into the house, and I followed, mounting directly to my wife'sboudoir. It was empty.“Where has she gone?” I said, looking hard at Môme, who had followed me. “Oh! Isee you don't know. Don't pretend you do. Come off that lounge! Do you think Lyswants tan-colored hairs all over her lounge?”I rang the bell for Catherine and Fine, but they didn't know where “madame” hadgone; so I went into my room, bathed, exchanged my somewhat grimy shootingclothes for a suit of warm, soft knicker-bockers, and, after lingering someextra moments over my toilet—for I was particular, now that I had married Lys—Iwent down to the garden and took a chair out under the fig-trees.“Where can she be?” I wondered, Môme came sneaking out to be comforted, and Iforgave him for Lys's sake, whereupon he frisked.“You bounding cur,” said I, “now what on earth started you off across the moor?If you do it again I'll push you along with a charge of dust shot.”As yet I had scarcely dared think about the ghastly hallucination of which I hadbeen a victim, but now I faced it squarely, flushing a little with mortificationat the thought of my hasty retreat from the gravel pit.“To think,” I said aloud, “that those old woman's tales of Max Fortin and LeBihan should have actually made me see what didn't exist at all! I lost my nervelike a schoolboy in a dark bedroom.” For I knew now that I had mistaken a roundstone for a skull each time, and had pushed a couple of big pebbles into the pitinstead of the skull itself.“By jingo!” said I, “I'm nervous; my liver must be in a devil of a condition ifI see such things when I'm awake! Lys will know what to give me.”I felt mortified and irritated and sulky, and thought disgustedly of Le Bihanand Max Fortin.But after a while I ceased speculating, dismissed the mayor, the chemist, andthe skull from my mind, and smoked pensively, watching the sun low dipping inthe western ocean. As the twilight fell for a moment over ocean and moorland, awistful, restless happiness filled my heart, the happiness that all men know—allmen who have loved.Slowly the purple mist crept out over the sea; the cliffs darkened; the forestwas shrouded.Suddenly the sky above burned with the afterglow, and the world was alightagain.Cloud after cloud caught the rose dye; the cliffs were tinted with it; moor andpasture, heather and forest burned and pulsated with the gentle flush. I saw thegulls turning and tossing above the sand bar, their snowy wings tipped withpink; I saw the sea swallows sheering the surface of the still river, stained toits placid depths with warm reflections of the clouds. The twitter of drowsyhedge birds broke out in the stillness; a salmon rolled its shining side abovetidewater.The interminable monotone of the ocean intensified the silence. I satmotionless, holding my breath as one who listens to the first low rumor of anorgan. All at once the pure whistle of a nightingale cut the silence, and thefirst moonbeam silvered the wastes of mist-hung waters.I raised my head.Lys stood before me in the garden.When we had kissed each other, we linked arms and moved up and down the gravelwalks, watching the moonbeams sparkle on the sand bar as the tide ebbed andebbed. The broad beds of white pinks about us were atremble with hovering whitemoths; the October roses hung all abloom, perfuming the salt wind.“Sweetheart,” I said, “where is Yvonne? Has she promised to spend Christmas withus?”“Yes, Dick; she drove me down from Plougat this afternoon. She sent her love toyou. I am not jealous. What did you shoot?”“A hare and four partridges. They are in the gun room. I told Catherine not totouch them until you had seen them.”Now I suppose I knew that Lys could not be particularly enthusiastic over gameor guns; but she pretended she was, and always scornfully denied that it was formy sake and not for the pure love of sport. So she dragged me off to inspect therather meager game bag, and she paid me pretty compliments, and gave a littlecry of delight and pity as I lifted the enormous hare out of the sack by hisears.“He'll eat no more of our lettuce,” I said attempting to justify theassassination.“Unhappy little bunny—and what a beauty! O Dick, you are a splendid shot, areyou not?”I evaded the question and hauled out a partridge.“Poor little dead things'” said Lys in a whisper; “it seems a pity—doesn't it,Dick? But then you are so clever—”“We'll have them broiled,” I said guardedly, “tell Catherine.”Catherine came in to take away the game, and presently ‘Fine Lelocard, Lys'smaid, announced dinner, and Lys tripped away to her boudoir.I stood an instant contemplating her blissfully, thinking, “My boy, you're thehappiest fellow in the world—you're in love with your wife”I walked into the dining-room, beamed at the plates, walked out again; metTregunc in the hallway, beamed on him; glanced into the kitchen, beamed atCatherine, and went up stairs, still beaming.Before I could knock at Lys's door it opened, and Lys came hastily out. When shesaw me she gave a little cry of relief, and nestled close to my breast.“There is something peering in at my window,” she said.“What!” I cried angrily.“A man, I think, disguised as a priest, and he has a mask on. He must haveclimbed up by the bay tree.”I was down the stairs and out of doors in no time. The moonlit garden wasabsolutely deserted. Tregunc came up, and together we searched the hedge andshrubbery around the house and out to the road.“Jean Marie,” said I at length, “loose my bulldog—he knows you—and take yoursupper on the porch where you can watch. My wife says the fellow is disguised asa priest, and wears a mask.”Tregunc showed his white teeth in a smile. “He will not care to venture in hereagain, I think, Monsieur Darrel.”I went back and found Lys seated quietly at the table.“The soup is ready, dear,” she said. “Don't worry; it was only some foolish loutfrom Bannalec. No one in St. Gildas or St. Julien would do such a thing.”I was too much exasperated to reply at first, but Lys treated it as a stupidjoke, and after a while I began to look at it in that light.Lys told me about Yvonne, and reminded me of my promise to have Herbert Stuartdown to meet her.“You wicked diplomat!” I protested. “Herbert is in Paris, and hard at work forthe Salon.”“Don't you think he might spare a week to flirt with the prettiest girl inFinistere?” inquired Lys innocently.“Prettiest girl! Not much!” I said.“Who is, then?” urged Lys.I laughed a trifle sheepishly.“I suppose you mean me, Dick,” said Lys, coloring up.“Now I bore you, don't I?”“Bore me? Ah, no, Dick.”After coffee and cigarettes were served I spoke about Tregunc, and Lys approved.“Poor Jean! He will be glad, won't he? What a dear fellow you are!”“Nonsense,” said I; “we need a gardener; you said so yourself, Lys.”But Lys leaned over and kissed me, and then bent down and hugged Môme—whowhistled through his nose in sentimental appreciation.“I am a very happy woman,” said Lys.“Môme was a very bad dog to-day,” I observed.“Poor Môme!” said Lys, smiling.When dinner was over and Môme lay snoring before the blaze—for the Octobernights are often chilly in Finistere—Lys curled up in the chimney corner withher embroidery, and gave me a swift glance from under her dropping lashes.“You look like a schoolgirl, Lys,” I said teasingly. “I don't believe you aresixteen yet.”She pushed back her heavy burnished hair thoughtfully. Her wrist was as white assurf foam.“Have we been married four years? I don't believe it,” I said.She gave me another swift glance and touched the embroidery on her knee, smilingfaintly.“I see,” said I, also smiling at the embroidered garment. “Do you think it willfit?”“Fit?” repeated Lys. Then she laughed“And,” I persisted, “are you perfectly sure that you—er—we shall need it?”“Perfectly,” said Lys. A delicate color touched her cheeks and neck. She held upthe little garment, all fluffy with misty lace and wrought with quaintembroidery.“It is very gorgeous,” said I; “don't use your eyes too much, dearest. May Ismoke a pipe?”“Of course,” she said selecting a skein of pale blue silk.For a while I sat and smoked in silence, watching her slender fingers among thetinted silks and thread of gold.Presently she spoke: “What did you say your crest is, Dick?”“My crest? Oh, something or other rampant on a something or other—”“Dick!”“Dearest?”“Don't be flippant.”“But I really forget. It's an ordinary crest; everybody in New York has them. Nofamily should be without ‘em.”“You are disagreeable, Dick. Send Josephine upstairs for my album.”“Are you going to put that crest on the—the—whatever it is?”“I am; and my own crest, too.”I thought of the Purple Emperor and wondered a little.“You didn't know I had one, did you?” she smiled.“What is it?” I replied evasively.“You shall see. Ring for Josephine.”I rang, and, when ‘Fine appeared, Lys gave her some orders in a low voice, andJosephine trotted away, bobbing her white-coiffed head with a “Bien, Madame!”After a few minutes she returned, bearing a tattered, musty volume, from whichthe gold and blue had mostly disappeared.I took the book in my hands and examined the ancient emblazoned covers.“Lilies!” I exclaimed.“Fleur-de-lis,” said my wife demurely.“Oh!” said I, astonished, and opened the book.“You have never before seen this book?” asked Lys, with a touch of malice in hereyes.“You know I haven't. Hello! What's this? Oho! So there should be a de beforeTrevec? Lys de Trevec? Then why in the world did the Purple Emperor—”“Dick!” cried Lys.“All right,” said I. “Shall I read about the Sieur de Trevec who rode toSaladin's tent alone to seek for medicine for St. Louise? Or shall I readabout—what is it? Oh, here it is, all down in black and white—about the Marquisde Trevec who drowned himself before Alva's eyes rather than surrender thebanner of the fleur-de-lis to Spain? It's all written here. But, dear, how aboutthat soldier named Trevec who was killed in the old fort on the cliff yonder?”“He dropped the de, and the Trevecs since then have been Republicans,” saidLys—”all except me.”“That's quite right,” said I; “it is time that we Republicans should agree uponsome feudal system. My dear, I drink to the king!” and I raised my wine glassand looked at Lys.“To the king,” said Lys, flushing. She smoothed out the tiny garment on herknees; she touched the glass with her lips; her eyes were very sweet. I drainedthe glass to the king.After a silence I said: “I will tell the king stories. His majesty shall beamused.”“His majesty,” repeated Lys softly.“Or hers,” I laughed. “Who knows?”“Who knows?” murmured Lys; with a gentle sigh.“I know some stories about Jack the Giant-Killer,” I announced. “Do you, Lys?”“I? No, not about a giant-killer, but I know all about the werewolf, andJeanne-la-Flamme, and the Man in Purple Tatters, and—O dear me, I know lotsmore.”“You are very wise,” said I. “I shall teach his majesty, English.”“And I Breton,” cried Lys jealously.“I shall bring playthings to the king,” said I—”big green lizards from thegorse, little gray mullets to swim in glass globes, baby rabbits from the forestof Kerselec—”“And I,” said Lys, “will bring the first primrose, the first branch of aubepine,the first jonquil, to the king—my king.”“Our king,” said I; and there was peace in Finistere.I lay back, idly turning the leaves of the curious old volume.“I am looking,” said I, “for the crest.”“The crest, dear? It is a priest's head with an arrow-shaped mark on theforehead, on a field—”I sat up and stared at my wife.“Dick, whatever is the matter?” she smiled. “The story is there in that book. Doyou care to read it? No? Shall I tell it to you? Well, then: It happened in thethird crusade. There was a monk whom men called the Black Priest. He turnedapostate, and sold himself to the enemies of Christ. A Sieur de Trevec burstinto the Saracen camp, at the head of only one hundred lances, and carried theBlack Priest away out of the very midst of their army.”“So that is how you come by the crest,” I said quietly; but I thought of thebranded skull in the gravel pit, and wondered.“Yes,” said Lys. “The Sieur de Trevec cut the Black Priest's head off, but firsthe branded him with an arrow mark on the forehead. The book says it was a piousaction, and the Sieur de Trevec got great merit by it. But I think it was cruel,the branding,” she sighed.“Did you ever hear of any other Black Priest?”“Yes. There was one in the last century, here in St. Gildas. He cast a whiteshadow in the sun. He wrote in the Breton language. Chronicles, too, I believe.I never saw them. His name was the same as that of the old chronicler, and ofthe other priest, Jacques Sorgue. Some said he was a lineal descendant of thetraitor. Of course the first Black Priest was bad enough for anything. But if hedid have a child, it need not have been the ancestor of the last Jacques Sorgue.They say he was so good he was not allowed to die, but was caught up to heavenone day,” added Lys, with believing eyes.I smiled.“But he disappeared,” persisted Lys.“I'm afraid his journey was in another direction,” I said jestingly, andthoughtlessly told her the story of the morning. I had utterly forgotten themasked man at her window, but before I finished I remembered him fast enough,and realized what I had done as I saw her face whiten.“Lys,” I urged tenderly, “that was only some clumsy clown's trick. You said soyourself. You are not superstitious, my dear?”Her eyes were on mine. She slowly drew the little gold cross from her bosom andkissed it. But her lips trembled as they pressed the symbol of faith.IIIAbout nine o'clock the next morning I walked into the Groix Inn and sat down atthe long discolored oaken table, nodding good-day to Marianne Bruyere, who inturn bobbed her white coiffe at me.“My clever Bannalec maid,” said I, “what is good for a stirrup-cup at the GroixInn?”“Schist?” she inquired in Breton.“With a dash of red wine, then,” I replied.She brought the delicious Quimperle cider, and I poured a little Bordeaux intoit. Marianne watched me with laughing black eyes.“What makes your cheeks so red, Marianne?” I asked. “Has Jean Marie been here?”“We are to be married, Monsieur Darrel,” she laughed.“Ah! Since when has Jean Marie Tregunc lost his head?”“His head? Oh, Monsieur Darrel—his heart, you mean!”“So I do,” said I. “Jean Marie is a practical fellow.”“It is all due to your kindness—” began the girl, but I raised my hand and heldup the glass.“It's due to himself. To your happiness, Marianne”; and I took a hearty draughtof the schist. “Now,” said I, “tell me where I can find Le Bihan and MaxFortin.”“Monsieur Le Bihan and Monsieur Fortin are above in the broad room. I believethey are examining the Red Admiral's effects.”“To send them to Paris? Oh, I know. May I go up, Marianne?”“And God go with you,” smiled the girl.When I knocked at the door of the broad room above little Max Fortin opened it.Dust covered his spectacles and nose; his hat, with the tiny velvet ribbonsfluttering, was all awry.“Come in, Monsieur Darrel,” he said; “the mayor and I are packing up the effectsof the Purple Emperor and of the poor Red Admiral.”“The collections?” I asked, entering the room. “You must be very careful inpacking those butterfly cases; the slightest jar might break wings and antennas,you know.”Le Bihan shook hands with me and pointed to the great pile of boxes.“They're all cork lined,” he said, “but Fortin and I are putting felt aroundeach box. The Entomological Society of Paris pays the freight.”The combined collection of the Red Admiral and the Purple Emperor made amagnificent display.I lifted and inspected case after case set with gorgeous butterflies and moths,each specimen carefully labelled with the name in Latin. There were cases filledwith crimson tiger moths all aflame with color; cases devoted to the commonyellow butterflies; symphonies in orange and pale yellow; cases of soft gray anddun-colored sphinx moths; and cases of grayish nettle-bed butterflies of thenumerous family of Vanessa.All alone in a great case by itself was pinned the purple emperor, the ApaturaIris, that fatal specimen that had given the Purple Emperor his name andquietus.I remembered the butterfly, and stood looking at it with bent eyebrows.Le Bihan glanced up from the floor where he was nailing down the lid of a boxfull of cases.“It is settled, then,” said he, “that madame, your wife, gives the PurpleEmperor's entire Collection to the city of Paris?”I nodded.“Without accepting anything for it?”“It is a gift,” I said.“Including the purple emperor there in the case? That butterfly is worth a greatdeal of money,” persisted Le Bihan.“You don't suppose that we would wish to sell that specimen, do you?” I answereda trifle sharply.“If I were you I should destroy it,” said the mayor in his high-pitched voice.“That would be nonsense,” said I, “like your burying the brass cylinder andscroll yesterday.”“It was not nonsense,” said Le Bihan doggedly, “and I should prefer not todiscuss the subject of the scroll.”I looked at Max Portin, who immediately avoided my eyes.“You are a pair of superstitious old women,” said I, digging my hands into mypockets; “you swallow every nursery tale that is invented.”“What of it?” said Le Bihan sulkily; “there's more truth than lies in most of‘em.”“Oh!” I sneered, “does the Mayor of St. Gildas and St. Julien believe in theloup-garou?”“No, not in the loup-garou.”“In what, then—Jeanne-la-Flamme?”“That,” said Le Bihan with conviction, “is history.”“The devil it is!” said I; “and perhaps, Monsieur the mayor, your faith ingiants is unimpaired?”“There were giants—everybody knows it,” growled Max Fortin. “And you a chemist!”I observed scornfully.“Listen, Monsieur Darrel,” squeaked Le Bihan; “you know yourself that the PurpleEmperor was a scientific man. Now suppose I should tell you that he alwaysrefused to include in his collection a Death's Messenger?”“A what?” I exclaimed.“You know what I mean—that moth that flies by night; some call it the Death'sHead, but in St. Gildas we call it ‘Death's Messenger.’” “Oh!” said I, “you meanthat big sphinx moth that is commonly known as the ‘death's-head moth.’ Why themischief should the people here call it death's messenger?”“For hundreds of years it has been known as death's messenger in St. Gildas,”said Max Fortin. “Even Froissart speaks of it in his commentaries on JacquesSorgue's Chronicles. The book is in your library.”“Sorgue? And who was Jacques Sorgue? I never read his book.”“Jacques Sorgue was the son of some unfrocked priest—I forget. It was during thecrusades.”“Good Heavens!” I burst out, “I've been hearing of nothing but crusades andpriests and death and sorcery ever since I kicked that skull into the gravelpit, and I am tired of it, I tell you frankly. One would think we lived in thedark ages. Do you know what year of our Lord it is, Le Bihan?”“Eighteen hundred and ninety-six,” replied the mayor.“And yet you two hulking men are afraid of a death's-head moth.”“I don't care to have one fly into the window,” said Max Fortin; “it means evilto the house and the people in it.”“God alone knows why he marked one of his creatures with a yellow death's headon the back,” observed Le Bihan piously, “but I take it that he meant it as awarning; and I propose to profit by it,” he added triumphantly.“See here, Le Bihan,” I said; “by a stretch of imagination one can make out askull on the thorax of a certain big sphinx moth. What of it?”“It is a bad thing to touch,” said the mayor wagging his head.“It squeaks when handled,” added Max Fortin.“Some creatures squeak all the time,” I observed, looking hard at Le Bihan.“Pigs,” added the mayor.“Yes, and asses,” I replied. “Listen, Le Bihan: do you mean to tell me that yousaw that skull roll uphill yesterday?”The mayor shut his mouth tightly and picked up his hammer.“Don't be obstinate,” I said; “I asked you a question.”“And I refuse to answer,” snapped Le Bihan. “Fortin saw what I saw; let him talkabout it.”I looked searchingly at the little chemist.“I don't say that I saw it actually roll up out of the pit, all by itself,” saidFortin with a shiver, “but—but then, how did it come up out of the pit, if itdidn't roll up all by itself?”“It didn't come up at all; that was a yellow cobblestone that you mistook forthe skull again,” I replied. “You were nervous, Max.”“A—a very curious cobblestone, Monsieur Darrel,” said Fortin.“I also was a victim to the same hallucination,” I continued, “and I regret tosay that I took the trouble to roll two innocent cobblestones into the gravelpit, imagining each time that it was the skull I was rolling.”“It was,” observed Le Bihan with a morose shrug.“It just shows,” said I, ignoring the mayor's remark, “how easy it is to fix upa train of coincidences so that the result seems to savor of the supernatural.Now, last night my wife imagined that she saw a priest in a mask peer in at herwindow—”Fortin and Le Bihan scrambled hastily from their knees, dropping hammer andnails.“W-h-a-t—what's that?” demanded the mayor.I repeated what I had said. Max Fortin turned livid.“My God!” muttered Le Bihan, “the Black Priest is in St. Gildas!”“D-don't you—you know the old prophecy?” stammered Fortin; “Froissart quotes itfrom Jacques Sorgue:When the Black Priest rises from the dead,St. Gildas folk shall shriek in bed;When the Black Priest rises from his grave,May the good God St. Gildas save!“Aristide Le Bihan,” I said angrily, “and you, Max Fortin, I've got enough ofthis nonsense! Some foolish lout from Bannalec has been in St. Gildas playingtricks to frighten old fools like you. If you have nothing better to talk aboutthan nursery legends I'll wait until you come to your senses. Good-morning.” AndI walked out, more disturbed than I cared to acknowledge to myself.The day had become misty and overcast. Heavy, wet clouds hung in the east. Iheard the surf thundering against the cliffs, and the gray gulls squealed asthey tossed and turned high in the sky. The tide was creeping across the riversands, higher, higher, and I saw the seaweed floating on the beach, and thelancons springing from the foam, silvery threadlike flashes in the gloom. Curlewwere flying up the river in twos and threes; the timid sea swallows skimmedacross the moors toward some quiet, lonely pool, safe from the coming tempest.In every hedge field birds were gathering, huddling together, twitteringrestlessly.When I reached the cliffs I sat down, resting my chin on my clenched hands.Already a vast curtain of rain, sweeping across the ocean miles away, hid theisland of Groix. To the east, behind the white semaphore on the hills, blackclouds crowded up over the horizon. After a little the thunder boomed, dull,distant, and slender skeins of lightning unraveled across the crest of thecoming storm. Under the cliff at my feet the surf rushed foaming over the shore,and the lancons jumped and skipped and quivered until they seemed to be but thereflections of the meshed lightning.I turned to the east. It was raining over Groix, it was raining at Sainte Barbe,it was raining now at the semaphore. High in the storm whirl a few gullspitched; a nearer cloud trailed veils of rain in its wake; the sky was spatteredwith lightning; the thunder boomed.As I rose to go, a cold raindrop fell upon the back of my hand, and another, andyet another on my face. I gave a last glance at the sea, where the waves werebursting into strange white shapes that seemed to fling out menacing arms towardme. Then something moved on the cliff, something black as the black rock itclutched—a filthy cormorant, craning its hideous head at the sky.Slowly I plodded homeward across the somber moorland, where the gorse stemsglimmered with a dull metallic green, and the heather, no longer violet andpurple, hung drenched and dun-colored among the dreary rocks. The wet turfcreaked under my heavy boots, the black-thorn scraped and grated against kneeand elbow. Over all lay a strange light, pallid, ghastly, where the sea spraywhirled across the landscape and drove into my face until it grew numb with thecold. In broad bands, rank after rank, billow on billow, the rain burst outacross the endless moors, and yet there was no wind to drive it at such a pace.Lys stood at the door as I turned into the garden, motioning me to hasten; andthen for the first time I became conscious that I was soaked to the skin.“However in the world did you come to stay out when such a storm threatened?”she said. “Oh, you are dripping! Go quickly and change; I have laid your warmunderwear on the bed, Dick.”I kissed my wife, and went upstairs to change my dripping clothes for somethingmore comfortable.When I returned to the morning room there was a driftwood fire on the hearth,and Lys sat in the chimney corner embroidering.“Catherine tells me that the fishing fleet from Lorient is out. Do you thinkthey are in danger, dear?” asked Lys, raising her blue eyes to mine as Ientered.“There is no wind, and there will be no sea,” said I, looking out of the window.Far across the moor I could see the black cliffs looming in the mist.“How it rains!” murmured Lys; “come to the fire, Dick.”I threw myself on the fur rug, my hands in my pockets, my head on Lys's knees.“Tell me a story,” I said. “I feel like a boy of ten.”Lys raised a finger to her scarlet lips. I always waited for her to do that.“Will you be very still, then?” she said.“Still as death.”“Death,” echoed a voice, very softly.“Did you speak, Lys?” I asked, turning so that I could see her face.“No; did you, Dick?”“Who said ‘death’?” I asked, startled.“Death,” echoed a voice, softly.I sprang up and looked about. Lys rose too, her needles and embroidery fallingto the floor. She seemed about to faint, leaning heavily on me, and I led her tothe window and opened it a little way to give her air. As I did so the chainlightning split the zenith, the thunder crashed, and a sheet of rain swept intothe room, driving with it something that fluttered—something that flapped, andsqueaked, and beat upon the rug with soft, moist wings.We bent over it together, Lys clinging to me, and we saw that it was adeath's-head moth drenched with rain.The dark day passed slowly as we sat beside the fire, hand in hand, her headagainst my breast, speaking of sorrow and mystery and death. For Lys believedthat there were things on earth that none might understand, things that must benameless forever and ever, until God rolls up the scroll of life and all isended. We spoke of hope and fear and faith, and the mystery of the saints; wespoke of the beginning and the end, of the shadow of sin, of omens, and of love.The moth still lay on the floor quivering its somber wings in the warmth of thefire, the skull and ribs clearly etched upon its neck and body.“If it is a messenger of death to this house,” I said, “why should we fear,Lys?”“Death should be welcome to those who love God,” murmured Lys, and she drew thecross from her breast and kissed it.“The moth might die if I threw it out into the storm,” I said after a silence.“Let it remain,” sighed Lys.Late that night my wife lay sleeping, and I sat beside her bed and read in theChronicle of Jacques Sorgue. I shaded the candle, but Lys grew restless, andfinally I took the book down into the morning room, where the ashes of the firerustled and whitened on the hearth.The death's-head moth lay on the rug before the fire where I had left it. Atfirst I thought it was dead, but when I looked closer I saw a lambent fire inits amber eyes. The straight white shadow it cast across the floor wavered asthe candle flickered.The pages of the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue were damp and sticky; theilluminated gold and blue initials left flakes of azure and gilt where my handbrushed them.“It is not paper at all; it is thin parchment,” I said to myself; and I held thediscolored page close to the candle flame and read, translating laboriously:“I, Jacques Sorgue, saw all these things. And I saw the Black Mass celebrated inthe chapel of St. Gildas-on-the-Cliff. And it was said by the Abbé Sorgue, mykinsman: for which deadly sin the apostate priest was seized by the most nobleMarquis of Plougastel and by him condemned to be burned with hot irons, untilhis seared soul quit its body and fly to its master the devil. But when theBlack Priest lay in the crypt of Plougastel, his master Satan came at night andset him free, and carried him across land and sea to Mahmoud, which is Soldan orSaladin. And I, Jacques Sorgue, traveling afterward by sea, beheld with my owneyes my kinsman, the Black Priest of St. Gildas, borne along in the air upon avast black wing, which was the wing of his master Satan. And this was seen alsoby two men of the crew.”I turned the page. The wings of the moth on the floor began to quiver. I read onand on, my eyes blurring under the shifting candle flame. I read of battles andof saints, and I learned how the Great Soldan made his pact with Satan, and thenI came to the Sieur de Trevec, and read how he seized the Black Priest in themidst of Saladin's tents and carried him away and cut off his head firstbranding him on the forehead. “And before he suffered,” said the Chronicle, “hecursed the Sieur de Trevec and his descendants, and he said he would surelyreturn to St. Gildas. ‘For the violence you do to me, I will do violence to you.For the evil I suffer at your hands, I will work evil on you and yourdescendants. Woe to your children, Sieur de Trevec!’” There was a whirr, abeating of strong wings, and my candle flashed up as in a sudden breeze. Ahumming filled the room; the great moth darted hither and thither, beating,buzzing, on ceiling and wall. I flung down my book and stepped forward. Now itlay fluttering upon the window sill, and for a moment I had it under my hand,but the thing squeaked and I shrank back. Then suddenly it darted across thecandle flame; the light flared and went out, and at the same moment a shadowmoved in the darkness outside. I raised my eyes to the window. A masked face waspeering in at me.Quick as thought I whipped out my revolver and fired every cartridge, but theface advanced beyond the window, the glass melting away before it like mist, andthrough the smoke of my revolver I saw something creep swiftly into the room.Then I tried to cry out, but the thing was at my throat, and I fell backwardamong the ashes of the hearth.When my eyes unclosed I was lying on the hearth, my head among the cold ashes.Slowly I got on my knees, rose painfully, and groped my way to a chair. On thefloor lay my revolver, shining in the pale light of early morning. My mindclearing by degrees, I looked, shuddering, at the window. The glass wasunbroken. I stooped stiffly, picked up my revolver and opened the cylinder.Every cartridge had been fired. Mechanically I closed the cylinder and placedthe revolver in my pocket. The book, the Chronicles of Jacques Sorgue, lay onthe table beside me, and as I started to close it I glanced at the page. It wasall splashed with rain, and the lettering had run, so that the page was merely aconfused blur of gold and red and black. As I stumbled toward the door I cast afearful glance over my shoulder. The death's-head moth crawled shivering on therug.IVThe sun was about three hours high. I must have slept, for I was aroused by thesudden gallop of horses under our window. People were shouting and calling inthe road. I sprang up and opened the sash. Le Bihan was there, an image ofhelplessness, and Max Fortin stood beside him polishing his glasses. Somegendarmes had just arrived from Quimperle, and I could hear them around thecorner of the house, stamping, and rattling their sabres and carbines, as theyled their horses into my stable.Lys sat up, murmuring half-sleepy, half-anxious questions.“I don't know,” I answered. “I am going out to see what it means.”“It is like the day they came to arrest you,” Lys said, giving me a troubledlook. But I kissed her and laughed at her until she smiled too. Then I flung oncoat and cap and hurried down the stairs.The first person I saw standing in the road was the Brigadier Durand.“Hello!” said I, “have you come to arrest me again? What the devil is all thisfuss about, anyway?”“We were telegraphed for an hour ago,” said Durand briskly, “and for asufficient reason, I think. Look there, Monsieur Darrel!”He pointed to the ground almost under my feet.“Good heavens!” I cried, “where did that puddle of blood come from?”“That's what I want to know, Monsieur Darrel. Max Fortin found it at daybreak.See, it's splashed all over the grass, too. A trail of it leads into yourgarden, across the flower beds to your very window, the one that opens from themorning room. There is another trail leading from this spot across the road tothe cliffs, then to the gravel pit, and thence across the moor to the forest ofKerselec. We are going to mount in a minute and search the bosquets. Will youjoin us? Bon Dieu! but the fellow bled like an ox. Max Fortin says it's humanblood, or I should not have believed it.”The little chemist of Quimperle came up at that moment, rubbing his glasses witha colored handkerchief.“Yes, it is human blood,” he said, “but one thing puzzles me: the corpuscles areyellow. I never saw any human blood before with yellow corpuscles. But yourEnglish Doctor Thompson asserts that he has—”“Well, it's human blood, anyway—isn't it?” insisted Durand, impatiently.“Ye-es,” admitted Max Fortin.“Then it's my business to trail it,” said the big gendarme, and he called hismen and gave the order to mount.“Did you hear anything last night?” asked Durand of me.“I heard the rain. I wonder the rain did not wash away these traces.”“They must have come after the rain ceased. See this thick splash, how it liesover and weighs down the wet grass blades. Pah!”It was a heavy, evil-looking clot, and I stepped back from it, my throat closingin disgust.“My theory,” said the brigadier, “is this: Some of those Biribi fishermen,probably the Icelanders, got an extra glass of cognac into their hides andquarreled on the road. Some of them were slashed, and staggered to your house.But there is only one trail, and yet—and yet, how could all that blood come fromonly one person? Well, the wounded man, let us say, staggered first to yourhouse and then back here, and he wandered off, drunk and dying, God knows where.That's my theory.”“A very good one,” said I calmly. “And you are going to trail him?”“Yes.”“When?”“At once. Will you come?”“Not now. I'll gallop over by-and-bye. You are going to the edge of the Kerselecforest?”“Yes; you will hear us calling. Are you coming, Max Fortin? And you, Le Bihan?Good; take the dog-cart.”The big gendarme tramped around the corner to the stable and presently returnedmounted on a strong gray horse, his sabre shone on his saddle; his pale yellowand white facings were spotless. The little crowd of white-coiffed women withtheir children fell back as Durand touched spurs and clattered away followed byhis two troopers. Soon after Le Bihan and Max Fortin also departed in themayor's dingy dog-cart.“Are you coming?” piped Le Bihan shrilly.“In a quarter of an hour,” I replied, and went back to the house.When I opened the door of the morning room the death's-head moth was beating itsstrong wings against the window. For a second I hesitated, then walked over andopened the sash. The creature fluttered out, whirred over the flower beds amoment, then darted across the moorland toward the sea. I called the servantstogether and questioned them. Josephine, Catherine, Jean Marie Tregunc, not oneof them had heard the slightest disturbance during the night. Then I told JeanMarie to saddle my horse, and while I was speaking Lys came down.“Dearest,” I began, going to her.“You must tell me everything you know, Dick,” she interrupted, looking meearnestly in the face.“But there is nothing to tell—only a drunken brawl, and some one wounded.”“And you are going to ride—where, Dick?”“Well, over to the edge of Kerselec forest. Durand and the mayor, and MaxFortin, have gone on, following a—a trail.”“What trail?”“Some blood.”“Where did they find it?”“Out in the road there.” Lys crossed herself.“Does it come near our house?”“Yes.”“How near?”“It comes up to the morning room window,” said I, giving in.Her hand on my arm grew heavy. “I dreamed last night—”“So did I—” but I thought of the empty cartridges in my revolver, and stopped.“I dreamed that you were in great danger, and I could not move hand or foot tosave you; but you had your revolver, and I called out to you to fire—”“I did fire!” I cried excitedly.“You—you fired?”I took her in my arms. “My darling,” I said “something strange hashappened—something that I cannot understand as yet. But, of course, there is anexplanation. Last night I thought I fired at the Black Priest.”“Ah!” gasped Lys.“Is that what you dreamed?”“Yes, yes, that was it! I begged you to fire—”“And I did.”Her heart was beating against my breast. I held her close in silence.“Dick,” she said at length, “perhaps you killed the—the thing.”“If it was human I did not miss,” I answered grimly. “And it was human,” I wenton, pulling myself together, ashamed of having so nearly gone to pieces. “Ofcourse it was human! The whole affair is plain enough. Not a drunken brawl, asDurand thinks; it was a drunken lout's practical joke, for which he hassuffered. I suppose I must have filled him pretty full of bullets, and he hascrawled away to die in Kerselec forest. It's a terrible affair; I'm sorry Ifired so hastily; but that idiot Le Bihan and Max Fortin have been working on mynerves till I am as hysterical as a schoolgirl,” I ended angrily.“You fired—but the window glass was not shattered,” said Lys in a low voice.“Well, the window was open, then. And as for the—the rest—I've got nervousindigestion, and a doctor will settle the Black Priest for me, Lys.”I glanced out of the window at Tregunc waiting with my horse at the gate.“Dearest, I think I had better go to join Durand and the others.”“I will go, too.”“Oh, no!”“Yes, Dick.”“Don't, Lys.”“I shall suffer every moment you are away.”“The ride is too fatiguing, and we can't tell what unpleasant sight you may comeupon. Lys, you don't really think there is anything supernatural in thisaffair?”“Dick,” she answered gently, “I am a Bretonne.” With both arms around my neck,my wife said, “Death is the gift of God. I do not fear it when we are together.But alone—oh, my husband, I should fear a God who could take you away from me!”We kissed each other soberly, simply, like two children. Then Lys hurried awayto change her gown, and I paced up and down the garden waiting for her.She came, drawing on her slender gauntlets. I swung her into the saddle, gave ahasty order to Jean Marie, and mounted.Now, to quail under thoughts of terror on a morning like this, with Lys in thesaddle beside me, no matter what had happened or might happen was impossible.Moreover, Môme came sneaking after us. I asked Tregunc to catch him, for I wasafraid he might be brained by our horses' hoofs if he followed, but the wilypuppy dodged and bolted after Lys, who was trotting along the highroad. “Nevermind,” I thought; “if he's hit he'll live, for he has no brains to lose.”Lys was waiting for me in the road beside the Shrine of Our Lady of St. Gildaswhen I joined her. She crossed herself, I doffed my cap, then we shook out ourbridles and galloped toward the forest of Kerselec.We said very little as we rode. I always loved to watch Lys in the saddle. Herexquisite figure and lovely face were the incarnation of youth and grace; hercurling hair glistened like threaded gold.Out of the corner of my eye I saw the spoiled puppy Môme come boundingcheerfully alongside, oblivious of our horses' heels. Our road swung close tothe cliffs. A filthy cormorant rose from the black rocks and flapped heavilyacross our path. Lys's horse reared, but she pulled him down, and pointed at thebird with her riding crop.“I see,” said I; “it seems to be going our way. Curious to see a cormorant in aforest, isn't it?”“It is a bad sign,” said Lys. “You know the Morbihan proverb: ‘When thecormorant turns from the sea, Death laughs in the forest, and wise woodsmenbuild boats.’““I wish,” said I sincerely, “that there were fewer proverbs in Brittany.”We were in sight of the forest now; across the gorse I could see the sparkle ofgendarmes' trappings, and the glitter of Le Bihan's silver-buttoned jacket. Thehedge was low and we took it without difficulty, and trotted across the moor towhere Le Bihan and Durand stood gesticulating.They bowed ceremoniously to Lys as we rode up.“The trail is horrible—it is a river,” said the mayor in his squeaky voice.“Monsieur Darrel, I think perhaps madame would scarcely care to come anynearer.”Lys drew bridle and looked at me.“It is horrible!” said Durand, walking up beside me; “it looks as though ableeding regiment had passed this way. The trail winds and winds about here inthe thickets; we lose it at times, but we always find it again. I can'tunderstand how one man—no, nor twenty—could bleed like that!”A halloo, answered by another, sounded from the depths of the forest.“It's my men; they are following the trail,” muttered the brigadier. “God aloneknows what is at the end!”“Shall we gallop back, Lys?” I asked.“No; let us ride along the western edge of the woods and dismount. The sun is sohot now, and I should like to rest for a moment,” she said.“The western forest is clear of anything disagreeable,” said Durand.“Very well,” I answered; “call me, Le Bihan, if you find anything.”Lys wheeled her mare, and I followed across the springy heather, Môme trottingcheerfully in the rear.We entered the sunny woods about a quarter of a kilometer from where we leftDurand. I took Lys from her horse, flung both bridles over a limb, and, givingmy wife my arm, aided her to a flat mossy rock which overhung a shallow brookgurgling among the beech trees. Lys sat down and drew off her gauntlets. Mômepushed his head into her lap, received an undeserved caress, and came doubtfullytoward me. I was weak enough to condone his offense, but I made him lie down atmy feet, greatly to his disgust.I rested my head on Lys's knees, looking up at the sky through the crossedbranches of the trees.“I suppose I have killed him,” I said. “It shocks me terribly, Lys.”“You could not have known, dear. He may have been a robber, and—if—not—did—haveyou ever fired your revolver since that day four years ago when the RedAdmiral's son tried to kill you? But I know you have not.”“No,” said I, wondering. “It's a fact, I have not. Why?”“And don't you remember that I asked you to let me load it for you the day whenYves went off, swearing to kill you and his father?”“Yes, I do remember. Well?”“Well, I—I took the cartridges first to St. Gildas chapel and dipped them inholy water. You must not laugh, Dick,” said Lys gently, laying her cool hands onmy lips.“Laugh, my darling!”Overhead the October sky was pale amethyst, and the sunlight burned like orangeflame through the yellow leaves of beech and oak. Gnats and midges danced andwavered overhead; a spider dropped from a twig halfway to the ground and hungsuspended on the end of his gossamer thread.“Are you sleepy, dear?” asked Lys, bending over me.“I am—a little; I scarcely slept two hours last night,” I answered.“You may sleep, if you wish,” said Lys, and touched my eyes caressingly.“Is my head heavy on your knees?”“No, Dick.”I was already in a half doze; still I heard the brook babbling under the beechesand the humming of forest flies overhead. Presently even these were stilled.The next thing I knew I was sitting bolt upright, my ears ringing with a scream,and I saw Lys cowering beside me, covering her white face with both hands.As I sprang to my feet she cried again and clung to my knees. I saw my dog rushgrowling into a thicket, then I heard him whimper, and he came backing out,whining, ears flat, tail down. I stooped and disengaged Lys's hand.“Don't go, Dick!” she cried. “O God, it's the Black Priest!”In a moment I had leaped across the brook and pushed my way into the thicket. Itwas empty. I stared about me; I scanned every tree trunk, every bush. Suddenly Isaw him. He was seated on a fallen log, his head resting in his hands, his rustyblack robe gathered around him. For a moment my hair stirred under my cap; sweatstarted on forehead and cheek bone; then I recovered my reason, and understoodthat the man was human and was probably wounded to death. Ay, to death; forthere at my feet, lay the wet trail of blood, over leaves and stones, down intothe little hollow, across to the figure in black resting silently under thetrees.I saw that he could not escape even if he had the strength, for before him,almost at his very feet, lay a deep, shining swamp.As I stepped forward my foot broke a twig. At the sound the figure started alittle, then its head fell forward again. Its face was masked. Walking up to theman, I bade him tell where he was wounded. Durand and the others broke throughthe thicket at the same moment and hurried to my side.“Who are you who hide a masked face in a priest's robe?” said the gendarmeloudly.There was no answer.“See—see the stiff blood all over his robe,” muttered Le Bihan to Fortin.“He will not speak,” said I.“He may be too badly wounded,” whispered Le Bihan.“I saw him raise his head,” I said, “my wife saw him creep up here.”Durand stepped forward and touched the figure.“Speak!” he said.“Speak!” quavered Fortin.Durand waited a moment, then with a sudden upward movement he stripped off themask and threw back the man's head. We were looking into the eye sockets of askull. Durand stood rigid; the mayor shrieked. The skeleton burst out from itsrotting robes and collapsed on the ground before us. From between the staringribs and the grinning teeth spurted a torrent of black blood, showering theshrinking grasses; then the thing shuddered, and fell over into the black oozeof the bog. Little bubbles of iridescent air appeared from the mud; the boneswere slowly engulfed, and, as the last fragments sank out of sight, up from thedepths and along the bank crept a creature, shiny, shivering, quivering itswings.It was a death's-head moth.I wish I had time to tell you how Lys outgrew superstitions—for she never knewthe truth about the affair, and she never will know, since she has promised notto read this book. I wish I might tell you about the king and his coronation,and how the coronation robe fitted. I wish that I were able to write how Yvonneand Herbert Stuart rode to a boar hunt in Quimperle, and how the hounds racedthe quarry right through the town, overturning three gendarmes, the notary, andan old woman. But I am becoming garrulous and Lys is calling me to come and hearthe king say that he is sleepy. And his highness shall not be kept waiting.The King's Cradle SongSeal with a seal of goldThe scroll of a life unrolled;Swathe him deep in his purple stole;Ashes of diamonds, crystalled coal,Drops of gold in each scented fold.Crimson wings of the Little Death,Stir his hair with your silken breath;Flaming wings of sins to be,Splendid pinions of prophecy,Smother his eyes with hues and dyes,While the white moon spins and the winds arise,And the stars drip through the skies.Wave, O wings of the Little Death!Seal his sight and stifle his breath,Cover his breast with the gemmed shroud pressed;From north to north, from west to west,Wave, O wings of the Little Death!Till the white moon reels in the cracking skies,And the ghosts of God arise."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] THE RING OF THOTH Image [images/u4.jpg]by Sir Arthur Conan DoyleCreator of the immortal Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930)needs no introduction. He was an exuberantly prolific writer who churned out aseemly endless variety of masterpieces (mystery, science fiction, horror,romance, poetry, historical fictions, non-fiction and fantasy). He was anoccultist whose interest in magic and Theosophy injected real substance into hissubjects and characters. It has often been suggested that he was a member of thegreat nineteenth-century magical society, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,but that is not the case. He was nominated for membership and had initiallygiven his permission to process his nomination, but evidence shows he withdrewhis permission and was not officially associated with the organization.THE RING OF THOTHMr. John Vansittart Smith, F.R.S., of 147-A Gower Street, was a man whose energyof purpose and clearness of thought might have placed him in the very first rankof scientific observers. He was the victim, however, of a universal ambitionwhich prompted him to aim at distinction in many subjects rather thanpreeminence in one.In his early days he had shown an aptitude for zoology and for botany whichcaused his friends to look upon him as a second Darwin, but when a professorshipwas almost within his reach he had suddenly discontinued his studies and turnedhis whole attention to chemistry. Here his researches upon the spectra of themetals had won him his fellowship in the Royal Society; but again he played thecoquette with his subject, and after a year's absence from the laboratory hejoined the Oriental Society, and delivered a paper on the Hieroglyphic andDemotic inscriptions of El Kab, thus giving a crowning example both of theversatility and of the inconstancy of his talents.The most fickle of wooers, however, is apt to be caught at last, and so it waswith John Vansittart Smith. The more he burrowed his way into Egyptology themore impressed he became by the vast field which it opened to the inquirer, andby the extreme importance of a subject which promised to throw a light upon thefirst germs of human civilisation and the origin of the greater part of our artsand sciences. So struck was Mr. Smith that he straightway married anEgyptological young lady who had written upon the sixth dynasty, and having thussecured a sound base of operations he set himself to collect materials for awork which should unite the research of Lepsius and the ingenuity ofChampollion. The preparation of this magnum opus entailed many hurried visits tothe magnificent Egyptian collections of the Louvre, upon the last of which, nolonger ago than the middle of last October, he became involved in a most strangeand noteworthy adventure.The trains had been slow and the Channel had been rough, so that the studentarrived in Paris in a somewhat befogged and feverish condition. On reaching theHotel de France, in the Rue Laffitte, he had thrown himself upon a sofa for acouple of hours, but finding that he was unable to sleep, he determined, inspite of his fatigue, to make his way to the Louvre, settle the point which hehad come to decide, and take the evening train back to Dieppe. Having come tothis conclusion, he donned his greatcoat, for it was a raw rainy day, and madehis way across the Boulevard des Italiens and down the Avenue de l'Opera. Oncein the Louvre he was on familiar ground, and he speedily made his way to thecollection of papyri which it was his intention to consult.The warmest admirers of John Vansittart Smith could hardly claim for him that hewas a handsome man. His high-beaked nose and prominent chin had something of thesame acute and incisive character which distinguished his intellect. He held hishead in a birdlike fashion, and birdlike, too, was the pecking motion withwhich, in conversation, he threw out his objections and retorts. As he stood,with the high collar of his greatcoat raised to his ears, he might have seenfrom the reflection in the glass-case before him that his appearance was asingular one. Yet it came upon him as a sudden jar when an English voice behindhim exclaimed in very audible tones, “What a queer-looking mortal!”The student had a large amount of petty vanity in his composition whichmanifested itself by an ostentatious and overdone disregard of all personalconsiderations. He straightened his lips and looked rigidly at the roll ofpapyrus, while his heart filled with bitterness against the whole race oftravelling Britons.“Yes,” said another voice, “he really is an extraordinary fellow.”“Do you know,” said the first speaker, “one could almost believe that by thecontinual contemplation of mummies the chap has become half a mummy himself?”“He has certainly an Egyptian cast of countenance,” said the other.John Vansittart Smith spun round upon his heel with the intention of shaming hiscountrymen by a corrosive remark or two. To his surprise and relief, the twoyoung fellows who had been conversing had their shoulders turned towards him,and were gazing at one of the Louvre attendants who was polishing somebrass-work at the other side of the room.“Carter will be waiting for us at the Palais Royal,” said one tourist to theother, glancing at his watch, and they clattered away, leaving the student tohis labours.“I wonder what these chatterers call an Egyptian cast of countenance,” thoughtJohn Vansittart Smith, and he moved his position slightly in order to catch aglimpse of the man's face. He started as his eyes fell upon it. It was indeedthe very face with which his studies had made him familiar. The regularstatuesque features, broad brow, well-rounded chin, and dusky complexion werethe exact counterpart of the innumerable statues, mummy-cases, and pictureswhich adorned the walls of the apartment.The thing was beyond all coincidence. The man must be an Egyptian.The national angularity of the shoulders and narrowness of the hips were alonesufficient to identify him.John Vansittart Smith shuffled towards the attendant with some intention ofaddressing him. He was not light of touch in conversation, and found itdifficult to strike the happy mean between the brusqueness of the superior andthe geniality of the equal. As he came nearer, the man presented his side faceto him, but kept his gaze still bent upon his work. Vansittart Smith, fixing hiseyes upon the fellow's skin, was conscious of a sudden impression that there wassomething inhuman and preternatural about its appearance. Over the temple andcheek-bone it was as glazed and as shiny as varnished parchment. There was nosuggestion of pores. One could not fancy a drop of moisture upon that aridsurface. From brow to chin, however, it was cross-hatched by a million delicatewrinkles, which shot and interlaced as though Nature in some Maori mood hadtried how wild and intricate a pattern she could devise.“Ou est la collection de Memphis?” asked the student, with the awkward air of aman who is devising a question merely for the purpose of opening a conversation.“C'est la,” replied the man brusquely, nodding his head at the other side of theroom.“Vous etes un Egyptien, n'est-ce pas?” asked the Englishman.The attendant looked up and turned his strange dark eyes upon his questioner.They were vitreous, with a misty dry shininess, such as Smith had never seen ina human head before. As he gazed into them he saw some strong emotion gather intheir depths, which rose and deepened until it broke into a look of somethingakin both to horror and to hatred.“Non, monsieur; je suis Fransais.” The man turned abruptly and bent low over hispolishing. The student gazed at him for a moment in astonishment, and thenturning to a chair in a retired corner behind one of the doors he proceeded tomake notes of his researches among the papyri. His thoughts, however refused toreturn into their natural groove. They would run upon the enigmatical attendantwith the sphinx-like face and the parchment skin.“Where have I seen such eyes?” said Vansittart Smith to himself. “There issomething saurian about them, something reptilian. There's the membrananictitans of the snakes,” he mused, bethinking himself of his zoologicalstudies. “It gives a shiny effect. But there was something more here. There wasa sense of power, of wisdom—so I read them—and of weariness, utter weariness,and ineffable despair. It may be all imagination, but I never had so strong animpression. By Jove, I must have another look at them!” He rose and paced roundthe Egyptian rooms, but the man who had excited his curiosity had disappeared.The student sat down again in his quiet corner, and continued to work at hisnotes. He had gained the information which he required from the papyri, and itonly remained to write it down while it was still fresh in his memory. For atime his pencil travelled rapidly over the paper, but soon the lines became lesslevel, the words more blurred, and finally the pencil tinkled down upon thefloor, and the head of the student dropped heavily forward upon his chest.Tired out by his journey, he slept so soundly in his lonely post behind the doorthat neither the clanking civil guard, nor the footsteps of sightseers, nor eventhe loud hoarse bell which gives the signal for closing, were sufficient toarouse him.Twilight deepened into darkness, the bustle from the Rue de Rivoli waxed andthen waned, distant Notre Dame clanged out the hour of midnight, and still thedark and lonely figure sat silently in the shadow. It was not until close uponone in the morning that, with a sudden gasp and an intaking of the breath,Vansittart Smith returned to consciousness. For a moment it flashed upon himthat he had dropped asleep in his study-chair at home. The moon was shiningfitfully through the unshuttered window, however, and, as his eye ran along thelines of mummies and the endless array of polished cases, he remembered clearlywhere he was and how he came there. The student was not a nervous man. Hepossessed that love of a novel situation which is peculiar to his race.Stretching out his cramped limbs, he looked at his watch, and burst into achuckle as he observed the hour. The episode would make an admirable anecdote tobe introduced into his next paper as a relief to the graver and heavierspeculations. He was a little cold, but wide awake and much refreshed. It was nowonder that the guardians had overlooked him, for the door threw its heavy blackshadow right across him.The complete silence was impressive. Neither outside nor inside was there acreak or a murmur. He was alone with the dead men of a dead civilisation. Whatthough the outer city reeked of the garish nineteenth century! In all thischamber there was scarce an article, from the shrivelled ear of wheat to thepigment-box of the painter, which had not held its own against four thousandyears. Here was the flotsam and jetsam washed up by the great ocean of time fromthat far-off empire. From stately Thebes, from lordly Luxor, from the greattemples of Heliopolis, from a hundred rifled tombs, these relics had beenbrought. The student glanced round at the long silent figures who flickeredvaguely up through the gloom, at the busy toilers who were now so restful, andhe fell into a reverent and thoughtful mood. An unwonted sense of his own youthand insignificance came over him. Leaning back in his chair, he gazed dreamilydown the long vista of rooms, all silvery with the moonshine, which extendthrough the whole wing of the widespread building. His eyes fell upon the yellowglare of a distant lamp.John Vansittart Smith sat up on his chair with his nerves all on edge. The lightwas advancing slowly towards him, pausing from time to time, and then comingjerkily onwards. The bearer moved noiselessly. In the utter silence there was nosuspicion of the pat of a footfall. An idea of robbers entered the Englishman'shead. He snuggled up further into the corner. The light was two rooms off. Nowit was in the next chamber, and still there was no sound. With somethingapproaching to a thrill of fear the student observed a face, floating in the airas it were, behind the flare of the lamp. The figure was wrapped in shadow, butthe light fell full upon the strange eager face. There was no mistaking themetallic glistening eyes and the cadaverous skin. It was the attendant with whomhe had conversed.Vansittart Smith's first impulse was to come forward and address him. A fewwords of explanation would set the matter clear, and lead doubtless to his beingconducted to some side door from which he might make his way to his hotel. Asthe man entered the chamber, however, there was something so stealthy in hismovements, and so furtive in his expression, that the Englishman altered hisintention. This was clearly no ordinary official walking the rounds. The fellowwore felt-soled slippers, stepped with a rising chest, and glanced quickly fromleft to right, while his hurried gasping breathing thrilled the flame of hislamp. Vansittart Smith crouched silently back into the corner and watched himkeenly, convinced that his errand was one of secret and probably sinisterimport.There was no hesitation in the other's movements. He stepped lightly and swiftlyacross to one of the great cases, and, drawing a key from his pocket, heunlocked it. From the upper shelf he pulled down a mummy, which he bore awaywith him, and laid it with much care and solicitude upon the ground. By it heplaced his lamp, and then squatting down beside it in Eastern fashion he beganwith long quivering fingers to undo the cerecloths and bandages which girt itround. As the crackling rolls of linen peeled off one after the other, a strongaromatic odour filled the chamber, and fragments of scented wood and of spicespattered down upon the marble floor.It was clear to John Vansittart Smith that this mummy had never been unswathedbefore. The operation interested him keenly. He thrilled all over withcuriosity, and his birdlike head protruded further and further from behind thedoor. When, however, the last roll had been removed from thefour-thousand-year-old head, it was all that he could do to stifle an outcry ofamazement. First, a cascade of long, black, glossy tresses poured over theworkman's hands and arms. A second turn of the bandage revealed a low, whiteforehead, with a pair of delicately arched eyebrows. A third uncovered a pair ofbright, deeply fringed eyes, and a straight, well-cut nose, while a fourth andlast showed a sweet, full, sensitive mouth, and a beautifully curved chin. Thewhole face was one of extraordinary loveliness, save for the one blemish that inthe centre of the forehead there was a single irregular, coffee-colouredsplotch. It was a triumph of the embalmer's art. Vansittart Smith's eyes grewlarger and larger as he gazed upon it, and he chirruped in his throat withsatisfaction.Its effect upon the Egyptologist was as nothing, however, compared with thatwhich it produced upon the strange attendant. He threw his hands up into theair, burst into a harsh clatter of words, and then, hurling himself down uponthe ground beside the mummy, he threw his arms round her, and kissed herrepeatedly upon the lips and brow. “Ma petite!” he groaned in French. “Ma pauvrepetite!” His voice broke with emotion, and his innumerable wrinkles quivered andwrithed, but the student observed in the lamplight that his shining eyes werestill as dry and tearless as two beads of steel. For some minutes he lay, with atwitching face, crooning and moaning over the beautiful head. Then he broke intoa sudden smile, said some words in an unknown tongue, and sprang to his feetwith the vigorous air of one who has braced himself for an effort.In the centre of the room there was a large circular case which contained, asthe student had frequently remarked, a magnificent collection of early Egyptianrings and precious stones. To this the attendant strode, and, unlocking it, hethrew it open. On the ledge at the side he placed his lamp, and beside it asmall earthenware jar which he had drawn from his pocket. He then took a handfulof rings from the case, and with a most serious and anxious face he proceeded tosmear each in turn with some liquid substance from the earthen pot, holding themto the light as he did so. He was clearly disappointed with the first lot, forhe threw them petulantly back into the case, and drew out some more. One ofthese, a massive ring with a large crystal set in it, he seized and eagerlytested with the contents of the jar. Instantly he uttered a cry of joy, andthrew out his arms in a wild gesture which upset the pot and sent the liquidstreaming across the floor to the very feet of the Englishman. The attendantdrew a red handkerchief from his bosom, and, mopping up the mess, he followed itinto the corner, where in a moment he found himself face to face with hisobserver.“Excuse me,” said John Vansittart Smith, with all imaginable politeness; “I havebeen unfortunate enough to fall asleep behind this door.”“And you have been watching me?” the other asked in English, with a mostvenomous look on his corpse-like face.The student was a man of veracity. “I confess,” said he, “that I have noticedyour movements, and that they have aroused my curiosity and interest in thehighest degree.”The man drew a long flamboyant-bladed knife from his bosom. “You have had a verynarrow escape,” he said; “had I seen you ten minutes ago, I should have driventhis through your heart. As it is, if you touch me or interfere with me in anyway you are a dead man.”“I have no wish to interfere with you,” the student answered. “My presence hereis entirely accidental. All I ask is that you will have the extreme kindness toshow me out through some side door.” He spoke with great suavity, for the manwas still pressing the tip of his dagger against the palm of his left hand, asthough to assure himself of its sharpness, while his face preserved itsmalignant expression.“If I thought—” said he. “But no, perhaps it is as well. What is your name?”The Englishman gave it.“Vansittart Smith,” the other repeated. “Are you the same Vansittart Smith whogave a paper in London upon El Kab? I saw a report of it. Your knowledge of thesubject is contemptible.”“Sir!” cried the Egyptologist.“Yet it is superior to that of many who make even greater pretensions. The wholekeystone of our old life in Egypt was not the inscriptions or monuments of whichyou make so much, but was our hermetic philosophy and mystic knowledge, of whichyou say little or nothing.”“Our old life!” repeated the scholar, wide-eyed; and then suddenly, “Good God,look at the mummy's face!”The strange man turned and flashed his light upon the dead woman, uttering along doleful cry as he did so. The action of the air had already undone all theart of the embalmer. The skin had fallen away, the eyes had sunk inwards, thediscoloured lips had writhed away from the yellow teeth, and the brown mark uponthe forehead alone showed that it was indeed the same face which had shown suchyouth and beauty a few short minutes before.The man flapped his hands together in grief and horror. Then mastering himselfby a strong effort he turned his hard eyes once more upon the Englishman.“It does not matter,” he said, in a shaking voice. “It does not really matter. Icame here to-night with the fixed determination to do something. It is now done.All else is as nothing. I have found my quest. The old curse is broken. I canrejoin her. What matter about her inanimate shell so long as her spirit isawaiting me at the other side of the veil!”“These are wild words,” said Vansittart Smith. He was becoming more and moreconvinced that he had to do with a madman.“Time presses, and I must go,” continued the other. “The moment is at hand forwhich I have waited this weary time. But I must show you out first. Come withme.”Taking up the lamp, he turned from the disordered chamber, and led the studentswiftly through the long series of the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persianapartments. At the end of the latter he pushed open a small door let into thewall and descended a winding stone stair. The Englishman felt the cold fresh airof the night upon his brow. There was a door opposite him which appeared tocommunicate with the street. To the right of this another door stood ajar,throwing a spurt of yellow light across the passage. “Come in here!” said theattendant shortly.Vansittart Smith hesitated. He had hoped that he had come to the end of hisadventure. Yet his curiosity was strong within him. He could not leave thematter unsolved, so he followed his strange companion into the lighted chamber.It was a small room, such as is devoted to a concierge. A wood fire sparkled inthe grate. At one side stood a truckle bed, and at the other a coarse woodenchair, with a round table in the centre, which bore the remains of a meal. Asthe visitor's eye glanced round he could not but remark with an ever-recurringthrill that all the small details of the room were of the most quaint design andantique workmanship. The candlesticks, the vases upon the chimney-piece, thefire-irons, the ornaments upon the walls, were all such as he had been wont toassociate with the remote past. The gnarled heavy-eyed man sat himself down uponthe edge of the bed, and motioned his guest into the chair.“There may be design in this,” he said, still speaking excellent English. “Itmay be decreed that I should leave some account behind as a warning to all rashmortals who would set their wits up against workings of Nature. I leave it withyou. Make such use as you will of it. I speak to you now with my feet upon thethreshold of the other world.“I am, as you surmised, an Egyptian—not one of the down-trodden race of slaveswho now inhabit the Delta of the Nile, but a survivor of that fiercer and harderpeople who tamed the Hebrew, drove the Ethiopian back into the southern deserts,and built those mighty works which have been the envy and the wonder of allafter generations. It was in the reign of Tuthmosis, sixteen hundred yearsbefore the birth of Christ, that I first saw the light. You shrink away from me.Wait, and you will see that I am more to be pitied than to be feared.“My name was Sosra. My father had been the chief priest of Osiris in the greattemple of Abaris, which stood in those days upon the Bubastic branch of theNile. I was brought up in the temple and was trained in all those mystic artswhich are spoken of in your own Bible. I was an apt pupil. Before I was sixteenI had learned all which the wisest priest could teach me. From that time on Istudied Nature's secrets for myself, and shared my knowledge with no man.“Of all the questions which attracted me there were none over which I labouredso long as over those which concern themselves with the nature of life. I probeddeeply into the vital principle. The aim of medicine had been to drive awaydisease when it appeared. It seemed to me that a method might be devised whichshould so fortify the body as to prevent weakness or death from ever taking holdof it. It is useless that I should recount my researches. You would scarcecomprehend them if I did. They were carried out partly upon animals, partly uponslaves, and partly on myself. Suffice it that their result was to furnish mewith a substance which, when injected into the blood, would endow the body withstrength to resist the effects of time, of violence, or of disease. It would notindeed confer immortality, but its potency would endure for many thousands ofyears. I used it upon a cat, and afterwards drugged the creature with the mostdeadly poisons. That cat is alive in Lower Egypt at the present moment. Therewas nothing of mystery or magic in the matter. It was simply a chemicaldiscovery, which may well be made again.“Love of life runs high in the young. It seemed to me that I had broken awayfrom all human care now that I had abolished pain and driven death to such adistance. With a light heart I poured the accursed stuff into my veins. Then Ilooked round for some one whom I could benefit. There was a young priest ofThoth, Parmes by name, who had won my goodwill by his earnest nature and hisdevotion to his studies. To him I whispered my secret, and at his request Iinjected him with my elixir. I should now, I reflected, never be without acompanion of the same age as myself.“After this grand discovery I relaxed my studies to some extent, but Parmescontinued his with redoubled energy. Every day I could see him working with hisflasks and his distiller in the Temple of Thoth, but he said little to me as tothe result of his labours. For my own part, I used to walk through the city andlook around me with exultation as I reflected that all this was destined to passaway, and that only I should remain. The people would bow to me as they passedme, for the fame of my knowledge had gone abroad.“There was war at this time, and the Great King had sent down his soldiers tothe eastern boundary to drive away the Hyksos. A Governor, too, was sent toAbaris, that he might hold it for the King. I had heard much of the beauty ofthe daughter of this Governor, but one day as I walked out with Parmes we mether, borne upon the shoulders of her slaves. I was struck with love as withlightning. My heart went out from me. I could have thrown myself beneath thefeet of her bearers. This was my woman. Life without her was impossible. I sworeby the head of Horus that she should be mine. I swore it to the Priest of Thoth.He turned away from me with a brow which was as black as midnight.“There is no need to tell you of our wooing. She came to love me even as I lovedher. I learned that Parmes had seen her before I did, and had shown her that hetoo loved her, but I could smile at his passion, for I knew that her heart wasmine. The white plague had come upon the city and many were stricken, but I laidmy hands upon the sick and nursed them without fear or scathe. She marvelled atmy daring. Then I told her my secret, and begged her that she would let me usemy art upon her.“‘Your flower shall then be unwithered, Atma,’ I said. ‘Other things may passaway, but you and I, and our great love for each other, shall outlive the tombof King Chefru.’“But she was full of timid, maidenly objections. ‘Was it right?’ she asked, ‘wasit not a thwarting of the will of the gods? If the great Osiris had wished thatour years should be so long, would he not himself have brought it about?’“With fond and loving words I overcame her doubts, and yet she hesitated. It wasa great question, she said. She would think it over for this one night. In themorning I should know her resolution. Surely one night was not too much to ask.She wished to pray to Isis for help in her decision.“With a sinking heart and a sad foreboding of evil I left her with hertirewomen. In the morning, when the early sacrifice was over, I hurried to herhouse. A frightened slave met me upon the steps. Her mistress was ill, she said,very ill. In a frenzy I broke my way through the attendants, and rushed throughhall and corridor to my Atma's chamber. She lay upon her couch, her head highupon the pillow, with a pallid face and a glazed eye. On her forehead thereblazed a single angry purple patch. I knew that hell-mark of old. It was thescar of the white plague, the sign-manual of death.“Why should I speak of that terrible time? For months I was mad, fevered,delirious, and yet I could not die. Never did an Arab thirst after the sweetwells as I longed after death. Could poison or steel have shortened the threadof my existence, I should soon have rejoined my love in the land with the narrowportal. I tried, but it was of no avail. The accursed influence was too strongupon me. One night as I lay upon my couch, weak and weary, Parmes, the priest ofThoth, came to my chamber. He stood in the circle of the lamplight, and helooked down upon me with eyes which were bright with a mad joy.“‘Why did you let the maiden die?’ he asked; ‘why did you not strengthen her asyou strengthened me?’“‘I was too late,’ I answered. ‘But I had forgot. You also loved her. You are myfellow in misfortune. Is it not terrible to think of the centuries which mustpass ere we look upon her again? Fools, fools, that we were to take death to beour enemy!’“‘You may say that,’ he cried with a wild laugh; ‘the words come well from yourlips. For me they have no meaning.’“‘What mean you?’ I cried, raising myself upon my elbow. ‘Surely, friend, thisgrief has turned your brain.’ His face was aflame with joy, and he writhed andshook like one who hath a devil.“‘Do you know whither I go?’ he asked.“‘Nay,’ I answered, ‘I cannot tell.’“‘I go to her,’ said he. ‘She lies embalmed in the further tomb by the doublepalm-tree beyond the city wall.’“‘Why do you go there?’ I asked.“‘To die!’ he shrieked, ‘to die! I am not bound by earthen fetters.’“‘But the elixir is in your blood,’ I cried.“‘I can defy it,’ said he; ‘I have found a stronger principle which will destroyit. It is working in my veins at this moment, and in an hour I shall be a deadman. I shall join her, and you shall remain behind.’“As I looked upon him I could see that he spoke words of truth. The light in hiseye told me that he was indeed beyond the power of the elixir.“‘You will teach me!’ I cried.“‘Never!’ he answered.“‘I implore you, by the wisdom of Thoth, by the majesty of Anubis!’“‘It is useless,’ he said coldly.“‘Then I will find it out,’ I cried.“‘You cannot,’ he answered; ‘it came to me by chance. There is one ingredientwhich you can never get. Save that which is in the ring of Thoth, none will evermore be made.“‘In the ring of Thoth!’ I repeated; ‘where then is the ring of Thoth?’“‘That also you shall never know,’ he answered. ‘You won her love. Who has wonin the end? I leave you to your sordid earth life. My chains are broken. I mustgo!’ He turned upon his heel and fled from the chamber. In the morning came thenews that the Priest of Thoth was dead.“My days after that were spent in study. I must find this subtle poison whichwas strong enough to undo the elixir. From early dawn to midnight I bent overthe test-tube and the furnace. Above all, I collected the papyri and thechemical flasks of the Priest of Thoth. Alas! they taught me little. Here andthere some hint or stray expression would raise hope in my bosom, but no goodever came of it. Still, month after month, I struggled on. When my heart grewfaint I would make my way to the tomb by the palm-trees. There, standing by thedead casket from which the jewel had been rifled, I would feel her sweetpresence, and would whisper to her that I would rejoin her if mortal wit couldsolve the riddle.“Parmes had said that his discovery was connected with the ring of Thoth. I hadsome remembrance of the trinket. It was a large and weighty circlet, made, notof gold, but of a rarer and heavier metal brought from the mines of MountHarbal. Platinum, you call it. The ring had, I remembered, a hollow crystal setin it, in which some few drops of liquid might be stored. Now, the secret ofParmes could not have to do with the metal alone, for there were many rings ofthat metal in the Temple. Was it not more likely that he had stored his preciouspoison within the cavity of the crystal? I had scarce come to this conclusionbefore, in hunting through his papers, I came upon one which told me that it wasindeed so, and that there was still some of the liquid unused.“But how to find the ring? It was not upon him when he was stripped for theembalmer. Of that I made sure. Neither was it among his private effects. In vainI searched every room that he had entered, every box, and vase, and chattel thathe had owned. I sifted the very sand of the desert in the places where he hadbeen wont to walk; but, do what I would, I could come upon no traces of the ringof Thoth. Yet it may be that my labours would have overcome all obstacles had itnot been for a new and unlooked-for misfortune.“A great war had been waged against the Hyksos, and the Captains of the GreatKing had been cut off in the desert, with all their bowmen and horsemen. Theshepherd tribes were upon us like the locusts in a dry year. From the wildernessof Shur to the great bitter lake there was blood by day and fire by night.Abaris was the bulwark of Egypt, but we could not keep the savages back. Thecity fell. The Governor and the soldiers were put to the sword, and I, with manymore, was led away into captivity.“For years and years I tended cattle in the great plains by the Euphrates. Mymaster died, and his son grew old, but I was still as far from death as ever. Atlast I escaped upon a swift camel, and made my way back to Egypt. The Hyksos hadsettled in the land which they had conquered, and their own King ruled over thecountry Abaris had been torn down, the city had been burned, and of the greatTemple there was nothing left save an unsightly mound. Everywhere the tombs hadbeen rifled and the monuments destroyed. Of my Atma's grave no sign was left. Itwas buried in the sands of the desert, and the palm-trees which marked the spothad long disappeared. The papers of Parmes and the remains of the Temple ofThoth were either destroyed or scattered far and wide over the deserts of Syria.All search after them was vain.“From that time I gave up all hope of ever finding the ring or discovering thesubtle drug. I set myself to live as patiently as might be until the effect ofthe elixir should wear away. How can you understand how terrible a thing timeis, you who have experience only of the narrow course which lies between thecradle and the grave! I know it to my cost, I who have floated down the wholestream of history. I was old when Ilium fell. I was very old when Herodotus cameto Memphis. I was bowed down with years when the new gospel came upon earth. Yetyou see me much as other men are, with the cursed elixir still sweetening myblood, and guarding me against that which I would court. Now at last, at last Ihave come to the end of it!“I have travelled in all lands and I have dwelt with all nations. Every tongueis the same to me. I learned them all to help pass the weary time. I need nottell you how slowly they drifted by, the long dawn of modern civilisation, thedreary middle years, the dark times of barbarism. They are all behind me now, Ihave never looked with the eyes of love upon another woman. Atma knows that Ihave been constant to her.“It was my custom to read all that the scholars had to say upon Ancient Egypt. Ihave been in many positions, sometimes affluent, sometimes poor, but I havealways found enough to enable me to buy the journals which deal with suchmatters. Some nine months ago I was in San Francisco, when I read an account ofsome discoveries made in the neighbourhood of Abaris. My heart leapt into mymouth as I read it. It said that the excavator had busied himself in exploringsome tombs recently unearthed. In one there had been found an unopened mummywith an inscription upon the outer case setting forth that it contained the bodyof the daughter of the Governor of the city in the days of Tuthmosis. It addedthat on removing the outer case there had been exposed a large platinum ring setwith a crystal, which had been laid upon the breast of the embalmed woman. This,then was where Parmes had hid the ring of Thoth. He might well say that it wassafe, for no Egyptian would ever stain his soul by moving even the outer case ofa buried friend.“That very night I set off from San Francisco, and in a few weeks I found myselfonce more at Abaris, if a few sand-heaps and crumbling walls may retain the nameof the great city. I hurried to the Frenchmen who were digging there and askedthem for the ring. They replied that both the ring and the mummy had been sentto the Boulak Museum at Cairo. To Boulak I went, but only to be told thatMariette Bey had claimed them and had shipped them to the Louvre. I followedthem, and there at last, in the Egyptian chamber, I came, after close upon fourthousand years, upon the remains of my Atma, and upon the ring for which I hadsought so long.“But how was I to lay hands upon them? How was I to have them for my very own?It chanced that the office of attendant was vacant. I went to the Director. Iconvinced him that I knew much about Egypt. In my eagerness I said too much. Heremarked that a Professor's chair would suit me better than a seat in theConciergerie. I knew more, he said, than he did. It was only by blundering, andletting him think that he had over-estimated my knowledge, that I prevailed uponhim to let me move the few effects which I have retained into this chamber. Itis my first and my last night here.“Such is my story, Mr. Vansittart Smith. I need not say more to a man of yourperception. By a strange chance you have this night looked upon the face of thewoman whom I loved in those far-off days. There were many rings with crystals inthe case, and I had to test for the platinum to be sure of the one which Iwanted. A glance at the crystal has shown me that the liquid is indeed withinit, and that I shall at last be able to shake off that accursed health which hasbeen worse to me than the foulest disease. I have nothing more to say to you. Ihave unburdened myself. You may tell my story or you may withhold it at yourpleasure. The choice rests with you. I owe you some amends, for you have had anarrow escape of your life this night. I was a desperate man, and not to bebaulked in my purpose. Had I seen you before the thing was done, I might haveput it beyond your power to oppose me or to raise an alarm. This is the door. Itleads into the Rue de Rivoli. Good night!”The Englishman glanced back. For a moment the lean figure of Sosra the Egyptianstood framed in the narrow doorway. The next the door had slammed, and the heavyrasping of a bolt broke on the silent night.It was on the second day after his return to London that Mr. John VansittartSmith saw the following concise narrative in the Paris correspondence of theTimes:—“Curious Occurrence in the Louvre.—Yesterday morning a strange discovery wasmade in the principal Egyptian Chamber. The ouvriers who are employed to cleanout the rooms in the morning found one of the attendants lying dead upon thefloor with his arms round one of the mummies. So close was his embrace that itwas only with the utmost difficulty that they were separated. One of the casescontaining valuable rings had been opened and rifled. The authorities are ofopinion that the man was bearing away the mummy with some idea of selling it toa private collector, but that he was struck down in the very act bylong-standing disease of the heart. It is said that he was a man of uncertainage and eccentric habits, without any living relations to mourn over hisdramatic and untimely end.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] A DREAM OF RED HANDS Image [images/u4.jpg]by Bram StokerThe name Bram Stoker (1847-1912) will forever be associated with Dracula and theworld of vampires. Even though he never actually visited Transylvania, he wasindeed inspired by legends and traditions taken very seriously by inhabitants ofEastern Europe. It is likely, however, that Stoker's real inspiration for theDracula was the character and nuances of his boss, actor, and theatricaldirector and producer Sir Henry Irving. Stoker was for years Irving's personalassistant and helped direct the activities of London's famed Lyceum Theatre.Like Arthur Conan Doyle, it was rumored that Stoker was a member of the magicalsociety the Hermetic Order the Golden Dawn, but no evidence has ever beenproduced to support this claim.A DREAM OF RED HANDSThe first opinion given to me regarding Jacob Settle was a simple descriptivestatement, “He's a down-in-the-mouth chap,” but I found that it embodied thethoughts and ideas of all his fellow-workmen. There was in the phrase a certaineasy tolerance, an absence of positive feeling of any kind, rather than anycomplete opinion, which marked pretty accurately the man's place in publicesteem. Still, there was some dissimilarity between this and his appearancewhich unconsciously set me thinking, and by degrees, as I saw more of the placeand the workmen, I came to have a special interest in him. He was, I found, forever doing kindnesses, not involving money expenses beyond his humble means, butin the manifold ways of forethought and forbearance and self-repression whichare of the truer charities of life. Women and children trusted him implicitly,though, strangely enough, he rather shunned them, except when anyone was sick,and then he made his appearance to help if he could, timidly and awkwardly. Heled a very solitary life, keeping house by himself in a tiny cottage, or ratherhut, of one room, far on the edge of the moorland. His existence seemed so sadand solitary that I wished to cheer it up, and for the purpose took the occasionwhen we had both been sitting up with a child, injured by me through accident,to offer to lend him books. He gladly accepted, and as we parted in the grey ofthe dawn I felt that something of mutual confidence had been established betweenus.The books were always most carefully and punctually returned, and in time JacobSettle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I crossed the moorland onSundays I looked in on him; but on such occasions he was shy and ill at ease sothat I felt diffident about calling to see him. He would never under anycircumstances come into my own lodgings.One Sunday afternoon, I was coming back from a long walk beyond the moor, and asI passed Settle's cottage stopped at the door to say “How do you do?” to him. Asthe door was shut, I thought that he was out, and merely knocked for form'ssake, or through habit, not expecting to get any answer. To my surprise, I hearda feeble voice from within, though what was said I could not hear. I entered atonce, and found Jacob lying half-dressed upon his bed. He was as pale as death,and the sweat was simply rolling off his face. His hands were unconsciouslygripping the bedclothes as a drowning man holds on to whatever he may grasp. AsI came in he half arose, with a wild, hunted look in his eyes, which were wideopen and staring, as though something of horror had come before him; but when herecognised me he sank back on the couch with a smothered sob of relief andclosed his eyes. I stood by him for a while, quite a minute or two, while hegasped. Then he opened his eyes and looked at me, but with such a despairing,woeful expression that, as I am a living man, I would have rather seen thatfrozen look of horror. I sat down beside him and asked after his health. For awhile he would not answer me except to say that he was not ill; but then, afterscrutinising me closely, he half arose on his elbow and said:“I thank you kindly, sir, but I'm simply telling you the truth. I am not ill, asmen call it, though God knows whether there be not worse sicknesses than doctorsknow of. I'll tell you, as you are so kind, but I trust that you won't evenmention such a thing to a living soul, for it might work me more and greaterwoe. I am suffering from a bad dream.”“A bad dream!” I said, hoping to cheer him; “but dreams pass away with thelight—even with waking.” There I stopped, for before he spoke I saw the answerin his desolate look round the little place.“No! No! That's all well for people that live in comfort and with those theylove around them. It is a thousand times worse for those who live alone and haveto do so. What cheer is there for me, waking here in the silence of the night,with the wide moor around me full of voices and full of faces that make mywaking a worse dream than my sleep? Ah, young sir, you have no past that cansend its legions to people the darkness and the empty space, and I pray the goodGod that you may never have!” As he spoke, there was such an almost irresistiblegravity of conviction in his manner that I abandoned my remonstrance about hissolitary life. I felt that I was in the presence of some secret influence whichI could not fathom. To my relief, for I knew not what to say, he went on:“Two nights past have I dreamed it. It was hard enough the first night, but Icame through it. Last night the expectation was in itself almost worse than thedream—until the dream came, and then it swept away every remembrance of lesserpain. I stayed awake till just before the dawn, and then it came again, and eversince I have been in such an agony as I am sure the dying feel, and with it allthe dread of tonight.” Before he had got to the end of the sentence my mind wasmade up, and I felt that I could speak to him more cheerfully.“Try and get to sleep early tonight—in fact, before the evening has passed away.The sleep will refresh you, and I promise you there will not be any bad dreamsafter tonight.” He shook his head hopelessly, so I sat a little longer and thenleft him.When I got home I made my arrangements for the night, for I had made up my mindto share Jacob Settle's lonely vigil in his cottage on the moor. I judged thatif he got to sleep before sunset he would wake well before midnight, and so,just as the bells of the city were striking eleven, I stood opposite his doorarmed with a bag, in which were my supper, an extra large flask, a couple ofcandles, and a book. The moonlight was bright, and flooded the whole moor, tillit was almost as light as day; but ever and anon black clouds drove across thesky, and made a darkness which by comparison seemed almost tangible. I openedthe door softly, and entered without waking Jacob, who lay asleep with his whiteface upward. He was still, and again bathed in sweat. I tried to imagine whatvisions were passing before those closed eyes which could bring with them themisery and woe which were stamped on the face, but fancy failed me, and I waitedfor the awakening. It came suddenly, and in a fashion which touched me to thequick, for the hollow groan that broke from the man's white lips as he halfarose and sank back was manifestly the realisation or completion of some trainof thought which had gone before.“If this be dreaming,” said I to myself, “then it must be based on some veryterrible reality. What can have been that unhappy fact that he spoke of?”While I thus spoke, he realised that I was with him. It struck me as strangethat he had no period of that doubt as to whether dream or reality surroundedhim which commonly marks an expected environment of waking men. With a positivecry of joy, he seized my hand and held it in his two wet, trembling hands, as afrightened child clings on to someone whom it loves. I tried to soothe him:“There, there! it is all right. I have come to stay with you tonight, andtogether we will try to fight this evil dream.” He let go my hand suddenly, andsank back on his bed and covered his eyes with his hands.“Fight it?—the evil dream! Ah! no, sir, no! No mortal power can fight thatdream, for it comes from God—and is burned in here;” and he beat upon hisforehead. Then he went on:“It is the same dream, ever the same, and yet it grows in its power to tortureme every time it comes.”“What is the dream?” I asked, thinking that the speaking of it might give himsome relief, but he shrank away from me, and after a long pause said:“No, I had better not tell it. It may not come again.”There was manifestly something to conceal from me—something that lay behind thedream, so I answered:“All right. I hope you have seen the last of it. But if it should come again,you will tell me, will you not? I ask, not out of curiosity, but because I thinkit may relieve you to speak.” He answered with what I thought was almost anundue amount of solemnity:“If it comes again, I shall tell you all.”Then I tried to get his mind away from the subject to more mundane things, so Iproduced supper, and made him share it with me, including the contents of theflask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit my cigar, having given himanother, we smoked a full hour, and talked of many things. Little by little thecomfort of his body stole over his mind, and I could see sleep laying her gentlehands on his eyelids. He felt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right,and I might safely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was goingto see in the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to read as he fellasleep.By degrees I got interested in my book, so interested that presently I wasstartled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that Jacob was stillasleep, and I was rejoiced to see that there was on his face a look of unwontedhappiness, while his lips seemed to move with unspoken words. Then I turned tomy work again, and again woke, but this time to feel chilled to my very marrowby hearing the voice from the bed beside me:“Not with those red hands! Never! never!” On looking at him, I found that he wasstill asleep. He woke, however, in an instant, and did not seem surprised to seeme; there was again that strange apathy as to his surroundings. Then I said:“Settle, tell me your dream. You may speak freely, for I shall hold yourconfidence sacred. While we both live I shall never mention what you may chooseto tell me.”He replied:“I said I would; but I had better tell you first what goes before the dream,that you may understand. I was a schoolmaster when I was a very young man; itwas only a parish school in a little village in the West Country. No need tomention any names. Better not. I was engaged to be married to a young girl whomI loved and almost reverenced. It was the old story. While we were waiting forthe time when we could afford to set up house together, another man came along.He was nearly as young as I was, and handsome, and a gentleman, with all agentleman's attractive ways for a woman of our class. He would go fishing, andshe would meet him while I was at my work in school. I reasoned with her andimplored her to give him up. I offered to get married at once and go away andbegin the world in a strange country; but she would not listen to anything Icould say, and I could see that she was infatuated with him. Then I to ok it onmyself to meet the man and ask him to deal well with the girl, for I thought hemight mean honestly by her, so that there might be no talk or chance of talk onthe part of others. I went where I should meet him with none by, and we met!”Here Jacob Settle had to pause, for something seemed to rise in his throat, andhe almost gasped for breath. Then he went on:“Sir, as God is above us, there was no selfish thought in my heart that day, Iloved my pretty Mabel too well to be content with a part of her love, and I hadthought of my own unhappiness too often not to have come to realise that,whatever might come to her, my hope was gone. He was insolent to me—you, sir,who are a gentleman, cannot know, perhaps, how galling can be the insolence ofone who is above you in station—but I bore with that. I implored him to dealwell with the girl, for what might be only a pastime of an idle hour with himmight be the breaking of her heart. For I never had a thought of her truth, orthat the worst of harm could come to her—it was only the unhappiness to herheart I feared. But when I asked him when he intended to marry her his laughtergalled me so that I lost my temper and told him that I would not stand by andsee her life made unhappy. Then he grew angry too, and in his anger said suchcruel things of her that then and there I swore he should not live to do herharm. God knows how it came about, for in such moments of passion it is hard toremember the steps from a word to a blow, but I found myself standing over hisdead body, with my hands crimson with the blood that welled from his tornthroat. We were alone and he was a stranger, with none of his kin to seek forhim and murder does not always out—not all at once. His bones may be whiteningstill, for all I know, in the pool of the river where I left him. No onesuspected his absence, or why it was, except my poor Mabel, and she dared notspeak. But it was all in vain, for when I came back again after an absence ofmonths—for I could not live in the place—I learned that her shame had come andthat she had died in it. Hitherto I had been borne up by the thought that my illdeed had saved her future, but now, when I learned that I had been too late, andthat my poor love was smirched with that man's sin, I fled away with the senseof my useless guilt upon me more heavily than I could bear. Ah! sir, you thathave not done such a sin don't know what it is to carry it with you. You maythink that custom makes it easy to you, but it is not so. It grows and growswith every hour, till it becomes intolerable, and with it growing, too, thefeeling that you must for ever stand outside Heaven. You don't know what thatmeans, and I pray God that you never may. Ordinary men, to whom all things arepossible, don't often, if ever, think of Heaven. It is a name, and nothing more,and they are content to wait and let things be, but to those who are doomed tobe shut out for ever you cannot think what it means, you cannot guess or measurethe terrible endless longing to see the gates opened, and to be able to join thewhite figures within.“And this brings me to my dream. It seemed that the portal was before me, withgreat gates of massive steel with bars of the thickness of a mast, rising to thevery clouds, and so close that between them was just a glimpse of a crystalgrotto, on whose shining walls were figured many white-clad forms with facesradiant with joy. When I stood before the gate my heart and my soul were so fullof rapture and longing that I forgot. And there stood at the gate two mightyangels with sweeping wings, and, oh! so stern of countenance. They held each inone hand a flaming sword, and in the other the latchet, which moved to and froat their lightest touch. Nearer were figures all draped in black, with headscovered so that only the eyes were seen, and they handed to each who came whitegarments such as the angels wear. A low murmur came that told that all shouldput on their own robes, and without soil, or the angels would not pass them in,but would smite them down with the flaming swords. I was eager to don my owngarment, and hurriedly threw it over me and stepped swiftly to the gate; but itmoved not, and the angels, loosing the latchet, pointed to my dress, I lookeddown, and was aghast, for the whole robe was smeared with blood. My hands werered; they glittered with the blood that dripped from them as on that day by theriver bank. And then the angels raised their flaming swords to smite me down,and the horror was complete—I awoke. Again, and again, and again, that awfuldream comes to me. I never learn from the experience, I never remember, but atthe beginning the hope is ever there to make the end more appalling; and I knowthat the dream does not come out of the common darkness where the dreams abide,but that it is sent from God as a punishment! Never, never shall I be able topass the gate, for the soil on the angel garments must ever come from thesebloody hands!”I listened as in a spell as Jacob Settle spoke. There was something so far awayin the tone of his voice—something so dreamy and mystic in the eyes that lookedas if through me at some spirit beyond—something so lofty in his very dictionand in such marked contrast to his workworn clothes and his poor surroundingsthat I wondered if the whole thing were not a dream.We were both silent for a long time. I kept looking at the man before me ingrowing wonderment. Now that his confession had been made, his soul, which hadbeen crushed to the very earth, seemed to leap back again to uprightness withsome resilient force. I suppose I ought to have been horrified with his story,but, strange to say, I was not. It certainly is not pleasant to be made therecipient of the confidence of a murderer, but this poor fellow seemed to havehad, not only so much provocation, but so much self-denying purpose in his deedof blood that I did not feel called upon to pass judgment upon him. My purposewas to comfort, so I spoke out with what calmness I could, for my heart wasbeating fast and heavily:“You need not despair, Jacob Settle. God is very good, and His mercy is great.Live on and work on in the hope that some day you may feel that you have atonedfor the past.” Here I paused, for I could see that deep, natural sleep thistime, was creeping upon him. “Go to sleep,” I said; “I shall watch with you hereand we shall have no more evil dreams tonight.”He made an effort to pull himself together, and answered:“I don't know how to thank you for your goodness to me this night, but I thinkyou had best leave me now. I'll try and sleep this out; I feel a weight off mymind since I have told you all. If there's anything of the man left in me, Imust try and fight out life alone.”“I'll go tonight, as you wish it,” I said; “but take my advice, and do not livein such a solitary way. Go among men and women; live among them. Share theirjoys and sorrows, and it will help you to forget. This solitude will make youmelancholy mad.”“I will!” he answered, half unconsciously, for sleep was overmastering him.I turned to go, and he looked after me. When I had touched the latch I droppedit, and, coming back to the bed, held out my hand. He grasped it with both hisas he rose to a sitting posture, and I said my goodnight, trying to cheer him:“Heart, man, heart! There is work in the world for you to do, Jacob Settle. Youcan wear those white robes yet and pass through that gate of steel!”Then I left him.A week after I found his cottage deserted, and on asking at the works was toldthat he had “gone north,” no one exactly knew whither.Two years afterwards, I was staying for a few days with my friend Dr. Munro inGlasgow. He was a busy man, and could not spare much time for going about withme, so I spent my days in excursions to the Trossachs and Loch Katrine and downthe Clyde. On the second last evening of my stay I came back somewhat later thanI had arranged, but found that my host was late too. The maid told me that hehad been sent for to the hospital—a case of accident at the gas-works, and thedinner was postponed an hour; so telling her I would stroll down to find hermaster and walk back with him, I went out. At the hospital I found him washinghis hands preparatory to starting for home. Casually, I asked him what his casewas.“Oh, the usual thing! A rotten rope and men's lives of no account. Two men wereworking in a gasometer, when the rope that held their scaffolding broke. It musthave occurred just before the dinner hour, for no one noticed their absence tillthe men had returned. There was about seven feet of water in the gasometer, sothey had a hard fight for it, poor fellows. However, one of them was alive, justalive, but we have had a hard job to pull him through. It seems that he owes hislife to his mate, for I have never heard of greater heroism. They swam togetherwhile their strength lasted, but at the end they were so done up that even thelights above, and the men slung with ropes, coming down to help them, could notkeep them up. But one of them stood on the bottom and held up his comrade overhis head, and those few breaths made all the difference between life and death.They were a shocking sight when they were taken out, for that water is like apurple dye with the gas and the tar. The man upstairs looked as if he had beenwashed in blood. Ugh!”“And the other?”“Oh, he's worse still. But he must have been a very noble fellow. That struggleunder the water must have been fearful; one can see that by the way the bloodhas been drawn from the extremities. It makes the idea of the Stigmata possibleto look at him. Resolution like this could, you would think, do anything in theworld. Ay! it might almost unbar the gates of Heaven. Look here, old man, it isnot a very pleasant sight, especially just before dinner, but you are a writer,and this is an odd case. Here is something you would not like to miss, for inall human probability you will never see anything like it again.” While he wasspeaking he had brought me into the mortuary of the hospital.On the bier lay a body covered with a white sheet, which was wrapped close roundit.“Looks like a chrysalis, don't it? I say, Jack, if there be anything in the oldmyth that a soul is typified by a butterfly, well, then the one that thischrysalis sent forth was a very noble specimen and took all the sunlight on itswings. See here!” He uncovered the face. Horrible, indeed, it looked, as thoughstained with blood. But I knew him at once, Jacob Settle! My friend pulled thewinding sheet further down.The hands were crossed on the purple breast as they had been reverently placedby some tender-hearted person. As I saw them my heart throbbed with a greatexultation, for the memory of his harrowing dream rushed across my mind. Therewas no stain now on those poor, brave hands, for they were blanched white assnow.And somehow as I looked I felt that the evil dream was all over. That noble soulhad won a way through the gate at last. The white robe had now no stain from thehands that had put it on."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] LIGEIA Image [images/u4.jpg]by Edgar Allan PoeNo introduction to Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) could be adequate or worthy.Master of mystery and macabre, inventor of “detective fiction,” poet, critic,star of the Romantic Movement, Poe in his forty short and tragic years was a godof American literature.LIGEIAAnd the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mystery of thewill, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by natureof its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto deathutterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.JOSEPH GLANVILLI cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I firstbecame acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since elapsed, and mymemory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring thesepoints to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rarelearning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling andenthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heartby paces so steadily and stealthily progressive, that they have been unnoticedand unknown. Yet I believe that I met her first and most frequently in somelarge, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family—I have surely heard herspeak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia!Buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressionsof the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone—by Ligeia—that I bringbefore mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while Iwrite, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the paternal nameof her who was my friend and my bethrothed, and who became the partner of mystudies, and finally the wife of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the partof my Ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I shouldinstitute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own—awildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion? I butindistinctly recall the fact itself—what wonder that I have utterly forgottenthe circumstances which originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever thatspirit which is entitled Romance—if ever she, the wan misty-winged Ashtophet ofidolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then mostsurely she presided over mine.There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is theperson of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latterdays, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quietease of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of herfootfall. She came and departed as a shadow. I was never made aware of herentrance into my closed study, save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, asshe placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden everequaled her. It was the radiance of an opium-dream—an airy and spirit-liftingvision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumberingsouls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of that regular moldwhich we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of theheathen. “There is no exquisite beauty,” says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speakingtruly of all the forms and genera of beauty, “without some strangeness in theproportion.” Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of aclassic regularity—although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed“exquisite,” and felt that there was much of “strangeness” pervading it, yet Ihave tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my ownperception of “the strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty and paleforehead—it was faultless—how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty sodivine!—the skin rivaling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose,the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and then theraven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant, and naturally-curling tresses, settingforth the full force of the Homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” I looked at thedelicate outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of theHebrews had I beheld a similar perfection. There were the same luxurioussmoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline,the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded thesweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly—the magnificentturn of the short upper lip—the soft, voluptuous slumber of the under—thedimples which sported, and the color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with abrilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them inher serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinizedthe formation of the chin—and, here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, thesoftness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek—thecontour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son ofthe Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been, too,that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes.They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race.They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of thevalley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals—in moments of intenseexcitement—that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia.And at such moments was her beauty—in my heated fancy thus it appearedperhaps—the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth—the beauty ofthe fabulous Houri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant ofblack, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The “strangeness,” however,which I found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the formation, or thecolor, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred tothe expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere soundwe intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The expression of theeyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, throughthe whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it—thatsomething more profound than the well of Democritus—which lay far within thepupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed with a passion to discover.Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to metwin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science ofmind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact—never, I believe, noticed in theschools—than in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, weoften find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, inthe end, to remember. And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny ofLigeia's eyes, have I felt approaching the full knowledge of theirexpression—felt it approaching—yet not quite be mine—and so at length entirelydepart! And (strange, oh, strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonestobjects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I mean to saythat, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's beauty passed into my spirit,there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the materialworld, a sentiment such as I felt always around, within me, by her large andluminous orbs. Yet not the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, oreven steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the surveyof a rapidly growing vine—in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, achrysalis, a stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean—in the fallingof a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. And thereare one or two stars in heaven (one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude,double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra) in a telescopicscrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling. I have been filled withit by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passagesfrom books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in avolume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness—who shallsay?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment: “And the will thereinlieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor?For God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness.Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only throughthe weakness of his feeble will.”Length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace, indeed, someremote connection between this passage in the English moralist and a portion ofthe character of Ligeia. An intensity in thought, action, or speech waspossibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volitionwhich, during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediateevidence of its existence. Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, theoutwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to thetumultuous vultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form noestimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once sodelighted and appalled me,—by the almost magical melody, modulation,distinctness, and placidity of her very low voice,—and by the fierce energy(rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wildwords which she habitually uttered.I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense—such as I have neverknown in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as faras my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of Europe, Ihave never known her at fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired becausesimply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the Academy, have I everfound Ligeia at fault? How singularly—how thrillingly, this one point in thenature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon myattention! I said her knowledge was such as I have never known in woman—butwhere breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areasof moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now clearlyperceive that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet Iwas sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with achild-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysicalinvestigation at which I was most busily occupied during the earlier years ofour marriage. With how vast a triumph—with how vivid a delight—with how much ofall that is ethereal in hope did I feel, as she bent over me in studies butlittle sought—but less known,—that delicious vista by slow degrees expandingbefore me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at lengthpass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden.How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, Ibeheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away!Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her presence, herreadings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of thetranscendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant luster of hereyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And nowthose eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which I pored.Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too—too glorious effulgence; thepale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blueveins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of themost gentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and I struggled desperately inspirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife were, tomy astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had been much in herstern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have comewithout its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to convey any just idea ofthe fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the Shadow. I groanedin anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I would have soothed—I would havereasoned; but in the intensity of her wild desire for life—for life—but forlife—solace and reason were alike the uttermost of folly. Yet not until the lastinstance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shakenthe external placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle—grew morelow—yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly utteredwords. My brain reeled as I hearkened, entranced, to a melody more thanmortal—to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known.That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily awarethat, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion. Butin death only was I fully impressed with the strength of her affection. For longhours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of aheart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry. How had Ideserved to be so blessed by such confessions?—how had I deserved to be socursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of my making them? But uponthis subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia's morethan womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthilybestowed, I at length, recognized the principle of her longing, with so wildlyearnest a desire, for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is thiswild longing—it is this eager vehemence of desire for life—but for life—that Ihave no power to portray—no utterance capable of expressing.At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, toher side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many daysbefore. I obeyed her. They were these:—Lo! ‘tis a gala nightWithin the lonesome latter years!An angel throng, bewinged, bedightIn veils, and drowned in tears,Sit in a theatre, to seeA play of hopes and fears,While the orchestra breathes fitfullyThe music of the spheres.Mimes, in the form of God on high,Mutter and mumble low,And hither and thither fly;Mere puppets they, who come and goAt bidding of vast formless thingsThat shift the scenery to and fro,Flapping from out their condor wingsInvisible Wo!That motley drama!—oh, be sureIt shall not be forgot!With its Phantom chased for evermoreBy a crowd that seize it not,Through a circle that ever returneth inTo the self-same spot;And much of Madness, and more of SinAnd Horror, the soul of the plot!But see, amid the mimic rout,A crawling shape intrude!A blood-red thing that writhes from outThe scenic solitude!It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangsThe mimes become its food,And the seraphs sob at vermin fangsIn human gore imbued.Out—out are the lights—out all:And over each quivering form,The curtain, a funeral pall,Comes down with the rush of a storm—And the angels, all pallid and wan,Uprising, unveiling, affirmThat the play is the tragedy, “Man,”And its hero, the conqueror Worm.“O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloftwith a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines—“O God! O DivineFather!—shall these things be undeviatingly so?—shall this conqueror be not onceconquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee? Who—who knoweth the mysteries ofthe will with its vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto deathutterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, andreturned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her last sighs, therecame mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear, anddistinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill: “Man dothnot yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through theweakness of his feeble will.”She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer endurethe lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the Rhine.I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more,very far more, than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased and put in some repair,an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequentedportions of fair England. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, thealmost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honoredmemories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utterabandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of thecountry. Yet although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging aboutit, suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity,and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of morethan regal magnificence within. For such follies, even in childhood, I hadimbibed a taste, and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief.Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered inthe gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in thewild cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tuftedgold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors andmy orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities I must notpause to detail. Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither,in a moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as thesuccessor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady RowenaTrevanion, of Tremaine.There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridalchamber which is not visibly before me. Where were the souls of the haughtyfamily of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass thethreshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? Ihave said, that I minutely remember the details of the chamber—yet I am sadlyforgetful on topics of deep moment; and here there was no system, no keeping, inthe fantastic display to take hold upon the memory. The room lay in a highturret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.Occupying the whole southern face of the pentagonal was the sole window—animmense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice—a single pane, and tinted of aleaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon passing through it, fellwith a ghastly luster on the objects within. Over the upper portion of this hugewindow extended the trellis-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massywalls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty,vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimensof a semi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess ofthis melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, ahuge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforationsso contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpentvitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in variousstations about; and there was the couch, too—the bridal couch—of an Indianmodel, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above. Ineach of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of blackgranite, from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged lidsfull of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! thechief phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in height—even unproportionablyso—were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy andmassive-looking tapestry—tapestry of a material which was found alike as acarpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as acanopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partiallyshaded the window. The material was the richest cloth of gold. It was spottedall over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot indiameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. Butthese figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regardedfrom a single point of view. By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceableto a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. Toone entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; butupon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and, step by step,as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by anendless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of theNorman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effectwas vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continualcurrent of wind behind the draperies—giving a hideous and uneasy animation tothe whole.In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as this—I passed, with the Ladyof Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriage—passed themwith but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of mytemper—that she shunned me, and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving;but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with a hatredbelonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew back (oh, with whatintensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, theentombed. I reveled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of herlofty—her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then,did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own. Inthe excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in the shacklesof the drug), I would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night,or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the wildeagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for thedeparted, I could restore her to the pathways she had abandoned—ah, could it beforever?—upon the earth.About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the Lady Rowena wasattacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow. The fever whichconsumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state ofhalf-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber ofthe turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy,or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. She became atlength convalescent—finally, well. Yet but a second more violent disorder againthrew her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all timesfeeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, ofalarming character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledgeand the great exertions of her physicians. With the increase of the chronicdisease, which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitutionto be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar increasein the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivialcauses of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, ofthe sounds—of the slight sounds—and of the unusual motions among the tapestries,to which she had formerly alluded.One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressingsubject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just awakenedfrom an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety,half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by theside of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She partly arose, andspoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds which she then heard, but which Icould not hear—of motions which she then saw, but which I could not perceive.The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her(what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almostinarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures uponthe wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind.But a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertionsto reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and noattendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited a decanter oflight wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened across thechamber to procure it. But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, twocircumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that somepalpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I sawthat there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lusterthrown from the censer, a shadow—a faint, indefinite shadow of angelicaspect—such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild withthe excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things butlittle, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed thechamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the faintinglady. She had now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself,while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. Itwas then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet,and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was in the act ofraising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall withinthe goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room,three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this Isaw—not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forebore tospeak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have beenbut the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by theterror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent tothe fall of the ruby drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in thedisorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of hermenials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with hershrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me. I gazed withunquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varyingfigures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in thecenser overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of aformer night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen thefaint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and breathing withgreater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon thebed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of Ligeia—and then came back uponmy heart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterablewoe with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still,with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, Iremained gazing upon the body of Rowena.It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken nonote of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from myreverie. I felt that it came from the bed of ebony—the bed of death. I listenedin an agony of superstitious terror—but there was no repetition of the sound. Istrained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse—but there was not theslightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived. I had heard thenoise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely andperseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsedbefore any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. Atlength it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeabletinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken smallveins of the eyelids. Through a species of unutterable horror and awe, for whichthe language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt myheart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of dutyfinally operated to restore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt that wehad been precipitate in our preparations—that Rowena still lived. It wasnecessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogetherapart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants—there were nonewithin call—I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the roomfor many minutes—and this I could not venture to do. I therefore struggled alonein my endeavors to call back the spirit still hovering. In a short period it wascertain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared fromboth eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lipsbecame doubly shriveled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; arepulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body;and all the usual rigorous stiffness immediately supervened. I fell back with ashudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused, and againgave myself up to passionate waking visions of Ligeia.An hour thus elapsed, when (could it be possible?) I was a second time aware ofsome vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I listened—in extremity ofhorror. The sound came again—it was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, Isaw—distinctly saw—a tremor upon the lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed,disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in mybosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. I felt thatmy vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effortthat I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus oncemore had pointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and uponthe cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there waseven a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived; and with redoubled ardor Ibetook myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples andthe hands and used every exertion which experience, and no little medicalreading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsationceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instantafterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue,the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities ofthat which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again (what marvel that I shudderwhile I write?), again there reached my ears a low sob from the region of theebony bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of thatnight? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near the periodof the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how eachterrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death;how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and howeach struggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personalappearance of the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been deadonce again stirred—and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing froma dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any. I had longceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, ahelpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhapsthe least terrible, the least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and nowmore vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energyinto the countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save that the eyelids were yetpressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave stillimparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have dreamed that Rowenahad indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not,even then, altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when, arisingfrom the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with themanner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advancedboldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment.I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected withthe air, the stature, the demeanor, of the figure, rushing hurriedly through mybrain, had paralyzed—had chilled me into stone. I stirred not—but gazed upon theapparition. There was a mad disorder in my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Couldit, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it, indeed, be Rowenaat all—the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why,why should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but then might itnot be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks—there werethe roses as in her noon of life—yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks ofthe living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, mightit not be hers?—but had she then grown taller since her malady? Whatinexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reachedher feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, theghastly cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth into therushing atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and disheveled hair; itwas blacker than the raven wings of midnight. And now slowly opened the eyes ofthe figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,” I shrieked aloud, “canI never—can I never be mistaken—these are the full, and the black, and the wildeyes—of my lost love—of the Lady—of the LADY LIGEIA.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] AT THE HOME OF POE Image [images/u4.jpg]by Frank Belknap Long, Jr.In his seventy-plus years of writing, Frank Belknap Long (1901-1994) garneredmore than his share of awards, foremost of which being the World Fantasy Awardfor Life Achievement (1978), the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Awardfor Lifetime Achievement (1987), and the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award (1977).His prodigious output of works included comic books, non-fiction, fantasy,science fiction, gothic romance, horror, and fantasy.AT THE HOME OF POEA Poem in ProseTo H. P. LovecraftThe home of Poe! It is like a fairy dwelling, a gnomic palace built of theaether of dreams. It is tiny and delicate and lovely, and replete with memoriesof sere leaves in November and of lilies in April. It is a castle of vanishedhopes, of dimly-remembered dreams, of sad memories older than the deluge. Thedead years circle slowly and solemnly around its low white walls, and clothe itin a mystic veil of unseen tears. And many marvellous stories could this quaintlittle old house tell, many weird and cryptic stories of him of the Raven hair,and high, pallid brow, and sad, sweet face, and melancholy mien; and of thebeloved Virginia, that sweet child of a thousand magic visions, child of thelonesome, pale-gray latter years, child of the soft and happy South. And how thedreamer of the spheres must have loved this strange little house. Every nightthe hollow boards of its porch must have echoed to his footfall, and every mornthe great rising sun must have sent its rays through the little window, andbathed the lovely tresses of the dream-child in mystical yellow. And perhapsthere was laughter within the walls of that house—laughter and merriment andsinging. But we know that the Evil One came at last, the grim humourless spectrewho loves not beauty, and is not of this world. And we know that the house ofyouth and of love became a house of death, and that memories bitter as the tearsof a beautiful woman assailed the dreamer within. And at last he himself leftthat house of mourning and sought solace among the stars. But the house remainsa vision out of a magical book; a thing seen darkly as in a looking-glass; butlovely beyond the dreams of mortals, and ineffably sad."},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] THE ALCHEMIST Image [images/u4.jpg]by H.P.

Lovecraft.This story was written in his early career, when he was the tender age ofsixteen or seventeen.THE ALCHEMISTHigh up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are woodednear the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest, stands the oldchateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty battlements have frowned downupon the wild and rugged country-side about, serving as a home and strongholdfor the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the moss-grown castlewalls. These ancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and crumblingunder the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of feudalism oneof the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all France. From itsmachicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons, Counts, and even Kings hadbeen defied, yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footstep of theinvader.But since those glorious years all is changed. A poverty but little above thelevel of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviationby the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the scions of our line frommaintaining their estates in pristine splendour; and the falling stones of thewalls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, theill-paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the saggingfloors, the worm-eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within, all tell agloomy tale of fallen grandeur. As the ages passed, first one, then another ofthe four great turrets were left to ruin, until at last but a single towerhoused the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate.It was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that I,Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Comtes de C—, first saw the light ofday, ninety long years ago. Within these walls, and amongst the dark and shadowyforests, the wild ravines and grottoes of the hillside below, were spent thefirst years of my troubled life. My parents I never knew. My father had beenkilled at the age of thirty-two, a month before I was born, by the fall of astone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle, and mymother having died at my birth, my care and education devolved solely upon oneremaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence, whosename I remember as Pierre. I was an only child, and the lack of companionshipwhich this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised bymy aged guardian in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whoseabodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base ofthe hill. At the time, Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon mebecause my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company.Now I know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of thedread curse upon our line, that were nightly told and magnified by the simpletenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottagehearths.Thus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of mychildhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow-hauntedlibrary of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or purpose through theperpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the sides of the hill near itsfoot. It was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquireda shade of melancholy. Those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark andoccult in nature most strongly claimed my attention.Of my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what smallknowledge of it I was able to gain, seemed to depress me much. Perhaps it was atfirst only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me mypaternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I ever felt at the mentionof my great house, yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to piece togetherdisconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue whichhad begun to falter in approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to acertain circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now becamedimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at which allthe Comtes of my line had met their end. Whilst I had hitherto considered thisbut a natural attribute of a family of short-lived men, I afterward ponderedlong upon these premature deaths, and began to connect them with the wanderingsof the old man, who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented thelives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirty-twoyears. Upon my twenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a familydocument which he said had for many generations been handed down from father toson, and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of the most startlingnature, and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions. At this time,my belief in the supernatural was firm and deep-seated, else I should havedismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes.The paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when the oldcastle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress. It told of acertain ancient man who had once dwelt on our estates, a person of no smallaccomplishments, though little above the rank of peasant; by name, Michel,usually designated by the surname of Mauvais, the Evil, on account of hissinister reputation. He had studied beyond the custom of his kind, seeking suchthings as the Philosopher's Stone, or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and wasreputed wise in the terrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvaishad one son, named Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts,and who had therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the Wizard. This pair, shunnedby all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous practices. Old Michel wassaid to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and theunaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at thedreaded door of these two. Yet through the dark natures of the father and theson ran one redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring withfierce intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filialaffection.One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by thevanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri, the Comte. A searching party, headedby the frantic father, invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came uponold Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron. Withoutcertain cause, in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair, the Comte laidhands on the aged wizard, and ere he released his murderous hold his victim wasno more. Meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming aloud the finding of youngGodfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too latethat poor Michel had been killed in vain. As the Comte and his associates turnedaway from the lowly abode of the alchemists, the form of Charles Le Sorcierappeared through the trees. The excited chatter of the menials standing abouttold him what had occurred, yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father's fate.Then, slowly advancing to meet the Comte, he pronounced in dull yet terribleaccents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of C—.“May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line Survive to reach a greater age thanthine!” spake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood, he drewfrom his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw in the face of hisfather's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night. TheComte died without utterance, and was buried the next day, but little more thantwo and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No trace of the assassin couldbe found, though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighboring woods andthe meadow-land around the hill.Thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the mindsof the late Comte's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent cause of the wholetragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an arrow whilst hunting, at theage of thirty-two, there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise. Butwhen, years afterward, the next young Comte, Robert by name, was found dead in anearby field from no apparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that theirseigneur had but lately passed his thirty-second birthday when surprised byearly death. Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the samefateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle;Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy and virtuous liveswhen a little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder.That I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certainto me by the words which I read. My life, previously held at small value, nowbecame dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and deeper into the mysteriesof the hidden world of black magic. Isolated as I was, modern science hadproduced no impression upon me, and I laboured as in the Middle Ages, as wraptas had been old Michel and young Charles themselves in the acquisition ofdemonological and alchemical learning. Yet read as I might, in no manner could Iaccount for the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments, Iwould even go so far as to seek a natural explanation, attributing the earlydeaths of my ancestors to the sinister Charles Le Sorcier and his heirs; yethaving found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of thealchemist, I would fall back to my occult studies, and once more endeavour tofind a spell that would release my house from its terrible burden. Upon onething I was absolutely resolved. I should never wed, for since no other branchesof my family were in existence, I might thus end the curse with myself.As I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land beyond.Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had lovedto wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only humancreature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began tocease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciledto the fate which so many of my ancestors had met. Much of my time was nowoccupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of theold chateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which oldPierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over fourcenturies. Strange and awsome were many of the objects I encountered. Furniture,covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness met myeyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere, andhuge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwiseuntenanted gloom.Of my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful record, foreach movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library tolled off somuch more of my doomed existence. At length I approached that time which I hadso long viewed with apprehension. Since most of my ancestors had been seizedsome little while before they reached the exact age of the Comte Henri at hisend, I was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death. Inwhat strange form the curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was resolvedat least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With newvigour I applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents.It was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the desertedportion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour which I felt mustmark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond which I could have not eventhe slightest hope of continuing to draw breath, that I came upon theculminating event of my whole life. I had spent the better part of the morningin climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated ofthe ancient turrets. As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels,descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, ora more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed thenitre-encrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase, the paving becamevery damp, and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank,water-stained wall impeded my journey. Turning to retrace my steps, my eye fellupon a small trap-door with a ring, which lay directly beneath my feet. Pausing,I succeeded with difficulty in raising it, whereupon there was revealed a blackaperture, exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter, anddisclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps. As soon asthe torch, which I lowered into the repellent depths, burned freely andsteadily, I commenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to a narrowstone-flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. This passage provedof great length, and terminated in a massive oaken door, dripping with themoisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it. Ceasingafter a time my efforts in this direction, I had proceeded back some distancetoward the steps, when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the mostprofound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind. Withoutwarning, I heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rustedhinges. My immediate sensations are incapable of analysis. To be confronted in aplace as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with evidence of thepresence of man or spirit, produced in my brain a horror of the most acutedescription. When at last I turned and faced the seat of the sound, my eyes musthave started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld. There in theancient Gothic doorway stood a human figure. It was that of a man clad in askull-cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour. His long hair and flowingbeard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible profusion. Hisforehead, high beyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep sunken and heavilylined with wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like and gnarled, were of such adeathly, marble-like whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man. Hisfigure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent and almostlost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But strangest of allwere his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness; profound in expression ofunderstanding, yet inhuman in degree of wickedness. These were now fixed uponme, piercing my soul with their hatred, and rooting me to the spot whereon Istood. At last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through withits dull hollowness and latent malevolence. The language in which the discoursewas clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned menof the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into theworks of the old alchemists and demonologists. The apparition spoke of the cursewhich had hovered over my house, told me of my coming end, dwelt on the wrongperpetrated by my ancestor against old Michel Mauvais, and gloated over therevenge of Charles Le Sorcier. He told me how the young Charles had escaped intothe night, returning in after years to kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow justas he approached the age which had been his father's at his assassination; howhe had secretly returned to the estate and established himself, unknown, in theeven then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideousnarrator; how he had seized Robert, son of Godfrey, in a field, forced poisondown his throat and left him to die at the age of thirty-two, thus maintainingthe foul provisions of his vengeful curse. At this point I was left to imaginethe solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilledsince that time when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of nature have died,for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the twowizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of CharlesLe Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of iteternal life and youth.His enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes thehatred that had at first so haunted them, but suddenly the fiendish glarereturned, and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent, the strangerraised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had Charles LeSorcier, six hundred years before, ended that of my ancestor. Prompted by somepreserving instinct of self-defense, I broke through the spell that had hithertoheld me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced myexistence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passageas the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with aghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by thewould-be assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell proneupon the slimy floor in a total faint.When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mindremembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more; yetcuriosity overmastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of evil, and howcame he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to avenge the death of poorMichel Mauvais, and how had the curse been carried on through all the longcenturies since the time of Charles Le Sorcier? The dread of years was liftedoff my shoulders, for I knew that he whom I had felled was the source of all mydanger from the curse; and now that I was free, I burned with the desire tolearn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries, andmade of my own youth one long-continued nightmare. Determined upon furtherexploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the unused torchwhich I had with me. First of all, the new light revealed the distorted andblackened form of the mysterious stranger. The hideous eyes were now closed.Disliking the sight, I turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothicdoor. Here I found what seemed much like an alchemist's laboratory. In onecorner was an immense pile of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously inthe light of the torch. It may have been gold, but I did not pause to examineit, for I was strangely affected by that which I had undergone. At the fartherend of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wildravines of the dark hillside forest. Filled with wonder, yet now realizing howthe man had obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded to return. I hadintended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face, but as Iapproached the body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound, as thoughlife were not yet wholly extinct. Aghast, I turned to examine the charred andshrivelled figure on the floor.Then all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face in whichthey were set, opened wide with an expression which I was unable to interpret.The cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not well understand. Once Icaught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again I fancied that the words“years” and “curse” issued from the twisted mouth. Still I was at a loss togather the purport of his disconnected speech. At my evident ignorance of hismeaning, the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me, until, helplessas I saw my opponent to be, I trembled as I watched him.Suddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised hishideous head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I remained, paralyzedwith fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those wordswhich have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights. “Fool,” he shrieked,“can you not guess my secret? Have you no brain whereby you may recognize thewill which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon yourhouse? Have I not told you of the great elixir of eternal life? Know you not howthe secret of Alchemy was solved? I tell you, it is I! I! I! that have lived forsix hundred years to maintain my revenge, FOR I AM CHARLES LE SORCIER!”"},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] DICKON THE DEVIL Image [images/u4.jpg]by Joseph Sheridan Le FanuGrandson of Irish playwright Alicia Sheridan LeFanu and grand-nephew of theequally celebrated playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Joseph Le Fanu(1814-1873) carved out (in his lifetime) his own immortal place as a foundingfather of horror (although he would have probably preferred we use the term“Dark Romanticism.”) His specialty: the ghost story. A singular characteristicof a La Fanu tale obliges the reader to speculate that there are hiddensupernatural forces at work even if it is likely there is a reasonable andrational explanation to the mystery. “Dickon the Devil” is a jewel-box samplingof La Fanu's lush and descriptive style.DICKON THE DEVILAbout thirty years ago I was selected by two rich old maids to visit a propertyin that part of Lancashire which lies near the famous forest of Pendle, withwhich Mr. Ainsworth's “Lancashire Witches” has made us so pleasantly familiar.My business was to make partition of a small property, including a house anddemesne to which they had, a long time before, succeeded as coheiresses.The last forty miles of my journey I was obliged to post, chiefly bycross-roads, little known, and less frequented, and presenting scenery oftenextremely interesting and pretty. The picturesqueness of the landscape wasenhanced by the season, the beginning of September, at which I was travelling.I had never been in this part of the world before; I am told it is now a greatdeal less wild, and, consequently, less beautiful.At the inn where I had stopped for a relay of horses and some dinner—for it wasthen past five o'clock—I found the host, a hale old fellow of five-and-sixty, ashe told me, a man of easy and garrulous benevolence, willing to accommodate hisguests with any amount of talk, which the slightest tap sufficed to set flowing,on any subject you pleased.I was curious to learn something about Barwyke, which was the name of thedemesne and house I was going to. As there was no inn within some miles of it, Ihad written to the steward to put me up there, the best way he could, for anight.The host of the “Three Nuns,” which was the sign under which he entertainedwayfarers, had not a great deal to tell. It was twenty years, or more, since oldSquire Bowes died, and no one had lived in the Hall ever since, except thegardener and his wife.“Tom Wyndsour will be as old a man as myself; but he's a bit taller, and not somuch in flesh, quite,” said the fat innkeeper.“But there were stories about the house,” I repeated, “that, they said,prevented tenants from coming into it?”“Old wives' tales; many years ago, that will be, sir; I forget ‘em; I forget ‘emall. Oh yes, there always will be, when a house is left so; foolish folk willalways be talkin'; but I han't heard a word about it this twenty year.”It was vain trying to pump him; the old landlord of the “Three Nuns,” for somereason, did not choose to tell tales of Barwyke Hall, if he really did, as Isuspected, remember them.I paid my reckoning, and resumed my journey, well pleased with the good cheer ofthat old-world inn, but a little disappointed.We had been driving for more than an hour, when we began to cross a wild common;and I knew that, this passed, a quarter of an hour would bring me to the door ofBarwyke Hall.The peat and furze were pretty soon left behind; we were again in the woodedscenery that I enjoyed so much, so entirely natural and pretty, and so littledisturbed by traffic of any kind. I was looking from the chaise-window, and soondetected the object of which, for some time, my eye had been in search. BarwykeHall was a large, quaint house, of that cage-work fashion known as“black-and-white,” in which the bars and angles of an oak framework contrast,black as ebony, with the white plaster that overspreads the masonry built intoits interstices. This steep-roofed Elizabethan house stood in the midst ofpark-like grounds of no great extent, but rendered imposing by the noble statureof the old trees that now cast their lengthening shadows eastward over thesward, from the declining sun.The park-wall was gray with age, and in many places laden with ivy. In deep grayshadow, that contrasted with the dim fires of evening reflected on the foliageabove it, in a gentle hollow, stretched a lake that looked cold and black, andseemed, as it were, to skulk from observation with a guilty knowledge.I had forgot that there was a lake at Barwyke; but the moment this caught myeye, like the cold polish of a snake in the shadow, my instinct seemed torecognize something dangerous, and I knew that the lake was connected, I couldnot remember how, with the story I had heard of this place in my boyhood.I drove up a grass-grown avenue, under the boughs of these noble trees, whosefoliage, dyed in autumnal red and yellow, returned the beams of the western sungorgeously.We drew up at the door. I got out, and had a good look at the front of thehouse; it was a large and melancholy mansion, with signs of long neglect uponit; great wooden shutters, in the old fashion, were barred, outside, across thewindows; grass, and even nettles, were growing thick on the courtyard, and athin moss streaked the timber beams; the plaster was discolored by time andweather, and bore great russet and yellow stains. The gloom was increased byseveral grand old trees that crowded close about the house.I mounted the steps, and looked round; the dark lake lay near me now, a littleto the left. It was not large; it may have covered some ten or twelve acres; butit added to the melancholy of the scene. Near the centre of it was a smallisland, with two old ash-trees, leaning toward each other, their pensive imagesreflected in the stirless water. The only cheery influence of this scene ofantiquity, solitude, and neglect was that the house and landscape were warmedwith the ruddy western beams. I knocked, and my summons resounded hollow andungenial in my ear; and the bell, from far away, returned a deep-mouthed andsurly ring, as if it resented being roused from a score years' slumber.A light-limbed, jolly-looking old fellow, in a barracan jacket and gaiters, witha smirk of welcome, and a very sharp, red nose, that seemed to promise goodcheer, opened the door with a promptitude that indicated a hospitableexpectation of my arrival.There was but little light in the hall, and that little lost itself in darknessin the background. It was very spacious and lofty, with a gallery running roundit, which, when the door was open, was visible at two or three points. Almost inthe dark my new acquaintance led me across this wide hall into the room destinedfor my reception. It was spacious, and wainscoted up to the ceiling. Thefurniture of this capacious chamber was old-fashioned and clumsy. There werecurtains still to the windows, and a piece of Turkey carpet lay upon the floor;those windows were two in number, looking out, through the trunks of the treesclose to the house, upon the lake. It needed all the fire, and all the pleasantassociations of my entertainer's red nose, to light up this melancholy chamber.A door at its farther end admitted to the room that was prepared for my sleepingapartment. It was wainscoted, like the other. It had a four-post bed, with heavytapestry curtains, and in other respects was furnished in the same old-world andponderous style as the other room. Its window, like those of that apartment,looked out upon the lake.Sombre and sad as these rooms were, they were yet scrupulously clean. I hadnothing to complain of; but the effect was rather dispiriting. Having given somedirections about supper—a pleasant incident to look forward to—and made a rapidtoilet, I called on my friend with the gaiters and red nose (Tom Wyndsour),whose occupation was that of a “bailiff,” or under-steward, of the property, toaccompany me, as we had still an hour or so of sun and twilight, in a walk overthe grounds.It was a sweet autumn evening, and my guide, a hardy old fellow, strode at apace that tasked me to keep up with.Among clumps of trees at the northern boundary of the demesne we lighted uponthe little antique parish church. I was looking down upon it, from an eminence,and the park-wall interposed; but a little way down was a stile affording accessto the road, and by this we approached the iron gate of the churchyard. I sawthe church door open; the sexton was replacing his pick, shovel, and spade, withwhich he had just been digging a grave in the churchyard, in their littlerepository under the stone stair of the tower. He was a polite, shrewd littlehunchback, who was very happy to show me over the church. Among the monumentswas one that interested me; it was erected to commemorate the very Squire Bowesfrom whom my two old maids had inherited the house and estate of Barwyke. Itspoke of him in terms of grandiloquent eulogy, and informed the Christian readerthat he had died, in the bosom of the Church of England, at the age ofseventy-one.I read this inscription by the parting beams of the setting sun, whichdisappeared behind the horizon just as we passed out from under the porch.“Twenty years since the Squire died,” said I, reflecting, as I loitered still inthe churchyard.“Ay, sir; ‘twill be twenty year the ninth o' last month.”“And a very good old gentleman?”“Good-natured enough, and an easy gentleman he was, sir; I don't think while helived he ever hurt a fly,” acquiesced Tom Wyndsour. “It ain't always easy sayin'what's in ‘em, though, and what they may take or turn to afterward; and some o'them sort, I think, goes mad.”“You don't think he was out of his mind?” I asked.“He? La! no; not he, sir; a bit lazy, mayhap, like other old fellows; but a knewdevilish well what he was about.”Tom Wyndsour's account was a little enigmatical; but, like old Squire Bowes, Iwas “a bit lazy” that evening, and asked no more questions about him.We got over the stile upon the narrow road that skirts the churchyard. It isoverhung by elms more than a hundred years old, and in the twilight, which nowprevailed, was growing very dark. As side-by-side we walked along this road,hemmed in by two loose stone-like walls, something running toward us in azig-zag line passed us at a wild pace, with a sound like a frightened laugh or ashudder, and I saw, as it passed, that it was a human figure. I may confess,now, that I was a little startled. The dress of this figure was, in part, white:I know I mistook it at first for a white horse coming down the road at a gallop.Tom Wyndsour turned about and looked after the retreating figure.“He'll be on his travels to-night,” he said, in a low tone. “Easy served with abed, that lad be; six foot o' dry peat or heath, or a nook in a dry ditch. Thatlad hasn't slept once in a house this twenty year, and never will while grassgrows.”“Is he mad?” I asked.“Something that way, sir; he's an idiot, an awpy; we call him ‘Dickon thedevil,’ because the devil's almost the only word that's ever in his mouth.”It struck me that this idiot was in some way connected with the story of oldSquire Bowes.“Queer things are told of him, I dare say?” I suggested.“More or less, sir; more or less. Queer stories, some.”“Twenty years since he slept in a house? That's about the time the Squire died,”I continued.“So it will be, sir; not very long after.”“You must tell me all about that, Tom, to-night, when I can hear it comfortably,after supper.”Tom did not seem to like my invitation; and looking straight before him as wetrudged on, he said:“You see, sir, the house has been quiet, and nout's been troubling folk insidethe walls or out, all round the woods of Barwyke, this ten year, or more; and myold woman, down there, is clear against talking about such matters, and thinksit best—and so do I—to let sleepin' dogs be.”He dropped his voice toward the close of the sentence, and nodded significantly.We soon reached a point where he unlocked a wicket in the park wall, by which weentered the grounds of Barwyke once more.The twilight deepening over the landscape, the huge and solemn trees, and thedistant outline of the haunted house, exercised a sombre influence on me, which,together with the fatigue of a day of travel, and the brisk walk we had had,disinclined me to interrupt the silence in which my companion now indulged.A certain air of comparative comfort, on our arrival, in great measuredissipated the gloom that was stealing over me. Although it was by no means acold night, I was very glad to see some wood blazing in the grate; and a pair ofcandles aiding the light of the fire, made the room look cheerful. A smalltable, with a very white cloth, and preparations for supper, was also a veryagreeable object.I should have liked very well, under these influences, to have listened to TomWyndsour's story; but after supper I grew too sleepy to attempt to lead him tothe subject; and after yawning for a time, I found there was no use incontending against my drowsiness, so I betook myself to my bedroom, and by teno'clock was fast asleep.What interruption I experienced that night I shall tell you presently. It wasnot much, but it was very odd.By next night I had completed my work at Barwyke. From early morning till then Iwas so incessantly occupied and hard-worked, that I had no time to think overthe singular occurrence to which I have just referred. Behold me, however, atlength once more seated at my little supper-table, having ended a comfortablemeal. It had been a sultry day, and I had thrown one of the large windows up ashigh as it would go. I was sitting near it, with my brandy and water at myelbow, looking out into the dark. There was no moon, and the trees that aregrouped about the house make the darkness round it supernaturally profound onsuch nights.“Tom,” said I, so soon as the jug of hot punch I had supplied him with began toexercise its genial and communicative influence; “you must tell me who besideyour wife and you and myself slept in the house last night.”Tom, sitting near the door, set down his tumbler, and looked at me askance,while you might count seven, without speaking a word.“Who else slept in the house?” he repeated, very deliberately. “Not a livingsoul, sir;” and he looked hard at me, still evidently expecting something more.“That is very odd,” I said, returning his stare, and feeling really a littleodd. “You are sure you were not in my room last night?”“Not till I came to call you, sir, this morning; I can make oath of that.”“Well,” said I, “there was some one there, I can make oath of that. I was sotired I could not make up my mind to get up; but I was waked by a sound that Ithought was some one flinging down the two tin boxes in which my papers werelocked up violently on the floor. I heard a slow step on the ground, and therewas light in the room, although I remembered having put out my candle. I thoughtit must have been you, who had come in for my clothes, and upset the boxes byaccident. Whoever it was, he went out, and the light with him. I was about tosettle again, when, the curtain being a little open at the foot of the bed, Isaw a light on the wall opposite; such as a candle from outside would cast ifthe door were very cautiously opening. I started up in the bed, drew the sidecurtain, and saw that the door was opening, and admitting light from outside. Itis close, you know, to the head of the bed. A hand was holding on the edge ofthe door and pushing it open; not a bit like yours; a very singular hand. Let melook at yours.”He extended it for my inspection.“Oh no; there's nothing wrong with your hand. This was differently shaped;fatter; and the middle finger was stunted, and shorter than the rest, looking asif it had once been broken, and the nail was crooked like a claw. I called out,“Who's there?” and the light and the hand were withdrawn, and I saw and heard nomore of my visitor.”“So sure as you're a living man, that was him!” exclaimed Tom Wyndsour, his verynose growing pale, and his eyes almost starting out of his head.“Who?” I asked.“Old Squire Bowes; ‘twas his hand you saw; the Lord a' mercy on us!” answeredTom. “The broken finger, and the nail bent like a hoop. Well for you, sir, hedidn't come back when you called, that time. You came here about them MissDymock's business, and he never meant they should have a foot o' ground inBarwyke; and he was making a will to give it away quite different, when deathtook him short. He never was uncivil to no one; but he couldn't abide themladies. My mind misgave me when I heard ‘twas about their business you werecoming; and now you see how it is; he'll be at his old tricks again!”With some pressure, and a little more punch, I induced Tom Wyndsour to explainhis mysterious allusions by recounting the occurrences which followed the oldSquire's death.“Squire Bowes, of Barwyke, died without making a will, as you know,” said Tom.“And all the folk round were sorry; that is to say, sir, as sorry as folk willbe for an old man that has seen a long tale of years, and has no right togrumble that death has knocked an hour too soon at his door. The Squire was wellliked; he was never in a passion, or said a hard word; and he would not hurt afly; and that made what happened after his decease the more surprising.“The first thing these ladies did, when they got the property, was to buy stockfor the park.“It was not wise, in any case, to graze the land on their own account. But theylittle knew all they had to contend with.“Before long something went wrong with the cattle; first one, and then another,took sick and died, and so on, till the loss began to grow heavy. Then, queerstories, little by little, began to be told. It was said, first by one, then byanother, that Squire Bowes was seen, about evening time, walking, just as heused to do when he was alive, among the old trees, leaning on his stick; and,sometimes, when he came up with the cattle, he would stop and lay his handkindly like on the back of one of them; and that one was sure to fall sick nextday, and die soon after.“No one ever met him in the park, or in the woods, or ever saw him, except agood distance off. But they knew his gait and his figure well, and the clotheshe used to wear; and they could tell the beast he laid his hand on by itscolor—white, dun, or black; and that beast was sure to sicken and die. Theneighbors grew shy of taking the path over the park; and no one liked to walk inthe woods, or come inside the bounds of Barwyke; and the cattle went onsickening and dying, as before.“At that time there was one Thomas Pyke; he had been a groom to the old Squire;and he was in care of the place, and was the only one that used to sleep in thehouse.“Tom was vexed, hearing these stories; which he did not believe the half on ‘em;and more especial as he could not get man or boy to herd the cattle; all beingafeared. So he wrote to Matlock, in Derbyshire, for his brother, Richard Pyke, aclever lad, and one that knew nout o' the story of the old Squire walking.“Dick came; and the cattle was better; folk said they could still see the oldSquire, sometimes, walking, as before, in openings of the wood, with his stickin his hand; but he was shy of coming nigh the cattle, whatever his reason mightbe, since Dickon Pyke came; and he used to stand a long bit off, looking atthem, with no more stir in him than a trunk o' one of the old trees, for an hourat a time, till the shape melted away, little by little, like the smoke of afire that burns out.“Tom Pyke and his brother Dickon, being the only living souls in the house, layin the big bed in the servants' room, the house being fast barred and locked,one night in November.“Tom was lying next the wall, and, he told me, as wide awake as ever he was atnoonday. His brother Dickon lay outside, and was sound asleep.“Well, as Tom lay thinking, with his eyes turned toward the door, it opensslowly, and who should come in but old Squire Bowes, his face lookin' as dead ashe was in his coffin.“Tom's very breath left his body; he could not take his eyes off him; and hefelt the hair rising up on his head.“The Squire came to the side of the bed, and put his arms under Dickon, andlifted the boy—in a dead sleep all the time—and carried him out so, at the door.“Such was the appearance, to Tom Pyke's eyes, and he was ready to swear to it,anywhere.“When this happened, the light, wherever it came from, all on a sudden went out,and Tom could not see his own hand before him.“More dead than alive, he lay till daylight.“Sure enough his brother Dickon was gone. No sign of him could he discover aboutthe house; and with some trouble he got a couple of the neighbors to help him tosearch the woods and grounds. Not a sign of him anywhere.“At last one of them thought of the island in the lake; the little boat wasmoored to the old post at the water's edge. In they got, though with small hopeof finding him there. Find him, nevertheless, they did, sitting under the bigash-tree, quite out of his wits; and to all their questions he answered nothingbut one cry—‘Bowes, the devil! See him; see him; Bowes, the devil!’ An idiotthey found him; and so he will be till God sets all things right. No one couldever get him to sleep under roof-tree more. He wanders from house to house whiledaylight lasts; and no one cares to lock the harmless creature in the workhouse.And folk would rather not meet him after nightfall, for they think where he isthere may be worse things near.”A silence followed Tom's story. He and I were alone in that large room; I wassitting near the open window, looking into the dark night air. I fancied I sawsomething white move across it; and I heard a sound like low talking, thatswelled into a discordant shriek—“Hoo-oo-oo! Bowes, the devil! Over yourshoulder. Hoo-oo-oo! ha! ha! ha!” I started up, and saw, by the light of thecandle with which Tom strode to the window, the wild eyes and blighted face ofthe idiot, as, with a sudden change of mood, he drew off, whispering andtittering to himself, and holding up his long fingers, and looking at them as ifthey were lighted at the tips like a “hand of glory.”Tom pulled down the window. The story and its epilogue were over. I confessed Iwas rather glad when I heard the sound of the horses' hoofs on the courtyard, afew minutes later; and still gladder when, having bidden Tom a kind farewell, Ihad left the neglected house of Barwyke a mile behind me."},{"pageContent":"THE WHITE PEOPLEby Arthur MachenBorn Arthur Llewelyn Jones (he would later adopt his wife's maiden name, Machen,to acquire an inheritance) in Caerleon, Monmouthshire (Gwent) Wales, ArthurMachen (1863-1947) is one of the most colorful and interesting figures inEnglish literature. In his eventful life, he played the part of essayist,novelist, war correspondent, magician, philosopher, actor, and critic. He hadmuch in common with another of our authors, Aleister Crowley. Both wereoccultists with a passion for magic, alchemy, and the darker side of the humanpsyche. Both were for a time members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,and colleagues of one of the Order's most illustrious adepts, Arthur EdwardWaite.Machen's story “The White People” is a subtle masterpiece of the most horrifickind, published in 1904 and often described as the greatest of all short horrorstories.PROLOGUE“Sorcery and sanctity,” said Ambrose, “these are the only realities. Each is anecstasy, a withdrawal from the common life.”Cotgrave listened, interested. He had been brought by a friend to thismouldering house in a northern suburb, through an old garden to the room whereAmbrose the recluse dozed and dreamed over his books.“Yes,” he went on, “magic is justified of her children. There are many, I think,who eat dry crusts and drink water, with a joy infinitely sharper than anythingwithin the experience of the ‘practical’ epicure.”“You are speaking of the saints?”“Yes, and of the sinners, too. I think you are falling into the very generalerror of confining the spiritual world to the supremely good; but the supremelywicked, necessarily, have their portion in it. The merely carnal, sensual mancan no more be a great sinner than he can be a great saint. Most of us are justindifferent, mixed-up creatures; we muddle through the world without realizingthe meaning and the inner sense of things, and, consequently, our wickedness andour goodness are alike second-rate, unimportant.”“And you think the great sinner, then, will be an ascetic, as well as the greatsaint?”“Great people of all kinds forsake the imperfect copies and go to the perfectoriginals. I have no doubt but that many of the very highest among the saintshave never done a ‘good action’ (using the words in their ordinary sense). And,on the other hand, there have been those who have sounded the very depths ofsin, who all their lives have never done an ‘ill deed.’”He went out of the room for a moment, and Cotgrave, in high delight, turned tohis friend and thanked him for the introduction.“He's grand,” he said. “I never saw that kind of lunatic before.”Ambrose returned with more whisky and helped the two men in a liberal manner. Heabused the teetotal sect with ferocity, as he handed the seltzer, and pouringout a glass of water for himself, was about to resume his monologue, whenCotgrave broke in—“I can't stand it, you know,” he said, “your paradoxes are too monstrous. A manmay be a great sinner and yet never do anything sinful! Come!”“You're quite wrong,” said Ambrose. “I never make paradoxes; I wish I could. Imerely said that a man may have an exquisite taste in Romanée Conti, and yetnever have even smelt four ale. That's all, and it's more like a truism than aparadox, isn't it? Your surprise at my remark is due to the fact that youhaven't realized what sin is. Oh, yes, there is a sort of connexion between Sinwith the capital letter, and actions which are commonly called sinful: withmurder, theft, adultery, and so forth. Much the same connexion that there isbetween the A, B, C and fine literature. But I believe that the misconception—itis all but universal—arises in great measure from our looking at the matterthrough social spectacles. We think that a man who does evil to us and to hisneighbours must be very evil. So he is, from a social standpoint; but can't yourealize that Evil in its essence is a lonely thing, a passion of the solitary,individual soul? Really, the average murderer, quâ murderer, is not by any meansa sinner in the true sense of the word. He is simply a wild beast that we haveto get rid of to save our own necks from his knife. I should class him ratherwith tigers than with sinners.”“It seems a little strange.”“I think not. The murderer murders not from positive qualities, but fromnegative ones; he lacks something which non-murderers possess. Evil, of course,is wholly positive—only it is on the wrong side. You may believe me that sin inits proper sense is very rare; it is probable that there have been far fewersinners than saints. Yes, your standpoint is all very well for practical, socialpurposes; we are naturally inclined to think that a person who is verydisagreeable to us must be a very great sinner! It is very disagreeable to haveone's pocket picked, and we pronounce the thief to be a very great sinner. Intruth, he is merely an undeveloped man. He cannot be a saint, of course; but hemay be, and often is, an infinitely better creature than thousands who havenever broken a single commandment. He is a great nuisance to us, I admit, and wevery properly lock him up if we catch him; but between his troublesome andunsocial action and evil—Oh, the connexion is of the weakest.”It was getting very late. The man who had brought Cotgrave had probably heardall this before, since he assisted with a bland and judicious smile, butCotgrave began to think that his “lunatic” was turning into a sage.“Do you know,” he said, “you interest me immensely? You think, then, that we donot understand the real nature of evil?”“No, I don't think we do. We over-estimate it and we under-estimate it. We takethe very numerous infractions of our social ‘bye-laws’—the very necessary andvery proper regulations which keep the human company together—and we getfrightened at the prevalence of ‘sin’ and ‘evil.’ But this is really nonsense.Take theft, for example. Have you any horror at the thought of Robin Hood, ofthe Highland caterans of the seventeenth century, of the moss-troopers, of thecompany promoters of our day?“Then, on the other hand, we underrate evil. We attach such an enormousimportance to the ‘sin’ of meddling with our pockets (and our wives) that wehave quite forgotten the awfulness of real sin.”“And what is sin?” said Cotgrave.“I think I must reply to your question by another. What would your feelings be,seriously, if your cat or your dog began to talk to you, and to dispute with youin human accents? You would be overwhelmed with horror. I am sure of it. And ifthe roses in your garden sang a weird song, you would go mad. And suppose thestones in the road began to swell and grow before your eyes, and if the pebblethat you noticed at night had shot out stony blossoms in the morning? Well,these examples may give you some notion of what sin really is.”“Look here,” said the third man, hitherto placid, “you two seem pretty wellwound up. But I'm going home. I've missed my tram, and I shall have to walk.”Ambrose and Cotgrave seemed to settle down more profoundly when the other hadgone out into the early misty morning and the pale light of the lamps.“You astonish me,” said Cotgrave. “I had never thought of that. If that isreally so, one must turn everything upside down. Then the essence of sin reallyis—”“In the taking of heaven by storm, it seems to me,” said Ambrose. “It appears tome that it is simply an attempt to penetrate into another and higher sphere in aforbidden manner. You can understand why it is so rare. There are few, indeed,who wish to penetrate into other spheres, higher or lower, in ways allowed orforbidden. Men, in the mass, are amply content with life as they find it.Therefore there are few saints, and sinners (in the proper sense) are fewerstill, and men of genius, who partake sometimes of each character, are rarealso. Yes; on the whole, it is, perhaps, harder to be a great sinner than agreat saint.”“There is something profoundly unnatural about sin? Is that what you mean?”“Exactly. Holiness requires as great, or almost as great, an effort; butholiness works on lines that were natural once; it is an effort to recover theecstasy that was before the Fall. But sin is an effort to gain the ecstasy andthe knowledge that pertain alone to angels, and in making this effort manbecomes a demon. I told you that the mere murderer is not therefore a sinner;that is true, but the sinner is sometimes a murderer. Gilles de Raiz is aninstance. So you see that while the good and the evil are unnatural to man as henow is—to man the social, civilized being—evil is unnatural in a much deepersense than good. The saint endeavours to recover a gift which he has lost; thesinner tries to obtain something which was never his. In brief, he repeats theFall.”“But are you a Catholic?” said Cotgrave.“Yes; I am a member of the persecuted Anglican Church.”“Then, how about those texts which seem to reckon as sin that which you wouldset down as a mere trivial dereliction?”“Yes; but in one place the word “sorcerers” comes in the same sentence, doesn'tit? That seems to me to give the key-note. Consider: can you imagine for amoment that a false statement which saves an innocent man's life is a sin? No;very good, then, it is not the mere liar who is excluded by those words; it is,above all, the ‘sorcerers’ who use the material life, who use the failingsincidental to material life as instruments to obtain their infinitely wickedends. And let me tell you this: our higher senses are so blunted, we are sodrenched with materialism, that we should probably fail to recognize realwickedness if we encountered it.”“But shouldn't we experience a certain horror—a terror such as you hinted wewould experience if a rose tree sang—in the mere presence of an evil man?”“We should if we were natural: children and women feel this horror you speak of,even animals experience it. But with most of us convention and civilization andeducation have blinded and deafened and obscured the natural reason. No,sometimes we may recognize evil by its hatred of the good—one doesn't need muchpenetration to guess at the influence which dictated, quite unconsciously, the‘Blackwood’ review of Keats—but this is purely incidental; and, as a rule, Isuspect that the Hierarchs of Tophet pass quite unnoticed, or, perhaps, incertain cases, as good but mistaken men.”“But you used the word ‘unconscious’ just now, of Keats' reviewers. Iswickedness ever unconscious?”“Always. It must be so. It is like holiness and genius in this as in otherpoints; it is a certain rapture or ecstasy of the soul; a transcendent effort tosurpass the ordinary bounds. So, surpassing these, it surpasses also theunderstanding, the faculty that takes note of that which comes before it. No, aman may be infinitely and horribly wicked and never suspect it. But I tell you,evil in this, its certain and true sense, is rare, and I think it is growingrarer.”“I am trying to get hold of it all,” said Cotgrave. “From what you say, I gatherthat the true evil differs generically from that which we call evil?”“Quite so. There is, no doubt, an analogy between the two; a resemblance such asenables us to use, quite legitimately, such terms as the ‘foot of the mountain’and the ‘leg of the table.’ And, sometimes, of course, the two speak, as itwere, in the same language. The rough miner, or ‘puddler,’ the untrained,undeveloped ‘tiger-man,’ heated by a quart or two above his usual measure, comeshome and kicks his irritating and injudicious wife to death. He is a murderer.And Gilles de Raiz was a murderer. But you see the gulf that separates the two?The ‘word,’ if I may so speak, is accidentally the same in each case, but the‘meaning’ is utterly different. It is flagrant ‘Hobson Jobson’ to confuse thetwo, or rather, it is as if one supposed that Juggernaut and the Argonauts hadsomething to do etymologically with one another. And no doubt the same weaklikeness, or analogy, runs between all the ‘social’ sins and the real spiritualsins, and in some cases, perhaps, the lesser may be ‘schoolmasters’ to lead oneon to the greater—from the shadow to the reality. If you are anything of aTheologian, you will see the importance of all this.”“I am sorry to say,” remarked Cotgrave, “that I have devoted very little of mytime to theology. Indeed, I have often wondered on what grounds theologians haveclaimed the title of Science of Sciences for their favourite study; since the‘theological’ books I have looked into have always seemed to me to be concernedwith feeble and obvious pieties, or with the kings of Israel and Judah. I do notcare to hear about those kings.”Ambrose grinned.“We must try to avoid theological discussion,” he said. “I perceive that youwould be a bitter disputant. But perhaps the ‘dates of the kings’ have as muchto do with theology as the hobnails of the murderous puddler with evil.”“Then, to return to our main subject, you think that sin is an esoteric, occultthing?”“Yes. It is the infernal miracle as holiness is the supernal. Now and then it israised to such a pitch that we entirely fail to suspect its existence; it islike the note of the great pedal pipes of the organ, which is so deep that wecannot hear it. In other cases it may lead to the lunatic asylum, or to stillstranger issues. But you must never confuse it with mere social misdoing.Remember how the Apostle, speaking of the ‘other side,’ distinguishes between‘charitable’ actions and charity. And as one may give all one's goods to thepoor, and yet lack charity; so, remember, one may avoid every crime and yet be asinner.”“Your psychology is very strange to me,” said Cotgrave, “but I confess I likeit, and I suppose that one might fairly deduce from your premisses theconclusion that the real sinner might very possibly strike the observer as aharmless personage enough?”“Certainly; because the true evil has nothing to do with social life or sociallaws, or if it has, only incidentally and accidentally. It is a lonely passionof the soul—or a passion of the lonely soul—whichever you like. If, by chance,we understand it, and grasp its full significance, then, indeed, it will fill uswith horror and with awe. But this emotion is widely distinguished from the fearand the disgust with which we regard the ordinary criminal, since this latter islargely or entirely founded on the regard which we have for our own skins orpurses. We hate a murderer, because we know that we should hate to be murdered,or to have any one that we like murdered. So, on the ‘other side,’ we veneratethe saints, but we don't ‘like’ them as we like our friends. Can you persuadeyourself that you would have ‘enjoyed’ St. Paul's company? Do you think that youand I would have ‘got on’ with Sir Galahad?“So with the sinners, as with the saints. If you met a very evil man, andrecognized his evil; he would, no doubt, fill you with horror and awe; but thereis no reason why you should ‘dislike’ him. On the contrary, it is quite possiblethat if you could succeed in putting the sin out of your mind you might find thesinner capital company, and in a little while you might have to reason yourselfback into horror. Still, how awful it is. If the roses and the lilies suddenlysang on this coming morning; if the furniture began to move in procession, as inDe Maupassant's tale!”“I am glad you have come back to that comparison,” said Cotgrave, “because Iwanted to ask you what it is that corresponds in humanity to these imaginaryfeats of inanimate things. In a word—what is sin? You have given me, I know, anabstract definition, but I should like a concrete example.”“I told you it was very rare,” said Ambrose, who appeared willing to avoid thegiving of a direct answer. “The materialism of the age, which has done a gooddeal to suppress sanctity, has done perhaps more to suppress evil. We find theearth so very comfortable that we have no inclination either for ascents ordescents. It would seem as if the scholar who decided to ‘specialize’ in Tophet,would be reduced to purely antiquarian researches. No paleontologist could showyou a live pterodactyl.”“And yet you, I think, have ‘specialized,’ and I believe that your researcheshave descended to our modern times.”“You are really interested, I see. Well, I confess, that I have dabbled alittle, and if you like I can show you something that bears on the very curioussubject we have been discussing.”Ambrose took a candle and went away to a far, dim corner of the room. Cotgravesaw him open a venerable bureau that stood there, and from some secret recess hedrew out a parcel, and came back to the window where they had been sitting.Ambrose undid a wrapping of paper, and produced a green pocket-book.“You will take care of it?” he said. “Don't leave it lying about. It is one ofthe choicer pieces in my collection, and I should be very sorry if it werelost.”He fondled the faded binding.“I knew the girl who wrote this,” he said. “When you read it, you will see howit illustrates the talk we have had to-night. There is a sequel, too, but Iwon't talk of that.”“There was an odd article in one of the reviews some months ago,” he beganagain, with the air of a man who changes the subject. “It was written by adoctor—Dr. Coryn, I think, was the name. He says that a lady, watching herlittle girl playing at the drawing-room window, suddenly saw the heavy sash giveway and fall on the child's fingers. The lady fainted, I think, but at any ratethe doctor was summoned, and when he had dressed the child's wounded and maimedfingers he was summoned to the mother. She was groaning with pain, and it wasfound that three fingers of her hand, corresponding with those that had beeninjured on the child's hand, were swollen and inflamed, and later, in thedoctor's language, purulent sloughing set in.”Ambrose still handled delicately the green volume.“Well, here it is,” he said at last, parting with difficulty, it seemed, fromhis treasure.“You will bring it back as soon as you have read it,” he said, as they went outinto the hall, into the old garden, faint with the odour of white lilies.There was a broad red band in the east as Cotgrave turned to go, and from thehigh ground where he stood he saw that awful spectacle of London in a dream.THE GREEN BOOKThe morocco binding of the book was faded, and the colour had grown faint, butthere were no stains nor bruises nor marks of usage. The book looked as if ithad been bought “on a visit to London” some seventy or eighty years ago, and hadsomehow been forgotten and suffered to lie away out of sight. There was an old,delicate, lingering odour about it, such an odour as sometimes haunts an ancientpiece of furniture for a century or more. The end-papers, inside the binding,were oddly decorated with coloured patterns and faded gold. It looked small, butthe paper was fine, and there were many leaves, closely covered with minute,painfully formed characters.I found this book (the manuscript began) in a drawer in the old bureau thatstands on the landing. It was a very rainy day and I could not go out, so in theafternoon I got a candle and rummaged in the bureau. Nearly all the drawers werefull of old dresses, but one of the small ones looked empty, and I found thisbook hidden right at the back. I wanted a book like this, so I took it to writein. It is full of secrets. I have a great many other books of secrets I havewritten, hidden in a safe place, and I am going to write here many of the oldsecrets and some new ones; but there are some I shall not put down at all. Imust not write down the real names of the days and months which I found out ayear ago, nor the way to make the Aklo letters, or the Chian language, or thegreat beautiful Circles, nor the Mao Games, nor the chief songs. I may writesomething about all these things but not the way to do them, for peculiarreasons. And I must not say who the Nymphs are, or the Dôls, or Jeelo, or whatvoolas mean. All these are most secret secrets, and I am glad when I rememberwhat they are, and how many wonderful languages I know, but there are somethings that I call the secrets of the secrets of the secrets that I dare notthink of unless I am quite alone, and then I shut my eyes, and put my hands overthem and whisper the word, and the Alala comes. I only do this at night in myroom or in certain woods that I know, but I must not describe them, as they aresecret woods. Then there are the Ceremonies, which are all of them important,but some are more delightful than others—there are the White Ceremonies, and theGreen Ceremonies, and the Scarlet Ceremonies. The Scarlet Ceremonies are thebest, but there is only one place where they can be performed properly, thoughthere is a very nice imitation which I have done in other places. Besides these,I have the dances, and the Comedy, and I have done the Comedy sometimes when theothers were looking, and they didn't understand anything about it. I was verylittle when I first knew about these things.When I was very small, and mother was alive, I can remember remembering thingsbefore that, only it has all got confused. But I remember when I was five or sixI heard them talking about me when they thought I was not noticing. They weresaying how queer I was a year or two before, and how nurse had called my motherto come and listen to me talking all to myself, and I was saying words thatnobody could understand. I was speaking the Xu language, but I only remember avery few of the words, as it was about the little white faces that used to lookat me when I was lying in my cradle. They used to talk to me, and I learnt theirlanguage and talked to them in it about some great white place where they lived,where the trees and the grass were all white, and there were white hills as highup as the moon, and a cold wind. I have often dreamed of it afterwards, but thefaces went away when I was very little. But a wonderful thing happened when Iwas about five. My nurse was carrying me on her shoulder; there was a field ofyellow corn, and we went through it, it was very hot. Then we came to a paththrough a wood, and a tall man came after us, and went with us till we came to aplace where there was a deep pool, and it was very dark and shady. Nurse put medown on the soft moss under a tree, and she said: “She can't get to the pondnow.” So they left me there, and I sat quite still and watched, and out of thewater and out of the wood came two wonderful white people, and they began toplay and dance and sing. They were a kind of creamy white like the old ivoryfigure in the drawing-room; one was a beautiful lady with kind dark eyes, and agrave face, and long black hair, and she smiled such a strange sad smile at theother, who laughed and came to her. They played together, and danced round andround the pool, and they sang a song till I fell asleep. Nurse woke me up whenshe came back, and she was looking something like the lady had looked, so I toldher all about it, and asked her why she looked like that. At first she cried,and then she looked very frightened, and turned quite pale. She put me down onthe grass and stared at me, and I could see she was shaking all over. Then shesaid I had been dreaming, but I knew I hadn't. Then she made me promise not tosay a word about it to anybody, and if I did I should be thrown into the blackpit. I was not frightened at all, though nurse was, and I never forgot about it,because when I shut my eyes and it was quite quiet, and I was all alone, I couldsee them again, very faint and far away, but very splendid; and little bits ofthe song they sang came into my head, but I couldn't sing it.I was thirteen, nearly fourteen, when I had a very singular adventure, sostrange that the day on which it happened is always called the White Day. Mymother had been dead for more than a year, and in the morning I had lessons, butthey let me go out for walks in the afternoon. And this afternoon I walked a newway, and a little brook led me into a new country, but I tore my frock gettingthrough some of the difficult places, as the way was through many bushes, andbeneath the low branches of trees, and up thorny thickets on the hills, and bydark woods full of creeping thorns. And it was a long, long way. It seemed as ifI was going on for ever and ever, and I had to creep by a place like a tunnelwhere a brook must have been, but all the water had dried up, and the floor wasrocky, and the bushes had grown overhead till they met, so that it was quitedark. And I went on and on through that dark place; it was a long, long way. AndI came to a hill that I never saw before. I was in a dismal thicket full ofblack twisted boughs that tore me as I went through them, and I cried outbecause I was smarting all over, and then I found that I was climbing, and Iwent up and up a long way, till at last the thicket stopped and I came outcrying just under the top of a big bare place, where there were ugly grey stoneslying all about on the grass, and here and there a little twisted, stunted treecame out from under a stone, like a snake. And I went up, right to the top, along way. I never saw such big ugly stones before; they came out of the earthsome of them, and some looked as if they had been rolled to where they were, andthey went on and on as far as I could see, a long, long way. I looked out fromthem and saw the country, but it was strange. It was winter time, and there wereblack terrible woods hanging from the hills all round; it was like seeing alarge room hung with black curtains, and the shape of the trees seemed quitedifferent from any I had ever seen before. I was afraid. Then beyond the woodsthere were other hills round in a great ring, but I had never seen any of them;it all looked black, and everything had a voor over it. It was all so still andsilent, and the sky was heavy and grey and sad, like a wicked voorish dome inDeep Dendo. I went on into the dreadful rocks. There were hundreds and hundredsof them. Some were like horrid-grinning men; I could see their faces as if theywould jump at me out of the stone, and catch hold of me, and drag me with themback into the rock, so that I should always be there. And there were other rocksthat were like animals, creeping, horrible animals, putting out their tongues,and others were like words that I could not say, and others like dead peoplelying on the grass. I went on among them, though they frightened me, and myheart was full of wicked songs that they put into it; and I wanted to make facesand twist myself about in the way they did, and I went on and on a long way tillat last I liked the rocks, and they didn't frighten me any more. I sang thesongs I thought of; songs full of words that must not be spoken or written down.Then I made faces like the faces on the rocks, and I twisted myself about likethe twisted ones, and I lay down flat on the ground like the dead ones, and Iwent up to one that was grinning, and put my arms round him and hugged him. Andso I went on and on through the rocks till I came to a round mound in the middleof them. It was higher than a mound, it was nearly as high as our house, and itwas like a great basin turned upside down, all smooth and round and green, withone stone, like a post, sticking up at the top. I climbed up the sides, but theywere so steep I had to stop or I should have rolled all the way down again, andI should have knocked against the stones at the bottom, and perhaps been killed.But I wanted to get up to the very top of the big round mound, so I lay downflat on my face, and took hold of the grass with my hands and drew myself up,bit by bit, till I was at the top. Then I sat down on the stone in the middle,and looked all round about. I felt I had come such a long, long way, just as ifI were a hundred miles from home, or in some other country, or in one of thestrange places I had read about in the “Tales of the Genie” and the “ArabianNights,” or as if I had gone across the sea, far away, for years and I had foundanother world that nobody had ever seen or heard of before, or as if I hadsomehow flown through the sky and fallen on one of the stars I had read aboutwhere everything is dead and cold and grey, and there is no air, and the winddoesn't blow. I sat on the stone and looked all round and down and round aboutme. It was just as if I was sitting on a tower in the middle of a great emptytown, because I could see nothing all around but the grey rocks on the ground. Icouldn't make out their shapes any more, but I could see them on and on for along way, and I looked at them, and they seemed as if they had been arrangedinto patterns, and shapes, and figures. I knew they couldn't be, because I hadseen a lot of them coming right out of the earth, joined to the deep rocksbelow, so I looked again, but still I saw nothing but circles, and small circlesinside big ones, and pyramids, and domes, and spires, and they seemed all to goround and round the place where I was sitting, and the more I looked, the more Isaw great big rings of rocks, getting bigger and bigger, and I stared so longthat it felt as if they were all moving and turning, like a great wheel, and Iwas turning, too, in the middle. I got quite dizzy and queer in the head, andeverything began to be hazy and not clear, and I saw little sparks of bluelight, and the stones looked as if they were springing and dancing and twistingas they went round and round and round. I was frightened again, and I cried outloud, and jumped up from the stone I was sitting on, and fell down. When I gotup I was so glad they all looked still, and I sat down on the top and slid downthe mound, and went on again. I danced as I went in the peculiar way the rockshad danced when I got giddy, and I was so glad I could do it quite well, and Idanced and danced along, and sang extraordinary songs that came into my head. Atlast I came to the edge of that great flat hill, and there were no more rocks,and the way went again through a dark thicket in a hollow. It was just as bad asthe other one I went through climbing up, but I didn't mind this one, because Iwas so glad I had seen those singular dances and could imitate them. I wentdown, creeping through the bushes, and a tall nettle stung me on my leg, andmade me burn, but I didn't mind it, and I tingled with the boughs and thethorns, but I only laughed and sang. Then I got out of the thicket into a closevalley, a little secret place like a dark passage that nobody ever knows of,because it was so narrow and deep and the woods were so thick round it. There isa steep bank with trees hanging over it, and there the ferns keep green allthrough the winter, when they are dead and brown upon the hill, and the fernsthere have a sweet, rich smell like what oozes out of fir trees. There was alittle stream of water running down this valley, so small that I could easilystep across it. I drank the water with my hand, and it tasted like bright,yellow wine, and it sparkled and bubbled as it ran down over beautiful red andyellow and green stones, so that it seemed alive and all colours at once. Idrank it, and I drank more with my hand, but I couldn't drink enough, so I laydown and bent my head and sucked the water up with my lips. It tasted muchbetter, drinking it that way, and a ripple would come up to my mouth and give mea kiss, and I laughed, and drank again, and pretended there was a nymph, likethe one in the old picture at home, who lived in the water and was kissing me.So I bent low down to the water, and put my lips softly to it, and whispered tothe nymph that I would come again. I felt sure it could not be common water, Iwas so glad when I got up and went on; and I danced again and went up and up thevalley, under hanging hills. And when I came to the top, the ground rose up infront of me, tall and steep as a wall, and there was nothing but the green walland the sky. I thought of “for ever and for ever, world without end, Amen”; andI thought I must have really found the end of the world, because it was like theend of everything, as if there could be nothing at all beyond, except thekingdom of Voor, where the light goes when it is put out, and the water goeswhen the sun takes it away. I began to think of all the long, long way I hadjourneyed, how I had found a brook and followed it, and followed it on, and gonethrough bushes and thorny thickets, and dark woods full of creeping thorns. ThenI had crept up a tunnel under trees, and climbed a thicket, and seen all thegrey rocks, and sat in the middle of them when they turned round, and then I hadgone on through the grey rocks and come down the hill through the stingingthicket and up the dark valley, all a long, long way. I wondered how I shouldget home again, if I could ever find the way, and if my home was there any more,or if it were turned and everybody in it into grey rocks, as in the “ArabianNights.” So I sat down on the grass and thought what I should do next. I wastired, and my feet were hot with walking, and as I looked about I saw there wasa wonderful well just under the high, steep wall of grass. All the ground roundit was covered with bright, green, dripping moss; there was every kind of mossthere, moss like beautiful little ferns, and like palms and fir trees, and itwas all green as jewellery, and drops of water hung on it like diamonds. And inthe middle was the great well, deep and shining and beautiful, so clear that itlooked as if I could touch the red sand at the bottom, but it was far below. Istood by it and looked in, as if I were looking in a glass. At the bottom of thewell, in the middle of it, the red grains of sand were moving and stirring allthe time, and I saw how the water bubbled up, but at the top it was quitesmooth, and full and brimming. It was a great well, large like a bath, and withthe shining, glittering green moss about it, it looked like a great white jewel,with green jewels all round. My feet were so hot and tired that I took off myboots and stockings, and let my feet down into the water, and the water was softand cold, and when I got up I wasn't tired any more, and I felt I must go on,farther and farther, and see what was on the other side of the wall. I climbedup it very slowly, going sideways all the time, and when I got to the top andlooked over, I was in the queerest country I had seen, stranger even than thehill of the grey rocks. It looked as if earth-children had been playing therewith their spades, as it was all hills and hollows, and castles and walls madeof earth and covered with grass. There were two mounds like big beehives, roundand great and solemn, and then hollow basins, and then a steep mounting walllike the ones I saw once by the seaside where the big guns and the soldierswere. I nearly fell into one of the round hollows, it went away from under myfeet so suddenly, and I ran fast down the side and stood at the bottom andlooked up. It was strange and solemn to look up. There was nothing but the grey,heavy sky and the sides of the hollow; everything else had gone away, and thehollow was the whole world, and I thought that at night it must be full ofghosts and moving shadows and pale things when the moon shone down to the bottomat the dead of the night, and the wind wailed up above. It was so strange andsolemn and lonely, like a hollow temple of dead heathen gods. It reminded me ofa tale my nurse had told me when I was quite little; it was the same nurse thattook me into the wood where I saw the beautiful white people. And I rememberedhow nurse had told me the story one winter night, when the wind was beating thetrees against the wall, and crying and moaning in the nursery chimney. She saidthere was, somewhere or other, a hollow pit, just like the one I was standingin, everybody was afraid to go into it or near it, it was such a bad place. Butonce upon a time there was a poor girl who said she would go into the hollowpit, and everybody tried to stop her, but she would go. And she went down intothe pit and came back laughing, and said there was nothing there at all, exceptgreen grass and red stones, and white stones and yellow flowers. And soon afterpeople saw she had most beautiful emerald earrings, and they asked how she gotthem, as she and her mother were quite poor. But she laughed, and said herearrings were not made of emeralds at all, but only of green grass. Then, oneday, she wore on her breast the reddest ruby that any one had ever seen, and itwas as big as a hen's egg, and glowed and sparkled like a hot burning coal offire. And they asked how she got it, as she and her mother were quite poor. Butshe laughed, and said it was not a ruby at all, but only a red stone. Then oneday she wore round her neck the loveliest necklace that any one had ever seen,much finer than the queen's finest, and it was made of great bright diamonds,hundreds of them, and they shone like all the stars on a night in June. So theyasked her how she got it, as she and her mother were quite poor. But shelaughed, and said they were not diamonds at all, but only white stones. And oneday she went to the Court, and she wore on her head a crown of pure angel-gold,so nurse said, and it shone like the sun, and it was much more splendid than thecrown the king was wearing himself, and in her ears she wore the emeralds, andthe big ruby was the brooch on her breast, and the great diamond necklace wassparkling on her neck. And the king and queen thought she was some greatprincess from a long way off, and got down from their thrones and went to meether, but somebody told the king and queen who she was, and that she was quitepoor. So the king asked why she wore a gold crown, and how she got it, as sheand her mother were so poor. And she laughed, and said it wasn't a gold crown atall, but only some yellow flowers she had put in her hair. And the king thoughtit was very strange, and said she should stay at the Court, and they would seewhat would happen next. And she was so lovely that everybody said that her eyeswere greener than the emeralds, that her lips were redder than the ruby, thather skin was whiter than the diamonds, and that her hair was brighter than thegolden crown. So the king's son said he would marry her, and the king said hemight. And the bishop married them, and there was a great supper, and afterwardsthe king's son went to his wife's room. But just when he had his hand on thedoor, he saw a tall, black man, with a dreadful face, standing in front of thedoor, and a voice said—Venture not upon your life, This is mine own wedded wife.Then the king's son fell down on the ground in a fit. And they came and tried toget into the room, but they couldn't, and they hacked at the door with hatchets,but the wood had turned hard as iron, and at last everybody ran away, they wereso frightened at the screaming and laughing and shrieking and crying that cameout of the room. But next day they went in, and found there was nothing in theroom but thick black smoke, because the black man had come and taken her away.And on the bed there were two knots of faded grass and a red stone, and somewhite stones, and some faded yellow flowers. I remembered this tale of nurse'swhile I was standing at the bottom of the deep hollow; it was so strange andsolitary there, and I felt afraid. I could not see any stones or flowers, but Iwas afraid of bringing them away without knowing, and I thought I would do acharm that came into my head to keep the black man away. So I stood right in thevery middle of the hollow, and I made sure that I had none of those things onme, and then I walked round the place, and touched my eyes, and my lips, and myhair in a peculiar manner, and whispered some queer words that nurse taught meto keep bad things away. Then I felt safe and climbed up out of the hollow, andwent on through all those mounds and hollows and walls, till I came to the end,which was high above all the rest, and I could see that all the different shapesof the earth were arranged in patterns, something like the grey rocks, only thepattern was different. It was getting late, and the air was indistinct, but itlooked from where I was standing something like two great figures of peoplelying on the grass. And I went on, and at last I found a certain wood, which istoo secret to be described, and nobody knows of the passage into it, which Ifound out in a very curious manner, by seeing some little animal run into thewood through it. So I went after the animal by a very narrow dark way, underthorns and bushes, and it was almost dark when I came to a kind of open place inthe middle. And there I saw the most wonderful sight I have ever seen, but itwas only for a minute, as I ran away directly, and crept out of the wood by thepassage I had come by, and ran and ran as fast as ever I could, because I wasafraid, what I had seen was so wonderful and so strange and beautiful. But Iwanted to get home and think of it, and I did not know what might not happen ifI stayed by the wood. I was hot all over and trembling, and my heart wasbeating, and strange cries that I could not help came from me as I ran from thewood. I was glad that a great white moon came up from over a round hill andshowed me the way, so I went back through the mounds and hollows and down theclose valley, and up through the thicket over the place of the grey rocks, andso at last I got home again. My father was busy in his study, and the servantshad not told about my not coming home, though they were frightened, and wonderedwhat they ought to do, so I told them I had lost my way, but I did not let themfind out the real way I had been. I went to bed and lay awake all through thenight, thinking of what I had seen. When I came out of the narrow way, and itlooked all shining, though the air was dark, it seemed so certain, and all theway home I was quite sure that I had seen it, and I wanted to be alone in myroom, and be glad over it all to myself, and shut my eyes and pretend it wasthere, and do all the things I would have done if I had not been so afraid. Butwhen I shut my eyes the sight would not come, and I began to think about myadventures all over again, and I remembered how dusky and queer it was at theend, and I was afraid it must be all a mistake, because it seemed impossible itcould happen. It seemed like one of nurse's tales, which I didn't really believein, though I was frightened at the bottom of the hollow; and the stories shetold me when I was little came back into my head, and I wondered whether it wasreally there what I thought I had seen, or whether any of her tales could havehappened a long time ago. It was so queer; I lay awake there in my room at theback of the house, and the moon was shining on the other side towards the river,so the bright light did not fall upon the wall. And the house was quite still. Ihad heard my father come upstairs, and just after the clock struck twelve, andafter the house was still and empty, as if there was nobody alive in it. Andthough it was all dark and indistinct in my room, a pale glimmering kind oflight shone in through the white blind, and once I got up and looked out, andthere was a great black shadow of the house covering the garden, looking like aprison where men are hanged; and then beyond it was all white; and the woodshone white with black gulfs between the trees. It was still and clear, andthere were no clouds on the sky. I wanted to think of what I had seen but Icouldn't, and I began to think of all the tales that nurse had told me so longago that I thought I had forgotten, but they all came back, and mixed up withthe thickets and the grey rocks and the hollows in the earth and the secretwood, till I hardly knew what was new and what was old, or whether it was notall dreaming. And then I remembered that hot summer afternoon, so long ago, whennurse left me by myself in the shade, and the white people came out of the waterand out of the wood, and played, and danced, and sang, and I began to fancy thatnurse told me about something like it before I saw them, only I couldn'trecollect exactly what she told me. Then I wondered whether she had been thewhite lady, as I remembered she was just as white and beautiful, and had thesame dark eyes and black hair; and sometimes she smiled and looked like the ladyhad looked, when she was telling me some of her stories, beginning with “Once ona time,” or “In the time of the fairies.” But I thought she couldn't be thelady, as she seemed to have gone a different way into the wood, and I didn'tthink the man who came after us could be the other, or I couldn't have seen thatwonderful secret in the secret wood. I thought of the moon: but it wasafterwards when I was in the middle of the wild land, where the earth was madeinto the shape of great figures, and it was all walls, and mysterious hollows,and smooth round mounds, that I saw the great white moon come up over a roundhill. I was wondering about all these things, till at last I got quitefrightened, because I was afraid something had happened to me, and I rememberednurse's tale of the poor girl who went into the hollow pit, and was carried awayat last by the black man. I knew I had gone into a hollow pit too, and perhapsit was the same, and I had done something dreadful. So I did the charm overagain, and touched my eyes and my lips and my hair in a peculiar manner, andsaid the old words from the fairy language, so that I might be sure I had notbeen carried away. I tried again to see the secret wood, and to creep up thepassage and see what I had seen there, but somehow I couldn't, and I kept onthinking of nurse's stories. There was one I remembered about a young man whoonce upon a time went hunting, and all the day he and his hounds huntedeverywhere, and they crossed the rivers and went into all the woods, and wentround the marshes, but they couldn't find anything at all, and they hunted allday till the sun sank down and began to set behind the mountain. And the youngman was angry because he couldn't find anything, and he was going to turn back,when just as the sun touched the mountain, he saw come out of a brake in frontof him a beautiful white stag. And he cheered to his hounds, but they whined andwould not follow, and he cheered to his horse, but it shivered and stood stockstill, and the young man jumped off the horse and left the hounds and began tofollow the white stag all alone. And soon it was quite dark, and the sky wasblack, without a single star shining in it, and the stag went away into thedarkness. And though the man had brought his gun with him he never shot at thestag, because he wanted to catch it, and he was afraid he would lose it in thenight. But he never lost it once, though the sky was so black and the air was sodark, and the stag went on and on till the young man didn't know a bit where hewas. And they went through enormous woods where the air was full of whispers anda pale, dead light came out from the rotten trunks that were lying on theground, and just as the man thought he had lost the stag, he would see it allwhite and shining in front of him, and he would run fast to catch it, but thestag always ran faster, so he did not catch it. And they went through theenormous woods, and they swam across rivers, and they waded through blackmarshes where the ground bubbled, and the air was full of will-o'-the-wisps, andthe stag fled away down into rocky narrow valleys, where the air was like thesmell of a vault, and the man went after it. And they went over the greatmountains and the man heard the wind come down from the sky, and the stag wenton and the man went after. At last the sun rose and the young man found he wasin a country that he had never seen before; it was a beautiful valley with abright stream running through it, and a great, big round hill in the middle. Andthe stag went down the valley, towards the hill, and it seemed to be gettingtired and went slower and slower, and though the man was tired, too, he began torun faster, and he was sure he would catch the stag at last. But just as theygot to the bottom of the hill, and the man stretched out his hand to catch thestag, it vanished into the earth, and the man began to cry; he was so sorry thathe had lost it after all his long hunting. But as he was crying he saw there wasa door in the hill, just in front of him, and he went in, and it was quite dark,but he went on, as he thought he would find the white stag. And all of a suddenit got light, and there was the sky, and the sun shining, and birds singing inthe trees, and there was a beautiful fountain. And by the fountain a lovely ladywas sitting, who was the queen of the fairies, and she told the man that she hadchanged herself into a stag to bring him there because she loved him so much.Then she brought out a great gold cup, covered with jewels, from her fairypalace, and she offered him wine in the cup to drink. And he drank, and the morehe drank the more he longed to drink, because the wine was enchanted. So hekissed the lovely lady, and she became his wife, and he stayed all that day andall that night in the hill where she lived, and when he woke he found he waslying on the ground, close to where he had seen the stag first, and his horsewas there and his hounds were there waiting, and he looked up, and the sun sankbehind the mountain. And he went home and lived a long time, but he would neverkiss any other lady because he had kissed the queen of the fairies, and he wouldnever drink common wine any more, because he had drunk enchanted wine. Andsometimes nurse told me tales that she had heard from her great-grandmother, whowas very old, and lived in a cottage on the mountain all alone, and most ofthese tales were about a hill where people used to meet at night long ago, andthey used to play all sorts of strange games and do queer things that nurse toldme of, but I couldn't understand, and now, she said, everybody but hergreat-grandmother had forgotten all about it, and nobody knew where the hillwas, not even her great-grandmother. But she told me one very strange storyabout the hill, and I trembled when I remembered it. She said that people alwayswent there in summer, when it was very hot, and they had to dance a good deal.It would be all dark at first, and there were trees there, which made it muchdarker, and people would come, one by one, from all directions, by a secret pathwhich nobody else knew, and two persons would keep the gate, and every one asthey came up had to give a very curious sign, which nurse showed me as well asshe could, but she said she couldn't show me properly. And all kinds of peoplewould come; there would be gentle folks and village folks, and some old peopleand boys and girls, and quite small children, who sat and watched. And it wouldall be dark as they came in, except in one corner where some one was burningsomething that smelt strong and sweet, and made them laugh, and there one wouldsee a glaring of coals, and the smoke mounting up red. So they would all comein, and when the last had come there was no door any more, so that no one elsecould get in, even if they knew there was anything beyond. And once a gentlemanwho was a stranger and had ridden a long way, lost his path at night, and hishorse took him into the very middle of the wild country, where everything wasupside down, and there were dreadful marshes and great stones everywhere, andholes underfoot, and the trees looked like gibbet-posts, because they had greatblack arms that stretched out across the way. And this strange gentleman wasvery frightened, and his horse began to shiver all over, and at last it stoppedand wouldn't go any farther, and the gentleman got down and tried to lead thehorse, but it wouldn't move, and it was all covered with a sweat, like death. Sothe gentleman went on all alone, going farther and farther into the wildcountry, till at last he came to a dark place, where he heard shouting andsinging and crying, like nothing he had ever heard before. It all sounded quiteclose to him, but he couldn't get in, and so he began to call, and while he wascalling, something came behind him, and in a minute his mouth and arms and legswere all bound up, and he fell into a swoon. And when he came to himself, he waslying by the roadside, just where he had first lost his way, under a blasted oakwith a black trunk, and his horse was tied beside him. So he rode on to the townand told the people there what had happened, and some of them were amazed; butothers knew. So when once everybody had come, there was no door at all foranybody else to pass in by. And when they were all inside, round in a ring,touching each other, some one began to sing in the darkness, and some one elsewould make a noise like thunder with a thing they had on purpose, and on stillnights people would hear the thundering noise far, far away beyond the wildland, and some of them, who thought they knew what it was, used to make a signon their breasts when they woke up in their beds at dead of night and heard thatterrible deep noise, like thunder on the mountains. And the noise and thesinging would go on and on for a long time, and the people who were in a ringswayed a little to and fro; and the song was in an old, old language that nobodyknows now, and the tune was queer. Nurse said her great-grandmother had knownsome one who remembered a little of it, when she was quite a little girl, andnurse tried to sing some of it to me, and it was so strange a tune that I turnedall cold and my flesh crept as if I had put my hand on something dead. Sometimesit was a man that sang and sometimes it was a woman, and sometimes the one whosang it did it so well that two or three of the people who were there fell tothe ground shrieking and tearing with their hands. The singing went on, and thepeople in the ring kept swaying to and fro for a long time, and at last the moonwould rise over a place they called the Tole Deol, and came up and showed themswinging and swaying from side to side, with the sweet thick smoke curling upfrom the burning coals, and floating in circles all around them. Then they hadtheir supper. A boy and a girl brought it to them; the boy carried a great cupof wine, and the girl carried a cake of bread, and they passed the bread and thewine round and round, but they tasted quite different from common bread andcommon wine, and changed everybody that tasted them. Then they all rose up anddanced, and secret things were brought out of some hiding place, and they playedextraordinary games, and danced round and round and round in the moonlight, andsometimes people would suddenly disappear and never be heard of afterwards, andnobody knew what had happened to them. And they drank more of that curious wine,and they made images and worshipped them, and nurse showed me how the imageswere made one day when we were out for a walk, and we passed by a place wherethere was a lot of wet clay. So nurse asked me if I would like to know whatthose things were like that they made on the hill, and I said yes. Then sheasked me if I would promise never to tell a living soul a word about it, and ifI did I was to be thrown into the black pit with the dead people, and I said Iwouldn't tell anybody, and she said the same thing again and again, and Ipromised. So she took my wooden spade and dug a big lump of clay and put it inmy tin bucket, and told me to say if any one met us that I was going to makepies when I went home. Then we went on a little way till we came to a littlebrake growing right down into the road, and nurse stopped, and looked up theroad and down it, and then peeped through the hedge into the field on the otherside, and then she said, “Quick!” and we ran into the brake, and crept in andout among the bushes till we had gone a good way from the road. Then we sat downunder a bush, and I wanted so much to know what nurse was going to make with theclay, but before she would begin she made me promise again not to say a wordabout it, and she went again and peeped through the bushes on every side, thoughthe lane was so small and deep that hardly anybody ever went there. So we satdown, and nurse took the clay out of the bucket, and began to knead it with herhands, and do queer things with it, and turn it about. And she hid it under abig dock-leaf for a minute or two and then she brought it out again, and thenshe stood up and sat down, and walked round the clay in a peculiar manner, andall the time she was softly singing a sort of rhyme, and her face got very red.Then she sat down again, and took the clay in her hands and began to shape itinto a doll, but not like the dolls I have at home, and she made the queerestdoll I had ever seen, all out of the wet clay, and hid it under a bush to getdry and hard, and all the time she was making it she was singing these rhymes toherself, and her face got redder and redder. So we left the doll there, hiddenaway in the bushes where nobody would ever find it. And a few days later we wentthe same walk, and when we came to that narrow, dark part of the lane where thebrake runs down to the bank, nurse made me promise all over again, and shelooked about, just as she had done before, and we crept into the bushes till wegot to the green place where the little clay man was hidden. I remember it allso well, though I was only eight, and it is eight years ago now as I am writingit down, but the sky was a deep violet blue, and in the middle of the brakewhere we were sitting there was a great elder tree covered with blossoms, and onthe other side there was a clump of meadowsweet, and when I think of that daythe smell of the meadowsweet and elder blossom seems to fill the room, and if Ishut my eyes I can see the glaring blue sky, with little clouds very whitefloating across it, and nurse who went away long ago sitting opposite me andlooking like the beautiful white lady in the wood. So we sat down and nurse tookout the clay doll from the secret place where she had hidden it, and she said wemust “pay our respects,” and she would show me what to do, and I must watch herall the time. So she did all sorts of queer things with the little clay man, andI noticed she was all streaming with perspiration, though we had walked soslowly, and then she told me to “pay my respects,” and I did everything she didbecause I liked her, and it was such an odd game. And she said that if one lovedvery much, the clay man was very good, if one did certain things with it, and ifone hated very much, it was just as good, only one had to do different things,and we played with it a long time, and pretended all sorts of things. Nurse saidher great-grandmother had told her all about these images, but what we did wasno harm at all, only a game. But she told me a story about these images thatfrightened me very much, and that was what I remembered that night when I waslying awake in my room in the pale, empty darkness, thinking of what I had seenand the secret wood. Nurse said there was once a young lady of the high gentry,who lived in a great castle. And she was so beautiful that all the gentlemenwanted to marry her, because she was the loveliest lady that anybody had everseen, and she was kind to everybody, and everybody thought she was very good.But though she was polite to all the gentlemen who wished to marry her, she putthem off, and said she couldn't make up her mind, and she wasn't sure she wantedto marry anybody at all. And her father, who was a very great lord, was angry,though he was so fond of her, and he asked her why she wouldn't choose abachelor out of all the handsome young men who came to the castle. But she onlysaid she didn't love any of them very much, and she must wait, and if theypestered her, she said she would go and be a nun in a nunnery. So all thegentlemen said they would go away and wait for a year and a day, and when a yearand a day were gone, they would come back again and ask her to say which one shewould marry. So the day was appointed and they all went away; and the lady hadpromised that in a year and a day it would be her wedding day with one of them.But the truth was, that she was the queen of the people who danced on the hillon summer nights, and on the proper nights she would lock the door of her room,and she and her maid would steal out of the castle by a secret passage that onlythey knew of, and go away up to the hill in the wild land. And she knew more ofthe secret things than any one else, and more than any one knew before or after,because she would not tell anybody the most secret secrets. She knew how to doall the awful things, how to destroy young men, and how to put a curse onpeople, and other things that I could not understand. And her real name was theLady Avelin, but the dancing people called her Cassap, which meant somebody verywise, in the old language. And she was whiter than any of them and taller, andher eyes shone in the dark like burning rubies; and she could sing songs thatnone of the others could sing, and when she sang they all fell down on theirfaces and worshipped her. And she could do what they called shib-show, which wasa very wonderful enchantment. She would tell the great lord, her father, thatshe wanted to go into the woods to gather flowers, so he let her go, and she andher maid went into the woods where nobody came, and the maid would keep watch.Then the lady would lie down under the trees and begin to sing a particularsong, and she stretched out her arms, and from every part of the wood greatserpents would come, hissing and gliding in and out among the trees, andshooting out their forked tongues as they crawled up to the lady. And they allcame to her, and twisted round her, round her body, and her arms, and her neck,till she was covered with writhing serpents, and there was only her head to beseen. And she whispered to them, and she sang to them, and they writhed roundand round, faster and faster, till she told them to go. And they all went awaydirectly, back to their holes, and on the lady's breast there would be a mostcurious, beautiful stone, shaped something like an egg, and coloured dark blueand yellow, and red, and green, marked like a serpent's scales. It was called aglame stone, and with it one could do all sorts of wonderful things, and nursesaid her great-grandmother had seen a glame stone with her own eyes, and it wasfor all the world shiny and scaly like a snake. And the lady could do a lot ofother things as well, but she was quite fixed that she would not be married. Andthere were a great many gentlemen who wanted to marry her, but there were fiveof them who were chief, and their names were Sir Simon, Sir John, Sir Oliver,Sir Richard, and Sir Rowland. All the others believed she spoke the truth, andthat she would choose one of them to be her man when a year and a day was done;it was only Sir Simon, who was very crafty, who thought she was deceiving themall, and he vowed he would watch and try if he could find out anything. Andthough he was very wise he was very young, and he had a smooth, soft face like agirl's, and he pretended, as the rest did, that he would not come to the castlefor a year and a day, and he said he was going away beyond the sea to foreignparts. But he really only went a very little way, and came back dressed like aservant girl, and so he got a place in the castle to wash the dishes. And hewaited and watched, and he listened and said nothing, and he hid in dark places,and woke up at night and looked out, and he heard things and he saw things thathe thought were very strange. And he was so sly that he told the girl thatwaited on the lady that he was really a young man, and that he had dressed up asa girl because he loved her so very much and wanted to be in the same house withher, and the girl was so pleased that she told him many things, and he was morethan ever certain that the Lady Avelin was deceiving him and the others. And hewas so clever, and told the servant so many lies, that one night he managed tohide in the Lady Avelin's room behind the curtains. And he stayed quite stilland never moved, and at last the lady came. And she bent down under the bed, andraised up a stone, and there was a hollow place underneath, and out of it shetook a waxen image, just like the clay one that I and nurse had made in thebrake. And all the time her eyes were burning like rubies. And she took thelittle wax doll up in her arms and held it to her breast, and she whispered andshe murmured, and she to ok it up and she laid it down again, and she held ithigh, and she held it low, and she laid it down again. And she said, “Happy ishe that begat the bishop, that ordered the clerk, that married the man, that hadthe wife, that fashioned the hive, that harboured the bee, that gathered the waxthat my own true love was made of.” And she brought out of an aumbry a greatgolden bowl, and she brought out of a closet a great jar of wine, and she pouredsome of the wine into the bowl, and she laid her mannikin very gently in thewine, and washed it in the wine all over. Then she went to a cupboard and took asmall round cake and laid it on the image's mouth, and then she bore it softlyand covered it up. And Sir Simon, who was watching all the time, though he wasterribly frightened, saw the lady bend down and stretch out her arms and whisperand sing, and then Sir Simon saw beside her a handsome young man, who kissed heron the lips. And they drank wine out of the golden bowl together, and they atethe cake together. But when the sun rose there was only the little wax doll, andthe lady hid it again under the bed in the hollow place. So Sir Simon knew quitewell what the lady was, and he waited and he watched, till the time she had saidwas nearly over, and in a week the year and a day would be done. And one night,when he was watching behind the curtains in her room, he saw her making more waxdolls. And she made five, and hid them away. And the next night she took oneout, and held it up, and filled the golden bowl with water, and took the doll bythe neck and held it under the water. Then she said—Sir Dickon, Sir Dickon, your day is done, You shall be drowned in the water wan.And the next day news came to the castle that Sir Richard had been drowned atthe ford. And at night she took another doll and tied a violet cord round itsneck and hung it up on a nail. Then she said—Sir Rowland, your life has ended its span, High on a tree I see you hang.And the next day news came to the castle that Sir Rowland had been hanged byrobbers in the wood. And at night she took another doll, and drove her bodkinright into its heart. Then she said—Sir Noll, Sir Noll, so cease your life, Your heart pierced with the knife.And the next day news came to the castle that Sir Oliver had fought in a tavern,and a stranger had stabbed him to the heart. And at night she took another doll,and held it to a fire of charcoal till it was melted. Then she said—Sir John, return, and turn to clay, In fire of fever you waste away.And the next day news came to the castle that Sir John had died in a burningfever. So then Sir Simon went out of the castle and mounted his horse and rodeaway to the bishop and told him everything. And the bishop sent his men, andthey took the Lady Avelin, and everything she had done was found out. So on theday after the year and a day, when she was to have been married, they carriedher through the town in her smock, and they tied her to a great stake in themarket-place, and burned her alive before the bishop with her wax image hunground her neck. And people said the wax man screamed in the burning of theflames. And I thought of this story again and again as I was lying awake in mybed, and I seemed to see the Lady Avelin in the market-place, with the yellowflames eating up her beautiful white body. And I thought of it so much that Iseemed to get into the story myself, and I fancied I was the lady, and that theywere coming to take me to be burnt with fire, with all the people in the townlooking at me. And I wondered whether she cared, after all the strange thingsshe had done, and whether it hurt very much to be burned at the stake. I triedagain and again to forget nurse's stories, and to remember the secret I had seenthat afternoon, and what was in the secret wood, but I could only see the darkand a glimmering in the dark, and then it went away, and I only saw myselfrunning, and then a great moon came up white over a dark round hill. Then allthe old stories came back again, and the queer rhymes that nurse used to sing tome; and there was one beginning “Halsy cumsy Helen musty,” that she used to singvery softly when she wanted me to go to sleep. And I began to sing it to myselfinside of my head, and I went to sleep.The next morning I was very tired and sleepy, and could hardly do my lessons,and I was very glad when they were over and I had had my dinner, as I wanted togo out and be alone. It was a warm day, and I went to a nice turfy hill by theriver, and sat down on my mother's old shawl that I had brought with me onpurpose. The sky was grey, like the day before, but there was a kind of whitegleam behind it, and from where I was sitting I could look down on the town, andit was all still and quiet and white, like a picture. I remembered that it wason that hill that nurse taught me to play an old game called “Troy Town,” inwhich one had to dance, and wind in and out on a pattern in the grass, and thenwhen one had danced and turned long enough the other person asks you questions,and you can't help answering whether you want to or not, and whatever you aretold to do you feel you have to do it. Nurse said there used to be a lot ofgames like that that some people knew of, and there was one by which peoplecould be turned into anything you liked, and an old man her great-grandmotherhad seen had known a girl who had been turned into a large snake. And there wasanother very ancient game of dancing and winding and turning, by which you couldtake a person out of himself and hide him away as long as you liked, and hisbody went walking about quite empty, without any sense in it. But I came to thathill because I wanted to think of what had happened the day before, and of thesecret of the wood. From the place where I was sitting I could see beyond thetown, into the opening I had found, where a little brook had led me into anunknown country. And I pretended I was following the brook over again, and Iwent all the way in my mind, and at last I found the wood, and crept into itunder the bushes, and then in the dusk I saw something that made me feel as if Iwere filled with fire, as if I wanted to dance and sing and fly up into the air,because I was changed and wonderful. But what I saw was not changed at all, andhad not grown old, and I wondered again and again how such things could happen,and whether nurse's stories were really true, because in the daytime in the openair everything seemed quite different from what it was at night, when I wasfrightened, and thought I was to be burned alive. I once told my father one ofher little tales, which was about a ghost, and asked him if it was true, and hetold me it was not true at all, and that only common, ignorant people believedin such rubbish. He was very angry with nurse for telling me the story, andscolded her, and after that I promised her I would never whisper a word of whatshe told me, and if I did I should be bitten by the great black snake that livedin the pool in the wood. And all alone on the hill I wondered what was true. Ihad seen something very amazing and very lovely, and I knew a story, and if Ihad really seen it, and not made it up out of the dark, and the black bough, andthe bright shining that was mounting up to the sky from over the great roundhill, but had really seen it in truth, then there were all kinds of wonderfuland lovely and terrible things to think of, so I longed and trembled, and Iburned and got cold. And I looked down on the town, so quiet and still, like alittle white picture, and I thought over and over if it could be true. I was along time before I could make up my mind to anything; there was such a strangefluttering at my heart that seemed to whisper to me all the time that I had notmade it up out of my head, and yet it seemed quite impossible, and I knew myfather and everybody would say it was dreadful rubbish. I never dreamed oftelling him or anybody else a word about it, because I knew it would be of nouse, and I should only get laughed at or scolded, so for a long time I was veryquiet, and went about thinking and wondering; and at night I used to dream ofamazing things, and sometimes I woke up in the early morning and held out myarms with a cry. And I was frightened, too, because there were dangers, and someawful thing would happen to me, unless I took great care, if the story weretrue. These old tales were always in my head, night and morning, and I went overthem and told them to myself over and over again, and went for walks in theplaces where nurse had told them to me; and when I sat in the nursery by thefire in the evenings I used to fancy nurse was sitting in the other chair, andtelling me some wonderful story in a low voice, for fear anybody should belistening. But she used to like best to tell me about things when we were rightout in the country, far from the house, because she said she was telling me suchsecrets, and walls have ears. And if it was something more than ever secret, wehad to hide in brakes or woods; and I used to think it was such fun creepingalong a hedge, and going very softly, and then we would get behind the bushes orrun into the wood all of a sudden, when we were sure that none was watching us;so we knew that we had our secrets quite all to ourselves, and nobody else atall knew anything about them. Now and then, when we had hidden ourselves as Ihave described, she used to show me all sorts of odd things. One day, Iremember, we were in a hazel brake, overlooking the brook, and we were so snugand warm, as though it was April; the sun was quite hot, and the leaves werejust coming out. Nurse said she would show me something funny that would make melaugh, and then she showed me, as she said, how one could turn a whole houseupside down, without anybody being able to find out, and the pots and pans wouldjump about, and the china would be broken, and the chairs would tumble over ofthemselves. I tried it one day in the kitchen, and I found I could do it quitewell, and a whole row of plates on the dresser fell off it, and cook's littlework-table tilted up and turned right over “before her eyes,” as she said, butshe was so frightened and turned so white that I didn't do it again, as I likedher. And afterwards, in the hazel copse, when she had shown me how to makethings tumble about, she showed me how to make rapping noises, and I learnt howto do that, too. Then she taught me rhymes to say on certain occasions, andpeculiar marks to make on other occasions, and other things that hergreat-grandmother had taught her when she was a little girl herself. And thesewere all the things I was thinking about in those days after the strange walkwhen I thought I had seen a great secret, and I wished nurse were there for meto ask her about it, but she had gone away more than two years before, andnobody seemed to know what had become of her, or where she had gone. But I shallalways remember those days if I live to be quite old, because all the time Ifelt so strange, wondering and doubting, and feeling quite sure at one time, andmaking up my mind, and then I would feel quite sure that such things couldn'thappen really, and it began all over again. But I took great care not to docertain things that might be very dangerous. So I waited and wondered for a longtime, and though I was not sure at all, I never dared to try to find out. Butone day I became sure that all that nurse said was quite true, and I was allalone when I found it out. I trembled all over with joy and terror, and as fastas I could I ran into one of the old brakes where we used to go—it was the oneby the lane, where nurse made the little clay man—and I ran into it, and I creptinto it; and when I came to the place where the elder was, I covered up my facewith my hands and lay down flat on the grass, and I stayed there for two hourswithout moving, whispering to myself delicious, terrible things, and saying somewords over and over again. It was all true and wonderful and splendid, and whenI remembered the story I knew and thought of what I had really seen, I got hotand I got cold, and the air seemed full of scent, and flowers, and singing. Andfirst I wanted to make a little clay man, like the one nurse had made so longago, and I had to invent plans and stratagems, and to look about, and to thinkof things beforehand, because nobody must dream of anything that I was doing orgoing to do, and I was too old to carry clay about in a tin bucket. At last Ithought of a plan, and I brought the wet clay to the brake, and did everythingthat nurse had done, only I made a much finer image than the one she had made;and when it was finished I did everything that I could imagine and much morethan she did, because it was the likeness of something far better. And a fewdays later, when I had done my lessons early, I went for the second time by theway of the little brook that had led me into a strange country. And I followedthe brook, and went through the bushes, and beneath the low branches of trees,and up thorny thickets on the hill, and by dark woods full of creeping thorns, along, long way. Then I crept through the dark tunnel where the brook had beenand the ground was stony, till at last I came to the thicket that climbed up thehill, and though the leaves were coming out upon the trees, everything lookedalmost as black as it was on the first day that I went there. And the thicketwas just the same, and I went up slowly till I came out on the big bare hill,and began to walk among the wonderful rocks. I saw the terrible voor again oneverything, for though the sky was brighter, the ring of wild hills all aroundwas still dark, and the hanging woods looked dark and dreadful, and the strangerocks were as grey as ever; and when I looked down on them from the great mound,sitting on the stone, I saw all their amazing circles and rounds within rounds,and I had to sit quite still and watch them as they began to turn about me, andeach stone danced in its place, and they seemed to go round and round in a greatwhirl, as if one were in the middle of all the stars and heard them rushingthrough the air. So I went down among the rocks to dance with them and to singextraordinary songs; and I went down through the other thicket, and drank fromthe bright stream in the close and secret valley, putting my lips down to thebubbling water; and then I went on till I came to the deep, brimming well amongthe glittering moss, and I sat down. I looked before me into the secret darknessof the valley, and behind me was the great high wall of grass, and all around methere were the hanging woods that made the valley such a secret place. I knewthere was nobody here at all besides myself, and that no one could see me. So Itook off my boots and stockings, and let my feet down into the water, saying thewords that I knew. And it was not cold at all, as I expected, but warm and verypleasant, and when my feet were in it I felt as if they were in silk, or as ifthe nymph were kissing them. So when I had done, I said the other words and madethe signs, and then I dried my feet with a towel I had brought on purpose, andput on my stockings and boots. Then I climbed up the steep wall, and went intothe place where there are the hollows, and the two beautiful mounds, and theround ridges of land, and all the strange shapes. I did not go down into thehollow this time, but I turned at the end, and made out the figures quiteplainly, as it was lighter, and I had remembered the story I had quite forgottenbefore, and in the story the two figures are called Adam and Eve, and only thosewho know the story understand what they mean. So I went on and on till I came tothe secret wood which must not be described, and I crept into it by the way Ihad found. And when I had gone about halfway I stopped, and turned round, andgot ready, and I bound the handkerchief tightly round my eyes, and made quitesure that I could not see at all, not a twig, nor the end of a leaf, nor thelight of the sky, as it was an old red silk handkerchief with large yellowspots, that went round twice and covered my eyes, so that I could see nothing.Then I began to go on, step by step, very slowly. My heart beat faster andfaster, and something rose in my throat that choked me and made me want to cryout, but I shut my lips, and went on. Boughs caught in my hair as I went, andgreat thorns tore me; but I went on to the end of the path. Then I stopped, andheld out my arms and bowed, and I went round the first time, feeling with myhands, and there was nothing. I went round the second time, feeling with myhands, and there was nothing. Then I went round the third time, feeling with myhands, and the story was all true, and I wished that the years were gone by, andthat I had not so long a time to wait before I was happy for ever and ever.Nurse must have been a prophet like those we read of in the Bible. Everythingthat she said began to come true, and since then other things that she told meof have happened. That was how I came to know that her stories were true andthat I had not made up the secret myself out of my own head. But there wasanother thing that happened that day. I went a second time to the secret place.It was at the deep brimming well, and when I was standing on the moss I bentover and looked in, and then I knew who the white lady was that I had seen comeout of the water in the wood long ago when I was quite little. And I trembledall over, because that told me other things. Then I remembered how sometimeafter I had seen the white people in the wood, nurse asked me more about them,and I told her all over again, and she listened, and said nothing for a long,long time, and at last she said, “You will see her again.” So I understood whathad happened and what was to happen. And I understood about the nymphs; how Imight meet them in all kinds of places, and they would always help me, and Imust always look for them, and find them in all sorts of strange shapes andappearances. And without the nymphs I could never have found the secret, andwithout them none of the other things could happen. Nurse had told me all aboutthem long ago, but she called them by another name, and I did not know what shemeant, or what her tales of them were about, only that they were very queer. Andthere were two kinds, the bright and the dark, and both were very lovely andvery wonderful, and some people saw only one kind, and some only the other, butsome saw them both. But usually the dark appeared first, and the bright onescame afterwards, and there were extraordinary tales about them. It was a day ortwo after I had come home from the secret place that I first really knew thenymphs. Nurse had shown me how to call them, and I had tried, but I did not knowwhat she meant, and so I thought it was all nonsense. But I made up my mind Iwould try again, so I went to the wood where the pool was, where I saw the whitepeople, and I tried again. The dark nymph, Alanna, came, and she turned the poolof water into a pool of fire . . .EPILOGUE“That's a very queer story,” said Cotgrave, handing back the green book to therecluse, Ambrose. “I see the drift of a good deal, but there are many thingsthat I do not grasp at all. On the last page, for example, what does she mean by‘nymphs’?”“Well, I think there are references throughout the manuscript to certain‘processes’ which have been handed down by tradition from age to age. Some ofthese processes are just beginning to come within the purview of science, whichhas arrived at them—or rather at the steps which lead to them—by quite differentpaths. I have interpreted the reference to ‘nymphs’ as a reference to one ofthese processes.”“And you believe that there are such things?”“Oh, I think so. Yes, I believe I could give you convincing evidence on thatpoint. I am afraid you have neglected the study of alchemy? It is a pity, forthe symbolism, at all events, is very beautiful, and moreover if you wereacquainted with certain books on the subject, I could recall to your mindphrases which might explain a good deal in the manuscript that you have beenreading.”“Yes; but I want to know whether you seriously think that there is anyfoundation of fact beneath these fancies. Is it not all a department of poetry;a curious dream with which man has indulged himself?” “I can only say that it isno doubt better for the great mass of people to dismiss it all as a dream. Butifyou ask my veritable belief—that goes quite the other way. No; I should notsay belief, but rather knowledge. I may tell you that I have known cases inwhich men have stumbled quite by accident on certain of these ‘processes,’ andhave been astonished by wholly unexpected results. In the cases I am thinking ofthere could have been no possibility of ‘suggestion’ or sub-conscious action ofany kind. One might as well suppose a schoolboy ‘suggesting’ the existence ofÆschylus to himself, while he plods mechanically through the declensions.“But you have noticed the obscurity,” Ambrose went on, “and in this particularcase it must have been dictated by instinct, since the writer never thought thather manuscripts would fall into other hands. But the practice is universal, andfor most excellent reasons. Powerful and sovereign medicines, which are, ofnecessity, virulent poisons also, are kept in a locked cabinet. The child mayfind the key by chance, and drink herself dead; but in most cases the search iseducational, and the phials contain precious elixirs for him who has patientlyfashioned the key for himself.”“You do not care to go into details?”“No, frankly, I do not. No, you must remain unconvinced. But you saw how themanuscript illustrates the talk we had last week?”“Is this girl still alive?”“No. I was one of those who found her. I knew the father well; he was a lawyer,and had always left her very much to herself. He thought of nothing but deedsand leases, and the news came to him as an awful surprise. She was missing onemorning; I suppose it was about a year after she had written what you have read.The servants were called, and they told things, and put the only naturalinterpretation on them—a perfectly erroneous one.“They discovered that green book somewhere in her room, and I found her in theplace that she described with so much dread, lying on the ground before theimage.”“It was an image?”“Yes, it was hidden by the thorns and the thick undergrowth that had surroundedit. It was a wild, lonely country; but you know what it was like by herdescription, though of course you will understand that the colours have beenheightened. A child's imagination always makes the heights higher and the depthsdeeper than they really are; and she had, unfortunately for herself, somethingmore than imagination. One might say, perhaps, that the picture in her mindwhich she succeeded in a measure in putting into words, was the scene as itwould have appeared to an imaginative artist. But it is a strange, desolateland.”“And she was dead?”“Yes. She had poisoned herself—in time. No; there was not a word to be saidagainst her in the ordinary sense. You may recollect a story I told you theother night about a lady who saw her child's fingers crushed by a window?”“And what was this statue?”“Well, it was of Roman workmanship, of a stone that with the centuries had notblackened, but had become white and luminous. The thicket had grown up about itand concealed it, and in the Middle Ages the followers of a very old traditionhad known how to use it for their own purposes. In fact it had been incorporatedinto the monstrous mythology of the Sabbath. You will have noted that those towhom a sight of that shining whiteness had been vouchsafed by chance, or rather,perhaps, by apparent chance, were required to blindfold themselves on theirsecond approach. That is very significant.”“And is it there still?”“I sent for tools, and we hammered it into dust and fragments.”“The persistence of tradition never surprises me,” Ambrose went on after apause. “I could name many an English parish where such traditions as that girlhad listened to in her childhood are still existent in occult but unabatedvigour. No, for me, it is the ‘story’ not the ‘sequel,’ which is strange andawful, for I have always believed that wonder is of the soul.”"},{"pageContent":"Image [images/u3.jpg] THE SEA LURE Image [images/u4.jpg]by Dion FortuneBorn Violet Mary Firth, Dion Fortune (1890-1946) is known amongst occultists asa brilliant magician and esoteric scholar. Like Machen and Crowley, she was anadept of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and penned the classic moderntextbook of Hermetic magic, The Mystical Qabalah (1935). Her direct and indirectinfluence on the revival of magic and the evolution of the hermetic thought inthe twentieth century is incalculable.She was also a marvelous and lucid novelist whose mastery of the psychologicalworks of Jung and Freud lifted the arts of Western Esotericism out of the pit ofmediaeval superstition. “The Sea Lure,” taken from her greater collection TheSecrets of Doctor Taverner, is one of a dozen stories that tell of supernaturaldisorders and the doctor's unconventional methods of treatment. In theintroduction to the collection, she wrote:It may not unreasonably be asked what motive anyone could have for securing ahearing for such histories as are set forth in these tales, beyond the notunreasonable interest in the royalties of horrors; I would ask readers, however,to credit me with another motive that the purely commercial. I was one of theearliest students of psychoanalysis in this country, and I found, in the courseof my studies, that the ends of a number of threads were put into my hands, butthat the threads disappeared into the darkness that surrounded the small circleof light thrown by exact scientific knowledge. It was following these threadsout into the darkness of the Unknown that I came upon the experiences and cases,which, turned into fiction, are set down in these pages.THE SEA LURE“Do you know anything about stigmata?” said my vis-à-vis. It was a veryunexpected question to have shot at one under the circumstances. I had beenunable to evade an invitation to spend the evening with an old fellow-studentwho since the war had held the uninspiring post of medical officer at a poor lawinstitution, a post for which I should say he was admirably fitted, and I nowfound myself facing him across a not very elegant supper table in his quartersin a great fortress of dingy red brick which looked out for miles over the greywastes of sordidness which are South London.I was so taken by surprise that he had to repeat his question before I answeredit.“Do you know anything about stigmata? Hysterical stigmata?” he said again. “Ihave seen simulated tumours,” I said, “they are fairly common, but I have neverseen actual flesh wounds, such as the saints were supposed to have had.”“What do you attribute them to?” asked my companion.“Auto-suggestion,” I replied. “Imagination so vivid that it actually affects thetissues of the body.”“I have got a case in one of my wards that I should like to show you,” he said.“A most curious case. I think it is hysterical stigmata, I cannot account for itany other way. A girl was brought in here a couple of days ago suffering from agunshot wound in the shoulder. She came here to have the bullet removed, butwould give no account as to how she came by the injury. We admitted her, butcouldn't see any bullet, which was rather puzzling. She was in a condition ofsemi-stupor, which we naturally attributed to loss of blood, and so we kept herhere. Of course there is nothing odd in all that, save our failure to locate thebullet, but then such things happen even with the best apparatus, and ours is along way from being that. But here is the queer part of the case.“I was sitting quietly up here last night between 11 and 12 when I heard ashriek, of course there is nothing odd about that either, in this district. Butin a minute or two they rang up on the house telephone to say that I was wantedin the wards, and I went down to find this girl with another bullet wound. Noone had heard a shot fired, all the windows were intact, there was a nurse not10 feet from her. When we X-rayed her we again failed to find the bullet, yetthere was a clean hole drilled in her shoulder, and, oddest of all, it neverbled a drop. What do you make of it?”“If you are certain there is no external agency at work, then the onlyhypothesis is an internal one. Is she an hysterical type?”“Distinctly. Looks as if she came out of one of Burne-Jones's pictures.Moreover, she has been in a sort of stupor each night for an hour or more at atime. It was while in this state that she developed the second wound. Would youcare to come down and have a look at her? I should like to have your opinion. Iknow you have gone in for psychoanalysis and all sorts of things that are beyondmy ken.”I accompanied him to the wards, and there we found in one of the rough infirmarybeds a girl who, lying on the coarse pillow, with closed eyes and parted lips,looked exactly like the Beata Beatrix of Rossetti's vision, save thathoney-coloured hair flowed over the pillow like sea-weed. When she opened hereyes at our presence, they were green as sea-water seen from a rock.All was quiet in the ward, for infirmary patients are settled for the night atan early hour, and my friend signed to the nurse to put screens round the bedthat we might examine our case without disturbing them. It was as he had said,two obvious bullet wounds, one more recent than the other, and from theirposition and proximity, I judged that they have been inflicted with intention todisable, but not to kill. In fact she had been very neatly “winged” by an expertmarksman. It was only the circumstances of the second shot that gave the caseany interest except a criminal one.I sat down on a chair at the bedside, and began to talk to her, seeking to winher confidence. She gazed back at me dreamily with her strange sea-green eyesand answered my questions readily enough. She seemed curiously detached,curiously indifferent to our opinion of her; as if she lived in a far-away worldof her own, about which she was quite willing to talk to any one who wasinterested.“Do you dream much?” I said, making the usual opening.This seemed to touch a subject of interest.“Oh, yes,” she replied, “I dream a tremendous lot. I always have dreamt, eversince I can remember. I think my dreams are the realest part of my life—and thebest part,” she added with a smile, “so why shouldn't I?”“Your dreams seem to have led you into danger recently,” I answered, drawing abow at a venture.She looked at me sharply, as if to see how much I knew, and then saidthoughtfully: “Yes, I mustn't go there again. But I expect I shall, all thesame,” she added with an elfish smile.“Can you go where you choose in your dreams?” I asked.“Sometimes,” she replied, and was about to say more, when she caught sight of mycompanion's bewildered face and the words died on her lips. I saw that she waswhat Taverner would have called “One of Us,” and my interest was roused. Ipitied the refined, artistic-looking girl in these sordid surroundings, hergreat shining eyes looking out like those of a caged creature behind bars; and Isaid: “What is your work?”“Shop girl,” she replied; a smile curling the corners of her lips. “Drapery, tobe precise.” Her words and manner were so at variance with her description ofherself, that I was still further intrigued.“Where are you going when you come out of here?” I enquired.She looked wearily out into the distance, the little smile still hovering abouther mouth. “Back into my dreams, I expect,” she replied. “I don't suppose Ishall find anywhere else to go.”I knew well Taverner's generosity with necessitous cases, especially if theywere of “his own kind,” and I felt sure that he would be interested both in thepersonality of the girl and in her peculiar injuries, and I said:“How would you like to go down to a convalescent home at Hindhead when you leavehere?” She gazed at me in silence for a moment with her strange gleaming eyes.“Hindhead?” she asked. “What sort of a place is that?”“It is moorland,” I replied. “Heather and pine, you know, very bracing.”“Oh, if it could only be the sea!' she exclaimed wistfully. “A rocky coast,miles from anywhere, where the Atlantic rollers come in and the seabirds areflying and calling. If it could only be the sea I should get right! The moorsare not my place, it is the sea I need, it is life to me.”She paused abruptly, as if she feared to have said too much, and then she added:“Please don't think that I am ungrateful, a rest and change would be a greathelp. Yes, I should be very thankful for a letter for the nursing home—” Hervoice trailed into silence and her eyes, looking more like deep-sea water thanever, gazed unseeing into a distance where I have no doubt the gulls were flyingand calling and the Atlantic rollers coming in from the West.“She has gone off again,” said my host. “It is apparently her regular time forgoing into a state of coma.”As we watched her, she took a deep inspiration, and then all breathing ceased.It ceased for so long, although the pulse continued vigorously, that I was juston the point of suggesting artificial respiration, when with a profoundexhalation, the lungs took up their work with deep rhythmical gasps. Now if youobserve a person's respiration closely, you will invariably found that youyourself begin to breathe with the same rhythm. It was a very peculiar rhythmwhich I found myself assuming, and yet it was not unfamiliar. I had breathedwith that rhythm before, and I searched my subconscious mind for the due.Suddenly I found it. It was the respiration of breathing in rough water. Nodoubt the cessation of breathing represented the dive. The girl was dreaming ofher sea.So absorbed was I in the problem that I would have sat up all night in the hopeof finding some evidence of the mysterious assailant, but my host touched mysleeve. “We had better be moving,” he said. “Matron, you know.” And I followedhim out of the darkened ward.“What do you make of it?” he enquired eagerly as soon as we were out in thecorridor.“I think as you do,” I answered; “that we are dealing with a case of stigmata,but it will require more plumbing than I could give it this evening, and Ishould like to keep in touch with her if you are willing.”He was only too willing; seeing himself in print in the Lancet and possessed ofthat dubious type of glory which comes to the owners of curios. It was a blessedbreak in the monotony of his routine, and he naturally welcomed it.Now that which is to follow will doubtless be set down as the grossest kind ofcoincidence, and as several such coincidences have been reported in thesechronicles, I do not suppose I have much reputation for veracity anyway. ButTaverner always held that some coincidences, especially those which might beconceived to serve the purpose of an intelligent Providence, were not asfortuitous as they appeared to be, but were due to causes which operatedinvisibly upon the subtler planes of existence, and whose effects alone wereseen in our material world; and that those of us who are in touch with theunseen, as he was, and as I, to a lesser degree on account of my associationwith him in his work, had also come to be, might get ourselves into the hiddencurrents of that realm, and thereby be brought in touch with those engaged insimilar pursuits. I had too often watched Taverner picking up people apparentlyat random and arriving at the psychological moment apparently by chance, todoubt the operation of some such laws as he described, though I neitherunderstand their workings nor recognize them at the time; it is only inperspective that one sees the Unseen Hand.Therefore it was that when, on my return to Hindhead, Taverner requested me toundertake a certain task, I concluded that my plans with regard to the study ofthe stigmata case must be set aside, and banished the matter from my mind.“Rhodes,” he said, “I want you to undertake a piece of work for me. I would gomyself, but it is extremely difficult for me to get away, and you know enough ofmy methods by now, combined with your native common sense (in which I have muchmore faith than in many people's psychism) to be able to report the matter, andpossibly deal with it under my instruction.”He handed me a letter. It was inscribed, “Care G.H. Frater,” and began withoutany further preamble: “That of which you warned me has occurred. I have indeedgot in out of my depth, and unless you can pull me out I shall be a drowned man,literally as well as metaphorically. I cannot get away from here and come toyou; can you possibly come to me?” And a quotation from Virgil, which seemed tohave little bearing on the subject, closed the appeal. Scenting adventure, Ireadily acceded to Taverner's request. It was a long journey I had to undertake,and when the train came to rest at its terminus in the grey twilight of a winterafternoon, I could smell the keen salt tang of the wind that drove straight infrom the West. To me there is always something thrilling in arriving at aseaside place and getting the first glimpse of the sea, and my mind reverted tothat other solitary soul who had loved blue water, the girl with the Rossettiface, who lay in the rough infirmary bed in the dreary desert of South London.She was vividly present to my mind as I entered the musty four-wheeler, whichwas all that the station could produce in the off-season, and drove throughdeserted and wind-swept streets on to the sea-front. The line of breakers showedgrey through the gathering darkness as we left the asphalt and boarding housesbehind us and followed the coast road out into the alluvial flats beyond thetown. Presently the road began to wind upwards towards the cliffs, and I couldhear the horse wheezing with the ascent, till a hail from the darkness put astop to our progress; a figure clad in an Inverness cape appeared in the lightof the carriage lamps, and a voice, which had that indefinable something whichOxford always gives a man, greeted me by name and invited me to alight.Although I could see no sign of a habitation, I did as I was bidden, and thecabman, manoeuvring his vehicle, departed into the windy darkness and left mealone with my invisible host. He possessed himself of my bag, and we set offstraight for the edge of the cliff, so far as I could make out, leaning upagainst the force of the gale. An invisible surf crashed and roared below us,and it seemed to me that drowning was the order of the day for both of us.Presently, however, I felt a path under my feet. “Keep close to the rock,”shouted my guide. (Next day I knew why.) And we dipped over the edge of thecliff and began to descend its face. We continued in this way for what seemed tome an immense distance, I learnt later it was about a quarter of a mile, andthen, to my amazement, I heard the click of a latch. It was too dark to seeanything, but warm air smote my face, and I knew that I was under cover. I heardmy host fumbling with a box of matches, and as the light flared, I saw that Iwas in a good-sized room, apparently hewn out of the cliff face, and a mostcomfortable apartment. Book-lined, warmly curtained, Persian rugs on the smoothstone of the floor, and a fire of drift wood burning on the open hearth, whichthe toe of my companion's boot soon stirred to a blaze. The amazing contrast tomy gloomy and perilous arrival took my breath away.My host smiled. “I am afraid,” he said, “that you were making up your mind to bemurdered. I ought to have explained to you the nature of my habitation. I am soused to it myself, that it does not seem to me that it may appear strange toothers. It is an old smuggler's lair that I have adapted to my use, and beingmade of the living rock, it has peculiar advantages for the work on which I amengaged.”We sat down to the meal that was already upon the table, and I had anopportunity to study the appearance of my host. Whether he was an elderly manwho had preserved his youth, or a young man prematurely aged, I could not tell,but the maturity of his mind was such that I inclined to the former hypothesis,for a wide experience of men and things must have gone to the ripening of such anature as his.His face had something of the lawyer about it, but his hands were those of anartist. It was a combination I had often seen before in Taverner's friends, forthe intellectual who has a touch of the mystic generally ends in occultism. Hishair was nearly white, in strange contrast to his wind-tanned face and darksparkling eyes. His figure was spare and athletic, and well above middle height,but his movements had not the ease of youth, but rather the measured dignity ofa man who is accustomed to public appearances.It was an interesting and impressive personality, but he showed none of thesigns of distress that his letter had led me to expect. After-dinner pipes soonled to confidences, and after sitting for a while in the warm fire-lit silence,my host seemed to gather his resolution together, and after crossing anduncrossing his legs several times uneasily, finally said:“Well, doctor, this visit is on business, not pleasure, so we may as well ‘Cutthe cackle and come to the ‘osses.’ I suppose I appear to you to be sane enoughat the present moment?” I bowed my assent.“At 11 o'clock you will have the pleasure of seeing me go off my head.”“Will you tell me what you are experiencing?” I said.“You are not one of us,” he replied (I had probably failed to acknowledge somesign), “but you must be in Taverner's confidence or he would not have sent you.I am going to speak freely to you. You are willing to admit, I presume, thatthere is more in heaven and earth than you are taught in the medical schools?”“No one can look life honestly in the face without admitting that,” I replied.“I have respect for the unseen, though I don't pretend to understand it.”“Good man” was the reply. “You will be more use to me than a brother occultistwho might encourage me in my delusions. I want facts, not fantasies. Once I amcertain that I am deluded, I can pull myself together; it is the uncertaintythat is baffling me.”He looked at his watch; paused, and then with an effort plunged in medias res.“I have been studying the elemental forces: I suppose you know what that means?The semi-intelligent entities behind the potencies of nature. We divide theminto four classes—earth, air, fire and water. Now I am of the earth, earthy.”I raised my eyebrows in query, for his appearance belied the description he gaveof himself. He smiled. “I did not say of the flesh, fleshly. That is quite adifferent matter. But in my horoscope I have five planets in earth signs, andconsequently my nature is bound up with the formal side of things. Now in orderto counteract this state of affairs I set myself to get in touch with thefluidic side of nature, elemental water. I have succeeded in doing so.” Hepaused and packed the tobacco in his pipe with a nervous gesture. “But not onlyhave I got in touch with the water elementals, but they have got in touch withme. One in particular.’ The pipe again required attention.“It was a most extraordinary, exhilarating experience. Everything I lackedseemed to be added to me. I was complete, vital, in circuit with the cosmicforces. In fact, I got everything I had sought in marriage and failed to find.But, and here's the rub, the creature that called me was in the water, and itwas in the water that I had to meet her. Round this headland the tides run likefury, no swimmer could hold his own against them, even in calm weather; but bynight, and in a storm, which is the time she generally comes, it would becertain death; but she calls me, and she wills me to go to her, and one of thesenights I shall do so. That is my trouble.”He stopped, but I could see by the working of his face that there was more tocome so I kept silence. He bent down and took from the side of the hearth anobject which he handed to me. It was a small crucible, and had evidently beenused to melt down silver.“You will laugh when I tell you what I used that for. To make silverbullets—silver bullets to shoot with.” He hid his face in his hands. ‘Oh, myGod, I tried to murder her!’ The flood-gates of emotion were open, and I couldsee his shoulders heave to the tide of it.“I could see her as she swam in the moonlight, and as her shoulder rose to thestroke, I shot her in the round white curve of it, white as foam against theblack water. And she vanished. Then I thought I had killed the thing I loved. Iwould have given heaven and earth to bring her back and to swim out there to herin the tide-race and drown with her. I was like a madman, I wandered on theshore for days, I could neither eat nor sleep. And then she came again, and Iknew that it was my life or hers, and I, being of the earth, clung to the lifeof form, and I shot her again. And now I am in torment. I love her, I long forher, I call to her in the unseen, and when she comes to me, I wait for her witha rifle.”He came to an abrupt stop and remained rigid, gazing into the heart of the dyingfire, his empty pipe in his hand. I glanced surreptitiously at my watch, and sawthat the hands were pointing to 11. His hour was upon him.He rose, and crossing the room, drew back the draperies at the far end andrevealed a casement window. Flinging it open, he seated himself on the sill andgazed fixedly into the darkness without. Moving softly I took my place behindhim, where I could see what was happening outside, and be ready to seize hold ofhim if necessary.For a while we waited; the clouds hurried over the moon sometimes, letting itsradiance pour out in a silver flood, but more often hiding its face and leavingus in the roaring, crashing darkness of that surf-beaten coast.It was indeed a “magic casement opening on the foam of perilous seas in faerylands forlorn.” I shall never forget that vigil.Nothing but heaving waters as far as eye could see, all flecked with foam in themoonlight where the reefs were hidden by the flood tide, which swirled below uslike a mill-race. My companion's fine-cut features had the boldness andimmobility of the statue of a Roman emperor, silhouetted against the silverbackground of the water.He never stirred, he might have been carven in stone, till I saw a quiver runthrough him and knew that he had found that for which he waited. I strained myeyes to see what it was that had caught his attention, and sure enough, rightout in the track of the moonlight, something was swimming. Coming steadilytowards us through the reefs, the white shoulder lifting to the stroke just ashe had described it, nearer, nearer, where no living soul could have swum inthat wild tide-race, till, not 30 yards from the base of the cliffs, I coulddescry a woman's form with the hair streaming out like seaweed.The man at the window leant right out stretching forth his arms to the swimmer,and I, fearing that he would overbalance, put mine gently round him and drew himback into the room.He seemed oblivious of my presence, and yielded to the pressure as if asleep,and I lowered him gently to the floor where he lay motionless in a trance. Istooped to feel his pulse, and as I counted the slow beats, I heard a sound thatmade me hold my breath and listen. It seemed as if the sea had risen and filledthe room, and yet not the material sea, but its ghost; shadowy impalpablesea-water flowed in waves to the very ceiling, and the seacreatures looked infrom without.Then I saw the form of a woman at the window. Shining with its own luminosity,it was clearly visible in the green gloom that was like the bottom of the sea.The hair floated out like seaweed, the shoulders gleamed like marble, the facewas that of a Beata Beatrix awakened from her dream, and the eyes were likesea-water seen from a rock, and there, sure enough, were the marks where thesilver bullets had wounded her.We looked into each other's eyes, and I am convinced she saw me as clearly as Isaw her, and that she knew me, for the same faint smile that I had seen beforehovered on her lips. I spoke as one addressing a sentient creature.“Do not try to take him in this way,” I said, “or you will kill him. Trust me, Iwill make things right. I will explain everything.”She looked at me with those strange sea-green eyes of hers, as if piercing myvery soul; apparently satisfied, she withdrew, and the shadowy seawater flowedafter till the room was emptied.I came to myself to find the quizzical eyes of my host fixed on me as he sat inhis chair smoking his pipe.“Physician, heal thyself!” he said.I rose stiffly from my seat and subsided into a chair, lighting a cigarette withnumbed fingers. A few whiffs of the soothing smoke steadied my nerves andenabled me to think.“Well, doctor,” came the voice of my host in gentle raillery, “what is yourdiagnosis?”I paused, for I realized the critical nature of that which I was about to do.“If I were to tell you that last night I was at the bedside of that girl we sawswimming out there, and that she had two bullet wounds in her shoulder, whatwould you say?”He leant forward, his lips parted, but no sound came from them. “If I told youthat the bullet-wounds arose spontaneously without any external agency, and thatthe doctor considered them to be hysterical stigmata, how would you explain it?”“By Jove,” he exclaimed, “it sounds like a case of repercussion! I came acrossseveral instances of it when I was studying the Scottish State Papers relatingto the witch trials in the sixteenth century. It was a thing often related ofthe witches, that they could project the astral double out of the physical bodyand so appear at a distance. I had something of that kind at the back of my mindwhen I made the silver bullets. Old country-folk believe that it is only withsilver bullets that you can shoot a witch. Lead has no effect on them. But youmean to tell me that you have actually seen—seen in the flesh—the woman whoseastral body it was we saw out there in the water? Good Lord, doctor, I am indeedout of my depth! I don't believe I ever thought in my heart that the things Iwas studying were real, I thought they were just states of consciousness.”“But aren't states of consciousness real?”“Yes, of course they are, on their own plane, that is the whole teaching ofoccult science. But I always thought they were entirely subjective, experiencesof the imagination. It never occurred to me that anyone else could share them.”“You—we both—seem to have shared in this girl's dreams, for she escapes from herdreary reality by imagining herself swimming in the sea.”“Tell me about her—What is she like? Where did you meet her?”“Before I answer that question, will you first tell me your motive for askingit? Do you want to be rid of her? Because if so, I can probably persuade her toleave you alone.”“I want to make her acquaintance,” came the reluctant reply. “I was pretty badlybitten once, and haven't spoken to a woman for years, but this—seems to bedifferent. Yes, I would like to make her acquaintance. Tell me, who is she? whatis she? what is her name? what are her people like?”“She is, as you have seen, of very unusual appearance. Many people would notconsider her beautiful, others would rave about her. She is somewhere in thetwenties. Intelligent, refined, her voice is that of an educated woman. Her nameI do not know, for she was lying in an infirmary bed, and was therefore just anumber. Nor do I know what her people are. I don't fancy she has any, for Igathered she was entirely destitute. She is a shop girl by trade—drapery, to beprecise.”During this recital my host's face had changed in an indefinable way. The cheekshad fallen in, the eyes had lost their brilliancy and become sunken, and anetwork of lines sprang up all over the skin. He had suddenly become worn andold, the burntout cinder of a man. I was at a loss to account for this appallingchange till his words gave me the clue.“I think,” he said in a voice that had lost all resonance, “that I had betterlet the matter drop. A shop girl, you say? No, it would be most unsuitable, mostunwise. It never does to marry outside one's own class. I—er—No, we will say nomore about the matter. I must pull myself together. Now that I understand thecondition I am sure I have the willpower to return to the normal. In fact I feelthat you have cured me already. I am sure that I shall never have a return of mydream, its power over me is broken. If you will give me your companionship forjust a few more days till I feel that my health is quite re-established I shallbe all right. But we will not refer to the matter again; I beg of you, doctor,not to refer to it, for I wish to banish the whole experience from my mind.”Looking at him as he crouched in his chair, the broken, devitalized wreck of theman whose fine presence I had admired, it seemed to me that the remedy was worsethan the disease. He had, by an effort of his trained will, broken the subtlemagnetic rapport that bound him to the girl, and with the breaking of it, thesource of his vitality had gone.“But look here,” I protested, “are you sure that you are doing the right thing?The girl may be quite all right in herself, even if she has to work for aliving. If she means all this to you, surely you are throwing away somethingbig.”For answer he rose, and going silently out of the room, closed the door behindhim, and I knew that argument was useless. He was bound within his limitationsand unable to escape out of them into the freedom which is life. Of the earth,earthy. I wrote a full account of these transactions to Taverner, and thensettled down to await his instructions as to future procedure.The situation was somewhat strained. My host looked like a man whose life hadfallen about his ears. Day by day, almost hour by hour, he seemed to age. He satin his rock-hewn room, refusing to move, and it was with the greatest difficultythat I succeeded in coaxing him out daily for a walk on the smooth hard sandsthat stretched for miles when the tide receded. When the water was up he wouldnot go near it; he seemed to have a horror of the sea.Two days passed in this way, with no word from Taverner, till on our return fromour morning walk, we found that a slip of paper had been pushed under the doorof our cavern. It was the ordinary post office intimation to say that a telegramhad been brought in our absence, and now awaited me at the post office. Notsorry for a break in our routine, though a little uneasy about my patient, Iimmediately set off on the three-mile walk to the town to get my telegram. Iwent up the perilous path cut out of the face of the rock, and then along thecliff road, for though it was possible to walk into town on the sands, the tidewas coming in, and it was doubtful if I would be able to round the headlandbefore the undercliff was awash, at any rate my host thought it was too riskyfor a stranger to attempt it.As I went up over the turf of the headland, a thrill ran through me like wine toa starving man. The air was full of dancing golden motes; the turf, the rock,the sea, were alive with a vast life and I could feel their slow breathing. AndI thought of the man I had left in the dwelling in the cliff face, the man whohad come so far in his quest of the larger life, but who dared not take thefinal step.At the post office of that desolate and forsaken watering-place I duly receivedmy telegram.“Am sending stigmata case. She arrives 4.15. Arrange lodgings and meet her.Taverner.” I gave a whistle that brought the postmaster and his entire staff tothe front counter, and taking counsel with them, I obtained certain addresseswhither I repaired, and finally succeeded in arranging suitable accommodation.What the upshot would be could not imagine, but at any rate it was out of myhands now.At the appointed time I presented myself at the station and soon picked out myprotégée from the scanty handful of arrivals. She looked very tired with thejourney; frail, forlorn, and shabby. What with the fume of the engine and thefrowst of the cab, there was no smell of the sea to revive her, and I couldhardly get a word out of her during the drive to the lodgings, but as shedisembarked from the crazy vehicle, a rush of salt-laden wind struck her in theface, and below us, in the dusk, we heard the crash-rush of the waves on thepebbles. The effect was magical. The girl flung up her head like a startledhorse, and vitality seemed to flow into her, and when I presented her to herlandlady, there was little to indicate the convalescent I had represented her tobe.When I returned to the rock-hewn eyrie of my host, his courtesy forbade him toquestion me as to the cause of my long absence, and indeed, I doubt if he feltany interest, for he seemed to have sunk into himself so completely that hisgrip on life was gone. I could hardly rouse him sufficiently to make him takethe evening paper I had brought from the town; it lay on his knee unread whilehe gazed into the driftwood fire with unseeing eyes.The following day the tide had not receded sufficiently for a morning walk, soit was not till the afternoon that we went for our constitutional. We had leftit rather late, and on our way back in the early winter twilight we had to fordseveral gathering pools. We swung along over the sand barefoot, boots slung overour shoulders and trousers rolled to the knee, for it was one of those mild daysthat often come in January—when out on the edge of the incoming surf we saw afigure.“Good Lord!” said my companion. “Who in the world is the fool out there? He willbe cut off by the tide and won't be able to get out of the bay by now. He willhave to come up by the cliff path. I had better warn him.” And he let out ahalloo.But the wind was blowing towards us, and the figure, out there in the noise ofthe surf, did not hear. My companion went striding over the sand towards thesolitary wader, but I, who had somewhat better eyes than he had, did not electto accompany him, for I had seen long hair blown out like seaweed and the flyingfolds of a skirt.I saw him walk into the ankle-deep water that creamed over the flat sands,forerunner of the advancing line of breakers. He called again to the wader, whoturned but did not come towards him, but instead held out her hand with astrange welcoming gesture. Slowly, as if fascinated by that summoning hand, headvanced into the water, till he was within touch of her. The first of theadvancing waves smote her knees and ran past her in yeasty foam. The next smoteher hip; the tide was rising fast with the wind behind it. A shower ofover-carried spray hit him in the face. Still the girl would not move, and thewaves were mounting up perilously behind her. It was not until he caught theoutstretched hand that she yielded and let him draw her ashore.They came towards me over the sand, still hand in hand, for they had forgottento loosen their fingers, and I saw that the life had come back to his face andthat his eyes sparkled with the brilliancy of fire. I drew back into the shadowof a rock, and oblivious of me, they passed up the steep path to the cliffdwelling.
