Aleister Crowley possessed far too much technical knowl- edge of magick to readily understand the problems of ordi- nary students. He frequently asked his younger colleagues to help make his teachings more accessible, and once explained that \"It's the sort of thing I can't do myself, not knowing the scope of the mind of the 'gentle reader/\" Like other \"gentle readers\" who have delved into Crowley's system on their own, Brother DuQuette found many of the gaps and pitfalls in the system by the time- honored method of falling into them, scrambling out, and trying again until he crossed them. The present work incor- porates many of the results of his personal work. What is true of science holds true for scientific illumin- ism. DuQuette is the first to allow that while some of his findings may be replicated by future experimenters, others are subjective personal interpretation. But even the latter are invaluable as suggesting other lines of investigation, and as examples of the kind of personalization of the system that enables the magician to make it his or her own. DuQuette also drew on recent research by other stu- dents that will be formally published in the forthcoming one volume edition of Crowley's Book Four. Speaking of Lon Milo DuQuette's mythical eponym, Crowley wrote in Part II of his Book Four that \"Milo began by carrying a newborn calf; and day by day as it grew into a bull, his strength was found sufficient.\" It is not stretching the metaphor too far to suggest that the present work will be useful to many students as an introductory guide to those portions of Crowley's magnum opus dealing with ceremonial magick."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Occultism frequently gives ample grounds for criticism to its detractors by making insupportable claims for vaguely defined powers, the whole compassed by nonsensical the- ory.

Aleister Crowley is dead. He died of natural causes on December 1, 1947 at the age of 72 at his residence at Netherwood, Hastings. His body was discovered by his land- lord who reported that, only moments before, he had heard the old man pacing back and forth across the floor of his sec- ond story apartment. There was no one with him when the end came; therefore subsequent reports that his last words were 'Tm perplexed\" are patently false. Contrary to many reports, he did not die a raving lunatic. He was bright and witty to the end. (Two of his most extraordi- narily brilliant works, The Book ofThoth and Magick Without Tears, were penned in his last years.) He did not die amid squalor and abject poverty. His modest residence in Hastings was, and still is, a charming and reputable country boarding house. Distortions of the facts surrounding his death are minor compared to those that still surround the events of his life. But it is not the purpose of this work to systematically rebut the mountains of misinformation that still denigrate the rep- utation of this remarkable man. This has been accomplished admirably in a variety of well researched biographies includ- ing three excellent works which I do not hesitate to recom- mend to the reader: The Legend of Aleister Crowley by Israel Regardie and R R. Stephensen (Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1986); The Legacy of the Beast by Gerald Suster (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1989); The Eye in the Triangle by Israel Regardie (Phoenix: Falcon Press, 1989)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 There are those, of course, who consider Martin Luther, John Lennon, and Mister Ed satanists, and ballroom dancing and bingo a form of Devil worship. Even though the focus of this book is upon the importance of the ritual works of Aleister Crowley, I would be remiss in my responsibility to the beginning student (not to mention my publisher) if I did not at the outset endeavor to disabuse the reader who has perhaps given credence to the misstate- ments and downright whoppers that continue to be perpet- uated by religious zealots and an assortment of tabloid journalists. My conclusions are the result of over twenty years of research into every aspect of his life; interviews with individuals, both here and abroad, who knew and worked with him, including Major G. L. McMurtry and Dr. Francis (Israel) Regardie; and review of historic documents in the archives of Ordo Templi Orientis, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Syracuse, and the Gerald Yorke col- lection currently housed at the Warburg Institute of the University of London. Let us begin with his reputation as \"The Wickedest Man in the World,\" a black magician, and a Satanist. 1 Although he seemed to enjoy being accused of such things, especially in print, Crowley was none of the above. True, there is much in the imagery of his writings that is dark and at first glance very frightening. But, when viewed objectively, no more so than that found throughout any number of traditional reli- gious texts, Eastern or Western. It is clear, even in his earliest works, that he often over- estimated the level of sophistication and education of his readers, and that he took fiendish delight in terrifying those who were either too lazy or too slow-witted to understand him. The student must bear this ever in mind if he or she expects to get anything out of his writings. In a footnote to Chapter 12 of Magick in Theory and Practice (portions of which are often quoted out of context by detractors to \"prove\" Crowley's advocacy of human sacrifice), he explains quite clearly what he is doing:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"There is a traditional saying that whenever an Adept seems to have made a straightforward, com- prehensible statement, then is it most certain that He means something entirely different. The Truth is nevertheless clearly set forth in His Words: it is His simplicity that baffles the unworthy. I have chosen the expressions in the Chapter in such a way that it is likely to mislead those magicians who allow self- ish interests to cloud their intelligence, but to give useful hints to such as are bound by the proper Oaths to devote their powers to legitimate ends. 2 He did not sacrifice children nor did he participate in or advocate human sacrifice. 3 The preposterous statement writ- ten in the above mentioned chapter, in which it appears he confesses to the sacrifice of over 156 male children in one year, was nothing more than an outrageous literary blind. It is obvious to anyone who carefully reads the chapter and its footnotes that the only thing he was confessing to was his practice of a simple technique of sexual magick whereby he ejaculated 156 times that year without making his partner pregnant. Today the bookstore shelves are filled with books and manuals on Tantra Yoga that elucidate explicitly upon the same sexual technique and hundreds more. But in 1923, when Crowley wrote the above, such candor in print could not be published. Ironically, talk of human sacrifice, and other such shocking subjects, could be. Consequently Crowley clothed many of his teachings in a thin veil of sensational titillation. By doing so he assured himself that 2 The most recent reprinted edition by Magickal Childe Publishing, New York, 1991, p. 100.

It did not matter to him that his writings would continue to be misunderstood for generations after his death. Neither did it matter to him that only a few individuals at any given time would understand him. It only mattered that the works would survive to reach them. There is no question that he lived an extremely eccentric lifestyle which caused rise to many wild rumors and specu- lations, (few of which he was inclined to deny), and often there was at least a scrap of truth in many of the accusations leveled at him. But it must be remembered that what was \"scandalous\" behavior in Victorian and Edwardian England might not seem very shocking to us today. Some of the more imaginative charges leveled against him (i.e., he was Hitler's guru; he ate babies; he personally decapitated Amelia Earhart in Japan; he was responsible for the sinking of the Titanic, etc.) are, needless to say, totally false. He despised the hypocrisy and the spiritually restric- tive aspects of established religions, including Christianity, and did not deny charges that his philosophy was anti- Christian. However, careful examination of his writings reveals a profound understanding and respect for the pure spiritual impulse that is at the heart of all religions. He was by no means perfect. He was not good with peo- ple and often alienated those who loved him dearest. His bold explorations of human sexuality and drugs (always meticulously recorded and analyzed) are fascinating to study, but were never intended to be casually emulated. I have never encountered anyone who knew him that did not dis- approve of some aspect of his character or behavior."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"But he is dead. For us, only his works remain as measure of the man, and they are currently more accessible to the general public than at anytime during his life. His influence on the modern world of art, literature, religion, and philos- ophy is now widely acknowledged even by his most vehe- ment critics. It is my hope that this little book may help bring the wonder of his genius to a new generation of seekers and to an even broader audience of serious students. But, for those whose belief in a God of goodness hinges upon the reality of a Devil who is equally evil; for the superstitious, the ignorant, the lazy, the immature, the unbalanced, the mentally ill, the paranoid, the faint-hearted; for anyone who for any reason cannot or will not take responsibility for their own actions, their own lives, their own souls; for these people Aleister Crowley is still a dangerous man.

Magick in Theory and Practice The above definition of Magick can be as misleading in its simplicity as it is in its complexity. The key word is of course Will, QeXmia 1 in Greek, and according to this definition, any willed action is an act of Magick: brushing your teeth, walk- ing the dog, or even paying your taxes. Conversely any unwilled action is an unmagical act: reaching for a cigarette; ordering that fourth Martini; or any habitual or reactive behavior that overrides the momentum of one's life focus could fall into the category of an unmagical act. Try as we might there is no escaping this simple fact: We are all Magicians and we are either competent or incom- petent practitioners of our craft. The great majority of successful Magicians do not even realize (nor should they care) that they are Magicians, or that there is a name for what they do so well. They just go through life striving to cause change to occur in conformity with their Wills and that's that. They have made a science 1 Thelema; by the Greek Qabalah enumerates to 93 as does Alcorn (Agape) Love."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2 This should not be interpreted as a blanket condemnation of \"Holy Scripture.\" Indeed, the Magick of Thelema is based firmly upon its Holy Book, Liber AL vel Legis.

They work hard, but for them the work is not a burden it is a labor of love and a continuing expression of the purpose of their existence. Obviously most of us do not, without great effort, fall into this fortunate category of human being. Our Magick falls somewhere between competence and incompetence. Occasionally we become aware of what our will is (or might be) and try to work the Magick. But more often than not, we find ourselves simply responding to an endless chain-reac- tion of external events and circumstances over which we have little or no control. Out of fear, frustration, or what might be called spiri- tual fatigue, many of us turn to religions whose champions are more than happy to tell us, in no uncertain terms, exactly where our place in the universe is. The religions that Westerners most frequently are attracted to (Christianity, with its many sects, Judaism, and Islam) postulate a Supreme Being who personifies and man- ifests the order of the universe. The mechanism of this order is often termed the \"will of God/' By surrendering the indi- vidual will to will of God, the religious devotee can theoret- ically harmonize his or her life with that of the Deity's. Not my will, but Thine be done. In order for us to know God's Will, these religions offer, for our great comfort (and often from ancient and \"infalli- ble\" sources), rules, commandments, and assorted scrip- tural injunctions to guide the thoughts and behavior of the faithful. As an added safeguard that these scriptures be \"correctly\" interpreted, a priestcraft of some form or another invariably evolves and assumes the role of a visible media- tor between the worshipper and the Deity. 2 For those who"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Magick of Thelema / 3 dutifully comply with the dictated formulae and surrender their wills to the prescribed will of God, a great burden is lifted from their shoulders. They no longer feel the need for direct spiritual experience, and faith in the infallibility of the dogmatists makes even intellectual investigation unneces- sary. The reward for such spiritual collaborators is the smug comfort of knowing that those who haven't submitted to the formula will suffer after death, and that they who have, will not. Magick also postulates a universal order—call it God, Nature, the Supreme Being, the Grand Architect of the Universe, the Tao, or just the-way-things-are. But the Magician knows that the pure Will of every man and every woman is already in perfect harmony with the divine Will; in fact they are one and the same. It is the Magician's Great Work to endeavor to remove the obstacles that hinder his or her perfect realization of that Will and then proceed to execute it. We perceive in the world around us a vast cosmic order- liness (or at least a glorious systematized chaos). Galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, electrons, and other sub-atomic particles all seem to have found their niche in the grand scheme of things and behave themselves accordingly. By realizing our True Wills we find our place...our orbit. By doing our True Will, we have the inertia of the entire Universe to assist us. The Magician does not necessarily want the burden of existence lifted from his shoulders; he wants to understand why he is carrying it and where."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO THE EVOLUTION OF MAGICAL FORMULAE In the Years of the Primal Course, in the dawn of terrestrial birth, Man mastered the mammoth and horse; and Man was the Lord of the Earth. He made him an hollow skin from the heart of an holy tree; He compassed the earth therein, and Man was the Lord of the Sea. He controlled the vigour of steam, he harnessed the light- ning for hire; He drove the celestial team; and Man was the Lord of the Fire. Deep-mouthed from their thrones deep-seated, the choirs of the aeons declare The last of the demons defeated, for Man is the Lord of the Air.

It can even be a single word that initiates an entire age: TAO; ANATTA; IAQ; QeXr\\iia Magical formulae evolve from older magical formulae as humanity's ability to perceive itself and the universe increases. A change in the consciousness of the race necessitates a change in magical formula. It's not that the old formula doesn't work anymore, it's just that the new one works so much better. Obsolete formulae of the past aren't necessarily discarded completely but are often amended or fine-tuned to better harmonize with a new, expanded understanding of natural or spiritual law. To use an apparently unmagical example, an ancient car- penter or craftsman seeking to determine the area of a small circle might venerate the great Magician who revealed to him that the area could be determined by measuring the radius of the circle, then multiplying that figure by itself, then multiplying that figure by the sacred number 3. For the rough calculations required by our primitive ancestors, this crude formula served quite adequately. But for larger, more complex projects (such as temples, pyramids, etc.) requiring precise computations, the world had to wait for the \"Magick\" of n. Once this new bit of information became general knowl- edge the world was never the same. While this is a very crude analogy, I am confident that the reader can see how it applies to our ever evolving per- ception of ourselves and our place in the universe. THE FORMULA OF THE NEW AGE Great spiritual periods (ages or aeons) are characterized by their magical formula. This is very important and funda-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"mental to the understanding of Magick in general and Thelemic Magick in particular, for the planet has just recently (relatively speaking) entered a new period; a new age; a new aeon. Yes, this is coincidental to what astrologers and song- writers call the Age of Aquarius 1 and what millions of others refer to simply as the New Age. But it would be a mistake to view this new aeon as simply another tick on a great cosmic clock. The Age of Aquarius, profoundly significant as it is, is only one aspect of a far greater new spiritual age. (Such mag- ical aeons do not necessarily coincide with the astrological periods and, according to Crowley 2 , may be of any length.) A more intimate, more magical perspective may be had if, rather than considering the ages as merely astrological epochs, we instead view them as gods. Crowley recognized in the three principal gods of Egypt Isis, Osiris, and Horus the characteristic formulae of the last three magical aeons. The present aeon is that of Horus, which has followed the Aeon of Osiris, which followed the Aeon of Isis. Each aeon is characterized by the level of understanding of nature and of self contemporarily prevalent, and dictates the variety of mag- ical and religious expression that dominate these periods. Here it will be necessary to take a moment to review the myth of Isis, Osiris, and Horus, for it is vitally impor- tant to the understanding of the evolution of magical for- mulae and the Magick of Thelema. Please keep in mind that this is only the briefest sketch of a story that has undergone over four thousand years of revision. 1 The Great Astrological Year lasts approximately 26,000 years and is divided into twelve periods of approximately 2,166 years corresponding to each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. Because the Sun does not quite make it back to its starting point each year, it appears to slowly regress backwards through the zodiac at the rate of one sign every 2,166 years. This is why the Age of Aquarius follows that of Pisces, which followed Aries, etc. 2 Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on THE BOOK OF THE LAW (Montreal: 93 Publishing 1974), p. 271."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE MYTH OF OSIRIS The Creator, Temu, first appeared (from out of a watery chaos) on a sacred mound. Upon this solid foundation of matter he masturbated, creating two children, brother and sister, Shu and Tefnet. These two in turn created Geb (the Earth-god) and Nut 3 (the Sky-goddess) who united to give birth to Osiris, Isis 4 , Seth 5 , and Nephthys. These nine deities make up the ennead of Heliopolis which appear continually throughout the sacred texts. Osiris became king of Egypt, supported by his sister- wife Isis. Theirs was a golden reign that raised the Egyptian people from the sub-human depths of anarchy and canni- balism. They initiated the systematic cultivation of the land in harmony with the flooding cycle of the river Nile, and their administration brought prosperity and happiness. Seth, the brother of Osiris, became increasingly envious of the success of his sibling, and conspired to have him assas- sinated. Secretly he had an ornate box constructed to the exact measurements of the body of Osiris. He then hosted a lavish party for his brother and announced that he would award the box to anyone who could fit perfectly inside. In what can only be described as an act of divine folly, Osiris volunteered to give it a try. As soon as he was comfortably snuggled inside the perfectly fitting box, the lid was imme- diately nailed shut by seventy-two of Seth's co-conspirators and the coffin set adrift on the Nile. Isis, hearing of the murder, immediately set out to find the body. She discovered it at Byblos where it had become imbedded in a tree which had been cut down and used, because of its wondrous aroma, as a column in the palace of the king. She pleaded with the local king for the return of her husband's body and was allowed to take it. 3 Spelled \"Nuit\" in Liber AL vel Legis, chapter I, verse 1. 4 Later identified with the Greek goddess Demeter. 5 Set, later identified with Apophis and the Greek devil-god Typhon."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"As she was returning with it by boat, she laid down upon the body and kissed it until its phallus became mirac- ulously erect. She mounted her dead husband and conceived the child Horus. (Horus or Hoor also has a brother, Hoor- Paar-Kraat, whom the Greeks called Harpocrates. More on this later.) Seth, discovering where Isis had hidden the body, stole it, dismembered it, and scattered the fourteen pieces through- out the entire country. Isis set out again and successfully recovered all the pieces of Osiris, save one 6 , and magically reassembled them, thereby bestowing upon Osiris immortality and rulership of the afterlife. Henceforth pious individuals who faithfully adhered to the complex magical formulae of the cult of Osiris, as outlined in The Book of the Dead, would be assured of the same continuity of existence after death. Their son Horus, to avenge the murder of his father, ini- tiated a mighty struggle against Seth, which according to some stories was successful after three days and according to others is perpetuated to this day. The images of this simple passion play are imbedded deeply in the collective consciousness of the human race. We see it retold almost verbatim by the Greeks as the story of Demeter and Persephone, and Orpheus and Eurydice. IAO, the great God of the Gnostics, even announces the magical formula of life, death, and resurrection in the letters of its name: Isis (Nature) is ruined by Apophis (the forces of destruction and decay), but is cyclically resurrected in Osiris. Most striking to the Western mind are the similarities between the story of Osiris and the central myth of Christianity: Through treachery a wise young savior is mur- dered... nailed to His death; the tree whereon the body is affixed; the mourning devotee who begs the return of His 6 The sacred phallus, which Seth threw in the Nile, and was eaten by three fishes was never recovered."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"7 This date, coincidentally, also marked the beginning of the astrological Age of Aries. body in order to give it proper burial; the resurrection of the God which also provides the formula for the eternal salvation of the world, etc. All very Osirian. But I am getting ahead of myself. To understand where we are, we must first understand where we have been, so let us first examine the conditions that characterized the last two aeons. THE AEON OF ISIS The Formula of the Great Goddess: It is difficult to speculate precisely when the aeon of the formula of Isis began, for its foundations were laid in the nebulousness of prehistory. However, we can, with relative confidence, venture to pin- point its zenith as being approximately 2400 B.C. 7 This was the Age of the Great Goddesss, and nowhere at this time was Her worship more conspicuous than in the Sumerian city of Uruk where the magnificent temple of Innana (Ishtar) dominated civilization's first great city. For us to focus exclusively upon Sumeria, however, would be a grave error for, indeed, the cult of the Great Goddess was truly universal. She was worshipped by countless cultures under myriad names and forms. It would also be a mistake for us to conclude that the magical formula of this period manifested exclusively through the worship of any particu- lar anthropomorphic female deity. For, like every aeon, the magical formula of the Aeon of Isis was founded upon mankind's interpretation of the \"perceived facts\" of nature, and our Isian-age progenitors perceived nature as a contin- uous process of spontaneous growth. In the dim beginnings of the aeon, humans were igno- rant of the cause and effect mysteries of sex and birth. Life appeared to come from woman alone. Blood flowed inex-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"plicably from her body with the same cycle as that of the moon. And when the cycle of bleeding was interrupted, her belly swelled for nine moons until she burst with new life. She then continued to nourish this life with her milk, the white blood of her breasts, and without this nourishment, drawn directly from her body, the new life would die. Nothing could match the power of woman. From her, all life proceeded and without her nourishment, no life could survive. Like the moon itself, she lived a three-fold life cycle of maid, mother, and crone; fertility, sustenance, and wisdom. Once the child was weaned, the Earth itself became sur- rogate mother, directly providing the flesh and blood of ani- mals and plants for sustenance. Mother was life. Earth was Mother. God was Woman. Death was a mystery that could not be solved nor overcome. This fundamental perception of nature persisted long after the mystery of where babies came from had been solved. Matriarchies and cannibalism dominated much of this period, but even after the ascent of the male warrior gods, the essential formula of the Goddess lived on. There exist to this day tribes of hunter-gatherers 8 whose social and religious lives exemplify the formula of Isis, but the Aeon of Isis survived only as long as the spirit of human- ity was dominated by the perception that life and its requisite nourishment came directly from the Earth and from the woman. A clearer perception of the universe would evolve that would usurp the formula of Isis and initiate a new cultural and religious age. We are painfully familiar with this period for it lasted until the turn of the twentieth century. Its for- mula is still the consensus of the so-called \"Great Religions\" and continues to dominate the spiritual lives of the majority of the inhabitants of our planet. 8 Although the systematic destruction of the rainforests is bringing an end to these time capsules of prehistory."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"In this age the focus was shifted from the Earth to the Sun as the source of all Life, and from the mysteries of birth to the mysteries of death. We figured out where babies came from; now we were to ponder where we go when we die. THE AEON OF OSIRIS The Formula of the Dying God: It could be said that the Aeon of Osiris began when men and women first became cognizant of the Sun, and recognized that the fertility of the Earth (and consequently their lives) depended directly upon the vitalizing power of sunlight. The secret of life was now perceived as a partnership of Sun and Earth, and our ances- tors saw this partnership reflected in themselves: man and woman, phallus and kteis, father and mother. When it became universally acknowledged that with- out the Sun, the Earth would perish, and without the semen of a man, a woman would remain barren, the great pendu- lum of racial consciousness and attitude took a radical swing. The formula of Isis was altered: woman brings forth life, but Life comes from the Sun. God was now Father. This new \"illumination\" resulted in unprecedented advances in civilization. Armed with the solar knowledge of the cycles of seasons, Osirian-age farmers began the orga- nized cultivation of crops. Cities arose, and with them the economies and armies of great nation-states. Patriarchies supplanted matriarches as the goddesses of countless cul- tures became \"wives\" to the new male deities. But inherent in this new formula was a terrible mystery; a factor that was not a part of the formula of the innocent Aeon of Isis; a dark reality that would become an all-con- suming (and some say, unhealthy) preoccupation of the Aeon of Osiris: death. It was perceived as-an undeniable fact that the Sun, the source of all life, was born each day on the eastern horizon and traveled across the sky, bestowing His warm blessings of light and life upon all the Earth. It was also observed that"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"this great pangenetor \"died\" each day in the west, plunging the entire world into a cold darkness—a darkness that evoked introspection and fear. Where did the Sun go? Would a new one ever reappear? Each night after the death of the Sun, our early Osirian- age ancestor fell into an uneasy slumber, and in that sleep lived another life—a strange life, peopled with other men and women, and filled with impossible wonders and hor- rors. Animals killed in the hunt, dead relatives, enemies, and comrades, all came alive again in this other world of dream. Was this where the Sun went at night? Was this the Land of the Dead? Of course the fearful night did not last forever and a \"new\" Sun appeared with comforting regularity each morn- ing to conquer the darkness and assure the continuity of life. But later more sophisticated Sun watchers would experience an even greater insecurity crisis when they observed the dwin- dling periods of sunlight (as summer moved toward winter) resulted in the decrease or actual cessation of the fecundity of the Earth. No sunlight, no crops. This was serious. The daily solar cycle showed them that the Sun is capa- ble of totally disappearing from the sky. But unlike the rela- tively short period of darkness of the daily cycle, there was no telling how long a great night would last if the Sun ever experienced a yearly death. Surely all life would end in the frozen darkness of an eternal (or even a lengthy) night. Unfounded as these fears were, they were based solidly upon a perceived reality, and the trauma became indelibly imprinted upon the psyche of the human race. This \"real- ity,\" in turn, formed the foundation of the magical formula of the Aeon of Osiris, the formula of the Dying God. The Sun, the Father of all Life, goes through a three-fold cycle of birth (life), death, and resurrection. Humankind, knowing themselves also subject to death, believed that by following the magical or religious formula of the Sun, they too could be made eligible for resurrection. What was this formula?"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Everywhere our Osirian-age ancestors looked, they saw the drama of the Dying God enacted. The farmer observed the fertilizing effects that blood and decaying flesh had upon the soil; and that seeds (which came from living plants in the summer and autumn) could lie dead and buried throughout the winter months, and then miraculously res- urrect as new plants in the spring. It was an obvious and inescapable truth: without death, there is no life. Did not the Sun suffer death each night and each winter so it might be reborn? Did not the seed offer itself to the Earth so that it might resurrect as a new plant? After ejacu- lation did not the penis sacrifice its potency to fertilize the ovum and perpetuate the race? Life from death was a fact, and to assure that the bless- ings of life would continue to come out of death, our Osirian-age ancestors believed they must take an active part in the great life/death ritual. To this end they took them- selves to mountain tops and high places. They gathered stones and proceeded to build altars and offer up sacrifice to the gods. Obviously the great cultural/religious myth of the Egyptians was literally Osirian in nature, but by the dawn of the astrological Age of Pisces (approximately 260 B.C.), the formula of the Dying God had crystalized itself as the central myth of countless cultures and civilizations. The gods of the great mystery cults—Orpheus, Hercules, Dionysus, Attis, Adonis, and later Christ—all were slain and resurrected. The story of Persephone, the central figure of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which flourished for over two thousand years, is a perfect example of the evolution of the formula of the Great Goddess to that of the Dying God. These cults were wildly popular. To assure one's own resurrection it was necessary to be an initiate and follow the god's formula of catastrophe, love, death, and resurrection. Partially patterned after these mystery schools, orthodox Christianity arose to become the dominant spiritual and polit- ical influence of the world for the last two thousand years."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The formula of sacrifice was born of the mistaken belief that the Sun came up in the morning and went down in the evening. A more accurate perception of the universe is now enjoyed by humanity. We know the Sun does not come up nor does it go down. It does not travel north in the summer nor does it move toward extinction in the south in the winter. The Sun stays \"on\" all the time. The light is continuous. The death of the Sun is merely an optical illusion, a shifting of shadow. So universally accepted is this simple fact of nature that today we seldom give it a second thought. Yet the archetypes that influence the great cultural and religious forces of today were formulated during those eras of profound ignorance and superstition. The stories of the dying Sun and the Dying God were myths created, in part, to help our ancestors over- come their fear of the dark and their fear of death. The per- ception of the universe that initiated the Aeon of Osiris has been forever changed. The formula has been amended. There is no need to fear the dark. There is no need to fear death. THE AEON OF HORUS The Formula of the Crowned and Conquering Child: As the child is the physical and genetic product of both its par- ents, so too the Aeon of Horus reconciles and transcends the formulae of the two previous Ages. Since the turn of the cen- tury, we have seen the fall of colonialism and the destruc- tion of the last vestiges of the overtly patriarchal rule of kings in Europe. The temporal power of the Pope is gone, and the illusion of the omnipotent spiritual power of the Church has become diluted beyond hope of revival. The earth-mother worshipping formula of the Aeon of Isis (violently repressed during the Aeon of Osiris) has been transformed by the evolution of our consciousness, and res- urrected as the earth-respecting environmental movement, the Woman's Movement, and the resurgence of the cult of the Goddess."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"These developments are seen by the established Osirian institutions as blasphemous examples of spiritual anarchy and the unholy degeneration of humanity. They grossly mis- interpret their own scriptures to warn of an inevitable cleansing conflagration that will reestablish an even greater Osirian rule. While a certain amount of conflict probably is inevitable (as it is at the beginning of every age), the result most cer- tainly will not be a return to the formulae of the past. Standing, as we are, upon the threshold of the Aeon of Horus, what we observe happening in the world is rather unsettling. But it is the natural result of the vested interests of the old aeon resisting the establishment of the new. It is very much like the strife families experience when a child grows up and finally leaves home. Eventually the parents accept the inevitable and, in most cases, form a new and supportive relationship with their child. We are the child who has just become self-aware. We still love our mother and father but we know we will never be happy as long as we exist only as an extension of their lives. Now that we are conscious of the continuity of exis- tence, now that we perceive the universe as a process of con- tinual growth, now that we recognize the individual as the basic unit of society, we will never return to the flawed and incomplete perceptions of the past."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE THE BOOK OF THE LAW Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

As it is impossible to understand the rituals of Thelema without a basic familiarity with Liber AL vel Legis, The Book of the Law, it would be unfair to the owners of this handbook if we did not include it in its entirety. The deities and magical formulae revealed in this small volume are the very essence of the Aeon of Horus. Details of how this unique book came into being are outlined in Crowley's The Equinox of the Gods, 1 The Temple of Solomon the King, 2 and in a number of other recent publica- tions which the reader is encouraged to research. To help put things in historical perspective, I offer the following brief review of the events that surrounded the reception of The Book of the Law. In 1903 Crowley had all but suspended all magical workings and had taken his new wife Rose 3 on an extended honeymoon to a score of exotic locations including Ceylon and Egypt. In December they discovered Rose was pregnant. Rather than returning to their cold home in Scotland, they chose to travel back to Cairo where the weather was pleasant. Assuming romantic identities, they checked into their hotel- apartment as Prince Chioa Khan (Beast) and Princess Ouarda (Rose) and settled in. Perhaps out of boredom, Crowley performed the \"Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia,\" purposing to show Rose the sylphs. (It must be remembered that Rose had no training or interest in magick.) She did not see the sylphs, but instead fell into a \"strange state of mind.\" She began repeating as if in a trance, \"They are waiting for you...it is all about the Child....All Osiris.\" 4"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"She then informed her husband that the God Horus was angry with him for ignoring Him. Irritated by what he at first thought was Rose's childish behavior, Crowley began to interrogate her as to the technical attributes of this \"God.\" To his great surprise, Rose, who had absolutely no knowl- edge of Egyptology or Magick, answered even the most tech- nical and esoteric questions with 100 percent accuracy. The next day they visited Cairo's Boulak museum. It was Crowley's intention that Rose point out this God who wanted to talk with him. He sniggered as she ignored and passed by the most common images of Horus, but he was quite surprised when she excitedly identified an obscure wooden funeral stele of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty as the source of her communications. Even more stunning was the museum exhibit number...666. Crowley could not ignore this curious chain of events. He had the stele reproduced and began systematically working with Rose as his magi- cal assistant. (See color insert, pages 47 and 48.) 5 Space forbids us to detail what followed, and the reader is again referred to the previously mentioned texts. Suffice to say, that through Rose's unexpected mediumship, contact was established with a praeter human intelligence calling itself Aiwass, a messenger Hoor-paar-Kraat, 6 who announced the Equinox of Gods (the changing of the age) and the inten- tion of the \"gods\" to use Crowley to receive a book that was to be the fundamental revelation of the new age. On March 20, 1904, Crowley performed the Supreme Invocation of Horus which formally initiated the Aeon of Horus. As per instructions, between noon and one o'clock on April 8,9, and 10, he entered the same temple, sat down at a writing table, and wrote what was dictated to him by 5 The photographs of the front and back of the Stele Revealing, along with Crowley's paraphrase were taken from Volume I, Number VII of The Equinox (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1990) p. 368. 6 Horus in his aspect as the innocent babe; often depicted fearlessly stand- ing upon two crocodiles, holding his finger or thumb to his lips."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"an audible voice.

It is entirely up to each of us to fathom its meaning in relationship to our individual lives. Note: The reader will notice that Liber AL vel Legis is desig- nated as a publication in Class A. Crowley originally cate- gorized works which are \"Official publications of A.\".A. - .\" into four 7 classifications: 1) Class A consists of books that may be changed not so much as the style of a letter: that is, they represent the utter- ance of an adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization. 2) Class B consists of books or essays that are the result of ordinary scholarship, enlightened and earnest. 3) Class C consists of matter that is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anything else. 4) Class D consists of the official rituals and instructions. Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class. 8 The Thelemic rituals which are the subject of this book are Class D. 7 For reasons that are not altogether clear, Crowley, after writing the Syllabus, created a fifth classification, Class E. 8 See \"A Syllabus of the official instructions of A.*.

Whouldst thou force the Spirits of the Evening Breeze to minis- ter to thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the Weak, not the Strong, and in that case the Weak will have power over thee. Liber Librae The first task of the Magician is to master his or her imme- diate environment. \"If thou thyself hast not a sure founda- tion, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature?\" 1 On the mundane plane this means the ability to provide materially for yourself (and your family if that is your situ- ation) in such a manner as to allow you to also pursue your spiritual disciplines. This is no mean task, and I doff my magical cap to anyone who can achieve such a lifestyle. Our immediate environment is the phenomenal uni- verse, the microcosm, the \"little universe,\" of which the ele- mental world forms the foundation. The key to the mastery of this world is the Pentagram. Obviously the \"magical\" elements are not those that appear on the periodic table of elements of modern chem- istry (although they could be called the building blocks of matter). Neither are they fire, water, air, and earth as is com- monly understood (although their fundamental natures are manifested perfectly in their literal counterparts). Perhaps the simplest way for us to understand the ele- ments is to think of them as the sum of all energies, powers, and properties of the universe categorized by characteristics into four general classes: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. For example, if a modern physicist were to use the picturesque language of the ancients to describe the four 1 Aleister Crowley, The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 1 (London: 1909; reprinted York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1992), p. 17."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"fundamental forces of nature, he might say the strong force is Fire, the electromagnetic force is Water, the weak force is Air, and the gravitational force is Earth. Or the chemist might classify nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon in the same order because of the characteristics these elements exhibit. The Qabalist (and consequently the Magician) sees the elements as reflections of the four qabalistic worlds 2 and the four letters of the Tetragrammaton IHVH, (mn>) —Yod, the Father-Fire; Heh, the Mother-Water; Vau, the Son-Air; and Heh (final), the Daughter-Earth. These in turn are rep- resented in the tarot as the four suits: Wands-Fire, Cups- Water, Swords-Air, and Disks-Earth. The reader may be asking at this point why the Pentagram, a five pointed figure, would be the key to the mastery of the four Elements. The answer lies in the dual operation performed by a \"quintessential\" fifth element. This element is simultaneously responsible for 1) binding the other elements together to form the infinite variety of the universe, and 2) keeping them separated enough to main- tain their essential individual characteristics (see figure 1, p. 54). This fifth element is known in Western Hermeticism as Spirit, and the Qabalists represent it by the letter Shin (£>). When inserted in the ineffable name IHVH (Jehovah) it becomes IHShVH (Jeheshua). We will later see how this dual nature of Spirit manifests as two types of Pentagram, active and passive. The perpetual combination and recombination of these elements is the very process of \"creation/ 7 From the very beginning of the Magician's career, he or she must con- sciously take part in this divine juggling 3 act and endeavor to correct any elemental imbalance in his or her life. This is not easy; but without this fundamental balance, we can never 2 Atziluth, the archetypal world of pure Deity; Briah, the creative- archangelic world; Yetzirah, the formative-angelic world; and Assiah, the elemental world of substance. 3 In many tarot decks The Magician card is called The Juggler."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Spirit Figure 1. The Pentagram. hope to successfully conquer what lies beyond the world of the elements. To reconcile the magical formulae of the classic Pentagram rituals with those of the Aeon of Horus, Crowley designed two rituals: Liber XXV, 4 The Star Ruby and Liber V vel Reguli. Both ceremonies are short and simple in con- struction, and can be memorized and performed almost immediately. The beginning student, however, is encouraged to be intimately familiar with the traditional Pentagram ritu- als before exclusively adopting these two ceremonies as his or her own. The reasons should be obvious. 1) Like every Thelemic Ritual we will discuss, the compo- nents of the Star Ruby and Reguli (God names, gestures, words, signs, etc.) conform to the formulae of the new aeon. These, as we have discussed above, evolved from the for- mulae of the previous aeons.

To be prepared to wield the power of the Pentagram in the rituals of the Star Ruby and Reguli, it is absolutely necessary that the Magician have a total and unambiguous mastery and understanding of these twelve diagrams. As you can see, a simple rule of thumb is invoke toward and banish away from the element in question. For practical workings these Pentagrams must not only be memorized but imprinted firmly upon the unconscious mind. It is not an exaggeration to warn that you must be able to draw the appropriate Pentagrams in your sleep—for once you have seriously embarked upon magical practices, you may be called upon to do just that.

When first studying the Pentagram it is helpful to visually create the Wheel of Fortune card in the mind's eye, and simply \"draw\" the appropriate star upon it, rather than trying to memorize all the varieties of Pentagram. In the Star Ruby, Crowley assumes that the Magician has mastered all the Pentagrams so thoroughly that he or she can simply create a Pentagram \"...aright in thy forehead\" and hurl it toward the appropriate quarter. It is only reason- able to conclude that if you aren't truly the master of the Pentagram, the star you hurl forth from your forehead will be anemic and ineffectual. To prepare for such command of the elements it is necessary to memorize and perfect the two fundamental rituals from which the Star Ruby and Reguli are derived; the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, and the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. The magical education these two ceremonies provide is the key to the power of the Thelemic rituals which follow. , THE LESSER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM Crowley had great respect for the simple Pentagram ritual. In a footnote to Palace of the World, 5 he wrote the following: Those who regard this ritual as a mere device to invoke or banish spirits, are unworthy to possess it. Properly understood, it is the Medicine of Metals and the Stone of the Wise. The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram should proceed any magical working or divinatory exercise. It is the magical"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Magick of Thelema / 57 equivalent of cleaning, vacuuming, and dusting the temple before operating. Only one type of Pentagram is used (Banishing Earth), and the ceremony is very brief. It pro- vides, perhaps for the first time, the opportunity for the Magician to create a magical environment. This simple ritual is useful in many other ways as well. It grounds the Magician and establishes a protective circle of operation. If done regularly the Magician will develop his or her powers of visualization and concentration by drawing the Pentagrams and invoking the archangelic guardians. Note: The direction in which the Magician moves in a ritual is very important. The basic rule of thumb is: move with the Sun (clockwise) to invoke, move against the Sun (counter-clockwise) to banish. Clockwise is referred to as deosil, and counter-clockwise is called widdershins. Although the above formula is never abrogated, there are many rituals which appear, at first glance, to ignore the rules. Even the simple Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram instructs the Magician to move deosil around the circle. A little med- itation upon this seeming contradiction will reveal to the stu- dent that the four quarters are properly banished by drawing the Baorrishing Earth Pentagrams, but the circle remains sealed and guarded by the four archangels who are invoked into their places by the deosil movement of the Magician. In more complex rituals, the logic behind the dictated direction of movement will be harder to fathom, but it is very important for each Magician to reason out to his or her sat- isfaction the \"method\" behind the \"madness.\""},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE LESSER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM 6 Spirit Banishing Earth Pentagram 1.

The microcosm (the \"little\" world of Five) is now held at bay outside and beyond. A vacuum is formed within the circle (which has become a column extending infinitely above and below). As Magick and Nature abhor vacuums, this environment is immediately filled by the inrush of the macrocosm (the \"big\" world of Six, represented by the hexagram).

You take one step with the right heel in the hollow of the left foot towards Tiphareth and vibrate the Divine Name as given in the ritual. You then carry round the point of the Wand towards Netzach, then take a step again (always recovering after each for-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ward step so that you remain in the centre) and vibrating the Divine Name as before. Continue the process facing Yesod and vibrating; then Hod, and vibrating; but carry the point of the Wand round to Tiphareth so as to complete the circle. As you vibrate the Divine Name the angels, as given in the ritual, appear, (note well that they should appear and if the ritual is properly per- formed do appear). You are thus standing in a Column which is pro- tected by your microcosmic invocation. The conse- quent result, being macrocosmic response, is that without any effort on your part the hexagram or sixfold star appears both above and below you. (Note the equilibration 5 = 6.) In this way you are completely shut off from the outer and Qliphotic parts of the universe. Get well into your mind the realization of this Column with its surrounding pentagrams and its hexagrams above and below you. Continuous prac- tice is essential if you are to perform this ritual as you should. It is particularly important not to slur any part of it; to visualize clearly and cleanly the forces invoked, with the exception of the Divine Being, who will not appear, in the ordinary course of events, for such slight cause.

Unlike the Lesser Pentagram Ritual which pro- vides a simple cleansing and centering function, this cere- mony taps a far deeper strata of the elemental world and is the key to the opening and closing of what is known as the Elemental Watchtowers of the Universe. The basic formula embodied in the Greater Ritual also provides the funda- mental knowledge necessary for the practice of other branches of the art, including Enochian Magick and Goetia. The version appearing below is the simplest format con- structed from the information outlined in Crowley's Liber O. More elaborate versions utilizing additional material such as Enochian words and the Kerubic symbols of the zodiac can be found in numerous other texts, but we feel the stu- dent would be best served by mastering the essentials first. The first thing one notices about the Greater Pentagram Ritual is its similarity to the Lesser Ritual. It opens with the same Qabalistic Cross and ends with the same invocation of the Archangels. But here the similarity ends. Each quarter is ruled by a different element (East-Air, South-Fire, West-Water, and North Earth 14 ) and each is acti- vated by two Pentagrams. The first is a Spirit Pentagram [an active Pentagram in the quarters of the active elements of Air (East) and Fire 13 With the Greater Pentagram Ritual, it is possible to Invoke or Banish any of the five elements by the correct use of the appropriate pentagrams. 14 These are the traditional microcosmic attributions determined by the terrestrial winds."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"(South); and a passive Pentagram in the quarters of the pas- sive elements of Water (West) and Earth (North)]. By cor- rectly creating this Pentagram, the Magician unlocks the door to the elemental universe and announces to the spiritual inhabitants of each quarter his or her authority to command them. The second is the elemental Pentagram of the quarter (Air in the East, Fire in the South, Water in the West, and Earth in the North). By correctly creating this Pentagram, the Magician exercises that authority to either invoke or ban- ish the elemental spirits of the quarter. After each of these Pentagrams is \"drawn,\" the Magician then symbolically proclaims his or her dominion of the quar- ter by making the proper sign or gesture appropriate to the element in question. TThese gestures (which are described in the text of the ritual) are the characteristic Signs of the Grades of the original Golden Dawn Degree structure (see figure 3 on page 62): (The Grade of the Portal, is particularly attributed to the element of Spirit; it refers to the Sun; the paths of Samech, Resh and Tzaddi are attributed to this Degree.

Therefore it is essential that the signs be made prop- erly and with the full intent of the Magician of transforming his or her body into a living symbol. In the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram, these signs are indicative of the elements, but in more advanced rituals they can represent even greater and more profound concepts. The version which follows is formatted for a general invocation of each element in its appropriate quarter. A com- parable banishing ceremony is accomplished by following the same procedure but utilizing Banishing Pentagrams. Even though a great deal of elemental energy is generated by this ritual, it is done safely because the active and passive nature of the elements and their position in the circle tend to balance each other off quite nicely.

There in that formless abyss was I made a partaker of the Mysteries Averse. Liber LXV As stated earlier, mastery of the Lesser and Greater Rituals of the Pentagram provides the Magician with the key to the microcosmic, elemental universe. Logically one would think the next task would be to gain mastery of the macrocosmic universe represented in nature by the seven planets of the ancients. In Western Hermeticism this \"Greater World\" is symbolically depicted as a hexagram with the Sun in the cen- ter and the six remaining planets—Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Luna—positioned at each point. Mastery of the Hexagram rituals has traditionally been the next step in the Magician's career. 1 The influence of the elemental formula does not end at the borders of the microcosm. Indeed, it continues to be 1 My original plan for the format of this book was to introduce the hexagram rituals at this point for the benefit the novice.

For the Enochian Magician, exploration of the Aethyrs is comparable to the Pathworkings of the Qabalistic Magician. 3 With the exception of the 30th Aethyr, Tex, which has four Governors. infused into all levels of consciousness. The most striking example of this elemental influence upon the macrocosm can be found in the Enochian magical records of Dr. John Dee. In the Enochian view of the universe, each of the thirty Aethyrs, or macrocosmic heavens 2 , is ruled by three Governors. 3 Curiously, the names of these celestial Governors are derived from the four microcosmic elemental tablets of the system, demonstrating a continuing and fun- damental influence of the elemental formulae throughout the macrocosm. Clearly there exists an untapped form of universal Pentagram which operates simultaneously upon both the microcosmic and macrocosmic planes, and that the newly released energies of the new aeon make magical access to these formulae now possible. To activate this vastly higher order of elemental power, Crowley created two rituals: 1) Liber XXV, The Star Ruby, and 2) Liber V, vel Reguli. As Thelemic hybrids of the Lesser and Greater Pentagram Rituals, they function as ceremonial exercises to invoke the energies of the Aeon of Horus. In these two ceremonies the focus of the Magician's con- sciousness is shifted from the Earth to the Sun; from the human to the Divine. No longer do we view ourselves as standing upon the surface of the Earth (with its four quarters ruled by the terrestrial winds), or even at the intersection of Samekh and Pe. We now identify ourselves with the Sun, surrounded by the zodiacal belt. In both rituals the divine names attributed to the four quarters have become overtly Thelemic. The Star Ruby retains the same active/passive positions established in the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram; the active/male deities (Therion"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and Hadit) are positioned in the active quarters (East and South, and the passive/female deities (Babalon and Nuit) are positioned in the passive quarters (West and North). In Liber V vel Reguli the zodiacal landmarks of the four quarters are the fixed or Kerubic signs: Taurus/Earth in the East; Aquarius/Air in the North; Scorpio/Water in the West; and Leo/Fire in the South. 4 Of the triplicity of signs, the Fixed signs are the most characteristically representative of the elements. 5 THELEMIC HOLY WORDS AND DIVINE NAMES Before we proceed to the rituals themselves, let us take just a few moments and examine the various Holy Words and Divine Names unique to the Magick of Thelema. To fathom transcendental concepts, one must possess transcendental illumination. Consequently the Holy Words and Divine Names of the Thelemic pantheon defy adequate literary definition. As the Magician's initiatory career evolves, so too will his or her capacity to understand and exploit the divine principles represented by the words. I do not presume to offer, nor am I capable of establishing, orthodox defini- tions of these terms. I have even been counseled (by those whose opinions I highly respect) that anything I say on the matter will be pitifully inadequate, and will ultimately serve only to limit the reader's understanding. While I whole- heartedly agree this is true, I am also convinced that the reader, if warned that the notes that follow are the flawed, incomplete, and inaccurate thoughts of one who has not yet 4 This clockwise zodiacal arrangement will be explained in the section concerning Liber V vel Reguli. 5 It should be pointed out that the Zodiacal landmarks utilized in the traditional Hexagram rituals are the Cardinal signs; Aries /Fire in the East; Cancer/Water in the North; Libra/Air in the West; and Capricorn/Earth in the South.

It is clear that from an early age Crowley was spiritu- ally and psychologically traumatized as the result of his fam- ily's fanatical embrace of Christian fundamentalism. It was perhaps inevitable that an individual of Crowley's genius would eventually rebel against the stifling restrictions, and the threats of eternal torment with which such cults terrorize their members. His childhood identification with the Beast 666 and his \"Devil be my God\" bravado was his youthful declaration of independence, and for the rest of his life he would continue to enjoy shocking the shockable with such sacrileges. We must point out, however, that there are pro- found magical and qabalistic significances to these \"blas- phemies\" that Crowley so cavalierly embraced in his youth, Ibid."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"9 See Magick Book Four, Liber ABA (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1993). 10 The Great Beast. and these immeasurably overshadow his mischievous pre- occupation with thumbing his nose at Christianity. The use of the names Therion (Greek for Beast) and Babalon (the Scarlet Woman or Great Whore) is not unique in the annals of religious nomenclature. Together they make their first and most notoriously misunderstood appearance in The Book of the Revelation of John, the finale of the New Testament. A superficial review of this book, presents us with what appears at first glance to be two shady, if not downright \"evil,\" characters. But looks can be deceiving, and as is often the case with books of the Bible, the villain of the exoteric story is frequently revealed to be the hero of the esoteric interpretation. There is no need to enter into the argument as to whether \"Beast\" refers to the man Aleister Crowley, or to the \"office\" of the Beast, or to some universal principal. At one time or another before his death, Crowley wrote that they were all of the above. 9 For our purposes we will sim- ply attempt to introduce the concepts by drawing parallels to ideas with which the reader may already be acquainted: Therion/Babalon as Chokmah/Binah —To the student of the Qabalah the easiest way to begin to understand Therion and Babalon is to conceptualize them as personifi- cations of the second and third Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, Chokmah and Binah, respectively. The second Sephirah, Chokmah represents the original concept of duality, and as such is the chaotic despoiler of the perfect unity of the first Sephirah, Kether. Chaos is another title of Chokmah and in certain Thelemic ritual is identified with Therion. Chokmah is also the Divine Will, the Logos, the Word whose vibration is the creative essence of universe. As the supernal Father, Chokmah/Therion is the archetype of the lingam, the universal Male. As TO MEGA THERION 10"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"(his motto as Magus 9°= 2°), Crowley is considered by Thelemites to be the Logos of the Aeon of Horus. The third Sephirah, Binah represents the original recon- ciliation and balance of the Divine Self (Kether) and the reflected Not Self (Chokmah). She is viewed as the all-recep- tive mate of Chokmah and when they are united the primal unity of Kether is realized. As Binah/Babalon resides just above the Abyss, She eventually receives unto Herself the totality of the life of the evolving universe. This universal life is symbolized as the \"blood of the Saints\" which She gathers up into Her great cup (the Holy Graal). This She shares with the Beast, and they unite in drunken ecstasy Thus she is called the Great Whore for in her \"shameless- ness\" she receives all and refuses none. Therion/Babalon as Shiva/Shakti—To the student of the Yoga or Tantric Buddhism, the easiest way to think about Therion and Babalon is to conceptualize them as the two polar streams of creation, Shiva—the Divine Will, the Logos, who manifests in creative union with His divine consort, Shakti—the Divine Power and the underlying and secret force permeating all of creation. Babalon/Shakti is the passive, negative stream of nature. She is magnetic and attracts to Herself, the potentiality of energy. This she absorbs and stores up (the Holy Graal, the Cup of Babalon). When the negative/feminine Shakti comes into proper contact with the positive/masculine Shiva, a dynamic reaction occurs triggering the transcendence of their individual polarity, transforming them into Brahma, the changeless One. This is a most important aspect of Therion and Babalon because it relates to natural energies and forces residing in our own bodies. Slumbering in the form of a coiled serpent at the base of the human spine is the Kundalini, a remnant of the universal Shakti. She has been separated and exiled from Her Lord Shiva (who resides in the human skull) by the very process of creation. The task of the Kundalini Yogi is to awaken this sleeping Goddess and direct her ascent up the spine to even- tual union with Her Lord in the cranium."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"11 The Lord of Silence.

Pan is, however, more than a playful imp. Even in the ancient myths one can seen an underlying profundity to his escapades that hint that Pan may be a deity of a far greater order than His Olympian contemporaries. His name suggests that He is the Great All; the God who transcends the gods. The \"Comedy of Pan\" is the singular reality of life itself. For those of us who have not yet achieved the levels of illumination necessary to perceive this greater reality, life is a dizzying mixture of pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow. Finding one's True Will is the key to embracing, then tran- scending these dualities and becoming an ecstatic and enthu- siastic player in the great Comedy of Pan. 12 IO PAN is the traditional invocation of Pan. I (the lingam) joined with O (the yoni) is a simple yet explicit invitation for the God who transcends duality to couple with the devotee. ANKH-AF-NA KHONSU See Liber AL vel Legis, Chapters I & III.

By adding a F as prefix and suffix of LAO, Crowley considered it to be \"...a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of Self-Initiation in this Aeon of Horus.\" 15 ABRAHADABRA The great Magick Word of the Aeon of Horus. Volumes of commentaries could be written on this word alone, and so I will not project even the pretense of thoroughness in my comments. References to ABRAHADABRA are found throughout Crowley's works but the reader is especially encouraged to study \"An Essay Upon Number\" found in 777. 16 Briefly, its eleven letters (five identical and six diverse) are illustrative of the Great Work accomplished. It joins that which is above to that which is below —the microcosmic world of 5 to the macrocosmic world of 6. It enumerates to 418 the same as the Hebrew letter Cheth spelled in full. The Path of Cheth crosses the Abyss, joining the fifth Sephirah, Geburah, with the third Sephirah, Binah (the abode of Babalon). The tarot card attributed to Cheth is the Charioteer who bears the Holy Graal across the Abyss where it becomes the Cup of Babalon.

THELEMIC PENTAGRAM RITUAL I The Star Ruby There are at least four published versions of The Star Ruby. Most of them vary only slightly from one another. For our purposes we will use the version which appears in BOOK TV, Part Three: Magick in Theory and Practice. 17 We have num- bered each line for reference purposes. It must be noted that the oldest version, which appeared in the 1913 first edition of The Book of Lies, 18 employs Greek Divine Names and other variations that differ considerably from later versions. Crowley revised the ritual in the 1920s to conform with Liber V vel Reguli, and to express his expanded understanding of Thelemic cosmology. We have included the information from this first version in the footnotes of the text and strongly recommend that it be carefully studied. The Star Ruby differs from the traditional Pentagram rit- uals in many other ways besides the Divine Names (i.e., parts of the ceremony are in Greek, the Pentagrams are imagined, not drawn, the Magician moves widdershins around the cir- cle, etc.). Perhaps the most significant innovation is the intro- duction of the invocation of Pan by the application of the N.O.X. formula. This, more than any other part of the ritual, elevates The Star Ruby above a simple banishing ritual by integrating the formula of the Supernal Triad. 19 The reader is encouraged to carefully study the notes which follow the text of the ritual for greater insight on this most important aspect of Thelemic Magick. 17 (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1993). 18 (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1986). 19 Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, the first, second, and third Sephiroth located above the Abyss.

Unthreateningly described as \"an incantation proper to invoke the Energies of the Aeon of Horus, adapted for the daily use of the Magician of whatever grade/' its ambiguities and mysteries nevertheless continue to challenge and intrigue students. Crowley's published comments on Reguli are sparse, so I have been fortunate to have been allowed access to Crowley's notes and several unpublished versions^of the rit- ual which have been helpful in writing this chapter. Crowley introduces Reguli as \"the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast/' which to a great many people, especially those who think they understand the Book of the Revelation of 25 According to the Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster, each individual, prior to any theurgic ritual, must gain consciousness of the \"agathosdaimon,\" a personal guardian spirit or angel who functions as the mediator between the aspirant and the gods. These guides are called \"lunges\" or \"Ferrymen.\" Literally \"wrynecks,\" traditionally the birds of the abyss, lunges, Synoches, and Teletarchae comprise the three celestial Intelligences or Archangels of Chaldean cosmology. 26 Diamonos.

But, as is usually the case with the nomenclature of Thelemic Magick, the expres- sion that evokes fear and loathing in the hearts of the profane, is revealed to the wise to be a profound and spiritually whole- some arcanum. To the Qabalist, the Mark of the Beast (Rev. 13:16) is the New Testament development of the Mark of Cain (Gen. 4:15), which, contrary to popular religious interpretation, is not the brand of a cursed sinner, but instead represents the radi- ant seal of illumination in the forehead of the Initiate. Graphically, the Mark of the Beast is represented in its most simple form as the Sun and Moon 27 united (Q) and, among other things, is the symbol of Babalon and the Beast con- joined, and the Great Work accomplished. Therefore, as... an incantation proper to invoke the Energies of the Aeon of Horus... the Ritual of the Mark of the Beast, if properly executed, serves to rewire the psychic body of the Magician to accommodate these higher spiritual energies. In fact, the overt employment of the various chakras makes Reguli as much a yogic exercise as a ritual of ceremonial Magick. While roughly adhering to the basic format of the Pentagram rituals and The Star Ruby, there are some funda- mental and drastic differences that distinguish Liber V vel Reguli. Some of these are obvious. Others I feel need to be addressed. THE FIRST GESTURE The Qabalistic Cross opening found in the previous rituals affirms the three columns of the Tree of Life: the Middle Pillar (Ateh-Malkuth), the Pillar of Severity (Geburah), and the Pillar of Mercy (Gedulah). In Reguli this as been replaced by 27 See The Book of the Law, I, xvi. Crowley developed a more elaborate version which he used as one of his seals.

This is especially sig- nificant in light of the fact that Crowley maintained that the Aeon of Horus activated the Path of Teth 28 (the horizontal Path between fifth Sephirah, Geburah, and the fourth Sephirah, Chesed) on the Universal Tree of Life. (See figure 4.) THE SECOND GESTURE Like the Lesser and the Greater Rituals of the Pentagram, the Pentagrams in Reguli are drawn in the air. But unlike any of the previous ceremonies, the Pentagrams employed in Reguli are described as \"averse.\" Crowley was a master of the English language and averse is a very curious word for him to use. What is an averse Pentagram? Is it upside down? If so, inverted would be a much more accurate word. Is it upright with the elemental positions reversed? Unfortunately Crowley published no precise definition. In 1978, I asked Israel Regardie what he thought Crowley meant. To my disappointment he told me that he didn't know for certain, but believed Crowley may have sim- ply wished to shock and outrage the members of the Golden 28 Teth, the 19th Path of the Tree of Life—attributed to Leo (the Beast) and to the tarot card Strength. In pre-Thelemic decks the card depicts a woman holding the mouth of a lion. In Crowley's version of the card, which is titled Lust, the woman is Babalon and She sits astride the Beast (Babalon and the Beast conjoined)."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Horizontal Axis  Vertical Axis Figure 5. Averse Pentagrams. Dawn whose fear of the inverted Pentagram bordered on pho- bia. 29 Regardie recommended that I use the traditional upright invoking Pentagrams. Other Crowley experts have been even less helpful on the subject, suggesting everything from reversed upright Pentagrams to upside-down Pentagrams formulated in the mind and hurled forth as in The Star Ruby. The dictionary defines averse as... \"turned away or back- ward.\" In botany it refers to leaves which are horned away from the axis or main stem as opposed to adverse in which the leaves turn toward the axis. By this definition we might con- clude that two Pentagrams, one upright and one inverted, joined horizontally at the axis of their bases, could both be considered averse to each other; we could also conclude (though with less conviction) that two upright Pentagram^ miiroring each other right to left are also averse (see figure 5). Following the qabalistic axiom of polarities (we are neg- ative to the plane above us, and positive to the plane below 29 \"...it is an evil symbol, affirming the empire of matter over that Divine Spirit which should govern it. See that thou doest it not.\" See The Golden Dawn, Vol. IV (River Falls, WI: Hazel Hills, 1969), p. 9."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"us), we might wish to follow this line of reasoning a bit fur- ther. The two Pentagrams with the horizontal axis could be projected upon the Tree of Life as shown in figure 6. Granted this arrangement leaves poor Malkuth dan- gling, (a position not without qabalistic precedence) but everything else fits quite nicely. Using the Path of Teth as the base line, all three horizontal paths so important to Liber V vel Reguli are represented. Also note the two tetrahedrons formed by this arrangement. Another method is to project all four Averse Pentagrams upon the tree as shown in figure 7 on page 98. Here we see that the Path of Teth, is unique among the three horizontal paths. Like a looking-glass, it is the point of reflection; the pivotal axis to all four averse Pentagrams. Once the four are superimposed upon the Tree, we dis- cover that they form a double version of Crowley's Unicursal Hexagram, the Hexagram of the Beast, which is traced in line 20 of the Second Gesture of Reguli (see figure 8 on page 99). o Figure 6.

The student wishing to pursue this line of speculation further can construct Pentagrams based on the Universe card, the five of disks from Crowley's Thoth 30 Tarot deck, the ele- mental format of those used in the Greater Ritual of the Pentagram, or by projecting the Pentagrams upon the Tree of Life, according to the elemental rulership of the Sephiroth. Viewed in relation to other Thelemic rituals, especially The Star Sapphire, there are even subtler and more complex con- siderations to be weighed, including the concept of employ- ing the N.O.X. formula to access an averse (or reversed) Tree of Life. Speculation on this matter could continue indefinitely, and I am not at all sure that wasn't Crowley's intention. Over the last twenty years, as my understanding and apprecia- tion of Thelemic rituals has grown, my opinion on this sub- ject has changed at least a dozen times. Confusion over this point, however, did not prevent me from learning the ritual and working with it on a daily basis.

All conjecture aside, the whole question of the averse Pentagrams seems to finally have been put to rest by a man- uscript bearing Crowley's handwritten notes and drawings, recently found at the George Arents Research Library at Syracuse University. This typescript, whose provenance has been tentatively attributed to 1928, includes the entire text of Liber V vel Reguli, complete with drawings of the various Pentagrams and symbols. It reveals without ambiguity that the averse Pentagram is simply the standard Pentagram turned upside down (see figure 9 on page 100). The elements remain in their same positions, and direc- tions for invoking and banishing are exactly as they would be if you drew a standard, upright Pentagram on a piece of paper, and then simple turned the paper upside down. Now we know for certain what the averse Pentagrams are, but why do we use them? A clue to our answer might be"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Figure 9. Averse Pentagram. found in Reguli's unique positioning of the four fixed signs of the zodiac. Traditionally the zodiac is thought of as a belt on twelve constellations, or signs through which the sun passes (from the earth's point of view) in a counterclockwise yearly journey. We could make a traditional magical circle of the zodiacal belt, by placing Taurus in the East, Leo in the North, Scorpio in the West and Aquarius in the South (see figure 10). As we will see in Reguli, however, this is not the case; Taurus is still in the East, and Scorpio is still in the West, but the positions of Leo and Aquarius are reversed. In other words, for this ritual, the signs of the zodiac are now run- ning clockwise. Has Crowley turned the belt of the zodiac upside down? No. He has turned the Magician upside down. As I have mentioned earlier, in the Thelemic rituals of the Pentagram the Magician no longer thinks of himself or herself as standing upon the surface of the Earth (geocen- tric), but rather, identifies with the Sun (heliocentric). From the Sun's point of view there is no up or down. In order to help liberate the Magician from the old aeon illusion of restricted orientation, Crowley now positions us upside down in the center of the zodiacal belt.

If it were pos- sible for you to actually perform Liber V vel Reguli while standing on your head, then (from your upside-down point of view) the zodiac would run counter-clockwise, and the Pentagrams would be upright. Perhaps, for some, the averse Pentagram will continue to be the frightful symbol of the triumph of matter over spirit (as the aspirants of the Golden Dawn are warned). In Reguli, however, it is not a case of matter triumphing over Spirit, rather, it is a case of Spirit descending into matter. 31 I have incorporated Crowley's notes and drawings from the above mentioned manuscript in the text of Reguli below.

The Word, LAShTAL includes all this. LA —Naught. AL —Two. L is \"Justice\", the Kteis fulfilled by the Phallus, \"Naught and Two\" because the Plus and the Minus have united in \"love under will.\" A is \"the Fool\", Naught in Thought (Parzival), Word (Harpocrates), and Action (Bacchus). He is the boundless air, the wandering Ghost, but with \"possibilities.\" He is the Naught that the Two have made by \"love under will.\" LA thus represents the Ecstasy of Nuit and Hadit con- joined, lost in love, and making themselves Naught thereby. Their child is begotten and conceived, but is in the phase of Naught also, as yet. LA is thus the Universe in that phase, with its potentialities of manifestation.

The indi- cator still points to zero. ShT is equally 31 with LA and AL, but it expresses the secret nature which operates the Magick or the transmutations. ShT is the formula of this particular aeon; another aeon might have another way of saying 31. Sh is Fire as T is Force; conjoined they express Ra-Hoor- Khuit. \"The Angel\" 45 represents the Stele 666, showing the Gods of the Aeon, while \"Strength\" 46 is a picture of Babalon and The Beast, the earthly emissaries of those Gods. ShT is the dynamic equivalent of LA and AL. Sh shows the Word of the Law, being triple, as 93 is thrice 31. T shows the formula of Magick declared in that Word; the Lion, the Serpent, the Sun, Courage and Sexual Love are all indicated by the card. In LA note that Saturn or Satan is exalted in the House of Venus or Astarte, and it is an airy sign. Thus L is Father- Mother, Two and Naught, and the Spirit (Holy Ghost) of their Love is also Naught. Love is AHBH, 13, which is AChD, Unity, 1, Aleph, who is The Fool who is Naught, but none the less an Individual One, who (as such) is not another, yet unconscious of himself until his Oneness expresses itself as a duality. Any impression or idea is unknowable in itself. It can mean nothing until brought into relation with other things. The first step is to distinguish one thought from another; this is the condition of recognizing it. To define it, we must per- ceive its orientation to all our other ideas. The extent of our knowledge of any one thing varies therefore with the num- ber of ideas with which we can compare it. Every new fact not only adds itself to our universe, but increases the value of what we already possess."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"In AL this \"The 7 ' or \"God\" arranges for \"Countenance to behold countenance, by establishing itself as an equilibrium, A the One-Naught conceived as L the Two-Naught.

Here then is Tetra- grammaton once more, but expressed in identical equations in which every term is perfect in itself as a mode of Naught. ShT supplies the last element; making the Word of either five or six letters, according as we regard ShT as one letter or two. Thus the Word affirms the Great Work accomplished: 5° = 6°. ShT is moreover a necessary resolution of the apparent opposition of LA and AL; for one could hardly pass to the other without the catalytic action of a third identical expres- sion whose function should be to transmute them. Such a term must be in itself a mode of Naught, and its nature can- not encroach on the perfections of Not-Being, LA, or of Being, AL. It must be purely Nothing-Matter, so as to create a Matter-in-Motion which is a function of \"Something.\" Thus ShT is Motion in its double phase, an inertia com- posed of two opposite currents, and each current is also thus polarized. Sh is Heaven and Earth, T Male and Female; ShT is Spirit and Matter; one is the Word of Liberty and Love flashing its Light to restore Life to Earth; the other is the act by which Life claims that Love is Light and Liberty. And these are Two-in-One, the divine letter of Silence-in-Speech whose symbol is the Sun in the arms of the Moon.

The Thelemic ritual of the Hexagram is Liber XXXVI, The Star Sapphire which first appeared in the 1913 first edition of The Book of Lies. As we will see later, this ritual is much more than the conventional Ritual of the Hexagram, super-charged with Thelemic com- ponents. In fact there are many who consider it Crowley's greatest contribution to Western Hermeticism. But before examining The Star Sapphire we need a fun- damental understanding of classic rituals of the Hexagram. To this end we will first examine the Lesser Ritual of the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Hexagram and Crowley's comments on the Greater Ritual of the Hexagram as they appear in Liber O, Part IV. 1 For the most part, the rituals are self explanatory, so I have kept my introductory comments brief. The Golden Dawn defined the Hexagram as \"...a pow- erful symbol representing the operation of the Seven Planets under the presidency of the Sephiroth, and of the seven-let- tered Name ARARITA...a divine name...formed of the Hebrew initials of the sentences: One is his beginning. One is his individuality. His permutation is one/' 2 Perhaps the most concise definition of ARARITA can be found in the English translation of the last words of The Star Sapphire: \"Six in One through the names of Seven in One, Ararita.\" 3 Concerning this sevenfold word Crowley wrote in his 1909 privately printed edition of 9eAr ||Lia; The use of this Name and Formula is to equate and identify every idea with its opposite; thus being released from the obsession of thinking any one of them as «true» (and therefore binding); one can withdraw oneself from the whole sphere of the Ruach. 4 The Hexagram itself is illustrative of the union of opposites. In its classic form it combines the red upright triangle of Fire with the blue triangle of Water which has its apex pointing downward.

If we recall the allegory of the Tetragrammaton, Princess/Heh-final, (anesthetized and exiled in the microcosmic world of 5), must be awakened by the kiss of Prince/Vav (her brother-lover-emissary of the macrocosmic world of 6). Their union eventually results in the Princess becoming the Supernal Queen/Heh and the Prince becoming King/Yod.

In the Rituals of the Hexagram, the Magician stands as the Sun surrounded by the belt of the zodiac. The zodiacal landmarks of the quarters are the Cardinal Signs which are oriented on the solar axes of the equinoxes and solstices: Aries-Fire in the East; Capricorn-Earth in the South; Libra-Air in the West; and Cancer-Water in the North. Standing at the intersection, and representing a vertical line running per- pendicular to the two lines of the cross, the Magician sets to work from a position of supreme balance. The rituals begin with the analysis of the Key Word INRF from the 5° = 6° ceremony of the Golden Dawn. Considered by the Adepts of the Aeon of Osiris to be the \"new, improved\" magical formula of the day, the latinized/ Christian formula of resurrection (INRI) is seen to conceal the great formulae of the Egyptians and the Gnostics (IAO). As the Qabalistic Cross section of the Pentagram Ritual affirms the Magician's identitity as a perfect reflection of the Tree of Life, this section of the Hexagram Ritual is the Magician's assertion that he or she is an integral part of the evolving magical formula of the universe. Only the traditional versions of the Hexagram (see fig- ure 12 on p. 118) were used to illustrate Liber O. For zodia- cal and planetary work, as outlined in Crowley's comments on the Greater Hexagram Ritual, one could just as easily employ Unicursal Hexagrams (see figure 12).

This chapter gives the real and perfect Ritual of the Hexagram. It would be improper to comment further upon an official ritual of the A:. A.\\"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"As I believe that a book about Thelemic Rituals would be incomplete without a basic introduction to The Star Sapphire, I feel it necessary to risk the condemnation of those who maintain that any discussion of the ritual in print is improper. Since the mid 1970s, at least a dozen works have been published that have touched upon the subject of this ritual. While many have been well-intentioned efforts, oth- ers have contained what I consider to be gross distortions and dubious interpretations. After reading them, I under- stand the wisdom of Crowley's commentary. Be that as it may, I think it is important that I offer a brief introduction and a few notes. Crowley's autohagiography would have us believe that The Star Sapphire was hastily written as the Thelemic version of the Hexagram Ritual, and that he had no idea of any deeper implications. He relates how he received an unex- pected visit from Theodor Reuss, the head of Ordo Templi Orientis, who accused him of publishing the Order's central secret, a technique of Sexual Magic. When Crowley protested he did no such thing, and that he didn't even know any secret of Sexual Magic, Reuss produced a copy of The Book of Lies and pointed to Chapter 36, The Star Sapphire. Scholars debate the veracity of this story, but there is lit- tle dispute that this ceremony can easily be interpreted as a sex Magick ritual. Be that as it may, I take exception to those who, with knowing winks and nudges, would have us believe that The Star Sapphire, or Liber XV, or a host of other Crowley rituals, are merely elaborate blinds for a variety of exotic sex acts. All Magick is sexual. Indeed, all life is sexual. It is either overt or implied, invoked or directed, stored or released. The Mass of the Roman Catholic Church is every bit as much a pantomime of the sex act as the \"Great Rite\" of the witches. The real question is \"what is sex symbolic of?\" The Star Sapphire is written as if it could be a complex choreographed act of ceremonial lovemaking. After all, the Hexagram is symbolic of the union of opposites. In this ritual,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the real challenge of the Magician lies in the ability to con- centrate, to visualize, receive, direct, and exchange the ener- gies represented by the various \"Holy Hexagrams.\" This work is performed on the magical plane which can be accessed by any number of techniques including (but not limited to) sex. Whenever opposites are transcended and perfect union is realized, a greater \"something\" is achieved. In lovemaking it is the ecstasy of orgasm; in initiation it can be the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. I encourage the student who has mastered the tradi- tional Hexagram rituals, to learn The Star Sapphire. Practice it as a non-sexual exercise, by drawing the Unicursal or tradi- tional Hexagrams (see figures 13 and 14 on pages 120 and 122 for examples). Study and meditate upon the implications of the signs, the words, and most importantly, the meanings of the four \"Holy Hexagrams.\" Your labor will be well repaid."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"In Chapter 69 of The Book of Lies, Crowley gives us the only explicit definition of the Holy Hexagram ever published.

The chapter alludes to Levi's drawing of the Hexagram, and is a criticism of, or improvement upon, it. In the ordi- nary Hexagram, the Hexagram of nature, the red triangle is upward, like fire, and the blue triangle, downward, like water. In the magical Hexagram this is reversed: the descend- ing red triangle is that of Horus, a sign specially revealed by him personally, at the Equinox of the Gods. (It is the flame descending upon the altar, and licking up the burnt offer- ing.) The blue triangle represents the aspiration, since blue is the colour of devotion, and the triangle, kinetically consid- ered, is the symbol of directed force. In the first three paragraphs this formation of the hexa- gram is explained; it is a symbol of the mutual separation of the Holy Guardian Angel and his client. In the interlocking is indicated the completion of the work. Paragraph 4 explains in slightly different language what we have said above, and the scriptural image of tongues is introduced. In paragraph 5 the symbolism of tongues is further developed. Abrahadabra is our primal example of an inter- locked word.

The Concept of the \"H.G.A.\" is ancient, but the term—Holy Guardian Angel— as it is used in Magick is relatively new. In 1888 Golden Dawn Adept S. L. MacGregor-Mathers translated an extraordinary fifteenth-century grimoire called The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage. Purportedly written in 1458 by Abraham the Jew, (an enig- matic character not without historical credentials in Central European court intrigues), this remarkable work proved to be quite unlike any other magical text. While contemporary grimoires sent would-be Magicians on endless scavenger hunts (tracking down bats 7 blood, eye of newt, etc.), in order to summon the power to bewitch the neighbor's cow or repel the evil eye, Abra-Melin introduces a novel idea. In order to receive real magical power, the Magician must first actually become an individual of supe- rior spiritual integrity. To exercise god-like powers, one must be god-like. Pious affirmations, and the parroting of pre- composed magical incantations are useless unless the Magician be truly a holy person. This simple yet profound theory was a radical departure from the primitive techniques of medieval European Magick, and elevated the art to a level comparable to the yogic sciences of the East. The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage pos- tulates that every individual has a Holy Guardian Angel; a spiritual Being unique to each of us. This Being, whose true nature can only be adaquately explained by itself, is more than a projection of our perfected Self. Indeed, until we have united with this being, we do not even posesss the \"equip- ment\" necessary to comprehend its nature. By assuming an attitude not unlike that of a love-sick suitor (who can do nothing but pine for his beloved), we trigger within ourselves an arsenal of inherent emotional responses which can be focused and amplified to such a degree that union with this abstract lover is actually achieved."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"In the language of the Qabalist, we are the Heh Final (5) of the Tetragrammaton, and the Holy Guardian Angel is the Vav (6). The H. G. A. is the Prince who awakens the sleeping Princess. Once this union is realized, both we and our Angel are transformed into a higher spiritual Being who is capa- ble of truly mastering the unbalanced forces of the lower worlds. Only then are we eligible to receive personal spiritual guidance from the only reliable source in the universe... ourselves. The qabalistic environment of the H. G. A. is the sixth Sephirah, Tiphereth. In the A .\\ A /. graded system of initi- ation, it represents the attainment of 5° = 6°, the grade of Adeptus Minor. The Abra-Melin operation is simple yet arduous. A house or a secured rustic environment is required. The Magician must be sufficiently independent, and self-reliant enough to continue the operation without interruption for six consecutive months. Every two months the regimen of prayer, fasting, and devotional activities increases in length and intensity, until near the end of the operation, the Magician is in a state of perpetual, all-consuming hunger for the Angel. Shortly after the Angel's arrival, the Magician is instructed to call forth the \"Four Great Princes of Evil,\" and compel their obedience and extract oaths of allegiance. The next day the same is done with the Eight Sub-Princes and so on until the entire population of the infernal realms have sworn their obedience and allegiance to the new \"H.G.A.ized\" Magician. I am often asked why the first thing the Magician does after six months of pious aspiration for the \"higher\" spiri- tual reality, is to summon the denizens of Hell. The answer is simple. You are not operating in a vacuum. As above, so below. Your Angel has descended to vouchsafe you the grace of union. In order to complete the circuit and assure an unin- terrupted flow of this divine current, you must in turn descend and transmit that same grace to the world beneath"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"you. If you fail to redeem, control, and train the menagerie of your lower nature, those \"demons\" will resurface as soon as the glow of the Angel's presence has faded, and literally \"play Hell\" with you. In corporate terms, the workers will eventually revolt if management does not share with them the benefits of increased profits. Individuals who admit to attempting the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage are rare. It is rarer still to find cred- ible individuals who maintain that they have successfully executed the formal procedure. Israel Regardie once told me that, with the exception of Crowley, he knew of no one who successfully concluded an Abra-Melin operation. Crowley made two attempts before successfully com- pleting it. He purchased Boleskine House on the shore of Loch Ness for the expressed purpose of performing the oper- ation. He was interrupted first in 1900, to go to Mather's aid in Paris during the period of the collapse of the Golden Dawn, then in 1903, to marry his first wife, Rose Kelly. When he finally succeeded, it was under the most unbe- lievably difficult circumstances. In 1906, while walking across China, he mentally performed the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The entire procedure was internalized; the temple, the furniture, the accoutrements—all visualized and projected upon the screen of his mind and held there by intense concentration. The invocations and the prayers were mentally rehearsed day after day. So focused was his con- centration that at one point it took him several moments to realize that he and his pony had both fallen over a small cliff. His success proved to him that the basic formulae and procedures of the Abra-Melin operation were viable. It also became clear that as long as the general program of \"invok- ing often\" and \"enflaming\" oneself in prayer was strictly fol- lowed, the particulars of the ceremony could vary considerably from those laid down in the 1458 text. It was during this period that he developed the techniques that would form the basis of what he would consider \"the most powerful and exalted of all my magical instructions,\" Liber Samekh."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"On the Tree of Life, the Path of Samekh is the second segment of the Middle Pillar and connects the ninth Sephirah, Yesod (the Moon), and the sixth Sephirah, Tiphereth (the Sun). In Hebrew the letter Samekh enumerates to 60 and means a prop or a tent peg or pole. In the traditional tarot, Samekh is the Sagittarius card, Temperance, which shows Michael, the Archangel of Tiphereth, reconciling opposites by pouring Water on a Fire symbol (a lion) and Fire upon a Water symbol (an eagle). Above the Angel is the rainbow, the Biblical symbol of God's covenant with man. This rain- bow represents the Veil of Paroketh which separates Sephiroth 10,9,8, and 7 from the rest of the Tree of Life. The Path of Samekh, like the arrow of Sagittarius, pierces the rain- bow Veil of Paroketh and shoots up the middle pillar to Tiphereth, the abode of the Holy Guardian Angel. The version of Liber Samekh with which we are most familiar was prepared in 1921 for the benefit of Abbey of Thelema 1 resident Frater Progradior (Frank Bennett). Crowley had genuine affection for this courageous Australian who had traveled to Cefalu for spiritual instruction. One afternoon while walking together to the beach, Crowley, in the course of casual conversation, said something to Bennett that instantly unknotted a personal unresolved internal con- flict that had frustrated his spiritual advancement for nearly thirty years. This event triggered a trance-like state of exal- tation which lasted three days. Crowley was so pleased with Bennett's receptivity to the program that he wanted to present him with a master ritual for the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Liber Samekh is that gift. The scaffolding of the ceremony is Charles Wycliffe Goodwin's 1852 translation of a Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian 1 In April 1920, Crowley established a Thelemic monastery (theoretically based upon Rabelais' Abbey of Thelema) just outside of the small Sicilian beach community of Cefalu.

It was informally known in the Golden Dawn as the \"Bornless Ritual.\" To this Crowley added an interpretation of the Barbarous Names \"Entymologically or Qabalistically determined and paraphrased in English.\" So much for the skeleton of the ritual. Its soul is the run- ning commentary and visualization instructions of Points II and III. Here we find detailed directions relevant to the Magician's internalized processes. In no other work is Crowley so explicit as to what should be going on in the mind of the Magician. The ritual is performed entirely on the magical plane in the Magician's \"Body of Light.\" Everything is visualized and Crowley is clear on every point. Also buried in the comments are treasures of magical data found nowhere else in Crowley's writings—funda- mental definitions of terms, concrete explanations of abstract concepts, and other gems that serve to fill many holes in the magical education of even the most knowledgeable student. My only criticism of Liber Samekh deals not with the rit- ual but its original format. I must confess when I first began to study it, I concluded I would never be able to construct a workable ritual from the material. Important comments and directions vital to the understanding of the ceremony are distractingly scattered throughout the two essays (Points II and III) at the end of the ritual itself, and there are other aspects of its organization that make initial study awkward and time consuming. Several years ago I decided to do some- thing about it and organized two versions of Liber Samekh in my magical diary as follows: 1) A Study Version—which includes Point I exactly as the original but underneath each section and each line of the text, I copied the descriptive comments from Point II. This enabled my poor linear brain to actually see what Crowley is talking about."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"2) A Working Version—which serves as a practical script, displaying only the words, directions, and diagrams necessary to actually memorize and begin rehearsing the ceremony. I have taken the liberty of presenting Liber Samekh as I have described above. For those who may object that this is a blas- phemous act of savage editing, I assure them that not one word of Liber Samekh has been removed, and that each com- ment from Point II is placed precisely where it is referenced by Crowley to Point I. The Working Ritual which follows is clearly titled as an edited text and the accompanying comments and diagrams are suggested from Crowley's notes. Before we procede to examine Liber Samekh, I feel it is necessary to say a few words about Crowley's intrepretation of the Barbarous Names which were part of the original Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian Work upon Magic. Theoretically such \"magick words\" are efficacious because they are unintelligible. The rational mind is tran- scended, and the magical plane is accessed as the Magician babbles a string of strange sounding words and phrases. Interpreting the words would seem to defeat this process, and there are many practitioners who feel this was an unnec- essary exercise on Crowley's part. Personally, being familiar with Crowley's analysis of the Names has neither helped nor hindered my appreciation of the ritual. The Names still sound wierd and mysterious and establish a powerful and irrational magical environment. If any harm has been done by Crowley's treatment of the Names, it has not to been to the serious student but to the diletante who, thumbing through the text, sees things like \"Thou Satan-Sun...\" and \"Satan, my Lordl The Lust of the Goatl\" More than one \"cult crime expert\" has quoted this section (out of context) on television talk shows in an attempt to prove Crowley was an evil satanist. For the dear reader who has come with me thus far, I think it is hardly necessary for me to take any more time"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"defending Crowley's honor. A careful study of his work does an infinitely better job than I ever could. Even a beginning student of the Qabalah can easily see how Crowley arrived at the various compound meanings to the Names. He analyzed them by letter as if each where spelled in Hebrew. To each Hebrew letter is attributed a meaning, a number, a tarot trump, and a host of other qabalistic correspondences. A = Aleph = the letter of breath; R = Resh = the Sun card; there- fore AR = \"O breathing, flowing Sun.\" Satan usually pops up when the letter O takes center stage. O = Ayin = the Eye = Capricorn, the Goat = the Devil card. OOO = \"Satan, thou Eye, thou Lustl\" repeated three times. It's as simple as that. As for an initiated interpretation of the word Satan, Crowley gives us the following from Chapter Five of Magick in Theory and Practice. \"O—The exalted \"Devil\" (also the other secret Eye) by the formula of the Initiation of Horus elsewhere described in detail. This \"Devil\" is called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with horror by people who are ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be evil, accuse Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, Set, Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc. The most serious charge against him is only that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient Initiates, dwelling as they did in lands whose blood was the water of the Nile or the Euphrates, connected the South with life-withering heat, and cursed that quarter where the solar darts were deadliest. Even in the legend of Hiram, it is at high noon that he is stricken down and slain. Capricornus is more- over the sign which the Sun enters when he reaches his extreme Southern declination at the Winter Solstice, the season of the death of vegetation, for the folk of the Northern hemi- sphere. This gave them a second cause of cursing the South. A third; the tyranny of hot, dry, poisonous winds; the menace of deserts of oceans dreadful because mysterious and impass- able, these also were connected in their minds with the South."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"But to us, aware of astronomical facts, this antagonism to the South is a silly superstition which the accidents of their local conditions suggested to our animistic ancestors. We see no enmity between Right and Left, Up and Down, and sim- ilar pairs of opposites. These antitheses are real only as a statement of relation; they are the conventions of an arbi- trary device for representing our ideas in a pluralistic sym- bolism based on duality. \"Good\" must be defined in terms of human ideals and instincts. \"East\" has no meaning except with reference to the earth's internal affairs; as an absolute direction in space it changes a degree every four minutes. \"Up\" is the same for no two men, unless one chance to be in the line joining the other with the centre of the earth. \"Hard\" is the private opinion of our muscles. \"True\" is an utterly unintelligible epithet which has proved refractory to the analysis of our ablest philosopher. \"We have therefore no scruple in restoring the \"devil-wor- ship\" of such ideas as those which the laws of sound, and the phenomena of speech and hearing, compel us to con- nect with the group of \"Gods\" whose names are based upon ShT or D, vocalized by the free breath A. For these Names imply the qualities of courage, frankness, energy, pride, power and triumph; they are the words which express the creative and paternal will. \"Thus \"the Devil\" is Capricomus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiest mountains, the Godhead which, if it become man- ifest in man, makes him Aegipan, the All. \"The Sun enters this sign when he turns to renew the year in the North. He is also the vowel O, proper to roar, to boom, and to command, being a forcible breath controlled by the firm circle of the mouth. \"He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, before whom all shadows flee away: also that Secret Eye, which makes an image of its God, the Light, and gives it power to utter oracles, enlightening the mind."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"I hope that the reader will find the following more user friendly versions of Liber Samekh helpful adjuncts to their study of this most important ritual work. \"Thus, he is Man made God, exalted, eager; he has come consciously to his full stature, and so is ready to set out on his journey to redeem the world.

And whenever we strive to evade an experience, what- ever it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We thwart our own tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is to revolt against the law which we have enacted to govern our lives. To resent destiny is thus to abdicate our sovereignty and to invoke death. Indeed, we have decreed the doom of death for every breach of the law of life. And every failure to incorporate any impression starves the par- ticular faculty which stood in need of it.

This dispersion destroys the concentration of the adept, whose mind cannot master such mulitiplicy of majesty; as a rule, he simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall noth- ing of his experience but a vague though vivid impression of complete release and ineffable rapture. Repetition fortifies him to realize the nature of his attainment; and his Angel, the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive to his Holy presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after repeated success, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by the explosion of the Star- spate, but identified with one particular \"Lion-Serpent\", con- tinuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper place in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, which the Adept may then take back to earth with him. This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish the relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Adept is aware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements of that Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies introduced by the accidents of environment, and that his Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys all doubts and delusions, confers all blessings, teaches all truth, and contains all delights. But it is important that the Adept should not rest in mere inexpressible real- ization of his rapture, but rouse himself to make the rela- tion submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms, and thereby enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to fanatical enthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African war-drums.]"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Hear Me: IEOU (Indwelling Sun of Myself) PUR (Thou Fire!

Nor should he omit to keep his Body of Light in close touch with the phenomena of its own plane, so that its privy conscious- ness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting his scat- tered ideas from obsession. But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of detaching these elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that they become (temporarily) independent responsible units, capable of receiving com- munications from headquarters at will, but perfectly able 1) to take care of themselves without troubling their chief, and 2) to report to him at the proper time.

This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral con- sciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that has pre- vented him from perceiving that Soul. The effect of the Ritual has been: a) to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him; b) to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths; c) to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anesthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisection, just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen out the inten- sity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire; d) to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; and e) to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes Him. The method of the Ritual is thus manifold. There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate his course of action. He can decide what must"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"be banished, what purified, what consecrated. He can then concentrate his will upon its one essential element, over- coming its resistance—which is automatic, like a physiolog- ical reflex—by destroying inhibitions through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm. 25 The other half of the work needs no such complex effort; for his Angel is simple and unperplexed, ready at all times to respond to rightly ordered approach. But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid description. One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not retain any memory soever of what has occurred. He may be merely aware of a gap in his conscious life, and judge of its contents by observing that his nature has been subtly transfigured. Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perfection. If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that some part of his mind is prepared to realize the rapture, and to express it to itself in one way or another. This involves the perfection of that part, its freedom from preju- dice and the limitations of rationality so-called. For instance: one could not receive the illumination as to the nature of life which the doctrine of evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuaded that humanity is essen- tially not animal, or convinced that causality is repugnant 25 A high degree of initiation is required. This means that the process of analysis must have been carried out very thoroughly. The Adept must have become aware of his deepest impulses, and understood their true significance. The \"resistance\" here mentioned is automatic; it increases indefinitely against direct pressure. It is useless to try to force oneself in these matters; the uninitiated Aspirant, however eager he may be, is sure to fail. One must know how to deal with each internal idea as it arises. It is impossible to overcome one's inhibitions by conscious effort; their existence justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of the vic- tim in Browning's Instans Tyrannus. A man cannot compel himself to love, however much he may want to, on various rational grounds. But on the other hand, when the true impulse comes, it overwhelms all its critics; they are powerless either to make or break a genius; it can only testify to the fact that it has met its master."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"to reason. The Adept must be ready for the utter destruction of his point of view on any subject, and even that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought. 26 Thus he may find that his Angel consider his \"business\" or his \"love\" to be absurd trifles; also that human ideas of \"time\" are invalid, and human \"laws\" of logic applicable only to the relations between illusions. Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is sensitive to His influence. Such a point will nat- urally be one that is salient in the Adept's character, and also one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pure. 27 Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to receive a visual impression of his Angel in a physi- cal form which is sublimely quintessential of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by majestic melodies such as he never hoped to hear. A philosopher may attain apprehen- sion of tremendous truths, the solution of problems that had baffled him all his life. Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illumina- tions, experienced by simple-minded men, such as a work- man who \"saw God\" and likened Him to \"a quantity of little pears.\" Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging upon unbal- anced minds, inflames the idolized idea, and produces fanat- ical faith fierce even to frenzy, with intolerance and insanely disordered energy which is yet so powerful as to effect the destinies of empires. 26 Of course, even false tenets and modes of the mind are in one sense true. It is only their appearance which alters. Copernicus did not destroy the facts of nature, or change the instruments of observation. He merely effected a radical simplification of science. Error is really a \"fool's knot.\" Moreover, the very tendency responsible for the entanglement is one of the necessary elements of the situation. Nothing is \"wrong\" in the end; and one cannot reach the \"right\" point of view without the aid of one's par- ticular \"wrong\" point. If we reject or alter the negative of a photograph we shall not get a perfect positive. 27 This means, free from ideas, however excellent in themselves, which are foreign to it. For instance, literary interest has no proper place in a picture."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Con- versation of the Holy Guardian Angel are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy. Their intimacy (or rather identity) is independent of all partial forms of expres- sion; at its best it is therefore as inarticulate as Love. The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a cry, some natural physical gesture of ani- mal sympathy with the spiritual spasm. This is to be criti- cized as incomplete self-control. Silence is nobler. In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his Soul is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect. It is evident that the stress of such spiritual possession must tend to overwhelm the soul, especially at first. It actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, just as extreme love produces vertigo. The soul sinks and swoons. Such weakness is fatal alike to its enjoy- ment and its apprehension. \"Be strong! then canst thou bear more rapture!\" sayeth the Book of the Law. 28 The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing him- self to harden his soul. To this end, I, the Beast have made trial and proof of divers devices. Of these the most potent is to set the body to strive with the soul. Let the muscles take grip on themselves as if one were wrestling. Let the jaw and mouth, in particu- lar, be tightened to the utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet strongly. Keep mastery over the mind by muttering forcibly and audibly. But lest such muttering tend to disturb com- munion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Until the Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfect possession of his Beloved. His most important task is thus to open his ears to the voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called. For hearken! this Name, understood rightly and fully, declareth the nature of the Angel in every point, wherefore also that Name is 28 Liber AL vel Legis, II, 61-68, where the details of the proper technique are discussed."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"the formula of the perfection to which the Adept must aspire, and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he must work. He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a word worthy of this particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon, which signifieth \"The Great Work accomplished\"; and Aumgn interpreted in Part HI of Book 4? and the name of THE BEAST, for that His num- ber showeth forth this Union with the Angel, and His Work is no other than to make all men partakers of this Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick. So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel and withstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communion until the con- sciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, and of accurate transmission 30 of the transcendent Truth of the Beloved to the heart that holds him. The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maintain the state of Union for several minutes, even at first. In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather as an encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He should increase his efforts. 29 The essence of this matter is that the word AUM, which expresses the course of Breath (spiritual life) from free utterance through controlled concentration to Silence, is transmuted by the creation of the compound let- ter MFN to replace M: that is, Silence is realised as passing into continuous ecstatic vibration, of the nature of \"Love\" under \"Will\" as shewn by MTN = 40 + 3 + 50 = 93 ArAITH, 0EAHMA, etc., and the whole word has the value of 100, Perfection Perfected, the Unity in completion, and equivalent to KP the conjunction of the essential male and female principles. 30 The \"normal\" intellect is incapable of these functions; a superior fac- ulty must have been developed.

Thou wilt not understand It as when under- standing some common thing.\""},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Let him beware of the Tust of result 7 , of expecting too much, of losing courage if his first success is followed by a series of failures. For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create an inhibition fatal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the fear intrudes upon the concentration and so fulfils its own prophecy. We know how too much pleasure in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace oneself on the next few occasions; indeed, until familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one's lover has never supposed one to be more than human. Confidence returns gradually. Inarticulate ecstasy is replace by a more sober enjoyment of the elements of the fascination. Just so one's first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one continues to gaze, to the appreciation of exquis- ite details of the view. At first they were blurred by the blind- ing rush of general beauty; they emerge one by one as the shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields to intelligent interest. In the same way the Adept almost always begins by tor- rential lyrics panting out mystical extravagances about \"inef- fable love,\" \"unimaginable bliss,\" \"inexpressible infinities of illimitable utterness.\" 31 He usually loses his sense of pro- portion, of humour, of reality, and of sound judgment. His ego is often inflated to bursting point, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so pitifully dangerous to himself and others. He also tends to take his new-found \"truths of illumination\" for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must be as valid and vital for all men as they happen to be for himself. It is wise to keep silence about those things \"unlawful to utter\" which one may have heard \"in the seventh heaven\". This may not apply to the sixth. 31 This corresponds to the emotional and metaphysical fog which is char- acteristic of the emergence of thought from homogeneity.

He must give time a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the impact of the Infinite. As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find his passionate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility which adds power, while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral qualities instead of obscuring and upsetting them. He will by now have become able to converse with his Angel, impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm of sound which he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The \"infinity\" nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only call them \"many.\" The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of the Adept, is perfectly definite and precise. It does not deal in ambiguities and abstractions. It possesses form, and confesses law, in exactly the same way and degree as any other body of truth. It is to the truth of the material and intellectual spheres of man very much what the Mathematics of Philosophy with its \"infinite series\" and \"Cantorian continuity\" is to school-boy arith- metic. Each implies the other, though by that one may explore the essential nature of existence, and by this a pawnbroker's profits. This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole oper- ation, to assimilate himself to his Angel by continual con- scious communion.

Also He made me a Magus, speaking through His Law, the Word of the new Aeon, the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child. 33 Thus he fulfilled my will to bring full freedom to the race of Men.

Liber AL vel Legis, III, xxxviii. Within a religious context, the Magick of Thelema could accu- rately be described as Solar worship. The only thing new and revolutionary about it is the \"worshiper's\" relation to the Sun. It doesn't take very long for the modem student of comparative religion to see the countless similarities and parallels inherent in the world's so-called Great Religions. We might even say (if we allow ourselves the emancipation of a truly open mind), that the religions of the past are really only aspects of one religion whose universal object of worship is the Sun, and whose ceremonies, observances, and holy days are based upon the reoirring yearly passion play that is the solar calendar. Terrestrial life pantomimes the Sun's life-creating qual- ities in the reproductive capabilities of the each organism. Our ancestors drew a direct parallel between the Sun and the phallus, and between sunlight, blood, and semen. This correlation assumes increasingly profound dimensions as we apply our greater understanding of astronomy, physics, and medicine to this great evolving religion."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"1 The Confessions of Aleister Crowley (London: Penguin/Arkana, 1989). The simple \"truth\" of the death of the Sun was des- troyed by the \"truth\" of the heliocentric system, which is destroyed by the \"truth\" that our solar system revolves around a central something which may very well be a black and inscrutable negative dimension. Theoretically all of this originated as a compact, pre-existent, negative singularity (which for some reason could not contain itself), and in all likelihood will someday withdraw everything back into nothingness. Meanwhile we are discovering that everything we were, are, and shall be is encoded upon a chemical \"chip\" called DNA, which impresses itself upon our cells, and flows like an eternal river through the blood of infinite generations whose most important function is to serve as organic \"ark\" for this evolving superlife. All of the Thelemic rituals express the formulae of the new solar consciousness, but two in particular incorporate the Sun itself as the central element of ceremony: Liber Resh and The Mass of the Phoenix. Resh is a simple series of four adorations which are per- formed at dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight. These are for- matted as classic Egyptian adorations, but customized to satisfy Crowley's idea of the new magical formulae. Resh serves as an excellent form of background concentration which requires us to acknowledge our magical relationship with the Sun at least four times in our busy day. The object of this practice is firstly to remind the aspirant at regular intervals of the Great Work; sec- ondly, to bring him into conscious personal rela- tion with the centre of our system; and thirdly, for advanced students, to make actual magical contact with the spiritual energy of the sun and thus to draw actual force from him. 1"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Mass of the Phoenix is a Eucharistic ceremony created to be celebrated at sunset in order to fortify the Magician's awareness of the Sun during its nighttime journey. Like The Star Ruby and The Star Sapphire, it first appeared in print in The Book Of Lies where it was positioned as Chapter 44. 2 Because there appears to be an element of self-mutila- tion in The Mass of the Phoenix, there continues to be considerable misunderstanding about the ritual, and out- rageous statements by extremists on both ends of the mag- ical spectrum have caused many serious students to avoid it altogether. Crowley wrote in chapter 20 of Magick in Theory and Practice, that the Mass of the Phoenix \"...should be performed daily at sunset by every magician.\" Did he really expect us to risk our health by slashing our chests open each evening? I confess that as an overzealous young fool, I celebrated The Mass of the Phoenix by using a surgeon's scalpel in place of the Burin to ../'make the proper sign\" To my amazement the blade painlessly disappeared almost entirely into the flesh of my chest before I realized what was happening. The cut was extremely clean, and for a moment there was no bleeding whatsoever. Then it came...quickly running in a thick stream over the front of my body. Determined to com- plete the ceremony, I tried to \"Staunch the blood\" with the Cake of Light, 3 only to have it disintegrate in my fingers in a flood of warm blood. The sun was half obscured by the hori- zon, and its soft orange light bathed my blood-soaked chest and fingers. I bolted for the bathroom as I nervously par- roted \"...with mirth I now go forth, and with thanksgiving, to do my pleasure on the earth among the legions of the liv- ing.\" I was frightened, agitated, injured, and embarrassed.

Let the blood of my sacrifice wash you clean of any temptation to do such a stupid thing to yourself! It is obvious from the text that the Magician is to actually draw blood in order to consecrate the Cake of Light before consuming it. But nowhere is it indicated that pain, scarring, or injury is a required element of the ceremony. It is a Eucharist, not a ritual of self-mutilation. An excellent way to \"make the proper sign\" 4 is to use a machinist's scribe (a rod of steel tapered to an extremely sharp point). It is easy to sterilize and, if one is careful, it is possible to lightly scratch the symbol on the flesh. This will remain visible for several hours. By applying just a little more pressure to a small area of the scratch, the tool will break the skin just enough for a tiny drop of blood to rise to the surface. This fulfils the literal interpretation of the ritual without harm to the Magician, and allows him or her to concentrate on the real purpose of the ceremony, namely a solar Eucharist. The ideal setting for The Mass of the Phoenix is outdoors, or before a window opened to accommodate a view of the setting Sun. The ritual is so brief that the Magician can begin as the Sun first touches the horizon and have time to \"charge\" the blood on the chest with the last rays of the set- ting Sun. This solar-consecrated Holy Blood is then trapped in the Cake of Light and eaten by the Magician. When the Mass is over, the essence of the Sun is safely sheltered until dawn in the body of the Magician.

In fact, all the rituals we have discussed so far could be considered as preparatory exercises to the High Magick embodied in them. Liber NV and Liber HAD 1 are the instructional papers for the invoca- tions of the highest concepts of Thelemic cosmology, Nuit and Hadit. While these invocations are obviously magical in their execution, they are undeniably mystical in their essence, for they require that the Magician not only do something but be something. Quite simply put, to invoke Nuit, the Magician must be Hadit; and to invoke Hadit, one must be Nuit. This is a pretty tall order, and most likely will not become the all-consuming preoccupation of most of the cur- rent inhabitants of our planet.

In all systems of religion is to be found a system of Initiation, which may be defined as the process by which a man comes to learn that unknown Crown. 3. Though none can communicate either the knowledge or the power to achieve this, which we may call the Great Work, it is yet possible for initiates to guide others. —Liber LXI vel Causae Before I began to organize the material for this handbook of rituals, I looked back over 20 years to when my struggle to study the Magick of Thelema began. It was as if I was thrust into post graduate work without ever finishing grammar school. I was singularly fortunate to make contact with sev- eral of Crowley's personal students who were kind enough to answer my questions and offer encouragement and invalu- able suggestions. I learned that there is a step-by-step approach to the subjects, and I have endeavored to organize the material in this text along the same linear scale. Even though this is by no means a complete compendium of the rituals of Aleister Crowley, I am hopeful that it will be a valu- able tool for both beginning and advanced students. Because of my association with Crowley contemporaries, I am often asked if it is necessary to affiliate with an organi- zation in order to become a Thelemic Magician. This question invariably disappoints me because it reveals that the querent is fundamentally ignorant of what it means to be a Thelemite."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"No! One does not have to join any organization, society, order, club, association, fraternity, collegium, lodge, chapter, temple, coven, tribe, party, league, fellowship, union, guild, team, troop, or pact to be a Thelemite or practice Thelemic Magick. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. The very term, \"Thelemic organization,\" seems to be an oxymoron. A col- lection of militant individualists all endeavoring to do their own will—this sounds like a recipe for chaos; and in many instances it is precisely that. Yet Crowley seemed inspired by the thought of a New Aeon society that could merge the precepts of complete personal liberty with the necessities of self-imposed spiritual disciplines. He experimented along various lines but finally settled on two \"Orders\" which he hoped would flourish in the millennia following his death: the A.\\ A/, and the O.T.O. The A/. A/. 1 was founded in 1907 by Crowley and George Cecil Jones. Based upon the classic Rosicrucian grade sys- tem of the Golden Dawn, the A/. A/, requires the Magician to actually achieve the states of consciousness and powers embodied in each of the ten Sephiroth (i.e., the Magician is only an Adeptus Minor when he or she has actually achieved the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel). The A/. A/, is not a lodge system, and is entirely secret. It is a testing order, not a teaching order. The Aspirant offi- cially knows only one person in the Order, his or her supe- rior. Each Magician is, for the most part, left alone to do the work as he or she sees fit. Ideally, contact with the superior is brief and infrequent, and can be characterized as being sug- gestive rather than instructive. Advancement to the next grade is simply a seal upon attainment. 1 It is commonly believed that A.*. A.*, stands for Argenteum Astrum (Silver Star). I have been informed in no uncertain terms that this is not the case."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The superior is at least one grade ahead of the Aspirant and is theoretically capable of recognizing the initiatory level of his or her student. The superior is answerable to their superior, etc. After a certain level of attainment has been suc- cessfully achieved and recognized, the Aspirant can then take on a student and become part of the chain. While Crowley was alive, it was obvious who was at the top of this chain, and though the practical did not always align with the ideal, one could be reasonably confident in the system. Since his death, matters have become more confusing. The present situation is basically this: Today there remain a number of individuals who had a formal A.\\ A/, relationship with Crowley or one of several of Crowley's students. Some of these individuals have chosen to continue to take on students, who in turn have taken on students, etc., etc. As the nature of these relationships is secret. There is no way, short of affiliation, to gauge the qual- ity of the magical work done. There are also a number of publicly advertised A/. A.'.s (and groups hinting they are the \"doorway\" to the A/. A/.) which one may contact simply by answering their magazine ads. As Crowley stressed the privacy of the system, and par- ticularly prohibited the exchange of any money (on pain of immediate expulsion) in connection with the A:. A/., I tend to view such groups with a level of skepticism. While I have no reason to doubt the sincerity or the com- petence of the individuals in either of the above categories, I must caution the reader against putting too much emphasis upon pedigrees and paperwork. The real work is always accomplished by the Aspirant alone. More often than not the student learns in spite of the teacher's effort to help, not as the result of it. Answers will come as soon as the student is wise enough to formulate the questions. There is no reason to wait for an adept to appear and make the Great Work easier for you.

If there is any validity to the concept of Secret Chiefs, such a display of determined sincerity will most cer- tainly attract their attention and form the required inner plane contact.

The reader is cautioned, however, against casu- ally boasting of one's \"A .\\ A /.\" position or achievements if one is not indeed affiliated with the A/. A/..

In the mid 1940s, Karl Germer, a key administrative officer of the O.T.O., wrote Crowley asking for a definitive statement regarding the difference between the A/. A/, and the O.T.O. The following is Crowley's reply. The difference between the A/. A/, and the O.T.O. is very clear and simple. The A/. A/, is a sempiternal institution, and entirely secret. There is no communication between its members. Theoretically, a member knows only the superior who introduced him, and any person whom he himself has introduced. The Order is run on purely spiritual lines. The object of membership is also entirely simple. The first objective is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The next objective, omitting considerations for the present of the VI = V, and VII = IV degrees, is the crossing of the Abyss, and the attainment of mastership of the Temple. This is described very fully especially in Liber 418. Much less is written about the V = VI degree, i.e., the Knowledge and Conversation, because it is too secret and"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"individual. It is impossible to lay down conditions, or to describe the experiences involved in detail. The O.T.O. has nothing to do with this, except that the BOOK OF THE LAW and the Word of the Aeon are essential prin- ciples of membership. In all other respects, it stands by itself as a body similar to Freemasonry, but involving acceptance of a social and economic system which is intended to put the world on its feet. There is also, of course, the secret of the IX° which is, so to say, the weapon which they may use to further these purposes. 666, September 16,1946 O.T.O. In contrast to the A.\\ A/., the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) operates publicly and semi-publicly in a manner not dis- similar to modem Freemasonry. In fact, its founding father, Karl Kellner was a high-grade German Mason, who pat- terned the basic degree structure of the Order after the Blue Lodge, Royal Arch, Council Prince of Jerusalem, Rose-Croix and Kadosch degrees of continental Freemasonry. Kellner traveled widely and was fascinated with the magical practices of the East and Near East. Reportedly, dur- ing one of his Burtonesque pilgrimages, he met three Adepts who progressively revealed to him a series of powerful mag- ical techniques of a sexual nature. When he digested the full implications of this information, Kellner saw that this \"Secret of Secrets\" was the key which unlocked the mysteries of both Freemasonry and Christian Mysticism. He wasted no time in incorporating this revelation in the higher degrees of his local lodge. In 1902 the existence of the O.T.O. was revealed in Oriflamme, a German Masonic publication, and it was announced that the Order taught the \"secret of sexual magic.\" Crowley was given leadership of the O.T.O. in the English speaking world in 1912 and reworked the Degree"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"4 (New York: Thelema Publications, 1986).

An excellent history of the Order is outlined in The Equinox Vol. III., Number 10 4 and I encourage anyone interested in the O.T.O. to review it. Ordo Templi Orientis is more active today than it ever was during Crowley's lifetime. It has official bodies in 17 countries and provides Degree Initiations, Gnostic Masses, and an assortment of public and semi-public events includ- ing Crowley's Rites of Eleusis. The O.T.O. is without question the most visible Thelemic organization on earth. There is no doubt that the series of dramatic rituals which comprise the O.T.O. Initiatory Degrees can have a last- ing and profound magical effect upon the candidate. It is also true that fellowship with other Thelemites can be a rewarding and satisfying experience. But, as we mentioned above in our comments about the A/. A/., the real work is done by the individual. No one can reveal to you a real secret. No one can project enlightenment upon you. If you expect affiliation with any organization is going to lighten your magical work load, you are mistaken; and if you are wait- ing for a teacher who embodies perfection, or a group in which there are no jerks, you will wait forever. Below is a portion of one of Crowley's letter which first appeared in Magick Without Tears (Hampton, NJ: Thelema, 1954) which briefly outlines the system of the O.T.O. ...What is a Dramatic Ritual? It is a celebration of the Adventure of the God whom it is intended to invoke. (77ze Bacchae of Euripides is a perfect exam- ple of this.)

Nor does their disinterest in the technical aspects of Magick exclude them from embrac- ing the Law of Thelema, or applying the formulae of the New Aeon to their lives.

As Lodge Master of one of the largest local O.T.O. bodies in the world, he is considered one of the finest Thelemic ritualists of the day. A native Califomian, he worked as a studio musician and contract artist for CBS Records in the early 1970s and recorded on the Epic label while studying at the Lee Strassberg Theatrical Institute in Hollywood. His early passion for Yoga and Eastern Mysticism inspired him to study the equiv- alent of spiritual disciplines of the West, and led him inevitably to the writings of Aleister Crowley and the work of the O.T.O. He lives in Newport Beach California with his wife and their son. He is an administrator of a small southern California investment firm."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Magick Magick has been called the \"Yoga of the West,\" and never before has interest in the subject been greater. Today one cannot embark upon even the most superficial study of the subject without encountering the works and personality of Aleister Crowley (1875-1947). His impact upon Western spiritual tradition is incalculable, yet beginning students frequently find it difficult, if not impossible, to grasp the post-graduate level of Crowley's writings. Now Crowley scholar Lon Milo DuQuette shares the insights of over twenty years of research and practice in what can be described as a \"Crowley primer.\" Using simple, straightforward language (uncharacteristic in books of this nature), DuQuette traces the evolution of modern Ceremonial Magick and painlessly discusses the foundations and intricacies of Crowley's thought. He then challenges the reader to put this knowledge into practice by offering initiated com- mentaries upon Crowley's most popular and celebrated rituals. The Magick of Thelema is without question the most unintimi- dating, amusing and user-friendly guide to the works of Aleister Crowley ever written. It is truly A Handbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley and as such is an indispensable addition to every magickal library.
