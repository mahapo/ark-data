I was 18 years oldand my brother Marc was 24. We sat atop one of the monstrous boulders that areheaped like petrified dinosaur droppings across California's Mojave desert andwatched the moon bury itself in the western sands. 180 degrees away, the easternhorizon split in a lewd and blood red invocation of the sun. Shortly before thiscelestial orgy we shared a mystic feast of far too much LSD1 [part0006.html#fn1]and vowed in deadly earnest that we would not return from the wilderness untilwe were holy men. Daybreak found us shish kebabed to death—skewered through bythe sun and moon's perfect opposition—fat on our backs emitting short grunts andgiggles.It would be an understatement to say we were naive, but we were not entirelygreen behind the psychedelic ears. Between the two of us we had at least twodozen carefully programmed “trips” under our belts. In our pitiful way we wereserious seekers. We followed the “set-setting-guide” procedures outlined by Drs.Leary and Albert, and crammed the days and weeks between our sessions withhealthy doses of Eastern Mysticism and spiritual practices.Nothing, however, could have prepared us for judgment day at Joshua Tree. Bymid-afternoon we had blithely paddled our souls up the river of our geneticancestry, stood at the very hub of eternity, and stared with wagging jaws downthe orbiting spokes of all possible possibilities. It was the most deafening ofunspoken truths—we would never leave the desert. Wherever we would go, whateverwe would do from that point forward would take place in the desert. Our frenziedhike back to my old VW bus was a stumbling ordeal of Odyssean scale, completewith horrifying labyrinths of dry washes and box-canyons, a blinding sandstormand the sadistic laughter of the spirits of our own tormented childhoods.The two-hour drive back to Costa Mesa was uneventful except for occasionalhighway encounters with desert skeletons returning home from church in theirpickup trucks. Once home we immediately sought dark refuge in the smoky coolnessof the Buccaneer, the only bar in town that would occasionally ignore the factthat I was a minor and serve me beer. That evening no one dared question my age.I looked a million years old.The beers didn't help. We were still very high. The zebra-striped walls of thelittle saloon dripped down to the floor like melting wax, and the pores of thebartender's nose were so big I could walk inside them.Then, from nowhere, I received a revelation—not a cosmic vision about DNA or thenature of light and time, but a surprisingly “normal” idea. It became very dearto me that I must marry Constance, my Nebraska high school sweetheart. That'sall there was to it. I converted a few dollar bills into coins (an act oftortuous complexity that seemed to require many days) and shuffled to the oldblack pay phone near the pinball machine. I dosed one eye and plugged theemptiness of Zero with my blue-green fingertip and spun the clicking wheel offortune. I pleaded with the operator to help me place the call to Nebraska.Constance answered.After a few moments of attempting to communicate with my hands, I managed toidentify myself. She sounded very happy to hear from me-after all, it was herbirthday. I couldn't believe the cosmic coincidence, but concealed the fact thatI didn't have a clue it was her birthday. Then I came out and said it.“Would you like to get married?” (It was the smartest thing I would ever do.)After a short pause she said, “Yes.” (It was the stupidest thing she had everdone.)We've been married for thirty years. 2 [part0006.html#fn2]And what about the Sons of the Desert? Did we really become holy men?After a violent decade of political radicalism, arrests, alcohol and drug abuse,and two wives, Brother Marc transformed into the very model of an Easternascetic. A Sant Mat devotee, a Satsangi of the Radha Soami order, he practicesthe strict disciplines of that august sect—a combination of Hindu yoga and Seikmysticism. He wears a huge untrimmed beard and travels each year to the Punjabregion of Northern India to labor and meditate at his Master's ashram. Back athome he is a chemical dependence counselor whose clients worship at the altar ofhis wit and wisdom. He is happily married to a beautiful and saintly woman—oneof the most gifted psychics in the world—also a Satsangi.Yes, I'd say Marc is a holy man, and I am very respectful of the spiritualdirection his life has taken. I have no doubts that it is his way. It certainlyrescued him from an early grave and his conversion has made Southern Californiaa less dangerous place to live.My life, on the other hand, took a dramatically different turn—so different infact, that many people, perhaps even my brother, believe my chosen path to bepatently evil.It is true. I have scorned and rejected the faith of my fathers. I invoke andworship strange and terrible gods. I summon devils and hold congress withangels, spirits, and demons; but does it naturally follow that these pursuitsare spiritual transgressions that bar me from the fellowship of holy ones? Inthis little book I search for an answer to that question.I hope the reader will appreciate the fact that I have departed from thetextbook format of some of my earlier works on magick and have nestled a greatdeal of technical information within narratives of my experiences. The firstchapters are filled with much autobiographical material. Please forgive me ifsuch memoirs seem at first irrelevant to the subject of magick. I assure youthey are not. I firmly believe that in order for us both to understand what I doit will first be necessary to understand who I am and where I came from.Magick is an art—as much an art as painting or music or dance. To understand andappreciate the artist's portfolio it is helpful, perhaps even essential, to knowsomething of the character and motivations that drive him or her to produce abody of work. I am a practitioner of the “black art” (or so it has been calledfor the last two thousand years). I am a spiritual craftsman. I fashion mycreations from thought and dream and will. No easel can suffer the subtle burdenof such elements. They must be splashed against the canvas of my own soul. It isno more possible to gaze directly upon these objects d'art than it is to lookupon the essence of my being. The most that can be done is to study the shadowsthey cast upon my memory.For my silhouette studio I have been graciously allowed the tissue-thin pages ofthis book. The reader may wish to start at the beginning of the exhibition orleisurely wander the halls at random. I hope you enjoy your visit and will comeaway with a greater appreciation of your own life as a magical artist.The gallery doors are now open, and the images of light and darkness that hangfrom the walls are the intangible tales of my life with the spirits.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0006.html#ft1] I think it is important for the reader to know that, whilethe methodical use of psychedelic substances played an important and generallypositive role in my early spiritual career, I no longer use nor do I advocatethe use of drugs for magical or recreational purposes.2 [part0006.html#ft2] Perhaps one of the reasons our marriage has been soenduring is the fact that I had the wisdom to wait until our 20th weddinganniversary to confess that I proposed to her on acid."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00003.jpeg]CHAPTER 1I Am Born1 [part0007.html#ft1]Except for the frustration and embarrassment of incontinence, infancy was aperfectly delightful experience. Soon after I learned to walk, it was discoveredthat I was afflicted with Perthes’ disease in my right hip. Perthes’ is aserious bone malady that crumbles the topmost part of the thigh. In order toprevent complete disintegration of my hip socket the doctors ordered me off myfeet and back into the crib. This was fine with me. It meant I could comfortablylounge undisturbed for many hours each day, drifting blissfully in and out ofconsciousness.Unlike able-bodied children who, as soon as they begin to walk and talk, losethe precious memories of their pre-linguistic inner-life, my little brain wasallowed to crystallize and permanently register those thoughts and images. Aslong as I was quiet, my mother was quite satisfied to leave me to mysemi-conscious musings.Among these were visions of myself as an adult man crouching in a dirt trenchwith a half a dozen other men. It was night, but the sky would brighten fromtime to time with brilliant explosions. Oddly enough, this image wasn'tparticularly frightening.The most frequent recurring picture that projected itself upon the screen of mybedroom ceiling was triggered by the smell of night-blooming jasmine that myfather had planted near my nursery window. I saw myself (again as an adult man)stepping into a car (that I would later determine was of the late 1920s or early1930s vintage) and driving south on (what I would later discover was) thePacific Coast Highway 101 from Santa Monica to Ensenada, Mexico.2[part0007.html#ft2] The night was hot and all I could think about was the womanI was to meet there. I was in love. I physically ached to be with my lover. Myinfantile mind couldn't visualize what exactly I was going to do with her, butcertain parts of my newly acquired baby body informed me in no uncertain termsthat there were many things that could indeed be done.3 [part0007.html#ft3]The reader who may be theorizing that these feelings and images were suggestedby things I had seen on television or in the movies must remember that as abed-ridden infant in 1948–1950, I had not been exposed to either medium. I amnot sharing this information with you in order to prove anything aboutreincarnation or genetic memory. (I can't even put up a good argument for thereality of life after birth). I only want you to know that the overridingcharacter of my self-identity was that of an adult trapped in an infant's body.I still possessed the emotions of a child. I couldn't read or write—I couldn'tdo calculus or play the violin. I was as stupid, naive, and crabby as any child.I simply couldn't wait to grow up to feel like myself. This created a level oftension whenever I interacted with family members. I detested being patronizedlike a child and cursed my helpless condition. I vividly remember after oneparticularly agonizing event (probably relating to food or poop) vowing inpassionate babbles, “I hate being a baby! If I ever grow up I'll never getmyself in this position again!”Without a doubt, the most profound of these crib meditations was an exercise Ipracticed daily whereby I pondered the nature of my own existence. Without thebenefit of words to frame the questions, I somehow asked myself “Was I offbefore I was on? If I weren't who I am, who would I be?” I then tried to imaginemyself not “on.” I never succeeded. Each time I imagined myself switched “off,”I instantly found myself switched “on” in another consciousness center—mybrother, my mother, or father. or someone-anyone-else. This frustrated me no endbecause if there was one thing I did know it was that I was “I” and nobody else.Nevertheless, I played this game every day in hopes that I would someday breakout of the helical loop. I finally gave up.It was also in my crib that I was first exposed to religious propaganda. As soonas I was old enough not to eat them, my mother gave me copies of The Upper Room,a tiny booklet published regularly by the Methodist Church.4 [part0007.html#ft4]The cover of each issue displayed a famous painting depicting incidents in thelife of Christ—walking on water—knocking at the door—the crucifixion—reachingfor a lost lamb—the Last Supper, that sort of thing.At first I wanted to like this Jesus character, but I was very disturbed by mymother's insistence that I wouldn't really get to know him until I was dead.Moreover, she told me that he looked down from heaven and saw everything I did.He even knew what I was thinking. She warned me if I didn't believe in him orwas naughty that terrible things would happen to me when I died. Jesus and hisfather would put me in hell, a place she described as a lake of fire whereyou'll have nightmares and never be able to wake up. Every night after tuckingme in she “led” me in prayer—Now I lay me down to sleep.I pray the Lord my soul to keep.If I should die before I wake,I pray the Lord my soul to take.This prayer did not comfort me at all. It was an oath I was forced to takeagainst my will. It terrified me and plunged me into a nightly crisis. My soulwas very real to me. As a person who drifted in and out of objectiveconsciousness all day and night, I knew my soul to be my only real identity.Being a baby was humiliating enough, but the thought of this ghost-god comingdown from the clouds to steal my soul before I could grow old enough to use thetoilet was horrifying. I could not put this dreadful thought out of my mind andsure enough, shortly after my 4th birthday, the “Lord” would come to my bedsidemy soul to take.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0007.html#fn1] My brother tells me that when our parents brought me homefrom the hospital, the nanny who had cared for him picked me up over her head,looked into my drooling face and said, I wonder what he was in his previouslife?” My mother snatched me from her hands, called her a witch and fired her onthe spot.2 [part0007.html#fn2] In 1980 I visited a palatial old gambling casino/hotel inEnsenada built by boxer Jack Dempsey in the early 30s. I instantly recognized itas the destination of this vision.3 [part0007.html#fn3] Naturally, another reward for enduring long hours ofprivacy was the ecstasy of physical self-discovery and experimentation. I mustconfess, I discovered this all-important aspect of life at a very early age andapplied myself diligently. The mental images that evoked this behavior wereclear, explicit, and decidedly adult.4 [part0007.html#fn4]She may as well have given me a loaded gun to play with."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 2My Vision of ChristMy mother was born in 1913 in the barren sand-hills of western Nebraska. Hermother, Clara, whose ancestors fought in the American Revolution, came fromsturdy Pennsylvania Dutch stock. Mom's father, Dewey, was the bastard son of thedaughter of a Scottish rancher named McConnell and a full-blooded CherokeeIndian named William Lake. Great Grandfather Lake, it seems, was quite thecowboy, and made his living as a performer in traveling Wild West shows. Thesespectacles were very popular in the 1880s and offered some of the onlyemployment opportunities for native Americans during that genocidal era. Hisspecialty was Roman riding, which is the act of standing up on two gallopinghorses—one foot on one horse, one foot on the other. Shortly after inseminatingmy great grandmother he was trampled to pieces as a matinee finale.Naturally, the shame of begetting a bastard halfbreed could not be borne by theMcConnell clan, and so little Dewey was given up as soon as he was weaned. Thenew “mother” was an outlaw “uncle” who made ends meet by selling corn whiskey,which he illicitly distilled in a honeycomb of caves south of North Platte. Mygrandfather became the moonshiner's slave boy and grew to manhood tending thefires and servicing the great copper kettles and coils. Out of necessity helearned the art of the blacksmith and eventually, when he was strong enough todefy his master, moved to Hershey and set up shop. Later he would marry ClaraPurbaugh and try his hand at ranching. Before they divorced they had fivechildren: two boys—Glenn and Freeman, and three girls—Gladys, Lucinda, and Avis.Life on the plains was unbelievably harsh, and I mean no disrespect to thememories of those poor devils who, for whatever reasons, chose to stay and breedin that unforgiving wilderness. However, the sad fact remains that by the timemy mother came into the world the sand hills had petrified the souls of herpeople, and stripped them of all but the most primitive aspects of character.What remained was a bitter stock of petty avarice, alcoholism, incest,brutality, and guilt. Suicide was a common remedy for this prairie madness.Gettin’ saved was the other way out.For a few weeks after Aimee Semple McPherson and her International Church of theFour-Square Gospel Crusade came to the cattle town of Paxton, the men stayed onthe wagon and the womenfolk developed attitudes. Lucinda, my teenagemother-to-be, reluctantly declined an offer to join the troop as a choir member.But she loved the colorful energy of revival and wholeheartedly surrendered to achild-like belief in that particular brand of Bible abuse.Fortunately, in our early years, my brother Marc and I were for the most partspared direct contamination from my mother's sad and unwholesome kin. We wereSouthern California kids, like our dad. Our house always had electricity andindoor plumbing. Our father was a Freemason. He drilled oil wells, he'd gone toUCLA, he read books and played golf-but his story will come later.In July of 1952 Dad sacrificed his two-week vacation, loaded up the Buick anddrove us all back to Nebraska to visit Mom's relatives. I had just turned 4, andwas still not permitted to walk. We took historic Route 66 part of the way. Itwas quite an adventure. Dad didn't like to stop the car except for gas or sleep,so when nature called Marc and I were obliged to carefully pee in a glass jar inthe back seat. Mom would then fling the hot piss out the passenger side window,ignoring the fact that much of it blew back through the open back window andinto our faces. I was carsick much of the time, and my poor brother became sofeverishly delirious as we crossed the Arizona desert that he tearfully pleadedwith Dad to stop the car so he could “sit in the shade of a jackrabbit.”The l,500 mile trip took four days. Our destination was a genuine ghost towncalled Wallace. Located about fifty monotonous miles southwest of North Platte(and at least eighty years back in time), Wallace had grown like a melanomaaround the loading platform of the Burlington Northern railroad. During the1920s it was the home of nearly seven hundred hardy souls, and boasted a doctor,a dentist, a drugstore, a barbershop, hardware, sundry and grocery stores, ablacksmith shop, a movie house and a hotel. By 1952 fewer than three hundredcalled Wallace home.The final leg of the trip was fifty miles of dusty gravel road and prairiegrass. Eventually the pointed cap of an ancient water tower pierced the hymen ofthe horizon. “Wallace is a pretty little town;’ my father quipped. “Wasn't it?”Marc and I were not amused. We knew we would have no fun in Wallace.The “business district” was a dirt street about three blocks long—a dusty arcadeof deserted buildings. From any point along this shallow canyon of shells aperson could look to either end of the street and see nothing but prairie. Therewere some signs of life: a saloon on the corner (where we would find UncleFreeman); a barbershop directly across the street—its once colorful pole crackedand bleached in the sun; C. W. Smith's grocery store—smelling of fresh butcheredmeat and rotting melons; and the hotel—its second floor rooms had seen no guestssince before the war, its lobby and first floor coffee shop the only place intown with ceiling fans.On both sides of the main street (it was not named “Main Street”—none of thestreets were named or numbered) was a village of remarkably well-built houseswith enormous yards, ancient trees, and broken sidewalks. Electricity came lateto Wallace and many of the yards still had working windmill pumps and primitivediesel generators. Every backyard had an outhouse and every basement had a coalchute.The most prominent building in town was the old school house—a dark two-storybrick monstrosity that looked more like a 19th-century foundry than a school. Onthe cold gray cornerstone near the great double door was chiseled the year ofits erection, 1917. My mother and her brothers and sisters attended high schoolthere in the 20s. As we drove by I could almost see in the windows the ghosts ofsuicidal farm boys in overalls.“See those doors? When I was 15 they slammed shut behind me so hard that a bigchunk of plaster broke loose from the ceiling and hit me right on my head.” Mompulled back the part in her silver hair to reveal a long pink scar. I didn'twant to look. “They thought I was dead. I don't know how long I was out. Withintwo months my hair turned completely gray.”Things like that happen in Nebraska.That night we drove twenty miles further into nowhere to have dinner at the newhome of one of Mom's cousins. The “new home;’ we would discover, was not yetfinished. As a matter of fact, only the basement had been dug andcinder-blocked. Still, like a family of grotesque prairie dogs, my kinsmencrammed their stove and other furniture into this hole in the sod and covered itall with a tarpaulin.As Dad carried me down the creaking steps 1 was greeted warmly by the patriarchprairie dog who pulled my hair and said, “So this is Ronnie! This boy's toogoddamned big to be carried ‘round like a baby! You leave this ‘un with us. Hedon't look like no cripple. We'll have him on his goddamned feet doin’ chores inno goddamned time.”Dinner was a buffet of fatty ham, fried chicken, home-canned corn and greenbeans. Everything smelled like gasoline. There were at least six sunken mysterypies that reeked of lard, and a huge bowl of lime Jell-0 topped with (of allthings) mayonnaise. Inexplicably they called this quivering monstrosity “salad:’Except for the celery stocks stuffed with browning cream cheese and grapeKool-Aid, I couldn't even look at the food.Sensing my terror at the bill-of-fare my country cousins amused themselves bythrusting various morsels of mystery meat into my mouth when I least expectedit. These simple folk never seemed to tire of the game. I eventually joined inthe fun and started to cry (which I finally realized was the object of thegame). Before the evening was over I became violently ill. Dad was relieved tohave an excuse to leave early and bundled us into the car. As we sped back overthe moonless prairie my mother pushed my head out of the car window so Iwouldn't vomit on her new dress. I stared out into the dear Nebraska sky and sawfor the first time in my young life the glory of the Milky Way. Sick as I was, Iwas transfixed. I had never seen anything like that in California. The creamycloud of stars seemed to go on forever, like the desert, like the prairie.Suddenly the fabric of my newfound heaven was ruptured by a flaming red ballwith a magnificent silver tail. I had never seen a shooting star before. It wasbreathtaking, but it startled me so that I reacted as if it were a personalviolation, a cruel cosmic barb aimed at me. When you're sick everythingirritates you. By the time we reached Aunt Gladys’ house in Wallace I was out ofmy head with fever and had severe diarrhea.“I know how to stop him shit'n.” Aunt Gladys was an enormous woman, crippledsince childhood with a disease that gelatinized her bones, but she was adiarrhea expert. It took both Dad and Uncle Guy to hold me down while thewomenfolk administered the enema of cold water and cornstarch. I screamed myselfunconscious trying to avoid this enlightened remedy. It had been a bad dayWhen I awoke I found myself alone in a large bed in the guestroom. The room wasdark and smelled like bleach, Vicks-Vapo-Rub and tobacco. The house was quiet.Everyone had gone to bed. I drifted in and out of a fever dream that found mepeddling my tricycle down the main street of Wallace. Every building was alivewith legions of cowboy ghosts wandering aimlessly in and out of the stores. Oneof them spoke to me and invited me to go upstairs to “Johnny Skeleton'smouse-house,” and asked me something about “nails for the baseball game.”“Wallace is a ghost town,” another voice announced. I couldn't have agreed more.I closed my eyes and listened to the crickets and the hiss in my brain caused byfever. When I opened them again I was startled to see someone standing at thefoot of my bed—not just someone—it was Jesus—standing in a long white robe, hisarms slightly outstretch to his side, the bloody palms of his hands turnedtoward me.I had never been so afraid in all my life. I pulled the covers over my head andmentally chanted (for I knew he could read my mind) “Please go away. I'm notdead! I just had diarrhea. Go away, please! I'm better now. Go away!”I tried to calm myself down. ‘'I'm having a bad dream;’ I told myself, “but I'mawake now. Jesus is not at the foot of the bed.”Slowly I pulled back the covers from over one eye. Still there! Jesus was stillthere! I dove, this time more deeply, beneath the covers. I was burning withfever. Hell is a lake of fire where you have nightmares and can never wake up. Iwanted more than anything to be home in my own bed, in my own cool house inCalifornia. Jesus wouldn't dare come to California to get me. He needed enemasand ghosts and outhouses and long pink scars and fatty meat and Jell-O withmayonnaise to be God.I don't know how many times I plunged under the suffocating covers. Each time Iresurfaced Jesus was still there waiting patiently for my soul to take. My fearturned into panic and then into hate. I hated Jesus. I hated my relatives andall grownups who believed in this monster and made him real. If I were grown up,if I were strong, I could make him go away, but I'm a weak little kid. It wasn'tfair. What kind of God terrorizes little kids when they're sick? Why did I everinvite him to take my soul?Finally, exhaustion and lack of oxygen prevailed, and I drifted intounconsciousness with my head buried under the sweat-soaked pillows. I would notawaken until the cheeping of sparrows told me the sun was up. The morning lightgave me courage to confront my terror. I threw the pillows and covers off myface and sat straight up.Jesus was gone. In his place, my mother's yellow dress hung neatly from thecloset door."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 3I DieAs every holy man will tell you, in order to be spiritually born again it isfirst necessary to spiritually die. I have died more times than I care toremember—but never of natural causes. Anybody can die of natural causes. Whenyou die by natural causes you stay dead. In order to be born again you must dieby your own hand or be murdered.The first time I recall being murdered was on the morning of my 5th birthday,July 11, 1953. My assassins conspired in whispers the kitchen. I heard my mothertell my brother, “He's 5 now. Christmas is five months away. It's best to do itnow, not close to Christmas. You tell him. You can do it nicely. He'll be okaywhen all those kids come for his birthday party.”Marc was a dear soul. He was tall for 11 and had the habit of chewing on hisshirt collar when he was nervous (which was nearly all the time). He came intothe den where I had been eavesdropping. We sat down on Dad's big chair. He stuckhis collar in his mouth.“You know Santa Claus?”“Yeah.”“Santa Claus isn't real, he's…”“Yes he is!” I cut him off before he said anything else. I pushed my tiny palmsagainst his lips trying to shove the words back in his mouth. “I sat on his lap.Mom's got a picture. He gave me my paint box at your school show. He knew myname.”“Those are guys in Santa Claus costumes.”“Shut up! He's real!” I started to cry. “You're saying this to be mean to me onmy birthday.”“No I'm not.”“He comes. He eats the cookies. He drinks the milk. He leaves all those thingsfor us.”“Mom and Dad wait ‘til we're asleep. Then they get up and eat the cookies. Theydrink the milk, and they buy all that stuff for us themselves—other people buyus stuff too, and say it's from Santa. He's just a pretend guy and big kids allknow he's not real. You don't want the big kids to make fun of you, do you?”I was beginning to realize he was telling me the truth. I could easily imaginesuch a black secret bubbling in the heart of an evil “big kid.”“He is too real!” By now I was lying to myself. I kept crying just to hearmyself cry. They were my last little kid tears. I knew when I stopped I would bea big kid and there would be no more magic in the world.“It's okay, we'll always get stuff on Christmas morning.” Marc was as sweet abrother as anyone could ask for.“There's no Easter Bunny either, is there?”“Nope.”“And when I put my teeth under the pillow…”“Mom takes your tooth while you're asleep and puts a nickel there.”I didn't have to ask the next question and he didn't have to tell me. We justsat quietly in Dad's big chair until I stopped crying.Jesus isn't real either, I thought. He's just a yellow dress."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 4I Descend Into HellMy father was born on November 11th, 1911, in a house at 1111 11th Street in LosAngeles. The midwife who attended his birth was so impressed by the array ofelevens that, even though the time of birth was afternoon, she logged the timeof birth as 11:11 A.M. She hoped it would bring the child luck. It did not. Hehad one sister and three half-sisters, all older than he.Dad's father, Joseph Oliver DuQuette, was a brooding and eccentric Frenchman whocame to America in 1899. He was a barber by trade and a self-taught scholar bypassion. He spoke seven languages fluently. He once told my father he neverdreamed in the same language two nights in a row. This gift of tongues was avaluable asset for one who scraped the chins of the huddled immigrant masses.The sign in the window of his Long Beach emporium proudly announced (in theirrespective vernaculars) “French, Italian, German, Greek, Portuguese, Spanish,and English spoken here.” He was an insatiable reader, and by 1928 could boastthat he had read every book in the great Long Beach Central Library.Joseph's tendency to overachieve may have been an attempt to compensate for asingular physical shortcoming. Childhood malnutrition and pre-adolescentdrinking and smoking ensured that he would never grow taller than four feet sixinches. Before his death in 1938 he was prone to severe bouts of depression,sometimes locking himself in his room for days with only a chamber pot, books,and wine.Shortly after Joseph arrived in New York from France, he met and married JessieHarland, an Englishwoman and the widowed mother of three girls. Her husband, soshe told Joseph, had fallen ill during the crossing and died before reaching NewYork. Ironically, he was not the only man in her life to be taken by the cruelAtlantic. Her father, a Scotland Yard inspector, died in a similar mannerreturning from Canada where he had been helping with the security arrangementsfor Queen Victoria's visit. What started as a sniffle and cough in Ottawa on thesecond day out quickly turned to pneumonia. He was dead before the ship docked.Joseph, Jessie, and the three girls (Beatrice, Marge, and little Jessie), movedto Los Angeles in 1904. They would have two children together, Vina and myfather, Clifford. All his sisters called him “Bud.”Although Joseph ridiculed the church, he enrolled the children in Catholicschool. Little Bud grew to be quite an athlete. Gymnastics and track and fieldwere his great passion. He competed in a handful of regional and national eventsand finished with respectable times. He briefly dreamed of Olympic competitionbut would soon awaken to the realities of his family's poverty. After highschool he found work as a roughneck in the Signal Hill oil fields and marriedevery woman he slept with.Throat cancer claimed Grandpa Joseph in 1938 while my father was wildcatting foroil in Kansas and Nebraska. The family made no attempt to contact him with thenews, and he didn't bother to write them to announce that he married again. Thistime the bride was a waitress from Ogalala, NE by the name of Lucinda MyrtleMcConnell. Dad didn't find oil in the sand hills, and in 1940, he and Lucindareturned to California. His mother died just a few months after meeting her newdaughter-in-law. She was interred at Sunnyside Mausoleum in Long Beach. Dad'ssisters would never tell him where his father was buried.All the characters of this American drama were dead by the time I was bornexcept my father and aunts Vina and Beatrice. The sisters never visited us, eventhough they lived only a few miles away. They despised my mother and wallowed ina hateful feud spawned at the foot of their mother's deathbed—something aboutthe final disposition of furniture or silverware or some other pitiful scraps ofthe poor woman's possessions.In 1955, after twenty-five years of toiling in-the oil-soaked dust of theHuntington Beach oil fields, Dad announced that he wanted to quit his job andstart his own water well drilling business. An eight-year drought in the midwestwas making millionaires of the few savvy drillers who were turning the greatplains green with shallow ground water. To my utter disbelief and terror, hetold us we would be moving to Nebraska. I would have been happier had heannounced he was going to kill me.Sensing our panic, Dad assured Marc and me we would not be living in Wallace oranywhere near Mom's relatives. As a matter of fact, we would be making our homein Columbus—in Eastern Nebraska over two hundred miles from Wallace, in the richgreen pastureland between the Platte and Loop rivers. The Pawnee Indians calledthis land the “happy hunting grounds.” Not only would there be lots of treesthere, but in the wintertime we could play in the snow! (Mom told me it tastedlike whipped cream.) We would be living in a real town with paved streets,indoor toilets and supermarkets with electric-eye doors. It wouldn't be anythinglike Wallace.I still had my doubts. I loved Southern California. My hip was getting betterand I was allowed to walk with crutches. If all continued to go well I would beon my feet in a year or two. I was just starting to live. We visited the beachoften and the radio was filled with hip new music that could only be heard inCalifornia called “no-named-jive.” I loved it. I just knew there wasn't anycorner of Nebraska where they had ever heard of Johnny Otis or the Three Tons ofJoy.It was December by the time we sold the house. Because the new owners wanted totake occupancy a few weeks before we were ready to leave, we spent our lastCalifornia Christmas in an ancient motel in Belmont Shores. On the eve of ourdeparture Dad made a horrifying announcement. Our new house in Columbus wouldnot be ready for us to occupy until March. We would have to go first to Wallaceand live with Aunt Gladys until spring. Marc and I would have to attend schoolfor at least three months in that prehistoric building that attacked my motherand turned her hair gray. Our Christmas gifts were snowboots, parkas, andgloves.The winter in Wallace was very difficult. I was immediately enlightenedregarding the taste of snow. My schoolmates were as course and cruel as theirenvironment and they tormented me over my crutches and everything I said, did,or wore, that was un-Nebraskan. (I couldn't understand why they called lunch“dinner” and they called dinner “supper”) The worst frustration resulted fromthe huge disparity between the California and Nebraska school systems. Nebraskawas far more advanced than California in the lower grades, and I immediatelyfound myself at least two years behind in math and English. I was completelylost and did not have a clue how to catch up. I never did.Every school day became simply an exercise in survival. Mom wouldn't let mevoice my complaints in the presence of her relatives, who were kind enough toput us up that miserable winter. It wouldn't have done any good anyway. Icheered myself with the thought that spring would come and we would move to areal town with paved streets, indoor toilets and supermarkets with electric-eyedoors.images [../images/00005.jpeg]“Welcome the First Day of Spring.” The words were written in colorful pastelcolors across the top of the blackboard. The board itself was covered with anincredibly beautiful chalk mural—scores of flowers, bunnies, squirrels, bees,and baby birds in a nest, all dominated by a huge yellow sun. I had never seenanything like it. Miss Shoemaker was a great artist. I was in love with her. Shemust have stayed up all night to draw it.This was the day I dreamed of those dreadful months in Wallace. Columbus wasn'tCalifornia, but it was at least fifty years ahead of Wallace. The weather on thefirst day of spring did not match Miss Shoemaker's colorful drawing. It was fourdegrees below zero and the third day of a blinding blizzard. The streets wereimpassable so I trudged my way through the drifts to school. I was in the secondgrade and totally lost in all my subjects except one—music. I learned I couldsing. Nobody was more surprised than I. For the ten years I remained inNebraska, my musical abilities and my service in the Methodist church would bethe only skills I would need to survive."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 5Altar Boy“Lonnie! Do you believe in Jesus?” Rev. Alan Castner squeezed the new blackBible in both hands like it was an overstuffed sandwich. That Bible was mine. Iearned it. I squirmed through two tedious years of Sunday School and survivedthe most obscene and evil form of legalized child abuse ever devised—VacationBible School. I passed their examinations. I got up before dawn every Sunday tosing in the children's choir at early service. On Saturday mornings while myfriends were playing army or watching Sky King on TV, I sat alone in the mustyand haunted hundred-year-old chapel and mindlessly folded the next day'sbulletins and responsive readings.Did I believe in Jesus? Didn't I dress up like a cherub each Sunday and marchdown the aisle bearing the sacred flame? Didn't I start each 11:00 A.M. serviceby enkindling the massive candles upon the altar that signified the livingpresence of God? And who was it that ended each service by solemnlyextinguishing the candles with the long brass snuffer? Me, that's who!Did I believe in Jesus? Did I believe in Jesus?Hell no! I didn't believe in Jesus! But I earned that goddamned Bible! Now,standing before the altar of God, in front of my parents and the entirecongregation, I was going to have to lie to get it.“Yes sir.”I was 9 years old and at last a full-fledged Christian.Rev. Alan looked like he was going to cry. He handed me my prize and put hishand on my shoulder and turned me toward the congregation.“How old are you Lonnie?”“9.”“Do you say your prayers at night?”“Yes sir.” This was not a lie for I prayed fervently every night, but not toJesus, not to God. Each night as I stared out my window into the beautifulNebraska sky I tearfully prayed to space aliens or any superior intelligence inthe universe who could hear my plea. “Get me out of Nebraska! Take me back toCalifornia. Take me anywhere. You can perform medical experiments on me—l don'tcare! Just get me out of here!”“Friends, this is our candle lighter, Lonnie DuQuette. You may not recognize himwithout his little white gown”—laughter—“and his torch and snuffer”—morelaughter. Lonnie also sings in the Carol Choir and comes in on Saturdays to foldour bulletins. We're all sure he's going to grow to be a man of God.” He thengently pushed me back toward my pew with a hearty “God bless you Lonnie.”What the dear man didn't know was that, even though I was the virginal innocentwho started and ended each service, I seldom stayed to hear his sermons. EachSunday after lighting the candles at the 11:00 o'clock service, I rushed back tothe vestry, stripped out of my chasuble and slipped out the side door. With myTimex strapped tightly to my impious wrist I ran at top speed across the street,past the ancient bandstand and towering elms in Frankfort Square, straight tothe soda fountain of Tooley's drug store. There, after catching my breath, Ilingered over my own Eucharist—a tuna salad sandwich (with an unforgettablehome-canned bread-n-butter pickle) and a cherry phosphate. I knew what heavenwas. After my sandwich I had just enough time to browse a comic book or twobefore rushing back to church to close the service.I paid for this weekly orgy with the winnings from a weekly crap game Iorganized before Sunday school in the church basement. My father had been kindenough to teach me the rules to this venerable game and I easily attracted apool of easy marks—their pockets bulging with cash that would otherwise bedestined for the offering plate. Predictably, the game was finally raided and my“bones” confiscated by George Sorensen, a racist construction mogul andspiritual exhibitionist who had bullied his way into the position of SundaySchool Headmaster.Each week before the individual classes adjourned to their respective cells, he“taught” the general assembly of all the grades in the large common room. Herewe drank deeply from the fountain of his bigoted wisdom, learning why people wholived before Jesus (including Adam, Eve, Abraham, and Socrates) were burning inHell, and why Blacks had to work for white people because Noah's grandson sawhim naked.On the morning of my arrest he strutted to the front of the assembly and held upmy precious green dice in front of all the students and bellowed, “These evildice was brung into God's house by one of your own classmates to steal God'smoney. I bet he thinks it's real funny. I tell ya one thing, God don't thinkit's funny. I ain't gonna tell you who done this. He knows who he is, and Godknows who he is”Then with a dramatic sweep of his hand he hurled the dice into the trashcan andadded dramatically, “All I can say is—I'll pray for him.”As much as I despisedGeorge-if-their-religion-won't-let-'em-eat-cows-why-don't-them-godless-Hindus-start-eatin-all-them-monkeys-they-got-jumpin-around-India-Sorensen,I loved Reverend Alan. I admired his youthful enthusiasm and positive attitude.He had a beautiful young wife and I fantasized what life must be like in therectory. He preached no hell-fire and made it seem like it should be fun to be aMethodist whether you believed in God or not. I was so comfortable with hisbrand of religion that (even though I was a secret unbeliever) I told my parentsI wanted to be a Methodist minister when I grew up. Even my freethinking fatherattended service each week to show his support for this dynamic man who was sentby the bishop to build our new church.He built the new church all right. Predictably, the building contractor wasGeorge-if-they-ain't-been-baptized-then-they're-burnin-in-Hell-even-if-they-are-just-little-babies-Sorensen.Unfortunately, before erection of the new church was completed his 12-year-olddaughter walked in on him playing Adam & Eve with Reverend Alan's wife in thenew church annex. The scandal shocked the town and forced the Castners to moveaway.1 [part0011.html#ft1]My father stopped going to church. I continued to serve under the next pastorand the next one and the next. After a short vacation George Sorensen resumedhis job as Sunday School Headmaster.All I can say is—I'll pray for him.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0011.html#fn1] In a midnight raid, my brother, Marc, and two of his highschool fiends salted the lawn of the pious church board member who was mostinstrumental in forcing the Castners to leave town. A summer rain later thatnight assured the soil was ruined to a depth of six feet. A few days later werode our bicycles past what looked like a swimming pool being dug in his frontyard."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 6Holy CommunionWhen I was 11, I graduated to the adult chorus, first as a soprano then later assecond tenor. I continued to sing in the church choir until I graduated fromhigh school and moved back to California. I hated it, but I had no choice.At age 7, I made a Faustian pact with Robert M. Carlton, the brilliant andtyrannical director of the vocal music department of the high school and theundisputed Kapellmeister of the entire school district. His ensembles andone-hundred-ten voice Master Chorale consistently won state and regional awardsand the honors he brought to our provincial town year after year made him asfeared and respected among the faculty and alumni as any winning football coach.He also directed the Methodist Church adult choir.I sang in school and church choruses under his direction from the second gradeuntil after high school graduation. He was not a likable man. He yelled. He wascruel and utterly insensitive to the feelings of others. He made children cry.He suffered migraines, and the blade of his wit was always wet with the blood ofhis inferiors, and everybody was his inferior. I have no idea why he singled mefor out special treatment from among the other reluctant warblers, but single meout he did. From sixth grade through my senior year he gave me the choicestslots in recitals and the leads in the seasonal shows and musicals.He never told me I had to sing in the church choir. He didn't have to. Afterall, for my entire high school career he personally bullied and threatened allmy other teachers to assure that I maintained a C-plus average in all myclasses. If my grades were to drop below C-plus I would not be allowed toparticipate in the various performances throughout the year. He made sure thatnever happened and I was shamelessly impudent in my security.1[part0012.html#ft1] I was the classic class clown. I never took a book home,seldom passed a test and even though I was punished by a detention period everyday without exception for three consecutive years (a school record), Imaintained a C-plus average.Shortly after I turned 14 my musical career expanded when I was asked to join alocal garage band. I played guitar like most boys my age, but what drew me tothe attention of my much older colleagues was the fact that I hosted anafter-school radio program on the local AM station and might be able to providefree advertising for the band. It was also nice that I knew the words to nearlyevery popular song recorded since 1952.To everyone's surprise our little band worked regularly, playing proms andsockhops in small towns throughout Nebraska and all neighboring states. Oursuccess was largely due to the efforts of our 25-year-old bass player. I made apoint of jotting down the names and phone numbers of everyone who ever booked usand a year later I formed my own band, “The Panics.” We were pretty good andstayed together until I completed high school.In the spring of 1966 the years of my indentured service to Mr. Carlton weredrawing to an end. Thanks to his powers of coercion I knew I would graduate fromhigh school (college prep no less). With the help of my brother (who hadreturned to California the moment he finished high school six years earlier) Imade arrangements to move to Costa Mesa to attend college. Almost out ofnostalgia I showed up at the church for the last few choir rehearsals and Sundayperformances. The last Methodist ceremony I would ever attend was a mostmemorable communion service.Eschewing pagan ritual and not wishing to be confused with the Satanic Church ofRome, Methodists, like most Protestants, take communion infrequently. What isfor Catholics the central and most intensely personal act of worship is toProtestants an embarrassing reminder that once upon a time in order to be aChristian it was necessary to regularly put one's faith where one's mouth wasand then swallow it.Methodists take pride in the fact they don't believe a priest is necessary toritualistically bless and consecrate the sacred elements. They don't believethat words (Latin or otherwise) can conjure the Holy Spirit into the blessedcup. They don't believe that common bread and wine can be magicallytransubstantiated into the flesh and blood of God. As a matter of fact, wherethe sacrament of communion is concerned, Protestants just don't believe.Nonetheless, like island natives who in obedience to some primitive instinctstill fling an occasional virgin into a volcano, they set aside a handful ofSundays a year to pass around plates piled high with tiny cubes of Wonderbreadand microscopic glasses of grape juice, and eat and drink when ordered to do so.On that last Sunday the subject of the sermon was “The Lonely Atheist:’ As Islouched half-awake in the choir loft—my hormones roaring uncontrollably to thesweet memory of Saturday night's backseat embraces—something else (almost asprofound) was rising beneath my purple choir robe. Realization. Suddenly Irealized that I was at peace with my atheism. Ever since the Santa Clausrevelation I had been cynically convinced of the non-existence of the God of theBible, but the severity of my earlier programming and my subsequent life in thechurch coated me with a waxy film of residual doubts. That bright morning,without any known catalyst or undue introspection, all doubts simply evaporated.Suddenly I became deliriously comfortable wit the simple fact that all of it,even atheism, is bullshit. I almost laughed out loud.I realize this doesn't sound like much of a revelation, but at that moment ittickled me ecstatically. I never felt so liberated in my life. I looked up atthe enormous circular stained glass window behind the altar and could almosthear the “Hallelujah Chorus.” How profoundly appropriate it was that thisrevelation should occur in church, for this is the secret, I concluded, of allreligions: There is no God! There is no God, and it really doesn't matter!I looked around at the restless and coughing congregation and smugly wallowed inthe luxury of feeling sorry for these frightened sheep. I did feel a bit like ahypocrite sitting there with the choir, lending my unbelieving voice to ameaningless worship service. Still, I thought, it was a job. I owed it to Mr.Carlton. But then I remembered it was Communion Sunday. Oh no you don't! Neveragain. I really would be a hypocrite if I took part in that absurd act of mockcannibalism. I decided I would sit this one out. It would be my declaration ofliberation. I couldn't wait to not take communion.The sermon wound to a dreary conclusion. “Can you imagine how lonely you wouldbe if you had only yourself to look to?” Dr. Petty then announced we would nowcommemorate the “Lord's Supper.” Mr. Carlton stood up and indicated to the choirto rise. The choir was to take communion first. My place was in the very middleof the tenor section. I had people on both sides of me. I couldn't remainseated. I was trapped into filing out with everybody else. “Damn it!” I thought.“Now I will have to stand there while everyone kneels to take communion. Dr.Petty will probably look at me and wait until I kneel. I might have to saysomething. It will be incredibly awkward.”I toyed with the idea of just marching out the side door and running to Tooley'sfor a tuna sandwich, but the thought of Mr. Carlton's wrath made me reconsider.I decided to go to the rail with the choir, kneel down like everybody else, butwhen the time came to communicate I would just kneel there respectfully. My backwould be turned to the congregation. No one would notice except perhaps Dr.Petty and he wouldn't say anything until after church. It might even be aninteresting conversation.Mr. Carlton was more than a choir director. He was a puppet master. He conductedthrough a rich vocabulary of subtle body language and his singers never tooktheir eyes off him. Barely moving two fingers he compelled us like so manymarionettes to parade to the communion rail and line up shoulder to shoulder. Hethen dropped us to our knees in perfect unison with an almost imperceptible nodof his head. We knelt there in our long robes like a row of purple tents.I was very excited, or maybe a little scared. My heart pounded so loudly I couldhear it clicking in my mouth.Now on the evening He was betrayed, as they were eating, Jesus took bread, andblessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat. Forthis is my body.”Everybody took and ate. I took not. I ate not. It was my first adult act ofconscience. I swooned with ecstasy. I had never felt so alive in my life.And when they had eaten he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave itto them, saying “Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant,which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”Everybody took and drank. I took not. I drank not. I was almosthyperventilating. I felt I would burst.And he said to them; “I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of thevine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.”It was over in just a moment. The others downed their pathetic drop of grapejuice and returned the sticky little glasses to their tight little holes. I haddone it. I had freed myself of God. I was one with the likes of Thomas Paine,Burtrand Russell, and Mark Twain!It was now time for the choir to return to the loft to serenade the bovine queueof believers through their snack. We looked to the dark eyes of Mr. Carlton andwaited for his silent permission to rise. He gave the command by raising hischin ever so slightly while lifting his eyebrows in subtle mockery as if he werewatching angels rising to heaven.Getting up from a kneeling position is never easy and I was very conscious ofthe fact that I could inadvertently “moon” the congregation from this positionif I wasn't careful—for a sophisticated freethinker like me that would never do.I leaned back slightly and slid my left foot forward until it rested flat nextto my right knee which was still planted solidly on the floor. I placed bothhands on my left knee and transferred my weight to that axis and tried to riseup on my left leg. Unbeknownst to me, however, was the fact that the hem of mychoir robe was pinned firmly to the floor by the toe of my right shoe. I wasonly able to rise two or three inches before my own robe trapped me in a mosthumiliating kowtow. Again I tried to rise but only managed to reach a painfulstoop. My ecstasy instantly turned to panic. I couldn't even raise my head. Therest of the choir members were already on their feet. Again and again I wasforced to my knees but no matter how I repositioned myself I could not free myrobe from the tent-stake of my own foot. The congregation started to murmur,then giggle.I tried again. This time when I reached the limit of my constraint I forcedmyself to hop violently like a one-legged hunchback two or three times in tinyjerks. At the crest of each hop I tried to lift my right foot. Each time as Ilanded I belched out a pitiful little grunt. This ridiculous maneuver resultedin the almost impossible act of kicking my own ass with the heel of my rightfoot. I was so embarrassed that I thought I would ignite. Eventually, thisgrotesque dance enabled me to pull myself free.Like a tightly strung bow that suddenly had its string severed, my body sprangto attention. I was upright for only a split second before my momentum hurled meoff balance and backwards towards the first row of pews. All I could see was theblur of the great stained glass window as my head snapped back violently. I knewI was toppling into humiliation and injury. As I plunged backward into theabyss, the high vaulted ceiling of the church reverberated with the only wordsmy spasming nervous system would permit my body to release.“Oh God!” I screamed at the top of my lungs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0012.html#fn1] I was expelled from high school on two occasions: thefirst time in my Junior year because my hair was too long, and once in my Senioryear for “seditious activity on campus” (a charge relating to my involvementwith the Students for a Democratic Society and the antiwar movement). I wasreinstated on the former occasion at the intervention of Mr. Carlton who pointedout to the School Board that I was a professional musician (who needed alonghair image) and my family needed my support because of my father's terminalillness. The charge of “seditious activity on campus” was dropped and I wasreinstated when a local Episcopal minister (a friend in the anti-war movementand a member of the American Civil Liberties Union) intervened on my behalf."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 7California Dreamin'A couple of weeks after my humiliation at the communion rail I packed up my VWbus and drove as fast as I could out of Nebraska. The long nightmare was overand my future beckoned to me from golden California. I knew everything wouldchange but I had no way of knowing how much.The world in 1966 was far more interesting than college. I studied very little.As a drama major I soon discovered I could get through most of my classes bysimply acting like a college student. I was just happy to be back home inCalifornia. It was everything I remembered and more. Almost immediately I foundwork in the evenings singing “folk music” in local saloons. I had more audacitythan ability, and was so entirely unconscious of my own lack of talent that Isometimes fooled other people as well. Among them were the owners of some of themost famous folk dubs in the country including Huntington Beach's famed GoldenBear, where I twice found myself opening act for my idol, Hoyt Axton.Soon I was befriended by other local musicians. Foremost among these was afellow Midwesterner, Charley D. Harris, who had just returned from a successfulstint in Hawaii. Charley was ten years older than I and had already made almostevery mistake a young musician could make.1 [part0013.html#ft1] He was ready tosettle down and get serious about songwriting. I convinced him to allow me tocollaborate with his efforts.We were remarkably prolific and soon produced a respectable portfolio of songswhich, if I say so myself, we presented quite well. Charley had a great voiceand our harmonies were very tight. This combination of skills got us throughseveral doors in the Hollywood publishing world and earned us a measure of localnotoriety. I wallowed in my local stardom. I was very poor, but life was sweet.Like most musicians, I smoked a little grass and waxed philosophical with mycolleagues over midnight steak and eggs (Man, did you like ever notice that dogspelled backwards is G-o-d?), but spirituality was the farthest thing from mymind. LSD would change that.I dropped my first hit with a fellow musician in the men's room of a BelmontShores blues club. It was my friend's first trip also. Once safely back in hisapartment, he went into the bedroom, closed the door and remained there. Iflopped down on the living room floor and for the next six hours repeatedlypicked myself apart and put myself back together.Don't worry, I won't bore the reader with another “I saw God on acid” story.It's not like that at all. It's more like an “I introduced myself to myself”story. I discovered that “myself” was an infinitely greater thing than I hadever imagined, and realized with technicolor certitude that understanding myselfwas going to be the only endeavor in life worth pursuing.By daybreak the doors of perception had dosed enough for me to put on my shoesand walk across town to my own apartment. Everything looked very different.Trees and shrubs radiated luminous auras. Telephone and power lines were coiledround with bright red and green magnetic bands. The visual effects were dazzlingbut no longer a wondrous distraction. My mind was focused on one joyousrevelation. Everything that everybody is looking for in religion is alreadyinside their own heads. There's no reason to believe anything. There's no reasonto pray to anything. It can all be experienced. It must all be experienced. Thatis what we are here to do.I encouraged my brother Marc to join me on my next “trip” about a ten days laterand we found that we communicated very well while under the influence. In theweeks that followed we read everything that we could get our hands on about LSDand the psychedelic phenomenon. Almost every article compared the experience tothe ecstatic visions of eastern mystics and primitive shamans. I haunted theEastern Philosophy section of my college library and indiscriminately skimmedthrough anything I thought might show me where to start my holy quest. Marcbegan investigating yoga and the various yoga institutions in SouthernCalifornia.We put ourselves on an experimental vegetarian diet and started “practicing” thephysical exercises from Swami Vishnudevananda's illustrated book of Hatha Yoga.2[part0013.html#ft2] We weren't bad. Both of us were surprisingly limber andcould sit in a full lotus for (what we considered) quite a long time. I couldeven stand on my head in a full lotus position and demand “Someone quick! Takemy picture!”images [../images/00006.jpeg]Quick! Take my picture!At first we thought we could mix psychedelics and yoga. Like idiots weregistered for an all day Christmas meditation at Paramahansa Yogananda'sSelf-Realization Fellowship Temple. In order to make sure we would get themaximum spiritual impact from the day, Marc baked the most extraordinary loaf ofmarijuana banana bread. It was the first time we ever tried this recipe,3[part0013.html#ft3] so we were unsure how it would affect us. It was very tasty,so delicious in fact that we couldn't believe that it could be very potent. Justminutes prior to entering the Temple we sat in the car and gorged ourselves onthe whole loaf.We were warmly welcomed by a serene looking monk who ushered us to themeditation room. In the East was a small altar displaying portraits of the lineof SRF gurus.4 [part0013.html#ft4]; Facing the altar were five or six rows ofstraight-backed wooden chairs with padded seats. A neatly folded blanket hungover the back of each chair.“Do we have to sit in these chairs?” I asked with affected humility. “We wouldprefer to sit on the floor in our asana.”The monk looked at us incredulously.“My friends, this is an eight hour meditation. I am sure you will be morecomfortable seated in chairs for that amount of time.”“We'll be the judge of that,” Marc replied with a patronizing giggle.We couldn't understand why the monk didn't believe we preferred to meditate onthe floor with our legs locked in a full lotus position like real yogis.“What kind of yogis are these?” Marc thought. (By now the banana bread wastaking effect and I could read his mind.)“Yeah!” I answered mentally. “He must think we are some kind of white guys!”The monk showed us where we could sit on the floor and informed us there wouldbe a break in 2½ hours in case we wanted to move to chairs at that time.“We'll be fine;” I assured him.Within a few minutes the little chapel was filled with neatly dressed devotees.None of them elected to join the two real yogis on the floor. The monk said afew words about Christmas being a very spiritual season and quoted a little fromthe writings of Yogananda. Then we all chanted a few of the Order's “cosmicchants” and settled in for the first 2½ hour period of silent meditation.Marc and I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to have eaten all ofthe banana bread. We were painfully high. We turned to one another and lookedhelplessly at each other's bulging yellow eyes and mentally screamed “We gottaget out of here!”Nevertheless, we closed our eyes and tried to be troopers. Our legs soon fellasleep, and without the distraction of pain so did I. I guess I was snoringpretty loudly when Marc jabbed me in the ribs with his elbow. The monk openedone eye and silently glowered at us. It was absolutely amazing. We could readhis mind, too!We squirmed and dozed through the longest 2½ hours of our lives and quietlyslithered to the car during the first break. We would not return to finish themeditation.For the next few months psychedelic experiments would remain the centerpiece ofour spiritual exploration. The dramatic events of our day in Joshua Tree wouldbe the culmination of this period.images [../images/00005.jpeg]Constance left Nebraska and came to live with me on June 15th, 1967. The sweetdistractions of our honeymoon prevented us from accompanying Marc and a niceyoung Quaker couple named Karl and Elsa to a peace demonstration on June 23rd inLos Angeles. This event would have a profound effect upon Marc and change allour lives dramatically.President Johnson was to appear at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Itwas the perfect opportunity for the Southern California peace movement tomobilize the most massive demonstration to date against the continuingescalation of the war in Vietnam. The movement on the West Coast was made upprimarily of young white adult students, teachers, the clergy, and liberalprofessionals of the JFK/RFK ilk. The day started with the festive, love-inatmosphere that had characterized earlier L.A. demonstrations. The crowd wascomposed of well-dressed young couples pushing baby carriages and spectacledcollege types in blue work-shirts and corduroy jackets. Before sunset thesedilettantes would become violently committed political radicals.Everyone expected the scenario to follow that of previous demonstrations. Thedemonstrators would position themselves in front of the hotel and chant as longand as loud as possible for the benefit of the television news crews. The policewould eventually give the order to disperse, everyone would boo and hiss for afew minutes and then return to their cars feeling defiantly self-satisfied.This day would be different. Two lines of riot-equipped officers sandwiched theentire assembly in front of the hotel. When the order came to disperse, thedemonstrators were prevented from moving by the line of officers behind. Theofficers in front of the hotel were ordered to advance on the crowd and usetheir batons on anyone who would not move. At the same time the police in backof the demonstrators were ordered to use their batons on anyone attempting tomove back. For twenty-five bloody minutes the police clubbed away in a shamefulattempt to make sure every demonstrator got a taste of the baton.News bureaus around the country called it the worse police riot since the 1930s.Witnesses said it was a miracle nobody died at the scene. Scores were seriouslyinjured and hospitalized. Marc was beaten on the head and face and returned homewith his glasses broken and his clothes covered in blood. Karl and Elsa werealso bruised and bloodied, their Quaker commitment to non-violence severelyshaken.The events of June 23, 1967 instantly polarized the political consciousness ofSouthern California. Moderate Democrats became ultra-liberals, ultra-liberalsbecame radicals, and radicals became communists. Shocked by the brutality, butsteadfast in their patriotism, moderate Republicans became conservatives,conservatives became ultra-nationalists, and ultra-nationalists became fascists.No one, it seemed, could remain moderate or neutral.The horrifying reality of the war in Vietnam, and the increasingly brutal andrepressive domestic environment had a curious effect on the spiritual life ofour little circle of family and friends. As the chaos escalated so did ourefforts toward self-discovery. We engaged in an almost desperate struggle toquickly gain enlightenment. We believed it would be our only avenue of escapefrom the coming holocaust.Constance and I were married in November and I simply stopped going to college.Karl and Elsa invited us to come live with them and their four children in thesuburban college community of Irvine. Karl taught Mathematics and ComputerScience at the University of California, Irvine, and Elsa, a Vassar Collegegraduate, was a professional midwife. We became the neighborhood's token“hippies” and were instantly embraced by the local liberal establishmentyearning to breathe “hip.” By day, Constance babysat and I gave guitar lessons.By night, Karl and Elsa hosted sumptuous sit-on-the-floor banquets where wewould introduce the neighbors to marijuana, Alan Watts, Ravi Shankar, recordedTibetan chants, and “electronic” music.In March of 1968 we started shopping for a larger home out in the nearby canyonsand forests where we could establish a private communal base. We didn't want tomove too far away from Karl's job at the University. On April 4th our planschanged. The assassination of Martin Luther King plunged us into a state oftangible paranoia. Timothy Leary was advising folks to “tune in, turn on, anddrop out:” We were already well tuned in and turned on, nothing remained now butto drop out.The subculture grapevine was humming with tales of utopian life in SouthernOregon. We heard of a magical place called Takilma, a tiny village on theIllinois River near the California border where land was cheap and the valleywas filled with beautiful people just like us. There was even a mysteriouswizard, a French Canadian pranic healer and follower of Yogananda who lived in arenovated barn by the river, and he was selling property next to his.This sounded too good to ignore. Marc and Karl made an exploratory trip anddetermined that Takilma would be our Shangri-La. Before returning they rented alarge house for us on Waldo Road near the Takilma community. The Waldo house hadelectricity and indoor plumbing and would afford us the opportunity to weanourselves from urbane luxuries before we plunged completely into the primitiveworld of rural hippiedom. Our plan was to headquarter there until each couplecould buy land that would be suitable for building our own cabins.On May Morn, after selling nearly everything we had except guitars and books,Constance and I set out for Takilma along with Marc, his wife Margaret, Karl andElsa, their four children and thirteen cats. There we hoped to build our ownhomes and live quiet lives of fasting, meditation, and study. There we intendedto achieve perfect illumination before the world blew apart.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0013.html#fn1] He was saving a few he could make with me.2 [part0013.html#fn2] Swami Vishnudevananda, The Complete Illustrated Book ofYoga, Juliean Press, Inc. 1960 Library of Congress Catalog Card # 59-15568.3 [part0013.html#fn3] As I recall he soaked an entire “lid” of cleaned grass intequila.

Each couple had a private bedroom, the childrenshared a bedroom, and the cats had the run of Southern Oregon. Constancedecorated our room like a jewel box. She hung the ceiling with a huge colorfulpoof of an Indian bedspread and color coordinated all our bedding and pillows.The only thing wrong with our new communal environment was that Constance and Idid not get very much privacy. After all, we were newlyweds and still prettyfrisky. A week or so after we arrived we declined an invitation to join theothers on an overnight visit to the famous Sunny Valley commune and seized theopportunity for some time alone.While Constance soaked in a hot bath I thought I would sit and meditate near thefire and listen to some music. If it had been six months earlier I would havealso lit up a joint, but one of the first things we learned about Oregon wasthat marijuana and psychedelics were not readily available. For the most part,country hippies got high the old fashioned way—yoga, pranayama, and naturalfood.I took off my boots, put on a Beatles album, settled into a half lotus and tooksome deep breaths. I closed my eyes and used the familiar tracks of the music asa mantra. Everything seemed perfect.There's nothing you can do that can't be done.1 [part0014.html#ft1]“Wow,” I thought, “that is just like something out of the Tao Te Ching.”Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.“Yes, just like the Tao Te Ching!”Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game. It's easy.There was nothing unusual about projecting cosmic significance to popular music,especially that of the Beatles. But that night I was taking it particularlypersonally.Nothing you can make that can't be made.No one you can save that can't be saved.Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time.It's easy.The second time I heard the words “it's easy,” I felt as if I would burst. I wasno longer listening to the stereo. The song had become nothing less than adirect communication from God to my soul. I was so thrilled that I squeezed mybuttocks with a contorted shiver of religious ecstasy. Instantly, shiveringpangs of intense tingling exploded in my abdomen and between my shoulder blades.All you need is love.All you need is love.All you need is love, love. Love is all you need.“Oh yes!” The more I surrendered to the tingling, the stronger the tingling, andthe more personal the lyrics became.Nothing you can know that isn't known.Nothing you can see that isn't shown.Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.It's easy.This time when God told me it was “easy” the tingling burst like a balloon atthe very top of my head. It was as if an egg of electric fire shattered on mycrown and sent scintillating goo slowing dripping over my head.All you need is love.“Surrender;” I told myself.All you need is love.“Surrender. This is it! Let it happen. It won't happen unless you let it.”All you need is love, love. Love is all you need.Miraculously, I took my own advice. I let go. I surrendered to the tingling atthe top of my head, and as I did it became so intense that everywhere it spreadit obliterated all sense of separateness. As it covered my head I could nolonger see, feel, or conceive of my head as being anything other than everythingthat was. Wherever the electric fire touched became everywhere, everything. Iwas becoming universally wall-to-wall from the head down. I could feel my lips,but I could also feel the air that touched my lips, and everything the air thattouched my lips touched, and on and on until my lips lost all meaning except toserve as position for the perfect center of the cosmos.As I continued to surrender it rapidly expanded to the back of my neck and downmy spine to usurp the lesser tingling between my shoulder blades. From there itspread to my arms and hands.All you need is love (All together, now!) All you need is love (Everybody!) Allyou need is love, love. Love is all you need.Almost with a thud it reached the base of my spine and flowed into my legs andfeet; but then—I had no feet. The new-I reached to the innermost/outermostcorners of universe, of space and time and energies. The only thing thatremained of old-I was the part that observes, the part that realizes—realizesthat it is the One Big Whatever-it-is; realizes that its fiery, blissfulconsciousness fills every nook and cranny of the One Big Whatever-it is;realizes that this “thisness” is eternally this!But old-I, the fleshy-fat and blood-filled tumor at the center of the One BigWhatever-it-is, also realized that it was losing itself; realized it was dying;realized that its lumbering crust hadn't taken a breath in a long time.Love is all you need (love is all you need)Love is all you need (love is all you need)Love is all you need (love is all you need)Love is all you need (love is all you need)The One Big Whatever-it-is didn't particularly care that old-I might be dying.Things were forever dying and being created in One Big Whatever-it-is. It saidto itself, “Old-I is lucky to die united to the One Big Whatever-it-is. Isn'tthat the spiritual goal of all old-Is?”Old-I was afraid. Maybe it was too soon to say goodbye to old-I. It searched theimmensity of everywhere to locate an old-I hand or an old-I foot. Movement mightbreak the spell of reverie the One Big Whatever-it-is held upon old I. But,fearful as it was, old-! loved being one with the One Big Whatever-it-is so muchthat it felt like blasphemy—spiritual suicide—to leave this bliss.Fear triumphed. An arm moved, and in doing so voluntarily separated itself fromthe One Big Whatever-it-is. The arm lost the omnipresent tingle. Then the otherarm moved. Wriggling feet were the next mutinous angels cast from paradise.I slumped forward and gasped for life, sucking in great waves of stinking airthat caused my heart to race like a hummingbird's. The magick fire withdrew fromall my extremities and lingered for a few last seconds in the back of my neck.Then it was gone. The stereo was silent. I opened my eyes to discover that a cathad shit on my boots.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0014.html#fn1] All You Need Is Love. by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.Copyright © 1967 (Renewed) Sony/ATV Songs LLC All rights administered bySony/ATV Music Publishing, 8 Music Square West, Nashville, TN 37203.

Kennedy was shot to death in the pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in LosAngeles. The consensus around the hippie campfires was that the evil forces ofthe proverbial military industrial complex were firmly in charge of the domesticsituation. Fearing things would get worse for those with dissident philosophies,many of our neighbors made plans to go even deeper into the woods.Karl and Elsa liked what they had seen at the Sunny Valley commune and soonmoved there with their children and some of the cats. A month or so afterward wesaw their smiling faces on the cover of Life Magazine. The photo spread on theinside featured Karl and Elsa as well. Today you can find those same pictures innumerous coffee-table pictorials of the 60s.The DuQuettes were not so anxious to submit to the hard work and disciplinedlifestyle of formal communal life. We pooled our money and bought half an acreof land by the Illinois River near Takilma. Marc and Margaret pitched a tent onthe property and set up the home base for our house-building efforts. Constanceand I moved nearby in a magical little one-room cabin behind the massiverenovated barn that was the home of the Wizard of Takilma Road.Gary DuBois didn't look like much of a wizard. He was a quiet man aboutfive-and-a-half feet tall and almost skinny. He had a thick black beard that hekept well trimmed. He smiled all the time, and spoke with a charmingFrench-Canadian accent. He lived with his wife, Diane, a huge woman easily threetimes his size, and their 10-year-old son Andre.Their home was the envy of everyone on Takilma Road. From the outside it was ahuge barn, complete with all the exterior adornments one usually expects to seeon an old barn: hubcaps, horseshoes, and an assortment of dear antlers andanimal pelts. The centerpiece was the skin of a large brown bear complete withhead and claws.The interior was bizarre to say the least. It was one big room partitioned hereand there by antique bookcases, bureaus, secretaries and wardrobes. Two wallswere taken up completely, floor to roof (there was no ceiling), with makeshiftbookcases crammed full of books. (Gary admitted to having over three thousand,but there could easily have been twice that number.) In the southeast cornernear the front door Diane had her kitchen. Illuminated on two walls by largecheery windows, it could have served as the cozy model for a Beatrix Potterstory. Her altar was a huge, light green enameled wood stove and warming ovenupon which she invoked the most amazing delicacies that she crammed in yourmouth each time you entered her world. Gary worked all night at a local dairy,and during the day performed the usual chores around the farmstead. I'm not surewhen he slept.Our little cabin was close enough to the DuBois’ barn for us to hear Gary andDiane fighting at night. Actually it was just Diane who did the fighting. Onceshe started yelling at Gary about one thing or another, he would escape byastrally projecting to safety. He was only successful if he could get to thecouch and pop out before Diane saw what was going on (she described herself asbeing “cursed” with clairvoyance).One night Constance and I were awakened by the sound of dishes smashing againstthe barn's wall.“You're not going to float out of here while I'm talking to you!” The voice wasDiane's, and she meant business. Another plate crashed into the wall.“Get back, dammit, or I'll move your little-assed body where you'll never findit!”We heard Gary's pitiful mumblings, then another dish hit the wall.“Okay! Okay! Stop it now. I'm back.”Early the next morning Diane came to our cabin with a plate of cheese blintzesand an explanation of the previous night's events.“He does it just to irritate me. I can see him do it. I wish I couldn't. If hegets too far away he can stay out for hours. But if I catch him just as he'sleaving I can bring the little fart back. Last night I nailed him with a soupbowl. Bam! Right through the skinny little spook.”Gary was a pranic1 [part0015.html#ft1] healer—a skill that made him somewhat ofa folk hero in Southern Oregon. People from as far away as Grants Pass andMedford traveled to the barn to receive his treatments. Constance and I wereprivileged to watch him at work on a number of conditions including asthmaattacks and broken bones. However, the most amazing thing I ever saw him do wasresurrect a dead cat.Like most of our neighbors, the DuBois were slaves to a menagerie of barnyardanimals. Diane's favorites were a pair of toy poodles named Shoo-Shoo and Misty.Constance and I were very impressed by the character and intelligence of thesecritters and when Misty had her next litter (sired by the neighbor's dogTudypoo) we were the first in line for a pup.2 [part0015.html#ft2]Diane also raised Siamese cats who, it seemed, found a way to breed with everyfeline in Southern Oregon. Predictably, the yard was alive with kittens thatwere just too cute for words. One warm summer evening I accidentally stepped onone and crushed the poor thing to death. I was wearing my heavy work boots. Itdidn't have a chance. I was hurrying to the barn (probably to see what Diane wascooking) and came down full force on the tiny fur-ball. I heard it crunch withseveral sickening cracks that told me it was mortally injured. I dropped to myknees to see its last pitiful struggles. I had obviously broken its spine. Itsback legs were completely motionless and just for a moment it waved its frontpaws in the air. It was so little. The last breath inflated its wee body like atiny balloon and then exited through the bloody mouth and nose, creating shinyred bubbles that quivered for an instant before popping in the warm evening air.I was so upset that I couldn't think straight. I even considered going back toour cabin and not telling anyone what happened. “Diane is going to kill me;’ Ithought. I decided that I would have to face the music sooner or later. Afterall, how can you lie to a psychic? I picked up the little carcass. It fit easilyin the palm of my hand. The black eyes were wide open and its mouth agape. Iknocked at the door. Diane opened it and immediately saw everything.“Oh you big oaf! Bring it in! Bring it in!”She snatched her dead kitten by the scruff of its neck and held it up to showGary. Its crooked body swung from her hand like a wet rag.“Look what Sleeping Bear3 [part0015.html#ft3] did, stomping around the barnyardin the dark!”I babbled a score of groveling apologies.Gary was seated on the couch in a full lotus posture smiling from ear to ear,wearing nothing but black Speedos.“Bring it here. Bring it here,” he said with a twinkle in his eye that I mistookfor a tear.“Gary, I'm sorry. It's dead I broke its back. I crunched it with my full weight.I'm really sorry.”“We'll see;” he said as Diane put the kitten in his hand.“Oh God!” I thought. “He's going to try to bring it back to life.”“It might be the wrong time,” Gary giggled as he began to go to work.He held the kitten in the palm of his left hand and used his right hand to tracerings and spheres in the air around the body. His gestures and movements wereintensely graceful, and as I watched him I could almost see colored lines ofenergy radiating from his palm and fingertips, wrapping the kitten in whatlooked like a vibrating ball of twine.After ten minutes or so of making spherical motions, he held his hand overvarious parts of the kitten's body and took a series of deep breaths that heheld for an impressively long time. Alternately, he emptied his lungs and heldhis negative breath for equally long periods. The whole atmosphere in the roombecame charged. My own hands and fingers tingled as I watched Gary work. Dianesat in the kitchen with her eyes closed.I was very impressed by what was obviously a psychic tour-de-force, but it stilldidn't alter the fact that the kitten was dead—really dead, and all theseheroics were not going to change that. I was more than a little embarrassed forGary. He was trying so hard to be the neighborhood holy man. This was the firsttime I had ever seen him fail at a spiritual chore. I felt extra guilty aboutthe whole thing.He began to violently stroke the air on four sides of the kitten, creating, asit were, a pyramidal field. With each stroke he raised his left hand almost asif he were going to toss the kitten in the air. If it were alive, I thought, itwould sure be getting a thrill out of that. All these rough movements jostledthe little body back and forth giving the appearance of animation.I watched Gary for nearly a half an hour and was anxious to go home and put thissad evening behind me. I looked over at Diane, hoping to get some encouragementto leave, but her eyes were still tightly shut. Gary began the entire cycle oftechniques over again; first the sphere, then the breathing, then the tossing.He repeated the cycle, this time faster, then again, and again, until finallyhis left hand dropped to his lap and I heard what sounded like a kitten's cough.Gary wiped a plug of brown blood from his naked leg. The kitten rolled back andforth in Gary's hand and coughed again. He turned his tiny patient on its backand began to “work” on its underbelly. Immediately more brown liquid came outits mouth. I moved closer to see. It was alive. There was no doubt about it. Itwas alive.Gary picked it up by the scruff of its neck and tried to get it to sit up in hishand. Its forelegs seemed willing but it had no control of its hindquarters.“You're right.” Gary giggled. They were the first words he had spoken sincebeginning the treatment. “You broke his spine.”“Big oaf!” Diane chimed in without opening her eyes.Gary went to work on the back. Using the thumb and forefinger of his right handhe rolled and twisted the air like he was rolling an invisible cigarette. Hestarted between the kitten's ears and moved slowly down to the tip of its tail.He reminded me of a child playing doctor on a pretend patient, but it was morethan pretending. As I watched his fingers move I could dearly see what he wasvisualizing. I looked over at Diane. Her eyes were still dosed but I knew she,too, shared in the vision. Gary was braiding the spine in his imagination, andDiane and I were helping. For a few golden moments I saw how everything in theuniverse is alive and connected to everything else. Everything is alive andnothing is impossible if you can visualize it perfectly enough.Within a few minutes the kitten's back legs were thrashing wildly and Gary washaving difficulty keeping the little critter in his hand. Before I went home, Iwatched the dead kitten sit up on the coffee table, scratch its ear with itshind leg and yawn. In the morning it was out in the barnyard wrestling with itsbrothers and sisters. Diane named it Lazarus.Later that week, Gary accidentally backed over Lazarus with the pickup truck. Iwatched him dig its shallow grave behind the chicken coop.“I guess now's the right time;” he giggled.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0015.html#fn1] The ancient Hindus postulated the existence of prana, thevital life force which permeates air, water, sunlight and all living things.They further theorize that the yogi can, by mastering certain techniques ofbreath control (pranayama), increase this vital force in his or her own body andtransmit its healing energy to others.2 [part0015.html#fn2] This little sweetie we named Shep, and he remained ourfaithful companion until his death fourteen years later.3 [part0015.html#fn3] Diane gave everybody “Indian” names {usually to ridiculephysical abnormalities or character flaws.)

We were surroundedby hard-core spiritual seekers, yogis, Buddhists, and devotional Christians. Godwas the centerpiece of every conversation, every meal, every diversion andpleasure. We were like an Amish community—only with a perverse sense of humor, alove of music and bright colors, and raging libidos.With expert help from our talented hippie neighbors we completed Marc andMargaret's house in early September, and laid out plans to build another forConstance and me. As we were nearly out of money, we decided to return brieflyto Southern California and raise the needed funds. I was sure I would be able tofind work singing, and if all went well, we would be back in Oregon in two orthree weeks.As it turned out, things went extremely well. The first day back I joined my oldsong writing partner Charley Harris, who had secured a marvelous gig at one ofthe better Newport Beach eateries. He negotiated more money from the club andgenerously allowed me to share the stage.images [../images/00008.jpeg]Charlie D. & Milo, Epic Records, 1970Charley and I were pretty good. The fact that we wrote many of the songs weperformed made our cabaret act somewhat of an aberration. We sang five nights aweek and by the end of the second week I had earned the fabled grubstake. Wepacked up the old VW bus and readied ourselves for our triumphant return toOregon. We planned to depart immediately after my last Saturday nightperformance. As it turned out, we did not leave that night, nor would we everreturn to our land.It happened that Charley and I had an old drinking buddy who had recently“bought into” the music business. He chanced to teamed up with a seasonedproducer from Columbia Records, and together they shepherded their client to twonumber one hits in less than ninety days. Their stock in the industry was at itszenith and for some reason they chose that night to get drunk and listen toCharley and me. They liked our original songs and asked us if we had written anyothers. Charley lied and boasted that we had hundreds of songs. Hearing this,they asked if we would be willing to record a demo. Neither Charley nor Iactually thought this was anything other than Hollywood hype, but I agreed tostay another week to see if they would deliver.They delivered—and more. Two days later we drove to Sunset Boulevard andrecorded a few original songs in historic Studio A at CBS. Within the week wesigned to record two singles and an album on the Epic label,1[part0016.html#ft1] joined the obligatory unions, and signed with the WilliamMorris Agency. It was an adolescent's dream come true. Charley and I andeveryone who knew us were stunned. It was now our turn to deliver all thosesongs we said we had written.Realizing we were philosophical light-weights with very little to say, wenonetheless chose to take the high road and channel the themes for our songs byflipping through the pages of an occult dictionary and picking a word or phraseat random. We wrote of sylphs and gnomes and undines and white goose feet. Wethought it was all very “heavy.”2 [part0016.html#ft2] Even our publisher gotcaught up in our magick music and renamed his company “Hazelwand Publishing.”For the next four years Charley and I played (sometimes quite successfully) atbeing recording artists and musicians. We traveled everywhere our songs receivedradio play and were the opening act for more recognizable names. A few of oursongs were picked up and recorded by other groups and we garnered more than ourshare of collateral studio work.3 [part0016.html#ft3]Predictably, Charley and I fell prey to the excesses that accompanied suchlifestyles in the early 70s, and it became more and more obvious that I was soongoing to have to make a decision about my future as a holy man. In spite of thecraziness, Constance and I decided we wanted a baby. Our son, Jean-Paul, wasborn toward the end of this wild and unhealthy season of my life. His arrivalmade it clear that the unstable world of a hippie musician was not conducive tofamily life. I decided to get out of the business and take my chances in thereal world. For the next ten years or so I didn't do a very good job of it.While trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I grew up, my brother Marcencouraged me to join him in the Rosicrucian Order AMORC. He said they were likemystic Freemasons. I took his advice, and with the United States Postal Serviceas my psychopomp, I took the first initiatory step into the Western Mysteries.My employment and financial difficulties would not get better for a long time,but my spiritual life was about to explode.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0016.html#fn1] We called ourselves Charley D. & Milo. Our first single onthe Epic label was “Back Bay Blu.” Our album, simply called Charley D. & Milo,did remarkably well everywhere it was distributed. It even earned BillboardMagazine's spotlight pick and received good reviews. Our second single, “TheWord is Love” went to number one in the handful of cities where distributionenabled it to be broadcast and purchased. Salt Lake City was one such city, andthe highlight of our concert visit to that fair city was hearing it played ontwo AM stations simultaneously.2 [part0016.html#fn2] “My own eye me mirror be.

Symbols are alive and living things a generally symbols of something.When I see an angel or a magical beast in a dream or vision or skrying1[part0017.html#ft1] session, it is usually a symbolic encounter with a conceptconcerning a personal or magical issue that is too complex to be expressed orunderstood through any other medium. These same “living” apparitions react tosymbols as if they were alive. A simple geometric figure such as a cross or apentagram drawn in the air in the face of a pesky spirit is often enough to sendit fleeing in terror. This basic rule of thumb unravels when one is faced indream or vision with the living image of a dead person. Is it alive, or is it asymbol?Almost everyone who has ever lost a loved one has at least one visitation storyto tell. Usually the deceased appears in a vivid dream or vision a week or twoafter dying and delivers a message to the effect that everything is okay and notto worry. I used to think that this phenomenon was a natural denial mechanism ofthe mind, triggered at times when it is easier to accept an hallucination ratherthan dealing with grief and the great mystery of death. Now, I am not so sure.I was 24 when my father died of emphysema a few weeks after seeing Jean-Paultake his first steps. He was only 61. About ten days after his funeral he showedup to deliver a curious message.Since my initiation into AMORC I had set aside an hour or two each Thursdaynight to study the monographs and practice the various outlined “psychic”exercises. For some reason I decided this night I would perform my devotionsbefore dinner and set up my Sanctum altar in the bedroom.I opened the “temple” with the usual ceremonial formalities, unsealed my newmonograph and started to read. Almost immediately I found that I could not keepmy mind focused on the words. I found myself reading the same sentence over andover again until I became extremely sleepy. I finally gave up trying to readaltogether and decided to take a little nap before dinner and pick up my studieslater. I blew out both candles and stretched out in the cool darkness. In thosedays it was my habit, when sleeping on my back, to cross my arms over my breast.I closed my eyes and was instantly out.Suddenly I became conscious that the room was no longer dark. I rememberthinking that I had broken the very first safety rule of fledgling mystics andallowed myself to fall asleep with candles burning. I opened my eyes and lookedup at the ceiling. I could see every detail bathed in a warm orange light. ThenI noticed that my arms were no longer crossed over my chest but stretched outcrucifixion style. That struck me as being very curious because I knew I hadn'tbeen asleep long enough to change positions.The pit of my stomach tingled with the joyous thrill I always feel when I dreamof flying. But I wasn't flying. I was flat on my back on the bed. I turned myhead to the left and looked down my arm to see my hand dangling over themattress. Then I turned to the right and to my utter delight discovered myfather sitting by the bed not six inches from my right hand.He looked great, better, in fact, than I had seen him in years. I felt youngerjust looking at him. His skin was a beautiful tan and his hair was thicker anddarker than I ever remembered. He didn't say a word, and for some reason Iwasn't inclined to speak either. We just looked at each other.I soon became conscious of the peculiarity of the moment. The light in the roomdid not come from the candles or the electric lights, but seemed to radiate fromevery object in the room, most especially from Dad and me. Also, there was atangible silence in the room as if the whole world was holding its breath. I hadthe feeling that if anything were to move it would do so in blissfully slowmotion. Finally, it dawned on me: I was sleeping; Dad was dead; and all this wasvery weird indeed.I had the presence of mind to realize that the thrill in the pit of my stomachwas symptomatic of astral projection, and this whole experience might not be adream at all but a bona fide case of psychic contact with the dead. To test mytheory I willed myself to float slowly to the ceiling and back down again. I didit with ease. I looked over at Dad and smiled. He seemed amused but a littleimpatient.Then, with great deliberation, he lifted his right hand. He wore a beautifulgolden ring with a blue stone setting. The stone was embellished with theMasonic square and compass. However, upon closer examination, I saw thatsuperimposed upon the square was a downward pointing triangle surmounted by anankh, very similar to an AMORC device.“Is this your message?” I asked mentally.He smiled and pointed to the ring.I had no idea what this meant. He delivered the wordless message with such dramaand grace that for the time being I didn't care what it meant. It was a just abeautifully pleasant moment. I choked up a little like I do when I almost cry atthe movies. I dosed my eyes just for an instant to control the tears. I took adeep breath, then opened my eyes. The room was dark. My arms were folded over mychest. My father was gone.A week or so later Constance and I visited Aunt Vina, my father's sister, inLong Beach. I mentioned to her that I was studying the AMORC monographs and shesaid, “In that case I've got something for you”She went to her bookcase and plucked several very old AMORC books and some boundmonographs from the 1930s.“I took the lessons for about five years,” she said, as she handed me the books,“You're welcome to these old monographs, too. Your father tried to join when hewas 17 or 18, but in those days you had to be 21 years old to join theRosicrucians. He was heartbroken. He was so thrilled when the Masons acceptedhim about the time you we born.”This little tidbit of family history did not exactly explain my father'svisitation, but at the time it served to encourage me concerning the directionmy spiritual life was heading. However, in the years to follow, when themysteries of Rosicrucianism and esoteric Freemasonry would become thecenterpiece of my magic life, I would come to understand that the message of myfather's ghost was uncannily prophetic.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0017.html#fn1] Skrying (scrying), sometimes called “traveling in thespirit vision,” is a name given to a variety of clairvoyant experiences usuallyinduced by formal magical procedures. One can skry a material object topsychically see the spiritual reality underlying its existence or learn of itsmagical past. Also, in magical systems, such as the Enochian magick of Dr. JohnDee, one can converse with spirits or visit their environment via visions seenin crystals or mirrors or which simply appear in the “mind's eye.”"},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 12InitiationHopefully you now have a pretty good idea what raw material the gods had to workwith when 24-year-old Lon DuQuette first knocked at the door of the WesternMysteries and demanded admittance. When the door opened I started all overagain. I stepped into a world where effect sometimes precedes cause; a world ofliving images and symbols whose meanings change profoundly the moment they aredefined; a world where saviors can be your worst enemies and demons your onlysalvation; a nonlinear world where unrelated experiences separated by many yearscan be impressed simultaneously upon one golden moment of growth or realization.So it is here that I beg the reader's indulgence, for I must by necessity soondepart from the strict linear chronology of events that has characterized mynarrative to this point. Of course I will try to tell things more or less inorder, but the importance for doing so will become less and less relevant. Ibelieve it will, however, be helpful to know the following:I became an enthusiastic student of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC's study program.I joined a local lodge and for several years was very active, serving first asNeophyte class master, then as ritual officer in degree initiations and atweekly convocations. I was especially attracted to the rich symbolism of thedegrees. I couldn't get enough of temple work and found that my entire life anddream patterns became refocused and reorganized in harmony with the symbols andsymmetry of ritual.I owe a great debt to AMORC, and I mean no disrespect to this great organizationwhen I say I soon became impatient with the pace of the program.1[part0018.html#fn1] At the invitation of some friends I joined the TraditionalMartinist Order and got my first taste of real ceremonial magick, and I alsojoined the Builders of the Adytum and began studying their marvelous Tarot andQabalah correspondence courses. I resonated perfectly to this stuff and I was apassionate student.Eventually I came upon an early edition of Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck.I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. The name Aleister Crowleysounded familiar and I vaguely recalled seeing his name footnoted in a Qabalahbook by Frater Achad.2 [part0018.html#fn2] I referred to my occult dictionaryand discovered to my horror—“Aleister Crowley—famous Scottish Satanist…”images [../images/00009.jpeg]0. T.O. Caliph Hymenaeus Alphal IX° 777 (Grady L McMurtry), Constance DuQuette,Jean-Paul DuQuete and the Author, 1978.I may have been a wild a crazy heretic but I sure didn't want anything to dowith Satanism. Knowing my brother had The Book of Thoth (the deck's companiontext), I promptly gave the cards to him—good riddance!I was sternly enlightened a few days later by our dear friend Mad Bob (a namethat only begins to describe his bizarre and wonderful character) who hadreturned briefly from a Central American adventure. Bob had read Crowley'sautobiography3 [part0018.html#fn3] and insisted that I would love the man if Igave him a chance. When I showed him what the occult dictionary had to say hebrushed it off saying, “It doesn't matter if Crowley was a Satanist, he was agood kind of Satanist and you'll just love him! Trust me.”That was the strangest thing I had ever heard, but I respected Mad Bob's opinionand took the cards back from Marc and asked to borrow The Book of Thoth. Bob wasright. Even though I didn't understand most of what I read, I knew that AleisterCrowley was brilliant, funny, and everything I was looking for. I boughteverything I could by or concerning the man (precious little in those days) andeventually wrote to Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) at the addresspublished on the Caliph card of the Thoth Deck to ask for initiation.On November 15, 1975 I was initiated in the Minerval Degree (0°) in the O.T.O.by Major Grady McMurtry (Caliph Hymenaeus Alpha, IX°) and Phyllis Seckler (SororMeral, IX°) at their home in Dublin, California. Constance was initiated aboutsix months later. We had no idea at the time, but the Order was almost extinct.When we were initiated there was only a handful of members still living. Soonafter joining the O.T.O. I discontinued my work in AMORC, TMO and BOTA Once Itasted Crowley nothing else seemed to satisfy.The O.T.O. is an initiatory order similar to freemasonry. It doesn't provideeducational monographs or standardized tests. Rather, it offers members theopportunity to experience a series of dramatic and magical initiations artfullydesigned to awaken and unfold the candidates’ spiritual potentialities. If amember did nothing else with the O.T.O. career but undergo these degreeexperiences, they would be immeasurably rewarded. Serious members know, however,that there is much more to the O.T.O.'s magick than a two-hour ceremonyperformed once or twice a year. So profound are the Order's inner mysteries thatto penetrate them requires not only a rich magical and spiritual education, butalso a high level of meditative attainment. Members who wish to truly affiliateat this level are expected to seize responsibility for their own magicaleducation and eventually rend the veil of the Order's mysteries for themselves.Initiation is a personal matter. What could be more personal than the evolutionof your own soul? One's true initiatory grade has nothing to do withorganizations, titles, or degrees. The only degree that counts is the degree towhich your soul has evolved. The only degree work possible is learning whatneeds to be done to take the next step.I will forever be grateful to the organizations and people who guided me in mystudies prior to my entrance to the O.T.O.; but it is the O.T.O. and the magicalwritings of Aleister Crowley that I must credit for whatever initiatory progress(real or imagined) I have made in this life. In order to make this magick work Ihave had to train and educate myself in a score of fields not directly connectedwith magick. I have had to integrate bizarre and abstract spiritual conceptsinto a daily life of work and marriage and fatherhood and amusement. Everythingthat follows in this little book must be projected against the backdrop of mylife in the O.T.O. (the details of which I hope someday chronicle). For ourpurposes here I will only summarize as follows:In 1978 I was chartered by Hymeneus Alpha to form a Lodge of O.T.O. in NewportBeach, CA. Constance and I proceeded to initiate. We were the first local lodgeso chartered by the Grand Lodge. Today the Order has approximately threethousand members in forty countries. I have had the privilege to initiatehundreds of individuals around the world and am currently a governing officer inthe International Order and United States Deputy Grand Master General.Sounds pretty impressive, eh? I assure you my magical life has not always beenso glamorous.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0018.html#ft1] I confess that I also grew weary of the level of psychicself-righteousness that seemed to infect many of my fellow lodge members. Itnever fails to amaze me how a self-declared psychic “master” can prattle in myface for half an hour about his or her mind-reading prowess and never have aclue that I am thinking (very loudly) that he or she is the biggest horse's assin the world. One afternoon at convocation I tested the clairvoyance of onegroup of self-proclaimed aura voyeurs. During the period of silent meditation Iprojected into the forbidden “Sanctum” area of the temple and astrally moonedthe entire assembly. Nobody seemed to notice.2 [part0018.html#ft2] Q.B.L. or The Bride's Reception, by Frater Achad.

In exchangefor his freedom the king grants him three wishes, all of which, naturally,backfire. It's a cute story designed to delight 11-year-olds, but it struck adeep chord in me.Somehow, even though I was cynical about God and Jesus, I found it easy tobelieve that there might be some truth behind legions of elves and fairies andleprechauns. If they existed I wanted to see them. I even tried to induce analtered state of consciousness by exhausting myself on my bicycle in thesecluded wilds of Pawnee Park. I never saw anything stranger than mosquitoes.Still, I might have been on the right track. It has been my experience that mostof my significant mystical adventures are triggered by trauma. Perhaps this istrue only for the most base and unevolved individuals, those who need to bebeaten over the head before they loosen up. It is certainly true for me. Veryearly in my magical career, following a trauma of sorts, I had a very vividencounter with a most curious creature.The nine-month period prior to my initiation into the O.T.O. was perhaps themost traumatic time of my life. We were painfully poor and my prospects, asusual, were dismal. My occult studies were a welcome escape and I used themprecisely for that purpose. I was especially passionate about my BOTA tarotlessons and was about to begin painting the twenty-two cards of the majorarcana.One afternoon Constance and I took the baby and drove to the market to buywhatever we could with the fifteen dollars I had just earned from giving guitarlessons. Constance, as usual, was a wise and frugal shopper and managed to spendless than ten dollars. Using a coupon, she even bought us a special treat ofhalf a pound of freshly ground Ethiopian Harrar coffee (my last remaining drugof choice). I couldn't wait to get home, get wired and paint my first tarotcard.Unfortunately, when we arrived home we discovered that, in the confusion ofputting the baby in the car, we left our bag of precious groceries in theshopping cart. I got in the car and sped back to the store. It was too late. Ourgroceries were gone. I was furious. I was sick. I was crazy.I went back in the store and with our last five dollars bought the baby'svegetables and (in an act of obscene selfishness) another half pound ofEthiopian Harrar. I was so upset that I could hardly drive. It was probably agood thing that I ran out of gas about six blocks from home. With no money forgas, I abandoned the car and walked home. I handed Constance the baby'svegetables and without a word headed straight for the espresso machine. I packedit tightly full of that incredible coffee and stared at it until the mad hissingstopped. I poured myself a triple shot and locked myself in the bedroom with mypaints and tarot cards.I finished the card in about two hours. It was beautiful. After slugging downanother triple espresso, I set my beautiful Fool up on my little altar andstared at it until bedtime. Even though I was wired to the gills I was verysleepy. I apologized to Constance for my crabbiness and fell instantly asleep.A chain of meaningless unrelated dreams eventually put me behind the wheel of mycar. I had to get it home. I had never abandoned it before. It wouldn't start.Of course! It was out of gas. I got out of the car to do god knows what, andbumped into what I can only describe as a leprechaun. He was about eight incheshigh and wore a black suit and a top hat that had been crushed to a comic angle.I sat down in the street to get a better look. He had lamb chop sideburns and anose like W. C. Fields. He produced a giant-sized (giant-sized for him) silverflask and unscrewed the top.“I made it m'self,” he said as he offered it to me. “One for the road. Drink itall. You've never had anythin’ like it. I made it m'self.”I took the flask and drained it. It had the smell and taste of fine whiskey butwithout any of the bite or burn. I became instantly drunk and was gettingdrunker by the second. The little man disappeared. I got back in the car andstarted it. I put the automatic gearshift to “Drive” only to find myself movingbackwards. I put it in “Reverse” and the whole car slid violently to the right.Finally, I somehow got it going straight ahead but when I turned the steeringwheel to the right the car moved left and visa versa. I didn't know what to do.I slammed on the brakes, which made me go faster. Eventually I crashed through achain link fence and drove the car straight into a swimming pool.I opened the door and stepped out of the car and into the shallow pool. I wasnaked and covered in what looked like soapsuds. I was no longer drunk. I feltclean and holy as if I had just been baptized. I waded to the shallow end of thepool and stepped out of the water. The sun was setting and it colored the skywith a most brilliant array of pastel colors. Everything in the vision waspastel. I saw no primary colors. A road skirted the swimming pool. It snaked tothe horizon in wide, lazy S's until it narrowed in exaggerated perspective anddisappeared completely into the setting sun.I was witnessing a parade—a disorganized procession of the most exotic andwhimsical creatures I had ever seen or imagined. No two were alike. They werehumanoid. Most were tall and slender, but each wore a different style and pastelcolor costume and hat. Each one was very attractive but was impossible todetermine if they were male or female.The most amazing thing about them was their transparency. I could see throughtheir clothes and I could see through them. I thought to myself, “these areelves or fairies.” The creatures reacted to my thought with riotous approval andbegan playing gaily upon bizarre musical instruments. There were thousands ofthem stretching all the way to the sun. As they marched past me, they waved andblew kisses to me. I was absolutely delighted and enchanted.Eventually one of the “elves” broke rank and approached me. This one, Iconcluded, was female because she was the most delicately beautiful creature Ihad ever seen. She was very thin and wore sheaths of transparent lavender thatalternately clung tightly to her firm little body then streamed lightly in theair around her. Her skin was light mauve and her hair transparent pink—bobbed ina classic pixie cut. She smiled at me as I recognized her as a mystical friendfrom a thousand unremembered dreams. She carried in her hands an octagonal paperbox with thousands of little pink wheels printed on the sides. The wheels hadspokes like the wheels that adorn the Fool's jacket on the 0 Key of the Tarot.I wanted to tell her how happy I was to see her and ask her how we could meetagain. Before I could phrase the words, she handed me the box and removed thelid.“Whenever you want to be with me, you need only look into the box and say…”Suddenly from nowhere a cosmic organist played an arpeggio. Taking it as herqueue she sang the following song to the tune of “Silver bells, Silver bells,it's Christmas time in the city.”“Nedura, Nedura, play by myself—in the rain:”It seemed perfectly logical to me at the time. I looked into the box. It wasfilled a quarter full with fine light lavender powder. As I repeated the words,“Nedura, Nedura, play by myself—in the rain;” my breath kicked up the powder andcreated great clouds of lavender dust that obscured the whole vision.I didn't know what any of this meant, but I suddenly became aware that I wasexperiencing a vision. I knew that if I could wake myself up fast enough I wouldbe able to write it all down before I forgot it. I didn't want to lose Neduraagain.As I fought to regain consciousness I looked at the little wheels on the box.They were all turning. The whole field of my vision was filled with turningwheels. I opened my eyes and still saw them turning on the walls and ceiling ofmy bedroom. I reached over and turned on the lamp. I could see everything in theroom clearly, but I also continued to see thousands of turning wheelssuperimposed upon everything. I grabbed a pencil and an envelope I was using asa bookmark and quickly wrote down everything I could remember. Eventually thewheels disappeared from my vision. Before I went back to sleep I got up andturned the Fool card face down on the altar.Nedura never visited me again.2 [part0019.html#fn2] For years I tried in vain toinvoke and evoke her by chanting her crazy little song while visualizing thatoctagonal box. I've investigated her name using the Hebrew and Greek Qabalah andfailed to find anything of significance. I even tried to conjure her into aSolomonic triangle and summon her through rites of which I am forbidden tospeak—all to no avail. She remains a mystery.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0019.html#ft1] “Darbey O'Gill and The Little People” (1959), Disney BuenaVista.

Even though the Order is not obliged to function as a teaching vehicle, myinitiators suggested that I begin the programs of study and practice thatCrowley outlined in One Star in Sight1 [part0020.html#ft1] and various othertexts. This work included preliminary yogic exercises, both physical andmeditative, and the beginning rituals of ceremonial magick. I embraced the workwith great energy and passion. Today, twenty-three years later, when I look atmy magical journals of that period, I am exhausted just reading about myroutine.I rose before dawn; performed the banishing rituals of the pentagram andhexagram. I then limbered up with yoga, eleven rounds of an eleven-fold solaradoration, after which I settled into my asana2 [part0020.html#ft2] and didpranayama.3 [part0020.html#ft3] I concluded the meditation period with exercisesdesigned to increase my concentration skills, then dosed with a repeat of thebanishing rituals of the pentagram and hexagram.images [../images/00010.jpeg]Figure 1. Diary Madness. Pages from Author's diary.images [../images/00011.jpeg]I was faithful to my regimen. As the months progressed I increased the times andlevels of difficulty of my pranayama and meditation exercises,4[part0020.html#ft4] and replaced the banishing rituals with Crowley's moreadvanced Thelemic rituals.I should like to point out that my notes from this period indicate that I didnot have a clue why I was doing all these things. Still, I ploughed on andlooked anxiously forward to my next O.T.O. initiation. When it came I felt thatI was ready to cut my magick wand.The magician is armed with four fundamental weapons: the wand, the cup, thesword and the disk. These four weapons are symbolic of the powers of the greatqabalistic four-letter deity Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh. The four letters in the name are,in turn, symbolic of the four qabalistic worlds: Atziluth, the Archetypal world;Briah, the Creative world; Yetzirah, the Formative world; and Assiah, theMaterial world. These four worlds have their counterparts in the human soul;Chiah, the life force; Neschamah, the divine soul-intuition; Ruach, theintellect; and Nephesh, the animal soul 5 [part0020.html#ft5]Table 1. Attributes and Weapons of the Great Name.images [../images/00012.jpeg]Finally, all of these four-part concepts can be expressed metaphorically as thefour fundamental elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth. See Table 1[part0020.html#tab1], above.The disk is the first weapon to be constructed, for it is the foundation of themagician's career. The disk is also called the pantacle because it shoulddisplay, in symbolic language, the totality of the magician's magicalworldview-the magician's universe. Upon this universe, the magician applies thediscriminating power of intellect (the sword) in order to learn the mysteries ofGod and self (Knowledge is Power). To truly understand this power and wield itwisely, the magician must learn to listen to the counsel of the heart (cup).Finally, the magician earns the wand by realization of his or her true purpose.The wand is the Will and the Will is the supreme weapon of the magician.Even though the wand is the last weapon a magician should make, it was the firstone that I wanted. The thought of tracing my pentagrams and hexagrams with areal wand and brandishing it against pesky spirits and demons was just toopowerful an image for my poor ego to resist. I had to have that wand.Magical literature abounds with traditions concerning how the magician goesabout creating magical weapons. The wand should be of almond wood6[part0020.html#ft6] cut from a flowering tree on the day of Corpus Christi. Itshould be cut with one blow from a magick knife (which the magician must alsomake), and it should be the length of the space between the tip of the fingersand the elbow. One end of the wand should be identified somehow with the maleprinciple and one end female. Once it is straightened and dried it must bepeeled and smoothed, then wrapped in a black cloth7 [part0020.html#ft7] until itis consecrated with an elaborate ceremony. After that it is to be kept in thealtar, wrapped in a scarlet bag.That's what I wanted. The only thing standing between me and magical adeptshipwas not having that wand!My First Degree initiation had been scheduled. I knew there were two lovelyalmond trees in the backyard garden of my initiator's home. I was sure that if Iasked nicely I could cut my wand there. In the meantime I wanted to have apractice wand, so I joined a few crazy friends on a midnight raid on a backyardin Huntington Beach known to have an almond tree. It was great fn. We felt soevil. My naughty stolen practice wand looked pretty good.Finally the day of my First Degree arrived and I traveled again to Dublin to beinitiated. First Degree in the O.T.O. is symbolic of birth, and I could notthink of a more auspicious day to cut my magick wand. I was granted permissionto take it from one of the trees in the garden. I took my time and carefullyscanned the trees from top to bottom. I spotted the perfect candidate, a verystraight section about twenty inches in length. It was budding and ready toflower. About ten inches of it were very dark, as if the branch grew during acold or difficult season. Then the wood turned very light in color all the wayto the end. This light and dark feature was most attractive because it fulfilledtraditional male/female requirements.The branch was very high in the tree and to my frustration there was no ladderat hand tall enough to reach it. Grady suggested that if I stood on the very topof the ladder and used the long pruning sheers I could do it. He offered tostand on the ladder below me and support me by holding on to my belt buckle. Iwas scared to death but I gave it a try. I can still remember looking down atGrady, his hand clutching the waistband of my pants, Aleister Crowley's goldenseal ring flashing from his finger in the sunlight.I severed the branch with one blow and my prize tumbled to the garden floor.Grady helped me down and we laughed like schoolboys. This was going to be thebest magical wand in the world!Once back home I constructed a fixture out of a board and a few nails and put myprecious wand in the straightening device. It took nearly three months to dryand straighten to my liking. In the meantime I used my stolen substitute wand inall my daily rituals.Finally the wand was ready to remove from the fixture. I trimmed it and sandedit to a sensuous smoothness. I oiled it with olive oil and rubbed to a perfectpolish. I can't tell you how beautiful it was. It was dark brown to the middlethen it turned a brilliant creamy light green. I sewed a red satin bag where itwould live after its consecration. Until then, I stored it wrapped in a blackcloth.Nothing would be too good for my wand. I composed a fourteen-day ceremony ofconsecration that would begin on the evening of the new moon and climax on thefull moon in Aries (cardinal fire). I constructed the ceremony around thePreliminary Invocation of the Goetia8 [part0020.html#ft8] and it's barbarouswords of evocation.Each night after banishing and opening my living room temple, I removed the wandfrom its black wrapping and set it before a bowl of flaming alcohol in theEast.9 [part0020.html#ft9] I then recited the Preliminary Invocation andperformed the Greater Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram Fire, after which Ipassed the wand through the flames, reciting the barbarous words of evocation tocall forth the spirits of Fire. I then returned the wand to its black wrappingand banished and closed the temple.On the second night I repeated the ceremony as before, but I recited two roundsof the barbarous words, the third night three rounds, etc., until by the lastnight I found myself whipped up into quite a frenzy by fourteen rounds of thebarbarous words of evocation. Admittedly, it was a crude and unimaginativeritual, but at the time I thought it was pretty good.It is here that I must point out a curious side effect that this ritual seemedto produce. On the first night of the ceremony an irritating drip developed inour bathtub which, because of our unresponsive landlord, developed within threedays into a torrent. The irritation was compounded by the ear-splitting highfrequency hiss the bathroom pipes emitted as all this water poured out of thefaucet. While plumbing problems are hardly indicative of magical phenomena, thetiming of the event caused me to joke with Constance that in reaction to all myfire invocations, the spirits of water seemed to be attacking the house. Thewaterfall in the bathroom grew louder and more maddening throughout the entiretwo-week operation. On the seventh night a thick marine fog rolled into theneighborhood and repeated its nightly visit for three straight evenings.Finally the night of the final grand climactic consecration ceremony arrived.Each preceding night I worked myself up a little more, increasingly losingmyself in ever wilder barbarous babbling. I was really getting behind this kindof magick. On the final night, with fourteen rounds of barbarous words, I wasprepared to go all out.As usual, Constance and Jean-Paul retired to the bedroom. I set up the livingroom temple as I had done for thirteen evenings. I got out the red bag thatwould be my wand's new home from that night forward. I put on my black robe, litthe bowl of alcohol and set to work.Things were cooking. After all these nights I had everything memorized andflowing out of my mouth like Shakespeare. I could see the angelic guardians inthe quarters, I could actually feel the fire as I ripped open the veils ofspirit active and slashed the flaming pentagrams into place in the greaterinvoking ritual. By the time I began the barbarous words—AR-O-GO-GO-RU-ABRAOSOUTOU MUDORIO-I was a fire-spitting wizard with one thing on my mind, evokingthe spirits of fire into my new wand. I was having the time of my life. Irepeated the words again and again. It kept getting better—PhALARThAO OOO AEPE!Suddenly I heard what sounded like rain on the roof, falling in loud heavydrops, then splattering on the driveway. Then the font our apartment shook as agreat rushing hiss blasted against the front door. I stopped the ritual andlooked out the window to see a thick geyser of water ejaculating five feet inthe air in the middle of the driveway that separated the two rows of apartments.The main water line to the complex, a huge and ancient pipe, had burstunderground right in front of our apartment and was washing chunks of asphaltinto the street. All the neighbors were yelling and running out to see what washappening. Some had to quickly move their cars before they were swallowed by therapidly forming sinkhole.I stood there in my black hooded robe, clutching my magick wand, the living roomilluminated wildly by the flickering light of a large flaming bowl of alcohol…“My God! I can't let the neighbors see me like this!”I quickly put out the flame, got out of my robe and joined the others outside aswe waited for the Fire Department to arrive.It was nearly 1 A.M. by the time things quieted down. I figured my wand had beenconcecrated enough. I performed a banishing ritual, closed the temple and put mynewly consecrated wand in its new red bag. Already it had had quite a career. Inthe morning I would use it for the first time in my daily rituals.Three hours later my alarm went off. It was still dark. I got up, washed my faceand put on my black robe. I grabbed my new wand and put it on the living roomchair. As I did every morning, I shuffled half asleep into the kitchen and fixedmyself a short cup of coffee. A few minutes later I returned to the living roomwith my coffee and thoughtlessly sat down full force on my new wand—snapping itneatly in two.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0020.html#fn1] Magick - Book Four - Liber ABA - Appendix II by AleisterCrowley (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1997), p. 486.2 [part0020.html#fn2] My asana at that time was the Dragon, a classic Japaneseposture, kneeling with the knees and legs together and the buttocks resting onthe heels of the feet.3 [part0020.html#fn3] The ancient Hindus postulated the existence of prana, thevital life force which permeates air, water, sunlight and all living things.They further theorize that the yogi can, by mastering certain techniques ofbreath control (pranayama), increase this vital force in his or her own body andtransmit its healing energy to others.4 [part0020.html#fn4] Yes, I could sit for an ungodly length of time with ateacup filled to the brim balanced on my head without spilling a drop.

I came to theconclusion that if I didn't think this was funny I was unworthy to call myself amagician. I started to laugh. It was funny beyond funny. My laughter woke upConstance. It woke up Jean-Paul. I woke up the neighbors with my howls.I didn't even consider gluing it back together. A weapon of Will that needs tobe glued together is pretty damned pathetic. I asked my little family if theywould let me have one more night alone in the temple.That night's ritual was very simple. I banished and opened as usual. I lit thebowl of alcohol and placed the two broken pieces of my beautiful broken wand inthe flames. Once they were burning I got out my naughty stolen surrogate wandthat had served me so well the last few months. I passed it through the flamesuntil the pieces of the broken wand were completely consumed. Just before theflame flickered out I stuck the tip of my old/new wand directly upon the dyingember and uttered my only words of invocation.“Jump in there goddamn it!”images [../images/00014.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 16Evocation of Orobas1 [part0022.html#ft1]As I mentioned in the last chapter, Qabalistic tradition divides the human soulinto four parts: Nephesh (the animal soul), Ruach (the intellect), Neschamah(the divine soul-intuition), and Chiah (the life force). Because we are “createdin the image of God,” these four parts reflect microcosmically the fourqabalistic worlds that emanate from the great macrocosmic deity namedYod-Heh-Vau-Heh. In other words, my soul and your soul are miniature versions ofthe great soul of god—“as above, so below.”Theoretically, this means we all possess the same creative potential as our hugeand vaporous counterpart. However, what keeps most of us from exercising ouromnipotent prerogatives and doing god-like mischief is the unfortunate fact thatthere is a complete breakdown of communication between the four parts of oursoul.We identify almost exclusively with Ruach and try to understand everything bymeans of our intellect. We disregard life-force, Chiah (which, in the finalanalysis, is probably our real identity) because the intellect alone cannotcomprehend its profound subtlety. We are almost embarrassed when intuitiveflashes from our Neschamah momentarily loosen the grip Ruach smugly holds onobjective reality. Ruach even tries to rationalize the irrational tempests ofour primitive animal soul.Blinded by Ruach's limited scope of perception, we erroneously convinceourselves that the higher aspects of the Nephesh are simply the lusts andshortcomings of human nature. We cower in fear from the nightmarish demons ofour lower Nephesh and attempt to exile them to the infernal regions of ourpersonal (or denominational) hell, and herein lies the source of much pain andsuffering.Ironically, all four parts of the soul are already activated and fullyfunctional, yet because Ruach tyrannically monopolizes the cosmic projector, weare stuck with thinking about the cosmic adventure instead of living it.To remedy this unhealthy situation, the Eastern mystic ruthlessly assassinatesRuach and simply stops thinking. In Western ceremonial magick, however, we arenot so anxious to throw the Ruach baby out with the bath water. Instead, weritualistically encourage the four parts of the soul to talk to each other,thereby emulating the cooperation exhibited by the four interfacing qabalisticworlds (our giant counterpart). Once integrated, the parts of the soul becomethe perfect reflection of the divine world enabling the transcendent magician towield the same immense power as the creative deity.As a naive young magician, I was rudely introduced to the various parts of mysoul during my first attempt to conjure a demon to visible appearance.I had been in the O.T.O. for nearly a year and I was still unemployed. Our oldcar finally died and there was no money to replace it. Without transportation,job hunting in Southern California is almost impossible. I sold my piano and allbut one of my guitars. The rent on our tiny apartment was paid through themonth, but I had no idea where the next month's rent would come from. I stillhad a handful of guitar students who faithfully appeared once or twice a week tosurrender five dollars to listen to an hour of my stories. Only the joy of beingable to spend time with Constance and little Jean-Paul and my magical studiesafforded me distraction from the grim realities of life as a starving formerartist.Among the texts recommended for my study was the First Book of the Lemegaton,The Lesser Key of Solomon, commonly called The Goetia.2 [part0022.html#ft2]Translated in 1888 by S. L. MacGregor Mathers (under the patronage of AleisterCrowley), this curious work is one of the most famous grimoires of all time.Perhaps its most notable claim to fame is its Preliminary Invocation that waspicked up and used generically by the magicians of the Golden Dawn.The bulk of the text is a description of seventy-two fallen angels who, havingbeen tossed out of heaven for being insubordinate, are supposedly cooling theirheels in hell.The basic premise of Goetic evocation is this:A skillful magician, using his or her “God-given” authority as a human being,can summon any spirit he or she wishes and compel it to obey any demand withinits ability to perform. Some spirits are handy for destroying your enemies;others can get you a girlfriend, or discover treasure, or teach you medicine orastronomy or mathematics. (Upon reading the descriptions of this talented crewfor the first time I noted in my diary: “No wonder Western religions are sostupid. There's been a brain drain!”) The book contains detailed operatinginstructions complete with conjurations, constraints, curses (in case thespirits are uncooperative) and diagrams of each spirit's unique seal.Although the Goetia is recommended reading for beginning students, Goeticevocation is usually reserved for more adept and experienced magicians.Predictably, the thought of conjuring up a demon to help me get my material lifetogether was a very attractive prospect. I wrote my superior in the Order andtold her how absolutely awful my material affairs were and that I was thinkingseriously about evoking a Goetic spirit to help me out.She wrote back and lectured me in no uncertain terms that Goetic evocation was“low magick” and I was not ready for such an operation; that it was dangerousand reckless, and if I needed a job why didn't I just “go out and get a job?”She counseled me to continue with my yoga and preliminary magical practices andforget about evocation until I achieved Knowledge and Conversation of my HolyGuardian Angel.I knew she was right, and I certainly respected her advice. Still, it wasobvious from her letter that she did not realize how desperate I really was. Howcould I stay focused on my spiritual practices when the future of my littlefamily was at stake? I wrote her again. This time I simply asked, “Have you everperformed a Goetic evocation?”“Certainly not;” was her answer. “That's low magick.”Out of respect for my superior, I did not schedule an evocation. On the otherhand, I did not feel that I would be too recalcitrant if I hypotheticallyselected a suitable spirit and started gathering up all of the equipment andaccoutrements that would be necessary for such an evocation (should I everdecide to do it).The spirit I selected was number fifty-five on the list of spirits, Orobas. Thetext read:He is a Great and Mighty Prince, appearing at first like a Horse; but after thecommand of the Exorcist he putteth on the Image of a Man. His Office is todiscover all things Past, Present, and to Come; also to give Dignities, andPrelacies, and the Favour of Friends and Foes. He giveth True Answers ofDivinity, and of the Creation of the World. He is very faithful unto theExorcist, and will not suffer him to be tempted of any Spirit. He governeth 20Legions of Spirits.3 [part0022.html#ft3]For the life of me I couldn't see why on earth this fellow could be consideredan “evil spirit.”He gives “dignities.” Dignity was the very thing I lacked. I was in thehumiliating and undignified position of unemployment, poverty and starvation—Ineeded the “dignity” to provide adequately for my family!He gives “prelacies.” I had absolutely no idea what prelacies were, and frankly,at the time I didn't care.He gives the “favor of friends and foes:” Who couldn't use that?He gives “true answers of divinity, and of the creation of the world.” Just themagical tutor I needed for my study of the Holy Qabalah!He is “very faithful unto the Exorcist, and will not suffer him to be tempted ofany Spirit.” That did it! This guy's perfect. Not only did it look like Orobascould help me pull my life together, he could also serve as a loyal familiar whowould protect me from any nasty spirits who might want to mess with me.In short order I had nearly everything I would need to operate. I could usemasking tape to make a circle on the carpet in Jean-Paul's room. I made aposterboard triangle. Also out of posterboard, I made plaques with all the holynames I felt I would need to guard my circle. I had my almond wand and robe. Fora mitre I would use a little blue yarmulke with the name of a local Jewishmortuary stamped on the inside.4 [part0022.html#ft4] I dutifully drew twosigils5 [part0022.html#ft5] of the spirit on beautiful paper. I had my hexagramof Solomon to pin to my black robe and I had prepared an outline order ofceremony and a customized conjuration to memorize.images [../images/00015.jpeg]Figure 2. Goetic Spirit Orobas. Illustrations from Author's diary.Everything was ready except the Holy Oil, which I would need so I could anointmy head and consecrate my wand, the sigils, and other temple furniture. For somesmug reason I had convinced myself that the ceremony would be doomed to failureif I used anything other than pure Oil of Abramelin.images [../images/00016.jpeg]Figure 3. Sigil of Goetic Spirit Orobas.The recipe for this exotic and spicy unguent was first revealed in the mostinfamous of all magical texts, The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, writtenin 1458 by Abraham the Jew.6 [part0022.html#ft6] Made up primarily of purecinnamon oil (the stuff school children in my day used to soak toothpicks in andthen torture their lips and gums with its blistering fire). Olive oil and smallportions of oil of myrrh and galangal are also used in the recipe.Today Oil of Abramelin is relatively easy to purchase from specialty labs. In1976, however, you either made it yourself or were lucky enough to know someonewho could. Fortunately for me a dear friend on the East Coast sent me a smallvial of the precious fluid. I immediately tested it by rubbing the tiniest dropon the center of my forehead. Instantly my skin burned like fire and left alight pink inflammation that lasted several hours. This was the real stuff. Iwas ready to whip up demons. Predictably, my excuse for doing so was directlyforthcoming.Two of my most dependable students (one half of my weekly income) were forced tostop their guitar lessons. Within days there would not even be enough food inthe house. Things had to change, and they had to change immediately. I believedthat I was prepared to go to hell to make them change.It was shortly after 2:00 in the afternoon. I told Constance and Jean-Paul tostay in the living room while I “did some magick” in Jean-Paul's room. Icollected my weapons and laid them out on Jean-Paul's bed. I quickly taped outthe circle and laid down the divine names. I set up a small incense burner inthe triangle along with the seal of the spirit.When everything was ready, I stripped and went into the adjacent bathroom andtook a long shower while I recited the obligatory words, “Thou shalt purge mewith hyssop, O Lord! and I shall be clean: Thou shalt wash me, and I shall bewhiter than the snow.” After drying myself, I put on my robe and dutifullychanted, “By the figurative mystery of these holy vestures I will clothe me withthe armour of salvation in the strength of the Most High.” I then uncorked thevial of Oil of Abramelin and dabbed the fingers of my left hand. I anointed myalmond wand with the oil and rubbed it until it glistened with a warm evensheen. I then poured a little oil on the top of my head and put on my yarmulke.I dabbed my fingers once more in oil and anointed my forehead at the Ajnachakra.7 [part0022.html#ft7]I looked around to assure myself that everything was in place and ready. I litthe incense and stepped into the circle. I was very nervous—no, I was veryafraid. I performed the banishing rituals of the pentagram and hexagram. I wasso unfocused that I felt it necessary to do them again.I took a couple of deep breaths and tried to bolster myself with righteousself-affirmations. I wanted to convince myself, like ancient conjurers, that Ihad the divine right to do what I was doing. I repeated the short litany of mymagical mottoes and the presumptuous titles of my formal degrees and thenrecited the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia. That made me feel a littlebetter. It is a very powerful enchantment.I didn't believe it was necessary to blindly parrot the traditional conjurationsso I customized one of my own using what I considered to be the essentialformulae. It was short, much shorter than the long-winded ramblings in theLesser Key of Solomon. It incorporated the barbarous words of evocation from thePreliminary Invocation, which I repeated in four rounds, one for each elementand quarter. I had it all nearly memorized and was pleased with how it rolledoff my tongue.I unfolded my handwritten conjuration and began to recite. I recited it fourtimes, each round louder and more intense. At the conclusion of the fourth roundI was quite worked up. I looked up and gazed into the incense smoke arising fromthe triangle.Nothing happened. I repeated all four rounds of the conjuration, this time witha bit more passion. I was sweating and already starting to tire. Still nothing.I hadn't prepared a second and stronger conjuration because I knew if I had oneprepared I would be obliged to use it.I stood in the circle in my black robe that pinched my armpits and that funnylittle skullcap and stared into the empty triangle.I hated myself. I hated the whole momentum of my existence that had brought meto that ridiculous moment. I drew in an enormous breath and exhaled a sigh ofhopeless depression. I wanted to vomit but the ache was too deep to purge. Islapped the palm of my hand with the magick wand and cursed myself.“Look at you. You're a grown man with a wife and a child. You can't even feedthem. How will you pay the rent? You don't even have a car to live in. You'vesold everything; your guitars, your piano. You've no job. You've no hope. You'rean idiot! Is this the only plan you can come up with to save your family?—toconjure a genie to come rescue you? You're pathetic, you're a failure; a failurein life, now you're a failure in magick.”I started hitting my hand harder and harder.“It's your own damned fault. You're lazy! You've always been lazy. You thinkyou're so special that the world owes you everything. You want to be rich butyou can't make a dime. You dream of being famous, but what have you ever done todeserve fame? You let your music career slip through your fingers because youare too lazy to do any real work, too afraid to pay any real dues. You're aquitter. You're a loser! You've always been this way. Every chance you have everhad to make something of yourself you screwed up and blamed it on somebody else!But it's nobody's fault but yours!”I started to quiver all over like I was about to explode. I broke out in ahorrible sweat that stung every pore of my body. My scalp felt like I waswearing a cap of needles. I knew that I was having an emotional breakdown.Better here, I thought, instead of in front of Constance and Jean-Paul. I hadcome to the end of my rope. I stared blankly into the empty triangle, no longerwith any thought of conjuration, but only as a place to nail my eyes as Icrucified myself.“It's your fault! It's your fault god damn you!”The triangle became the pointed symbol of my laziness, of my stupidity, of myfailure. It was the only dear object in the room.“God damn you!”I couldn't stop staring at the little piece of card stock.“God damn you! God damn you! God damn you!”I sank to my knees and whimpered. I had never felt so awful in my whole life. Iwiped my nose on the sleeve of my robe and looked down at the disgusting silverstreak. Suddenly my self-pity turned to rage. The emotional swing was sounexpected that it nearly took my breath away. I shook the wand wildly at theaccursed triangle.For the first time in my life I had something legitimate to blame all mytroubles on—not the war, not my family, not my teachers, not my partner, or mywife, or the economy, or the government, or the church. Here at last was anobject upon which I could spew all my frustration and fear. I had trapped thefiendish devil, the source of all my ills, in a cardboard triangle and it wasgoing to listen to me. The monster was myself and my name was Orobas!I ranted for what seemed forever before I came back to myself in the circle. Iblinked and squinted through the tears and sweat and strained to see what washappening in the triangle. I didn't “see” anything, but something mostdefinitely was happening. The feeling was unmistakable. I was no longer alone inthe room. It was like waking up from an unsettling dream to discover that yourdog is just inches away from your face staring at you.I stood up and leaned forward for a better look. I was not prepared for this. Iwas only prepared for failure. The change of atmosphere in the room wasunmistakable. I was paralyzed with wonder. I completely forgot the object of theoperation. I knew without doubt the spirit was present in the triangle. I wouldsoon have to deal with it. Second by second it became more tangible. I flushedwith embarrassed confusion. It was really going to happen. I was about to meet aGoetic demon.A large drop of sweat scurried from my scalp over my forehead and dripped intomy right eye socket just below the bridge of my nose. It stung and made my eyewater. I quickly wiped both my eyes with the fingers of my left hand. Thepowerful smell of cinnamon triggered a terrifying alarm. My hand and fingerswere still covered with Oil of Abramelin! Like the biggest idiot in the world Ihad just rubbed sweat and concentrated cinnamon oil into both my eyes! A secondlater I was blinded by the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced. Itwas as though someone or something had jabbed red-hot pokers into my eyes. Itried to open one eye then the other but the air exacerbated the agony.“My God!” I thought, “This is the equivalent of a magical industrial accident.”I spun around in the circle like a wounded animal. I couldn't leave the circle.It would break every rule of Solomonic magick. But what could be worse thanthis? I knew I had to get to the shower and rinse my eyes or I might never seeagain. With my eyes squeezed tightly shut I leveled my wand in the generalvicinity of the triangle. “Stay!” I barked as if commanding a disobedient dog.“Stay there until I come back!”As I stumbled blindly toward the bathroom door the most extraordinary thingoccurred. I could see! I could see the whole scene as if I was perched somewherein the ceiling. I saw myself moving toward the bathroom door with that stupidlittle beanie on my head. I saw the circle and the divine names. I saw thecarpet, the windows, and the bed. I saw the triangle and inside the triangle, Isaw the demon Orobas—a miniature black horse standing patiently. It had analmost comic oversized head with huge round eyes. It looked bored.Under other circumstances I would have been awestruck by this clairvoyance, butit meant Jess than nothing to me. I was fighting to save my eyesight. I couldcare Jess about magick or demons or food or cars or rent or tomorrow.As I lurched passed the triangle I shook my wand at Orobas and again shouted,“Stay!” The little horse obeyed by casually kneeling first on its front kneesthen dropping its hind legs and rump to the floor.Inside the bathroom I stripped and blindly fumbled to find the cold water knobfor the shower. I stuck my face into the icy stream and tried in vain to open myeyes. I had to hold them open with my fingers. I struggled to find the soap sothat I could wash the Oil of Abramelin off my fingers. It seemed like it tookforever. I carefully held both eyelids open with the thumb and forefinger ofeach hand and rolled my eyes madly to let the cold water pour over every inch oftortured eyeball.I'm not sure how long I stood there. Eventually I was able to keep my eyes openwithout having to hold them open. I wept when I finally discovered I could see.The tears brought more relief to my eyes. The first thing I saw was my littleblue yarmulke. It must have still been on my head when I got in the shower. Itwas plugging the drain and it was slurping loudly like a straw vacuuming thelast drops of a giant milkshake. I pushed it away with my toe.Reluctantly I turned off the water and stepped out of the tub. I caught myreflection in the mirror of the medicine cabinet. I looked like a demon. The“whites” of my eyes were bright blood red and shot with scores of tinycrows-feet veins. I had huge purple bags under my eyes and strings of snot clungto my mustache and beard. My hair stuck straight up and out over my ears formingan insipid crown of dripping spikes.“Some wizard,” I thought.I reached into the tub and retrieved my magick cap. I put it back on my headwithout wringing it out. I again looked at myself in the mirror. I was wet andnaked (except for my soaking yarmulke). I started to laugh. It felt good to seemy demonic face smile. Then I really laughed—a great deep-breathed laugh thatdoubled me forward and left me hanging to the sides of the sink with both hands.I guess I had another emotional breakdown. This time it seemed like a healthydischarge of energy. It gave me a dean feeling of intense relief. I was veryanxious to get back into the circle and talk to Orobas. I put on my robe,straightened my cap, picked up my wand and went back into the temple.I didn't look into the triangle until I was back in the circle. I didn't “see”Orobas at all, but he was still there all right. I could tell because thetriangle was still heavy with the smell of cinnamon, body odor, and fear.I broke with tradition and sat down in my asana and addressed Orobas. I chose mywords very carefully and whispered them slowly and clearly. To my surprise I“heard” his replies simultaneously, as if his answers rode upon the same mentalwave that carried my words to him. Before I could finish asking him why heburned my eyes, he was already pointing out the fact that only an idiot wouldput cinnamon oil near his eyes in this heat.I had to laugh and agree. I then continued with my original outline ofquestions. I first determined if Orobas was aware of the various powersattributed to him in the book, and if so, was he capable of exercising thosepowers. The answer being in the affirmative, I commenced to itemize the detailsof my predicament and charged him with the duty of immediately doing somethingto turn around my life.“I will not presume to tell you how to go about it,” I told him. “I do notintend to micromanage you or the spirits under your command. I only want it donenow, within one hour of the end of this ceremony and you will do it withoutharming me, my family or friends or pets. Do you understand?”He indicated that he understood, but even as I was giving him his orders I wasthinking to myself how one hour isn't very much time to see some results. Whatif nothing happens? Then I'll be back in the same depressing position offailure. Perhaps I should give him a day or two to pull this miracle off—r aweek—or a month—or six months! Something will most definitely happen within sixmonths so I will be able to say to myself“It worked! Yes Lon! You're asuccessful magician!”Then I stopped myself. No! Don't listen to him. This is not me talking, it's thedamned spirit. That's how these guys operate. This imp has been counseling me mywhole life with this kind of crap. This is exactly the kind of thinking that isscrewing me up. No wonder demonic evocation has always been accompanied by talesof Faustian covenants and pacts with the devil. No! This is where it stops! Thisis my chance to break this self-destructive cycle. That is precisely the reasonI've got this little bastard in the triangle.“Be still!” I said. “One hour and I meant one hour. If you serve me well I willcarve your sigil in metal or stone that will last a thousand years, I will singthe praises of your great power and loyalty. Obey me, and I will be a kind andloving master. I will raise you spiritually even as I am raised. Help me toredeem myself and I will be the key to your redemption. But if you fail me Iwill conjure you only once more. And I will remember the pain in my eyes as Isinge your sigils in the fire.8 [part0022.html#ft8] If you are not for me, youare against me, and I will not hesitate to annihilate you utterly!”I don't know where I got the surge of righteous indignation, but this time itcame straight from the heart. The words just poured from my mouth and the entireformulae of Goetic evocation fell into place. I felt like a magical grown-up.Orobas immediately agreed. “One hour.”That was it. I had no more to say. I gave Orobas the license to depart as if Ihad recited it a thousand times. It included the standard stipulation that Icould subsequently summon him at anytime without the heroics of a full formalconjuration. I banished the temple with the Pentagram and Hexagram rituals. Iremained standing in the circle for a few minutes and waited for the “infernal”atmosphere in the room to dissipate. Orobas was gone.I took the sigil out of the triangle and wrapped it and the other talismans inlinen bags and put the triangle and divine names into a large envelope. I put mywand back into its red silk bag and changed into street clothes. I pulled up thetape circle and threw the sticky wad into the bathroom wastebasket and thenthrew every towel I could find on the bathroom floor to soak up the water. Ilooked at my reflection in the mirror. Did that really happen? My blood-red eyesconfirmed that it did.The temple was now once again just my son's bedroom. Just for good measure Irepeated the banishing rituals and opened the door to the living room. Constancewas busy in the kitchen and Jean-Paul was playing with his trucks on the livingroom floor. He looked up and giggled.“Look at Papa's eyes!”I mumbled something, then went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. It allseemed so unreal to me now. The details faded like early morning dreams when youbecome conscious of the fact that you are waking up. I stretched out on my backon the living room rug and struggled to reconstruct the chronology of events.This would have to go into my diary.I closed my eyes just for a moment and realized how exhausted I was. I wanted tofall asleep, and I was drifting toward that golden moment of surrender when thepainful roar of a mufflerless automobile shattered my peace, indeed, the peaceof the entire neighborhood. We ran to the window to see an old rusted Chevroletpulling up the driveway. It was dented in so many places and missing so muchchrome that it was impossible to tell the year or model. To our terror it rolleddirectly up to our front door and stopped. The driver gunned the engine with onelast smoky blast and turned it off.It was Mad Bob. We hadn't seen him in two years. The last we heard was that hewas in Guatemala with his girlfriend. (He hadn't written us but she did. Thelast letter from her said something like…“We just love it down here. Bob isteaching us to eat mosquitoes.”) It was just like Bob to make an entrance likethat. We were all very excited to see him.We all endured his crushing hugs in the door and tried to pull him inside. Helaughed maniacally (his trademark), but wouldn't be coaxed into a chair. Insteadhe threw his car keys at me and said, “The car's yours. Now you have to drive meback to Long Beach, I've got less than an hour to catch a ride back toGuatemala. What the f—happened to your eyes?”He didn't give me time to answer. He pushed me into the driver's side of the oldChevy and we headed out down the Pacific Coast Highway to his rendezvous in LongBeach. On the way he did all the talking, telling me about the car'sidiosyncrasies and secrets. He had me drop him off near downtown. As he got outhe looked at his watch.“Forty minutes. The old gal made pretty good time.”He pulled what looked like the pink slip for the car out of his wallet and toldme to fill it out however I wanted.“Thanks Bob. You don't know what this means to me!”He giggled. “Sure I do.”We shook hands through the passenger window and he disappeared around a corner.I took a moment and looked around my “new” car. The floorboard was missing inplaces and I could look down between my feet and see the street. Almost everyknob and door handle was missing. The horn worked; and the lights; and theradio. In the ashtray I found about sixty cents in change.On the way home I stopped at a convenience store and used the change to buy anOrange County Register and a Three Musketeers Bar for Constance. Once home Itore into the “Help Wanted” section and circled three opportunities I couldreach in my new car. I went to bed early and the next morning applied in personat all three. The third one, a medical device manufacturer, hired me on thespot.At first my new job paid a little over minimum wage but I didn't care. My firstpayday was the following Friday. We bought groceries and at the end of the monthI paid the rent. In a little over a month (as a reward for being the only personin my department dedicated enough to actually show up to work every day) theymade me lead man of my section and a month later foreman of my department. Thatposition lasted less than two months because I was promoted to the QualityAssurance lab and six weeks later asked to join the engineering department.It has been over twenty years since that first evocation of Orobas. Obviously, Iview it as a successful operation. That day was the pivotal moment of my adultlife. As a matter of fact, it was the first day of my adult life. Mad Bob's giftof a car within the prescribed one hour was the unambiguous catalyst thattriggered a chain-reaction of events that manifested everything that I demanded.Dignities—Since the evocation I have enjoyed the “dignity” of being able tosupport and care for my family. I have also been singularly fortunate in mymagical career. Within one year of the evocation I was given a great deal ofresponsibility in the O.T.O. which, over the years, has expanded considerably. Ihave tried to shoulder my duties with honor and dignity. I love the Order andconsider my membership to be the single-most important factor in my magicalreality.Prelacies—A prelacy is a church office. A bishop is a prelate. On the sameoccasion I was honored with more responsibilities in the O.T.O. I was also,quite unexpectedly, consecrated Bishop in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica, TheGnostic Catholic Church (the ecclesiastical arm of the O.T.O.). Several yearslater I was appointed Archbishop and was co-consecrated on three additionaloccasions.9 [part0022.html#ft9]Favour of friends and foes—Over the years this has been particularly helpful. Ihave discovered that, more often than not, I do not have the good sense torecognize either a friend or a foe. It's much easier to enjoy the favor of bothand not give a damn who's who.True answers of divinity, and of the creation of the world—I continue to be apassionate student of the Qabalah (at least those aspects of the Holy Qabalah ofinterest to Hermetic magicians). I have written quite a bit on the subject andcreated a tarot deck incorporating various aspects of qabalistic magick.He is very faithful unto the Exorcist, and will not suffer him to be tempted ofany Spirit—For this service I remain perpetually grateful.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0022.html#fn1] For a brief summary of this tale see Aleister Crowley'sIllustrated Goetia, by Lon Milo DuQuette and Christopher S.

In the case of my first evocation of Orobas Iwas prepared, if he failed me, to jump straight to the ultimate penalty.9 [part0022.html#fn9] This most recent consecration was at the hands of my dearfriend and brother His Grace Tau Erigia as we visited Westminster Abbey, London."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 17Evocation of Orobas—A PostscriptIt is customary in Solomonic magick for the magician to hide the charged sigilof the spirit in a secret place. No one, except the magician, should touch thesigil or even look upon it. The theory is that the magician, having beenprotected from the malice of the spirit by the circle and holy names during theinitial conjuration, remains so protected after the ceremony. However, any otherperson who may come in contact with the sigil is unprotected and totallyvulnerable to the demon's influence.After my first evocation of Orobas I put his parchment sigil in a small linenbag and put the bag inside my guitar. As I allowed no one to touch my preciousC. F. Martin D-28, I thought that it would be supremely safe there. Also, Iprobably hoped that it might attract new guitar students or recordingopportunities. Predictably, after a few weeks I forgot that I had put it thereand did not give it another thought until after it was too late.Kurt was a friend of one of my guitar students. He was a young man in his early20s and a talented woodworker. His specialty was mother of pearl and abaloneshell inlay. He showed me photographs of his work and I was very impressed. Hesaid he would like to do some custom inlay on my Martin, in exchange for guitarlessons. This was an offer I could not refuse and I greedily commissioned him toinlay an Egyptian winged solar disk on the headpiece.He told me he would need the guitar for a week. Five days later he returned withthe finished product. It was beautiful—a fabulous job. I asked if he was readyto take his first lesson, but he said he couldn't because he was going toaccompany his father to the racetrack.“Are you a race fan?” I asked.“Not until yesterday;’ he said excitedly. “My dad and I spent the whole day atSanta Anita. I just fell in love with the horses. We went down by the paddockbefore each race to get a dose look. They're so beautiful. They're like gods.When they look at me I feel like a horse!” He then whinnied like a horse.Kurt's enthusiasm was almost embarrassing. He was obsessed to the point of beingcreepy. Before he got on his bicycle to leave he said. “Oh, while I was workingon your guitar a little bag dropped out. I opened it up and saw that littleweird thing you got in there. I thought I better not mess with Lon's magickweird thing so I put it right back in the bag. It sure smells good. Hope Ididn't screw anything up.”I was stunned silent. Orobas got out. Now this guy thought he was a horse.“No.” I lied to him, “I just put it in there to make my guitar smell likecinnamon.”What could I tell him?Kurt stayed part of our magical scene for the next fifteen years, during whichtime he constructed many of our magical tools and pieces of lodge furniture.Sadly, his addiction to horseracing and other forms of gambling escalated yearby year into self-destructive behavior that eventually rendered him a socialcripple. The last time I saw him he was living in a small industrial shop—thewalls of his cell surrounded by hundreds of color photographs and posters ofracehorses.The reader may be asking at this point why I didn't conjure Orobas again andsimply command him to leave Kurt alone? I did. On numerous occasions throughoutthe fifteen years we knew Kurt I conjured Orobas on the poor man's behalf. Eachtime my charge was, “If you are responsible for Kurt's behavior leave him inpeace. If you are not the cause of his torment do what is in your power helphim.” Kurt's degeneration continued unabated.I cannot think that accidental contact with a tiny piece of parchment was thecause of Kurt's ruin. Everything we know about the addictive personalitysuggests that sooner or later he was going to get caught up in something, be itdrugs, or drink, or gambling. Though science and medicine may speculate uponphysiological causes, and psychiatry may point to childhood experiences andtrauma, and organized religion may blame man's inherent wickedness, all, in myopinion, fall pitifully short of a satisfactory explanation to the awful cursethat tormented Kurt.As I said in the introduction to this book, Magick is an art. If science,medicine, and religion cannot really answer these questions, why can't we bepoetic when considering such mysteries and our inability to understand them?Perhaps the chemical imbalance in Kurt's blood—perhaps his mother's coldrejection—perhaps the monstrous doctrines of guilt and self-hatred heaped uponhim year after year from the pulpit—perhaps all these things united in adiabolical marriage that gave birth to an evil spirit—a demon horse who escapedits wizard just long enough to gallop madly into the vulnerable soul of a weakand tragic human being."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00004.jpeg]CHAPTER 18Israel Regardie and the Exorcism of GarkonEarly in 1980 I secured a comfortable position as a laboratory technician at yetanother medical device laboratory. I was very lucky to work for a dear woman whowas absolutely fascinated with my extra-curricular magical activities. Onemorning she burst into the lab and gushed, “Lon, pick up line two. It's a Dr.Regardie and he wants to speak to Bishop DuQuette.”Israel Regardie was my hero, a true adept and a living page of magical history.He was Aleister Crowley's secretary and student in the 1920s and later went onto rend the veil of the Golden Dawn with his controversial publication of itsceremonies and teachings. His books are the indispensable core of everyEnglish-speaking magician's library. He lived about sixty miles away in StudioCity. Constance and I had been introduced to him a few years earlier by GradyMcMurtry, the Caliph of the O.T.O. I had met with him only twice since then andwe exchanged a few letters concerning a peculiar project dear to both of us.1[part0024.html#ft1]This phone call was obviously a joke. Regardie had a playfully twisted sense ofhumor. A few weeks earlier he had donated a box of books to Heru-ra-ha Lodge andI was sure he was calling to tell me he had more.“Lon, this is Francis Regardie. Dear boy, I hope I haven't gotten you fired.” Hedidn't mean it.“Oh, everyone here knows I'm crazy.” I didn't mean it.“I was wondering if you could do me a bit of a favor. I need a bishop. As I'msure you know, it takes a bishop to order an exorcism.”Now I really knew he was joking. I solemnly deepened my voice in mock virility.“Why yes Doctor, of course, naturally. How many exorcisms shall I put you downfor?” I smiled and winked at my boss.My smile quickly faded as I realized that he was not joking. A it turned out apsychiatrist friend of his was treating a patient who was convinced that sheneeded a formal exorcism. The woman was knowledgeable enough to know thatclassic exorcisms must be performed under the direct auspices of a bishop withlegitimate apostolic lineage.“Your line is as good as any and I'm sure we can't get a Christer to cooperateon such short notice. Of course, she just needs a show. I thought you might knowsomeone in your lodge who can give her one.”I couldn't believe he was asking me to do this. I giggled nervously and mumbledsomething.“It's really quite sad actually. If you're up to it, you will need to talk withher doctor, do you have a pencil?”Before I had the presence of mind to protest or ask any more questions hedictated the name and number of a Dr. Kaufman in Long Beach. Before I hung up Ireminded him that he, too, was a Wandering Bishop and asked why he didn'tarrange the exorcism.“I just did. Do tell me how it goes.” He hung up.A few minutes later I called Dr. Kaufman. She was a pleasant sounding woman whowas very serious about scheduling an exorcism. Regardie had been her Reichiantherapist and she admired him passionately. Although she made it quite dear shedid not believe in demons and spirits other than as psychological metaphors, shewas familiar with the fundamentals of Hermetic thought and respected itspotential in modern therapy. I didn't need to ask any questions. She startedtalking and was very candid.The subject was a 38-year-old woman named Sharon. Her husband had recentlycommitted suicide and she was left with three children ranging in ages from 11to 16.When she was 2 years old her stepfather began sexually molesting her on aregular basis. Early on in this monstrous cycle of abuse, Sharon created amake-believe guardian, a friendly dragon named Garkon, who came and deliveredher to happy places while her little body was being violated. He helped hersurvive her nightmarish existence, and for years this double life kept herrelatively sane. As she grew older, however, her champion's character began tochange.Shortly after she started school and began noticing boys, Garkon's rescues werespiked with random acts of petty cruelty; a sharp dragon nip on the tummy or anill-tempered scratch on her face. Ironically, Sharon felt that she deservedthese little punishments and suffered them gladly, for without question herfantasy life with Garkon was infinitely preferable to the nightly visitationsfrom her stepfather.The years of abuse finally ended when she was 14. Her stepfather lost his headcompletely in a skillful display of physical contortion requiring the use of thekitchen table, the big toe of his right foot and a ten-gauge shotgun That nightwhen Sharon went to bed she dared to fantasize a new life free of the horrors ofher early childhood. She would no longer need Garkon to rescue her, indeed,Garkon was a reminder of everything she wanted to forgetBut Garkon did not go away. The next night he swept into Sharon's bedroom. Hehad grown to an enormous size and lost all vestiges of his old friendlycountenance. He boasted that he had eaten her stepfather's head and vowed thatno man would ever hurt her again.“The dynamics are pretty simple,” Dr. Kaufman said. “He torments her cruellywhenever any factor of sexuality enters a life equation.”In high school she avoided the dating scene altogether and concentrated on herstudies. She married in her junior year of college, but because she could neverenjoy lovemaking without arousing Garkon's wrath, the marriage was predictablyan unhappy one. The ordeal of conceiving and bearing children was excruciating.She nearly died during each of her three pregnancies. She was perpetuallynauseous and often lost consciousness. After the birth of her third child, sheand her husband ended their sexual relationship altogether and for ten yearsGarkon slumbered.The truce was shattered when Sharon's husband committed suicide after a businessfailure. Many old issues from her childhood resurfaced, including Garkon. Thistime she resolved not to face the problem alone. She sought out psychologicalcounseling.This act of spiritual independence enraged Garkon who, now sensing the danger tohis very existence, was escalating his attacks and making Sharon's lifeunbearable. She contemplated suicide {an idea that Garkon wholeheartedlyendorsed). Instead she settled on the idea of an exorcism.2 [part0024.html#ft2]Her psychologist would have none of it and referred her to Dr. Kaufman, thinkingthat at least a psychiatrist could prescribe appropriate medication. Dr. Kaufmanresisted drug therapy but was willing to explore exorcism as a psychodramaticexercise.I didn't know what to say. The story was very compelling. Dr. Kaufman seemedanxious that I appreciate the psychological significance of Sharon's“possession” and was patient enough to keep pointing out how all this wasperfectly understandable from an analytical point of view.I really wanted to help, but this was serious stuff. I could barely keep my owndemons from eating me. I certainly did not feel equipped to exorcise such aformidable psychic entity from someone else. Still, it seemed as if the wholeuniverse (and my magical hero) had conspired to put me in the middle of thissituation. I thought for a moment who I might know among my eccentric andbohemian cronies who was knowledgeable enough (and crazy enough) to be myexorcist. The answer came to me immediately.“I know who can do it if he will agree. When do you want this done?”“Tonight,” Dr. Kaufman answered as though she was sure I should have alreadyknown that, “at my home in Long Beach.”Nathan Sanders was an O.T.O. Brother and the most experienced Goetic magician Ihad ever met. He was the former student of Carroll (Poke) Runyon, the legendarymaster of the art of evocation.3 [part0024.html#ft3] Using classic andflawlessly memorized conjurations, Nathan could summon anything into histriangular black mirror, and his evocations were not limited to the seventy-twospirits of the Goetia. I had seen him conjure to visible appearance angels,elementals, and even historical and fictional characters.4 [part0024.html#ft4]He was truly an extraordinary magician and I was sure if anyone could makeGarkon appear it was Nathan. (I guess I assumed he could also make him go away.)A I expected, Nathan was only too happy to answer the Bishop's call and assumethe role of exorcist. I called Dr. Kaufman again and told her the exorcism wason. Because of the distances involved it was nearly 10:00 P.M. before Nathan andI knocked at her door. We would have arrived an hour earlier, but our travel washindered by a thick coastal fog.5 [part0024.html#ft5]Dr. Kaufman greeted us cordially and apologized for the way the house smelled.“We've had a difficult evening. Since I told Sharon we were doing this tonight,she hasn't been able to hold down any food. She lost her 7UP when she heard youknock.”Nathan and I did our best to appear unmoved and professional. Personally, Iwanted out of there.“Perhaps we should do this another time,” I eagerly suggested.“No, I expected worse actually. Garkon obviously doesn't want to say goodbye.”She led us into the kitchen and introduced us to Sharon, who was sitting at thetable with a can of soda and a cigarette in her hand. She was an attractivewoman in jeans and a gaily-patterned ski sweater. Her complexion was pasty andshe wore dark glasses that hid dark circles under her eyes. She thanked us forcoming and asked what she would need to do. Nathan said he would like to firstask her a few questions. She agreed.I was somewhat surprised by his questions. The first one seemed downright rude.He asked her if she was “addicted” to fantasy literature. Sharon smiled andsaid, “Why, yes, I guess I am.”He then asked details about Garkon's appearance-his shape, his color, did heever color change, number of fingers, toes, eyes. Lastly, he asked her how tospell Garkon's name. On his notepad he carefully inscribed the letters ofGarkon's name in Hebrew.“Knowing the name of the spirit is the key to controlling the spirit.” Nathan'sdelivery was dramatic and effective. “Bishop DuQuette is going to take theseletters and construct the spirit's magical signature using a Kamea of Saturn.6[part0024.html#ft6] We'll then draw this sigil on the back of these pentagramtalismans. In the ceremony each of us will wear one around our neck to link usto the spirit and remind him that we are his masters.”Nathan was assuming an awful lot when he announced I was going to do all of thesigil drawing. Fortunately for Bishop DuQuette's reputation, the magick squareof Saturn (3x3—the smallest and simplest of all the planetary kameas) was theonly one I could draw from memory. I whipped out those sigils like I knew what Iwas doing.That was it for the interview. We spent the next half-hour bringing things infrom the car. In addition to his beautifully constructed break-down magicalcircle and the triangular black mirror, we brought four black robes and everymagical tool a well-equipped Solomonic magician would need: wand, sword, lamp,white-handled knife, black-handled knife, brass box of torment, talismans, holywater, salt, oil of Abramelin, incense, and candles.Nathan told Dr. Kaufman and me to wash our hands and faces before robing up. Asfor himself, he would take a shower. When he reappeared from the bathroom he wasdecked out in his full magical regalia. I have to admit he looked every inch anexorcist.He then presented Sharon the robe she would wear in the ceremony and instructedher to also shower and wash her hair thoroughly. It was nearly midnight beforeshe came out of the bathroom. She had towel dried her hair and she looked like afrightened little girl.There wouldn't be room for all of us in the circle of art, so we created a largeouter circle with a length of clothesline. Sharon would stand in the centralcircle holding two lighted tapers. The triangular black mirror was placedoutside of both circles and positioned so that she could easily see thereflection of her own face illuminated by the candles. Nathan, also in thecentral circle, stood directly behind her. He would be the “operator” and shethe “receiver.” Dr. Kaufman and I were to stand in the outer circle on eitherside and slightly behind Sharon. We all had our sigil/pentagram talismans aroundour necks and a parchment hexagram of Solomon pinned to the skirt of our blackrobes.Nathan then ran through a quick checklist of items to see if all was inreadiness. Was the phone off? Were the doors locked? Were the pets outside? Didanyone need to pee? When he was satisfied, he lit the two candles in Sharon'shands, and turned out all the lights. Before entering the circle to begin theceremony he unwrapped a tiny cake of hotel soap and with it drew a large versionof Garkon's sigil in the center of the black mirror. This act made Sharon gaspsharply as if someone had seized her throat. I was no longer nervous, I wasafraid.“Your Grace, would you be so kind as to banish the temple by the rituals of thepentagram and hexagram?” This was another one of Nathan's kind gestures to makeit appear that I was needed. I didn't mind. At least it was something simple Icould do to be helpful. After I banished, Nathan performed brief cleansing andconsecration ceremonies and formally declared the temple open. He asked Sharonto take several deep breaths, relax and gaze at her reflection in the triangle.He then began to recite the classic conjuration of the Goetia.I do invocate and conjure thee, 0 Spirit, Garkon; and being with power armedfrom the Supreme Majesty I do strongly command thee…Nathan used a special voice for his conjurations. It was lower and stronger thanhis natural voice, but gave no hint of artificial affectation. His words rodesmoothly upon two or three notes. Whenever the text ran into pockets of bizarreand unintelligible names and words he linked them smoothly into a sonorousstring almost as if they were one long master word of unspeakable power.…by Beralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachia, and Apologiae Sedes; by the mostPowerful Princes, Genni, Liachidae, and Ministers of the Tartarean Abode; and bythe Chief Prince of the Seat of Apologia in the Ninth Legion, I do invoke thee,and by invocating conjure thee.All the while he conjured he held his wand high and drew angelic sigils in theair above Sharon's head.And being armed with power from the Supreme Majesty, I do strongly command thee,by Him Who spake and it was done, and unto whom all creatures be obedient…He wasn't through the first section when Sharon started to weave back and forthand let out short pitiful sobs. Nathan went on but was soon drowned out bySharon's whimpering. He continued louder and louder.By all the names of God, Adonai, El, Elohim, Elohi, Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh, Zabaoth,Elion, jah, Tetragrammaton, Shaddai, Lord God Most High, I do exorcise thee anddo fully command thee, O thou spirit Garkon, that thou dost forthwith appearunto us here before this Circle in a fair human shape, without any deformity ortortuosity…Sharon was now thrashing from side to side sobbing uncontrollably. I was certainshe was faking. She'd seen too many movies, I thought. I was embarrassed forher, embarrassed for all of us. The noise and commotion were too much forNathan. He stopped reciting the conjuration and simply shouted at Sharon “Is thespirit in the triangle?”“Yes!” Sharon screamed angrily. “He's always been there!”When I heard those words, I knew she was not acting. I felt the hair on the backof my head spring to attention. The atmosphere in the room seemed to collapseunder a crushing wave of primitive malice. I was petrified.Sharon dropped her hands forward, spilling hot wax down the front of her robeand onto the carpet. I stepped forward and lifted her hands back into position.When I touched her arms, they were as hard as rock. Her wrists and hands wereswollen to such a degree that her fattened fingers could barely close around thecandlesticks. I stole a quick glance at her face. It was bright red and hercheeks so puffed up that her eyes were nearly pinched shut.With the tip of his wand Nathan poked me back to my station and commenced toaddress the spirit. Even in this chaotic environment he calmly welcomed Garkonand praised him for all his years of service to Sharon when she was a littlegirl. He then explained that Sharon was now grown up and that his actions werehurting her.Sharon stopped crying and began to let out an extended monotone howl of the word“no:’ She held the note until her breath was exhausted. As she pushed the lastair from her lungs she induced a cycle of coughing that eventually led toretching spasms of dry heaves. Dr. Kaufman and I had to take the candles awayfrom her. Nathan shouted at her. “Look into the triangle! Is Garkon in thetriangle? Tell me what he is saying:”“Oh yes!” Sharon hissed with venomous sarcasm. “He's laughing at you!”It soon became clear that Garkon could not be drawn into dialogue. The spirit'sonly response was to create terror and then feed on that terror. He was doing avery good job. Poor Sharon bobbed up and down like a caged monkey shifting fromfoot to foot as she gawked open-mouthed at the triangle. From where I stood itappeared that she no longer had a neck. Her shoulders had risen and becomesquared. I remember thinking that it looked like she had put on her robe with acoat hanger still in it.Nathan tried once more to reprogram Garkon to become a supportive familiar butGarkon would have none of it. The response was always the same-more paininflicted upon Sharon.“Then, if you refuse to help her you will no longer be allowed to hurt her!”Nathan popped the cork on the crystal vial of holy water and shook it—first uponSharon and Dr. Kaufman and me, then upon the triangle itself.Now, O Garkon, since thou art still pernicious and disobedient; I do in thename, and by the power and dignity of the Omnipresent and Immortal JehovahTetragrammaton do bind thee in the depths of the Bottomless Abyss.He emptied the vial of holy water over Sharon's head, then ripped the parchmenttalisman bearing Garkon's sigil from around her neck. He reached to where Istood with the lighted candle and passed the talisman through the flame.I conjure thee, O fire, by him who made thee and all other creatures for good inthe world, that thou torment, burn, and consume this Spirit Garkon, foreverlasting.He then allowed the talisman to catch fire and held it until it was almostconsumed. He tossed the last flaming fragment in the air. It burned completelyout before it reached the floor. I was very impressed.I hereby communicate thee, and destroy thy name and seal and burn thee in theimmortal fire and bury thee in immortal oblivion.Predictably, Sharon howled and babbled. Nathan then stepped between her and themirror and from the confines of the circle he hurled a black doth at thetriangle. It snagged the uppermost point and fell to cover the entire surface ofthe mirror. He turned Sharon away from the triangle and gently helped her to thefloor. He raised his wand and aimed it at the covered mirror.Christeos cormfa peripsol amma ils!Let the company of heaven curse thee!Christeos ror, graa, tofglo aoiveae amma ils!Let the sun, moon, and all the stars curse thee!Christeos luciftias od tofglo pir peripso amma ils, pujo ialprg ds apila, odpujo mir adphahtl!Let the light and all the Holy Ones of Heaven curse thee, unto the burning flamethat liveth forever and unto the torment unspeakable!Nathan sat down beside Sharon and put his arms around her. We all remainedsilent for what seemed like a long time. He then helped her to her feet andshowed her the mirror.“That's it;” he said cheerfully. “All gone. You'll never be this embarrassedagain. Thank you for not throwing up on my robe.”Sharon laughed and hugged him. We all laughed and hugged“Your Grace, will you do the honors?” Nathan really enjoyed his role asexorcist. He had done a fantastic job. I was so proud of him—so proud of all ofus. I quickly performed the banishing rituals of the pentagram and hexagram,after which Nathan dosed the temple. The entire ceremony took a little less thanan hour.We were all in high spirits. Dr. Kaufman told Sharon that during the ceremonyshe had blown up like a blimp. I was relieved to learn that I wasn't the onlyone to notice the phenomenon. Dr. Kaufman apologized for forgetting to tell methat for years Sharon's joints swelled dramatically during Garkon's attacks. Infact it was these physical manifestations that first attracted her to the case.It was two weeks before I heard back from Dr. Kaufman. In her opinion theoperation was a success. Garkon seemed to be out of Sharon's life, and she wasmaking progress on all other levels of her therapy.I called Nathan and we crowed like self-congratulatory cocks. I then calledRegardie and tried not to sound too excited. He said that he had already talkedwith Dr. Kaufman and she had praised us “to high heaven.” He was happy that itworked out but he cautioned me about celebrating prematurely. His parting wordsleft me a bit uneasy.“The law of conservation of energy applies to magick as well as physics. Ourfriend may not have been destroyed, he may have just moved along to the nearestcenter of least resistance.”This was the last time Regardie and I spoke. Two years later I would receiveanother call from Dr. Kaufman and a new lesson in the conservation of energy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0024.html#fn1] As we both had collections of letters from individualsclaiming to be incarnations of Aleister Crowley, I suggested we pool our storiesand publish them as Liber Nutz.

Sharonfinished her master's degree and is now a Ph.D. candidate at UCLA. No, Sharon'sdoing great. There's been a family tragedy, though. Her son Robert committedsuicide day before yesterday and the two girls are taking it pretty hard.”This didn't sound like anything that should involve the esoteric theatrics ofBishop DuQuette's traveling demon show. I voiced my sadness and asked Dr.Kaufman to relay my sympathy. I knew etiquette now demanded I say somethinglike…“Is there anything I can do to help?” but I resisted the temptation to be agentleman. I could feel Dr. Kaufman waiting for me to say it and for severaluncomfortable moments we remained locked in a showdown of silence.“Lon, maybe you can give me some advice.”Oh god! I didn't know what was coming but I knew I wasn't going to like it.“Alex, Sharon's oldest girl, believes her brother's ghost is having sex withher.”Why did I answer the phone? I sat down and pushed off my shoes. “Go on.”The story she related was every bit as bizarre and gruesome as Sharon'spossession. In fact, as Dr. Kaufman unfolded the details I couldn't help butview the scenario from a magical perspective and the conclusions I drew made mesick at heart.For nearly their entire lives Sharon's three children were forced to grow upwith a suicidal father and a mother who was perpetually on the brink of madness.In this unwholesome environment they had only themselves to turn to foremotional support. As bright kids, they soon discovered what keys to turn andwhat buttons to push to exploit their dysfunctional parents. In a nutshell, aslong as mom and dad were crazy the kids got anything they wanted out of them.Their father's suicide and their mother's liberation from Garkon changed all ofthat almost overnight. Sharon now had her life back and was not about to returnto the old insane patterns, including allowing herself to be manipulated bythree disturbed and very spoiled children.The two oldest, Robert (now 18) and his sister Alex (now 16) acted out theirfrustration in grand style by publicly flaunting their heretofore-secretincestuous relationship. Their reputations ruined at school, Robert enlisted inthe Air Force and Alex plunged headlong into nymphomaniacal promiscuity.After less than a month of basic training, Robert went AWOL and came home. Inone last attempt to bring Sharon back into line he accidentally hanged himselfin the garage in what the coroner called a “failed mock suicide attempt.” Forthe two days and nights since her brother's death Alex had been violentlymasturbating in her room “smothered,” as she moaned, “in Robert's embraces.”I really didn't want to get involved in this one, but really had very littlechoice in the matter. I called Nathan who reluctantly agreed we should go and atleast banish the house. I also invited Deborah Weiner, a mutual friend andgifted clairvoyant.At Sharon's home we asked first to see the garage where Robert died. To ourshock and utter disgust the area had not been touched since the body had beenremoved. The remains of the severed rope still draped from the ceiling beam andthe floor was still covered with the foul contents of the poor boy's bowels.We then toured the rest of the house including Robert's bedroom. His bed wasstill unmade and his unwashed laundry was strewn all over the floor. The threeof us huddled for a few minutes and decided the first thing that needed to bedone was to rid the house of everything to which the shell of a confused andrecently disembodied person might be attracted. The first things to go would bethe filthy sweat-soaked clothes to which the throbbing residue of his vitalessences still clung like Spanish moss. Barbara said there was enough astralchum in the air to build the bodies of fifty ghosts.We cleared out his room completely and piled all of his dirty clothes, hisbathroom towels and his sandy wet-suit on the floor of the garage. We thenproceeded to ceremonially banish and cleanse every room in the house except thegarage. Our plan was to lure Robert out of the house and concentrate him in thegarage. Before we dealt with Robert in the garage however, we needed to talkwith Alex.Alex behaved as if she didn't want to be banished, or exorcised, or bothered. Werespected her wishes. She did allow us to banish and cleanse her room, andbefore we left her she cooperated in a little ceremony Nathan had devised. Hetied one end of a length of string around a portrait of Robert and the otheraround Alex's waist. He then gave her a pair of scissors and asked her if shecould cut the string. She said she could and proceeded to do so.Our last duty was in the garage and included (along with a lot of bell ringing)the supreme banishing rituals of the pentagram and hexagram and the wholespectrum of Golden Dawn purification and consecration ceremonies.Sharon thanked us and vowed that she would get rid of everything in the garagethe next day. As we shook hands I realized that Regardie was right. Garkon hadjust moved along to the nearest center of least resistance. I didn't want toknow where the law of conservation of energy would send him from here."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 20Enochian Spirits—First Worshipper, Friendly VisitThe lodge was growing steadily and the new members were understandably anxiousto meet and study magick. I scheduled a weekly class in our home and beganorganizing my thoughts concerning the fundamentals of magick. It was finallysinking in that there were some people in the world who actually knew less aboutthe subject than I.The class was attended by some very bright people1 [part0026.html#fn1] and inshort order I realized that in order to stay one jump ahead of them I was goingto have to study very hard and be resourceful. By the time we mastered thepentagram and hexagram rituals, and had consecrated our elemental weapons, itwas clear I was going to have to come up with something dramatic. I combed myGems from the Equinox2 [part0026.html#fn2] for something exotic and differentand turned to Liber Chanokh: A Brief Abstract of the Symbolic Representation ofthe Universe Derived by Doctor john Dee Through the Skrying of Sir EdwardKelley.3 [part0026.html#fn3] It was full of magick squares, charts, diagrams,and a series of “Calls” in a strange angelic language. If the class wantedexotic, this certainly looked like it. At our next meeting I announced that wewould soon begin a six-week Enochian Magick workshop.images [../images/00018.jpeg]Author (with shaved head) with noted diabolist S. jason Black.At the time the material in Gems and Regardie's Golden Dawn4 [part0026.html#fn4]was the only information I had on the Enochian system. I read through the textsseveral times and came to the conclusion that I would understand the materialbetter if I constructed the various pieces of Enochian equipment. These consistprimarily of four Elemental Tablets, one each for Fire, Water, Air, and Earth,and one smaller Tablet of Union (or Spirit Tablet). Each Elemental Tablet iscomposed of 156 truncated pyramids. Each pyramid (or square) is lettered on topand each of the four sides is colored to represent an element, planet, orzodiacal sign.Each pyramidal square is home to an angel or spirit whose characteristics aredetermined by the specific elemental mix as indicated by the colors on itssides. The letter on the top of the pyramid is the angel's name (or a letter inthe name of a larger angel).For example: if a pyramid lettered “A” is colored yellow (Air) on two sides andblue (Water) on the two other sides, it houses an elemental being named “A”whose character and scope of intelligence is defined by (and limited exclusivelyto) the elemental “natures” of Air and Water. Using the classic elemental imagesof the Kerubic beasts (Lion=Fire; Eagle=Water; Human=Air; and Bull=Earth)5[part0026.html#fn5] angel “A” could be symbolically represented as a sphinx witha man's head and body (for Air) and an eagle's wings and legs (for Water).Obviously, such an elemental spirit would have a very narrow range of duties inthe universe. On the material plane, these duties might regulate the behavior ofdouds or mists. In the human psyche they may play a specific part in thedynamics of our emotional life.Then let's say that right next to angel “A” lives angel “B” who is half Earth(black or green) and half Fire (red). Angel “B” would naturally have drasticallydifferent characteristics than angel “A”. (Using Kerubic images it would havethe head and body of a bull (Earth) with the paws and legs of a lion (Fire).Keeping this in mind we see that each Enochian Elemental Tablet has, first ofall, 156 angels with one-letter names, and very specific attributes andresponsibilities in the universe. However, we do not stop here. Enochianelemental spirits are modular. They fit together just like the elements fittogether in infinite combinations and ratios to create the phenomenal universe.Angel “A” can join with its neighbor angel “B” to create angel “AB” whosecharacteristics are more complex than either “A” or “B” alone. Angel “AB” inturn can join with other squares to form bigger and even more intricate beings,etc.The more I learned about the Enochian system, the more thrilled I became at itsdivine perfection. The laws that dictate the ordering of the elements and theorganization of the squares are examples of Hermetic logic at its most sublime.The class was enthralled. Most members set to work painting their own set oftablets. As complex as the process appears to be at first, the simple act ofcoloring the tablets makes the method-to-the-madness easy to understand. In themeantime, I was determined to build a full set of three-dimensional Enochiantablets. (Up until this time Enochian magicians simply drew the pyramids on aflat surface.) I mentioned my plan to Dr. Regardie who counseled stronglyagainst it. “They're dangerous enough when they're flat!” he cautioned. “Don'tgive them dimensional elbow room.”As much as I respected the good doctor I really didn't see how it would hurt tofully manifest the tablets in 3D. In fact, I thought, maybe the reasonRegardie's Enochian spirits were so crabby was because he had them all squishedinto those flat tablets.I commissioned Kurt, who owned a table saw, to cut 644 wooden truncated pyramidswith one-inch bases. I bought sandpaper, sealant and acrylic paints. As soon asthe pyramids were cut I went to work like a man possessed. I got up early in themorning to sand, seal, and paint. I became totally engrossed in the project.Time lost all meaning to me. Each morning I found myself arriving at my joblater than the morning before. The tablets were all I could think about. Eachday I stole away from work a little earlier so I could get home to sand, seal,and paint. Soon I was sanding and sealing and painting all day long because I nolonger had a job to distract me. I didn't care. The tablets were indescribablybeautiful. I was so proud. I finished the small Tablet of Union first, then theElemental Tablet of Earth. I couldn't wait until the other tablets werefinished. I was determined we would try out the Earth tablet at the next class.Up until this point, my only experiences with spirit evocation had been of theGoetic/Solomonic variety. I did not have a clue what to expect from an Enochianworking, and I was particularly unsure how to proceed in a group setting.Mercifully, there was no ambiguity about the technical procedures. Templeopenings, Enochian Calls, and the angelic hierarchies were all laid out quitedearly in Liber Chanokh. I performed a series of experimental evocations (aKerub from each of the four tablets) before retiring on four consecutive nights.I made note of my dreams and concluded that this kind of work was harmless andeffective.For our first evocation session I decided we would work as Dee and Kelley did.One person would act as seer, and one as operator. The seer would recite theappropriate call, receive the vision and communicate it during or after thesession. The operator would banish, open and dose the temple, and question theseer. I would be the operator, but I did not know who in our little class wouldbe the first to sit in the visionary driver's seat. On class night there wasonly one rather reluctant volunteer.David P. Wilson was not new to the world of magick. In the years leading up tohis affiliation with our lodge he sat in with a host of magical groups andworkshops in the Los Angeles area upon whom he later heaped scorn and ridiculebecause of their inability to show him “real magick.” He was the boldest memberof the class, also the most impatient and sarcastic. I could see the Enochianclass going down in flames on opening night because David the curmudgeon onceagain “saw nothing!” He had done none of the preliminary Enochian work with therest of the class. He hadn't painted a set of tablets or studied any of thecalls. Still, he was our only volunteer.I can't recall why, but I decided we would to try to contact LAIDROM, the MarsSenior6 [part0026.html#fn6] of the Elemental Tablet of Earth. In the spirit ofbetter safe than sorry, we placed the Earth tablet in the South(Capricorn/Cardinal Earth) and enclosed the entire class in a circle cast with aclothesline cord. I banished with the rituals of the lesser and greaterpentagrams and hexagrams, then opened the temple and invoked the hierarchicalnames as indicated in Liber Chanokh. David was seated on the floor at thesouthern edge of the circle just inches away from the Earth tablet. Leaningagainst the wall behind the tablet was a huge cardboard version of the Tablet ofEarth that I placed there for the other members of the class to focus upon. Iturned on the tape recorder and gave David a copy of the Call to read. I satdown behind him while he read it aloud.He did rather well considering he had never read it before. When he was finishedhe closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Nothing happened. I asked him to readthe Call again. He did so and after only a few seconds he said, “I have alandscape. I see a landscape.”I was relieved beyond words. “What does it look like?”David proceeded to describe in surprising detail a desert vista of flat,trackless white crystalline powder stretching to the horizon. Great gray columnsof volcanic rock towering over the plane broke the monotony of the scene.Between the columns the ground was pockmarked with countless gaping pits.That was it. Nothing else was occurring. I asked him to read the call a thirdtime. This time there was movement. From out of a pit in the center of his fieldof vision arose a black cone. He said it sparkled from the inside and upon itssurface with thousands of little sparks that jumped from one star to another.I asked, “Is this LAIDROM?”David grabbed his pencil and notepad and quickly scribbled something. I lookedat what he had drawn. It looked like four very poorly drawn Enochian letters. Atthe time it meant nothing to me. I asked for a clearer answer. “Is thisLAIDROM?”“It's him! It's him! I see him.”He described a humanoid figure draped in the same material from which the conewas constructed. He had an egg-shaped head but no face. His hands were likemittens—there were no fingers. He reached his arm toward the ground and “drew” adiagram in the sand in front of him. David quickly copied the figure on thenotepad. It was a square divided diagonally by two lines with a small circle inthe lower left-hand corner. We took this to be LAIDROM's signature.We were all very excited. It was as if the entire class saw David's vision inour mind's eye. Then it occurred to me. Now that we've got this guy, what thehell are we to do with him?Before I could think of what to do next, David said, “Lon, I feel like…l feel…lcould make strange sounds.”This was a twist. “Let yourself.” I told him. “Go with it.” I tried to soundcalm.“Naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayeff…this is bullshit!”“No! Relax let it happen!”“I mean it, I feel like an idiot. I'm too…zil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arpnan-ta…(inaudible)…ef…efee thar-zi. I am sorry. That's all. Nothing like thishas ever happened before. I just felt like doing it.” David's apology wascomical. We all broke into nervous giggles.It had been quite an evening. As we had planned nothing particular to do withLAIDROM I thought it wise to quit while we were ahead. I asked David to thankour spirit guest for his visit and proceeded to banish and close the temple.One of the class members had brought along his Enochian Dictionary7[part0026.html#fn7] and suggested we try to use it to see if David's strangebabbling actually meant something. I rewound the tape and played it back fromthe beginning. Everything was crystal clear right up to the time of LAIDROM'sappearance, when the tape developed an irritating distortion. We joked that itwas the fault of malicious spirits and expected it to soon clear up. It did not.In fact by the time the tape reached David's babbling we could hardly pick hisvoice out from behind the bank of white noise. As soon as the good stuff wasover the distortion suddenly stopped.Noise notwithstanding, after replaying the section of tape a dozen times or morewe picked up enough of what was being said to write down three audible stringsof syllables:naw-n tahelo hoh athayzo raygayeff.zil-zi-anzilzi-lo-da-arp nan-ta…(inaudible) andef…efee thar-zi.Starting at the beginning we painstakingly played with the phonetics of eachword (and the word/words following) and attempted to match them with words inthe Enochian Dictionary. Obviously we weren't being very scientific, nor Iconfess, very objective. This was all very exciting and romantic and I am surethat night we would have squeezed some profundity out of any string of sounds.Be that as it may, it took less than an hour to break the sounds up as follows:Nanta, elo Hoath zorge ef.—Which translated neatly to: “Spirit of Earth, firstworshiper friendly visit.”Zil zien—“Stretch forth hands.”Zilodarp Nanta—“Stretch forth and conquer Spirit of Earth.”Ef etharzi—“Visit in peace.” Needless to say we were all very impressed. At the end of the evening it wasagreed that from then on class would meet two times a week to pursue Enochianmagick. Sadly, David's ability to break spontaneously into the Enochian languagewould diminish rapidly as his familiarity with the language of the Callsincreased. After the fourth or fifth session he lost the ability completely. Hisvisions, on the other hand, became clearer, more informative, and moreprovocative.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0026.html#ft1] My role as class master was more as host and moderator.Several members of class were already far more knowledgeable than I in astrologyand other occult sciences.

Duringthat time David was the primary skryer, but each of us regularly took our turnat the wheel. We systematically worked our way through the spirits of theElemental Tablets starting with the Seniors,1 [part0027.html#fn1] then theKerubs,2 [part0027.html#fn2] then the Servitors.3 [part0027.html#fn3]Early in our work with the planetary Seniors a most extraordinary session tookplace. Our subject that evening was ACMBICU, Mercury Senior of the ElementalTablet of Earth. He was only the fourth Senior we had called forth, and hisappearance was a shocking departure from those of the previous visions.Before our first session with ACMBICU each Senior appeared attractively humanoidor even superhuman. ACMBICU immediately emerged in David's vision as monstrousvariation of a great ape. His actions were violent and senseless.“What is this thing doing?” I asked.To this day I can still hear David's deep and dramatic voice. “He is squattingdown on the ground…and throwing mud in his crotch.”All attempts to communicate with ACMBICU were answered by similar obscene andinscrutable gestures. This was hardly the androgynous visage, refined behavior,and eloquent conversation we expected from a spirit of Mercury.Over and over again I asked the standard set of questions that we developed whenworking with the other Seniors: What is the nature of your being? What are yourduties in nature? How do you manifest in the human heart, the human emotions, inhuman desires? Have you ever possessed a figure in human history? Have yourqualities ever been described as a character in literature that we mightrecognize?4 [part0027.html#fn4] ACMBICU ignored every question.5[part0027.html#fn5]Eventually his behavior locked in a curious repetitious loop. David described aline of white rocks about the size of footballs laying on the dirt in front ofthe spirit. ACMBICU then would pick up one rock in his right hand and anotherrock in his left hand and replace one with the other on the ground. He then didthe same thing, replacing the rocks to their original places. This happened overand over again until we gave up, banished the temple and called it a night. Itwas the first time that a session ended in such disappointment. Poor Davidworried that he might be losing his seership skills the same way he lost theability to speak Enochian.After the lights came up and the tea was poured we debriefed like we did everysession. David made a quick sketch of ACMBICU and we all passed it around andjoked about its muddy crotch. I asked David to draw the rocks.images [../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 4. LAIDROM, Mars Senior of the Elemental Tablet of Earth (read right toleft) ACMBICU, Mercury Senior of the Elemental Tablet of Earth (read top tobottom).“What's there to draw? They were…rocks!”He hurriedly drew seven rough circles in a vertical line. Then he drew adouble-headed arrow pointing to and from the second and fourth rocks from thetop. We scratched our heads and concluded there was no cosmic significance tothe drawing or our evening's labor.As I removed the Elemental Tablet of Earth from the table, I tried to locateACIMBCU's name written in Enochian on the bottom left vertical arm of the greatcross that separates the Tablet in to four equal sections. I couldn't find it. Isat the tablet down and looked more closely. I lettered all my Tablets usingEnochian characters that are rather hard to read, especially after a long night.Then the proverbial light bulb went on over my head.Seven rocks, seven letters in ACMBICU's name. I took the drawing of David'srocks and labeled them A-C-M-B-I-C-U. Then I looked at my Tablet of Earth;A-B-M-C-I-C-U. The coloring on the sides of the C and the B pyramids was exactlyalike. When I glued the pyramids to the Tablet I must have carelessly reversedtheir position and didn't catch my mistake until now.“Look at this!” I called David and the others over to see my discovery. “Nowonder ACMBICU was so screwed up! We weren't talking to ACMBICU we were talkingto his perverted cousin ABMCICU…who was kind enough to show us what we weredoing wrong!”6 [part0027.html#fn6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0027.html#ft1] Six Seniors per tablet.2 [part0027.html#ft2] Four primary Kerubs per tablet (one governing eachsubangle).3 [part0027.html#ft3] Sixteen primary Servitors per tablet (four per subangleunder the rulership of the primary Kerub).4 [part0027.html#ft4] I realize these questions may seem strange and somewhattrivial. We learned early in our Enochian work that we learn nothing from aspirit unless we understand how it executes its specific duties in nature andourselves. It should be obvious that historic or literary characters areexpressions of spirits. When the Venus Senior of the Elemental Tablet of Airtells you she possessed Isadora Duncan, you immediately understand a thousandcollateral things about the spirit.5 [part0027.html#ft5] I do recall it telling us that its sacred animal was thearmadillo.6 [part0027.html#ft6] Shortly after the first ACMBICU session, a friend was kindenough to give me a set of microfilm enlargements of Dee and Kelley's “reformed”tablets. In these later versions of the tablets there are numerous changes inthe lettering of the squares. In the reformed versions the Mercury Senior ofEarth is spelled AHMLICU."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 22Enochian Spirits—EHNBOf all the Enochian Elemental spirits we contacted during the three-year heydayof the Guild of Enochian Studies,1 [part0028.html#fn1] one in particular becamethe object of repeated and concentrated workings. The spirit is EHNB, the rulingentity of the small but immensely powerful Tablet of Union (Spirit Tablet).The Tablet of Union is the key to the Enochian Elemental system, just as thequintessential element, Spirit, is the key to the elemental universe. Spirit isthe glue that binds the other four elements together to form the building blocksof creation. It is also the barrier that prevents the elements from dissolvinginto one another and turning the universe into mush. Spirit is always pushingand pulling at the same time. This dual role is expressed in Elemental Magick astwo pentagrams—Spirit Active and Spirit Passive.The Enochian Tablet of Union is actually a simplified and Macrocosmic renditionof the four Elemental Tablets.2 [part0028.html#fn2] It is made up of the namesof the four great spirits of the elements: EXARP—great spirit of Air who rulesthe entire Elemental Tablet of Air; HCOMA—who rules the entire Elemental Tabletof Water; NANTA—who rules the entire Elemental Tablet of Earth; and BITOM—whorules the entire Elemental Tablet of Fire. See figure 5 [part0028.html#fig5].images [../images/00020.jpeg]Figure 5. The Enochian Tablet of Union.The letters EHNB rule their respective names and elements,making EHNB the ruler of the rulers of the Elements.These four great spirits rule the entire Elemental universe and the spiritrepresented by the first letter of each of their names (EHNB) rules the fourgreat spirits! Anyway you look at it EHNB is one big spirit in the Enochiansystem. One side of each of the four pyramids of its name is attributed to anelement (E-Air, H-Water, N-Earth, B-Fire). The remaining three sides are pureSpirit. (In other words, the elemental structure of EHNB is a powerful yetbalanced mixture of twelve parts Spirit, one part Air, one part Water, one partEarth, and one part Fire.)As a group we avoided the Tablet of Union for nearly a year because of a commentmade by Aleister Crowley in his Book of Thoth:Generally speaking, the attributions of Spirit are not clear and simple likethose of the other elements. It is very remarkable that the Tablet of Spirit inthe Enochian system is the key to all mischief; as, in the Hindu system, Akashais the Egg of Darkness. 3 [part0028.html#fn3]He doesn't go on to explain what he means by “…the key to all mischief…” but itwas enough to keep us away from working the Tablet of Union for a very longtime. When we finally got up the nerve to do it, we were most pleasantlysurprised. Fearing “mischief;’ David and I decided to first do it privately aday or so before class.First of all, EHNB is extremely easy to call forth. The temple opening ceremonyis very brief and only the first and second Calls are intoned. David immediatelydescribed a circular temple setting with circular well in the center of thefloor and a domed ceiling with a circular hole in the top. EHNB in humanoid form(and dressed rather ostentatiously and wearing an enormous ring) stood near thewell.I began with the same question I had asked all the Enochian spirits upon theirappearance. “What is the nature of your being?”It did not answer verbally, but stretched forth its hand, and, with its finger,pointed to the circumference of the temple floor. David interpreted. “Its natureis universal.”“What are its specific duties?”David answered in the first person. “The mechanism of the universe youunderstand or can ever understand is contained within me. I am everything. I doeverything. I know everything.”I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to ask. Finally I asked David whatEHNB was doing now.“Just standing by the well looking bored.”I wanted time to think. EHNB was more than I was prepared for. I asked David tothank it for coming and ask it if it would readily appear again for othermembers of the class if we called it in the same manner. It agreed. We then badeit farewell and closed the temple.At the next class David and I did not share the EHNB story with the others.Instead I asked another class member if she would be willing to skry a spiritfrom the Tablet of Union. Our volunteer was not as skilled as David, nor was shepossessed with his rich vocabulary of visual images. Nevertheless, EHNB appearedto her standing before a circular campfire surrounded by a circle of stones. Hewore a fringed leather coat and fringed pants. I asked her if she had anythingshe wished to ask EHNB. She declined, feeling almost intimidated by itspresence.After I banished and closed, David and I related the story of our first EHNBencounter with the other members of the class. Everyone was struck by thesimilarities of the two visions. We decided for the time being that EHNB wouldbe the focus of our elemental workings.In the months and years that followed, EHNB proved without question to be themost cooperative and informative spirit in the Enochian elemental system. In myopinion it is the classic spirit guide. One evening, while questioning it on thenature of time, I asked if it was aware of the periods of life and consciousnessthat we humans view as incarnations. EHNB answered in the affirmative. I thenasked if it could show us visions of our previous incarnations. Again the answerwas yes.“Then show me one of mine:’ I foolishly asked. “Show me how I died.”The seer began to describe an urban scene of what appeared to be a city in theNear East. A young man with a bushy mustache was on the rooftop of a buildingabout two or three stories high. Telegraph poles and lines were in view tellingus that we were no farther back in time than the mid-19th century. There waslaughter. The young man stepped to the edge of the roof and put his foot on awire that stretched over the street to another building. He fell. He died. Theend.I want to make it perfectly clear that although I believe in the continuity ofexistence, I do not hold to the simplistic theory that upon death a vaporousghost containing our soul floats out of our dead body and goes to some cosmicwaiting room while a karmic committee tallies up our unfulfilled needs anddesires and matches us up with two unsuspecting fools who deserve the hell thatwe will put them through as much as we deserve the hell they will put usthrough. I am very confident, however, in the cycles of nature, and I do not seeany reason to believe that the same cyclic behavior we observe in the universearound us cannot apply to consciousness and the continuity of our existence.Perhaps, because of the fragile nature of time, we are living all our“incarnations” simultaneously.4 [part0028.html#fn4]That being said, I will remind you that as an infant I had many memories thatcould be interpreted as stemming from previous incarnations. I confess not oneof them, to my recollection, had the remotest semblance to the one described byEHNB on that evening. Be that as it may, in my first year of college Ivolunteered to be the subject in a study of hypnotic age regression.5[part0028.html#fn5] I was hypnotized by a licensed and experiencedhypnotherapist and regressed past infancy to the last moments of a theorizedprevious incarnation. I was a young man. I had a thick black moustache that Icould easily see when I lowered my eyes. I was dressed in loose white pants anda white shirt that was open to my navel. I was on a rooftop looking across to abuilding of the same height across the street.

The lodge grew surprisingly fast and put increasing demands upon mytime. Even though I have not resurrected the G.O.E.S. per se, I still makeEnochian skrying sessions part of my regular magick class, and encourage evenbeginning students to learn the basics and start a personal program ofexploration.Today, scholarship on Enochian magick is greater than at any other time inhistory. Aspects of the system that our little class never even approached arecurrently the subject of thorough examination and lively discussion. I amthrilled at the conversations I follow on the Enochian “chat” lines and amgratified to see that a new generation of brilliant Enochian magicians is givingthis marvelous system the attention it deserves. My personal Enochian work forthe last ten years has for the most part been limited to my repeated explorationof the thirty Enochian heavens, or Aethyrs.images [../images/00021.jpeg]Figure 6. The thirty heavens, or Aethyrs, of the Enochian universe surround thefour Elemental Watchtowers in thirty concentric spherees. Instead of classifying the material and celestial universe and the levels ofhuman consciousness in terms of the ten sephiroth and twenty-two paths of theQabalistic diagram called the Tree of Life, Enochian magick sees the worldarranged a little differently. Surrounding the four Elemental Tablets (orwatchtowers) that form the matter and energies of the phenomenal universe, thereare thirty spherical Aethyrs, one enveloping another like layers of an onion.Like the paths and sephiroth of the Tree of Life, each Aethyr is reflected inthe “software” of the human consciousness matrix.The qabalistic magician engages in a program of “path-workings” andsystematically explores the paths and sephiroth of the Tree of Life in skryingsessions. It is common, even for beginners, to obtain some visions in all levelsof the Tree. But, to those who are truthful with themselves, it is alwaysobvious when they have reached a level where their current level of initiation(the highest level of consciousness they can currently achieve) prevents themfrom obtaining an undistorted vision of that plane.The Enochian magician explores the thirty Aethyrs in precisely the same manner.Over the years I have systematically skryed all thirty Aethyrs half a dozentimes. Each time starts out very strong, the early Aethyrs clear and full ofuseful information and insights. Then, inevitably, there comes a point where thevision is seen as through a glass darkly. The messages are jumbled and cryptic,the angelic governors unstable and crabby. It is then that I know that I havereached the limit of my personal level of initiation. I must do something withmyself and to myself to break through to the next higher level of consciousness.More often than not, I find that the key to achieving the next level is to befound in my own diary, in the notes from the last Aethyr I could successfullypenetrate.I confess, I still don't get very far before I hit the “glass darkly” stage.Nevertheless, I feel that by periodically visiting the Aethyrs, no matter howdistorted most of them may be, a magician can gain real insight as to his or herpersonal spiritual progress. Furthermore, unlike qabalistic pathworkings thatare often “jump-started” by guided imagery exercises telling the seer what they“should” be seeing at any given point (“In Hod you will meet a man in an orangecloak eating fishsticks with his toes.”), the Enochian seer is obliged to viewvisions that are entirely unique to his or her vocabulary of images."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 24The Curse of Belial (Never Share a Fiend with a Friend)Aleister Crowley wrote, “the Single Supreme Ritual is the Attainment of theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. It is the raising of thecomplete man in vertical straight line. Any deviation from this line tends tobecome black magic. Any other operation is black magic…If the Magician needs toperform any other operation than this, it is only lawful insofar as it is anecessary preliminary to That One Work.”1 [part0030.html#fn1]The Western magical tradition teaches there are ten major landmarks in theinitiate's journey. These of course aren't geographic landmarks; rather, theyare ten progressively higher levels of consciousness. Students of Easternmysticism are quick to point out that at least seven of these landmarks ofconsciousness correspond nicely with the seven chakras or psychic centers in thehuman body. Either way you look at it, attainment to the next level endows theinitiate with greater insight, wisdom, and power.When Crowley wrote about Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,he was referring specifically to achieving and maintaining the level ofconsciousness corresponding to the sixth sephira of the Tree of Life. In Easternterms, this coincides with the opening of the Anahata chakra (heart, or Christcenter) in the human psychic body.Until the initiate has achieved this level of consciousness, he or she is moreor less blind to the true nature of his or her spiritual condition, andtherefore ill equipped to make competent magical decisions. The only acts ofmagick that are lawful before this grade is achieved are those designed to breakdown obstacles that prevent the magician's magical progress toward that goal.More often than not, the new magician doesn't have a clue as to what thoseobstacles really are. Consequently, magical workings at this stage of one'scareer are a hit and miss affair, and often meet with less than roaring success.So high is the failure rate that many magical instructors forbid their studentsfrom dabbling in anything other than the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel.This, I feel, is a mistake. Unless a few things blow up in your face you willnever learn what you will need to do, and who you will need to become to avoidsuch mistakes in the future.It is true that if I had listened to my teacher before I evoked Orobas for thefirst time2 [part0030.html#fn2] I could have spared myself the agonizing pain ofburning my eyes with cinnamon oil. On the other hand, I would have missed theopportunity to learn a score of invaluable magical lessons: I would have deniedmyself a priceless ego-shattering experience; I might have never have becomeaware of the various parts of my soul; I might have remained completely ignorantof the nature of the spirits, not to mention the possibility that Mad Bob mightnot have shown up with the car that so dramatically rescued my family fromdestruction.I was very lucky with that first evocation. The reason, I believe, thateverything worked out was because it was my unambiguous will to pull my lifetogether. I wasn't experimenting. I wasn't praying. I was actually doingsomething for myself. I think I could have done anything—sacrificed a cigar anda bottle of rum—performed an unnatural act with a cheese grater—anything wouldhave worked!On the other hand, if the object of the operation is not one's unambiguous will,or if your will is divided against itself for one reason or another, the energyyou pour into the magick just seems to make things worse. A most dramaticexample of such a breech in formula occurred when I tried to share a demon witha friend for the purpose of prospering a business venture.In 1981, Matt Benton, an old musician friend of mine who had recently earned hisPh.D. in psychology, offered me a job editing a series of books he had writtenin conjunction with a therapeutic boardgame he had developed in grad school. Itwas without a doubt the best job I ever had. The pay was good and the work veryinteresting. It even included a car.A little less than a month after I started the job, the project was hit withsome unforeseen and expensive surprises. A sizable chunk of investment capitalhad been withdrawn, and unless new cash could be injected into the enterprise,the project (and my job) would have to be postponed.The only way Matt could quickly raise the needed cash was to secure another loanon his already heavily encumbered home. In desperation he took counsel with anattorney of colorful integrity and together they filed loan paperwork that canonly be described as “surreal.”Knowing that I would prefer to keep working, Matt asked if there was anything“magical” I could do to assure that the loan committee would somehow approve thepackage without reading it. I figured it was my unambiguous will to keep workingso I foolishly suggested that we enter into a joint evocation of Goetic spirit.Matt loved the idea. We thumbed through the text together and settled on Belial,the 68th spirit of the Goetia, a spirit I had heretofore not evoked. The textreads:BELIAL—He is a Mighty and Powerful King, and was created next after Lucifer. Heappeareth in the Form of Two Beautiful Angels sitting in a Chariot of Fire. Hespeaketh with a Comely Voice, and declareth that he fell first from among theworthier sort, that were before Michael, and other Heavenly Angels. His officeis to distribute Presentations and Senatorships, etc., and to cause favour ofFriends and of Foes. He giveth excellent Familiars, and governeth 80 Legions ofSpirits. Note well that this King Belial must have Offerings, Sacrifices andGifts presented unto him by the Exorcist, or else he will not give True Answersunto his Demands. But then he tarrieth not one hour in the Truth, unless he beconstrained by Divine Power…3 [part0030.html#fn3]Because Belial appears as two spirits, I thought it particularly appropriate foran operation involving two magicians. I had never performed a dual evocationbefore4 [part0030.html#fn4] so I was unsure as to the best way to proceed. Idecided Matt and I should operate simultaneously from two different locations(our respective homes). I set to work making two poster-board triangles and twopaper versions of Belial's sigil. I also engraved the demon's sigil on twocopper disks. On the back of each disk I engraved the classic TetragrammatonPentagram. These we would wear around our necks during the evocations.images [../images/00022.jpeg]Figure 7. Sigil of Goetic Spirit Belial I wrote up two outline rituals. Mine would be the more elaborate version similarto the one I used for the evocation of Orobas and others. Matt's version wasvery simple and designed primarily to link his temple with mine.Matt lived less than two miles from my home, so it was very easy for me to go tohis house and help him set up his circle and triangle and assure myself that heand his temple were in order. Matt had never done anything like this before andwas understandably a little nervous. We cast his circle around a gigantic easychair in his living room so he could sit comfortably during the ten or fifteenminutes I estimated it would take for the evocation.Before I left Matt's house I banished the room and consecrated his circle. Webriefly reviewed what he was to do in the joint ceremony. It was very simple.After I left he was to take a shower while he repeated the appropriate verse.5[part0030.html#fn5] He was then to put on his bath robe (he didn't have amagical robe) and enter his living room temple. He was to place his paper sigil(which was drawn on the back of a letter signed by one of the bank loanofficers) in the triangle and his copper sigil around his neck. Then, for theduration of the specified time he was to remain in the chair within the circleand repeat a short mantra;Belial thou mighty King,Accept thou now this offering.Send forth your legions to secure,The Loan Committee's signature.6 [part0030.html#fn1]Matt was then to wait in the circle until I returned to banish and dose histemple.We synchronized our watches and I rushed home to begin the conjuration at thedesignated moment. As Belial demands offerings and sacrifices, I decided, withuncharacteristic machismo, that I would initiate the proceedings by scratchingthe sigil of demon on my left arm with a compass point and then stamping themark with my blood onto a round piece of parchment. This I placed in thetriangle to serve as the material basis for the spirit's manifestation.My conjuration was accompanied by no strange occurrences whatsoever. Although Ididn't actually see the spirit in the triangle, my inner senses all informed meloud and clear that Belial greedily accepted my sacrifice of blood and that theobject of our operation would succeed. After giving the spirit his charge, Ibanished the temple and rushed back to Matt's house.I found Matt in his black bathrobe sitting in his big easy chair. He seemed alittle shaken. I performed the banishing rituals of the pentagram and hexagram,then asked him how it went. He said, “Well…I'm not sure. But I think I'd like totake another shower. Don't sit in that chair.”Matt disappeared into the bathroom and took a quick shower. He returned with atowel and bottle of pine scented disinfectant. Without saying a word heproceeded to thoroughly dean his chair.This was very strange. I didn't know if I wanted to know what was going on.“Let's go get something to eat,” he finally said. “My treat.”Over dinner he told me the most remarkable story.In my first draft of this chapter I wrote down as much as I could rememberconcerning his story. I read it to Matt to see if there was anything he couldadd. He said it was fine, but got out his journal of that period just to doublecheck. It was the first time I had ever seen his diary. After reading it I askedhim if I he would allow me to reproduce his diary notes instead of using what Ihad written. He graciously consented. Please excuse his abbreviations andshorthand use of the language. (Compared to some of my diary entries, Matt'snotes read like Shakespeare.)7/23—:30:15 pBlack magic cer.

I put on my robe and cleaned up the chair as much can (sic.) andwaited inside the circle for him to return.I wasn't sure I was going to but I told M. pretty much everything that happened.He thought I was joking at first and said that nothing like that had everhappened to him—told me sounds like I got the good half of the demon.I was a bit uncomfortable with the sexual component of Matt's experience,especially because it was not part of the original operation. It seemeduncomfortably like an act of spiritual vampirism. Still, I did not share myconcerns with Matt because I did not want to throw a wet blanket on hisenthusiasm over his first magical operation. Furthermore, three days later welearned that the loan committee had approved the loan and offered an additionalfifteen percent if Matt so requested. He so requested. The project was on again.I need to point out that everything related to the project seemed to carry withit demonic, even dangerous baggage. This is not to say that things didn't gowell. On the contrary things seemingly went very well indeed. For example:We needed an artist, a cartoonist, who could translate Matt's texts intostoryboard cells. To retain such a talent for a six to ten month term couldunderstandably be very expensive. We started our quest in Laguna Beach talkingwith the owners of various studios. As we expected, there was no shortage oftalent, but none of it affordable. We ended the first day of our searchempty-handed. We stopped at a local saloon (one of the most infernal in town)for a beer and sat down right next to our artist. He was old and bald and smokedcheap cigars. The beard around his mouth was stained ugly yellow from years ofcigar smoke. He was obnoxiously drunk.The bartender started talking about him as if he couldn't hear what he wassaying.“That old goat is Jack Barr. He was the smallest man ever to play football forthe Rams. The guy's a cartoonist. Here, look.”The bartender slid a recent issue of Playboy down the bar. Sure enough, a JackBarr cartoon. It was very funny. Not only that but I recognized his style from ascore of other Playboy cartoons that I had enjoyed over the years. He was forreal. He was in front of us. He most likely would work very cheaply. But he wasa hopeless drunk and currently in no condition to talk.The bartender was a wealth of information. He told us the pattern of Barr's lifehadn't changed in fifteen years. The alcohol in his blood dictated a strictschedule.Each morning (Saturdays and Sundays included) at 10:00 A.M. he arrived to “open”his favorite bar. He drank beer, smoked cigars and ate lightly (mostly pickledeggs and burritos) until 5:00 P.M. (when he had to be home to feed his dog). Hedid what chores he could manage until around 8:00 P.M. when he passed out. Heawoke every morning at 3:00 A.M., showered and drank black coffee while he drewin his studio—drew wonderful things; terrible things; little things that he sentout regularly for publication; big things that covered his wall with monstrousspecters from his tortured soul.Matt and I appeared at his home at 5:30 A.M. the next day and talked to himabout the project. He was perfectly sober and enthusiastic about the project. Wetold him what we could pay and he accepted without quibbling.Old Jack Barr served us well throughout the entire project, but in order for usto exploit his talent, Matt and I were obliged to radically adjust the scheduleof our lives to accommodate the old man's nightmarish daily cycle. The three ofus met daily at 6:00 A.M. to see the newest drawings and lay out plans for thenext night's work. We had to carefully write out every detail of instructionbecause when Jack woke up at 3:00 A.M. he would be unable to remember theprevious day's conversation.Jack Barr was just one of the “demon” helpers who labored for us on thisventure. Each one executed his or her assigned task to our satisfaction, buteach also brought with them some vice or infernal flaw that managed to extractfrom Matt and me some painful measure of personal concession. I am notexaggerating when I say it was truly like working with pack of demons.Still, the results were impressive. Matt's career was off with a bang. The bookswere printed. The “game” was manufactured. Matt lectured at a local Universityand was “discovered” by a newspaper reporter, who splashed his picture and storyacross the front page of the Accent section of the Sunday Los Angeles Times.This publicity led to the direct-mail sale of the entire first edition of thebooks and game, and spawned a dizzying schedule of college lectures.Our next request for Belial was to remove any obstacles that might prevent Mattfrom opening his own counseling center. We performed another joint evocation,which, this time, was not accompanied by strange phenomena. As far as we couldtell, the operation was also successful, and Matt was soon the director of hispsychological counseling center and the darling of the recovery industry.The center became quite popular. Matt took on two additional associates and thethree of them booked a full schedule of clients. Matt also facilitated groups inthe evenings and held weekend intensives. The money was good.My job was done. Matt got everything he wanted and more from our little magickfiend. I got over a year of steady work and a segue to an even better positionin commercial real estate. I moved on to my new job and Matt settled into hisblossoming career. We both more or less forgot Belial. Neither one of us calledhim up again to thank him or give him another one of those “offerings” that helikes so well. Matt just went on with his unambiguous magical will to succeed,and my unambiguous will went on to focus on other things. Beliel's joint mastersabandoned him, and Matt's fortunes were soon to change.It all started when Elizabeth, Matt's receptionist and secretary, got married toa client of Matt's, a wealthy entrepreneur named Charles who came to the centerto overcome a drug addiction. After they were married, Charles and Elizabethmoved to the Midwest where, for one reason or another, Elizabeth becamehopelessly addicted to cocaine. Charles was beside himself and called Matt andmade him an offer he could not refuse.Confident in Matt's discretion and ability to help clients overcome drugproblems, Charles offered Matt an exorbitant figure to fly to their home andtreat Elizabeth on a twenty-four hour basis until she was clean. He also paidfor all lost client fees Matt would incur while he was away. Matt accepted. Thetreatment took five weeks, during which time Charles confided in Matt the natureof his business. In keeping with the theme of this chapter I need only say thatCharles was a creature of the underworld and Matt had unwittingly become one ofhis minions.Predictably, Charles paid Matt in cash—cash that Matt put in his briefcase forthe return flight home—a brief case that was opened by airport officials in theMidwest—airport officials that had questions—questions Matt would not answer.In all likelihood the authorities realized that Matt was more or less aninnocent acquaintance of Charles who was in the wrong place at the wrong timecarrying a large amount of questionable cash. Nevertheless, they mistakenlybelieved Matt could give them useful information concerning Charles’ operation,and in order to pressure him to cooperate, they arrested him on a number ofcharges (none of which included the charges of stupidity and ill-placedloyalty). Bail and subsequent legal fees devastated Matt's finances. He lost hishouse to foreclosure. As the home loan was the original object of our magicaloperation I called Matt and told him that it was clear that Belial had turnedagainst the game plan and urged that we exorcise him from our lives. He agreed.I conjured Belial one last time and gave him license to depart and dismissed himfrom my service. I then burned his paper sigil and sanded his sign from thecopper medallion. I drove to Matt's “new” home on the beach and together weperformed a brief exorcism. Instead of sanding down his copper medallion, Mattwanted to destroy it by casting it into the sea where it would quickly corruptin the salt water.We stepped to the water's edge. Matt hurled it with a mighty sweep and it shotout to sea like a tiny flying saucer. The sea breeze caught it like a Frisbeeand lifted it a few feet higher than its original trajectory. Suddenly, aseagull intercepted the disk in mid air and caught it firmly in its beak. Mattand I couldn't believe what we were seeing. We waved our arms and screamed atthe bird hoping it would fly further out to sea and drop it. But it circled backand flew toward Matt's little bungalow. It made a few dips and circles and thendropped the disk in the sand about fifty yards down the beach. We ran to whereit appeared to fall and carefully combed the sand, but we could not find it.For the next year, while he fought one expensive legal battle after another,Matt searched for Belial's sigil. He borrowed a metal detector. He built ascreen box. He questioned sunbathers who spread their towels in the vicinity. Henever found it.He did, however, eventually resolve his awful situation. It took five years andall of his resources, but in the end he neither betrayed his clients nor did hego to jail for his silence. He pulled his life and career back together and ranhis counseling center for as long as it was his unambiguous will to do so.There is a magical legend that informs us that King Solomon built the greatTemple of God with the supernatural help of demons. Afterward he bound thespirits and imprisoned them in a brass bottle, sealed with a leaden seal, andthrew it into a river. One day a fisherman netted the bottle and innocentlyunleashed the spirits back into the world. Solomon eventually caught all butseventy-two of the little devils and sealed them back up again. The remainingseventy-two are the spirits of the Goetia, including Belial.A couple of years after Matt's unfortunate adventure, he and his new girlfriendwere relaxing on the beach with friends who were visiting from Israel. Matt wasplaying Frisbee with the 14-year-old son of their guests when the boy reachedinto the sand and recovered the lost medallion of Belial. Matt still keeps it inhis office in a place of honor. The boy's name was Solomon.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0030.html#ft1] Magick—Book Four—Liber ABA—Part III—Magick in Theory andPractice, by Aleister Crowley (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1997), p. 275.2 [part0030.html#ft2] See chapters 16 and 17.3 [part0030.html#ft3] The Goetia, The Lesser Key of Solomon the King, trans.Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, edited, annotated, introduced, and enlarged byAleister Crowley.

The key to successfully isolatingand redirecting these “spirits” lies in our ability to balance and integrate theother parts of the soul to such a degree that these unruly rascals find iteasier to cooperate with the magician's game plan than to resist it. This is avery personal thing. Obviously, it was a terrible idea for Matt and I to engagein a dual conjuration of a goetic spirit. A slave cannot serve two masters. Assoon as I formally withdrew from the operation, Matt and Belial (the only “two”who should have ever been operating in the first place) became focused on thejob at hand and eventually triumphed.Ever since then I have resisted the temptation to stick my nose into someoneelse's magical business. However, from time to time friends or acquaintancescome to me seeking magical solutions to everyday problems. The best that I cando is to counsel them as to how I might magically proceed in the same situation.I can never be sure that my advice is correct because I have no way of knowinganother person's karmic profile or the depth of their commitment to theoperation.images [../images/00023.jpeg]Figure 8. Sigil of Goetic Spirit Andromalius A few years after my experience with Belial, two of our dearest friends, Pat andTerry, bought the most beautifully appointed Volkswagen camper. They were wildlygenerous with it and seized any excuse to take Constance and me and other lodgemembers on road trips, campouts, baseball games, and mini-vacations. Then, lessthan two months after buying it, the new van was stolen from the parking lot ofa movie theater.The police held out no hope of its recovery. Pat and Terry lived less than sixtymiles from the Mexican border, and it was likely that the car was out of thecountry before they came out of the theater and discovered it missing. We wereall heartbroken. Just out of frustration and outrage I wanted to evokeAndromalius,1 [part0031.html#fn1] who brings back stolen things. But then Iremembered my experience with Belial and reconsidered. I did, however, instructPat how he might easily evoke Andromalius.Pat was not very enthusiastic about performing that kind of magick and I wassure that a half-hearted effort would fail. Pat performed some kind ofconjuration of Andromalius (he never told me exactly what he did) and gave thespirit two weeks to recover the car.To everyone's surprise, the car was recovered exactly two weeks later at theMexican border—the thieves had taken it to Mexico and were trying to cross backinto the United States with a shipment of contraband parrots. Andromalius was ahero.A few days later I told the story to the accountant at work who immediatelydemanded that I tell her how to whip up Andromalius. Her sister's car had justbeen stolen by her ex-husband. I sketched out the spirit's sigil and gave her acrash course in Solomonic evocation. The next morning she related to me how shedrew a chalk circle and triangle on the floor of her garage and stood in thecircle with a bottle of tequila and screamed curses at her former brother-in-lawin the form of the sigil of Andromalius in the triangle. That night when I leftwork she greeted me in the parking lot in her sister's recovered car (a VW van)and rewarded me with a big kiss and a gift box of Boodles British Gin (myfavorite).Since then, I have “given” Andromalius to four other individuals for the returnof their stolen automobiles.2 [part0031.html#fn2] He hasn't failed yet—and I amat a loss to explain why. In my opinion none of these people even came nearplumbing the infernal depths of their Nephesh Hells to harness the blind powerof their personal demons.3 [part0031.html#fn3] Their stolen cars, while apainful loss, presented more of an inconvenience than gut-wrenching outrage.Most of them, to my knowledge, merely went through the motions of standing for amoment in a circle and making a wish at a paper sigil in a triangle. Why did itwork? Is Andromalius that easy to enlist? Is he that cooperative?I feel I must apologize to the reader because I have no dean explanation forthis spirit's behavior. It runs counter to my magic field theory about whatthese spirits are and how they operate. The only thing I can say is this. Ifyour car gets stolen and you want it back (especially if it is a VW bus)—it surecouldn't hurt to evoke Andromalius.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0031.html#ft1] The Goetia, The Lesser Key of Solomon the King, trans.Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, edited, annotated, introduced, and enlarged byAleister Crowley.

She leftour house in a cab with Andromalius’ sigil drawn on the back of an envelope.When she returned home her car (a VW bus) was waiting for her in her driveway.3 [part0031.html#ft3] Constance evoked Andromalius to recover a large box ofvitamins and other motherly gifts which she sent at great expense to our son inJapan. I had no doubts that “Andy” would comply to a mother's wrath, especiallywhen the nourishment of the baby bird is at stake. Sure enough, the box showedup in Japan. All our subsequent shipments bear the sigil of Andromaliusconspicuously displayed front and back."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 26Attack of Aunt Gladys’ GhostI am often asked if I have ever been attacked personally by a spirit. People aredisappointed if I can't terrorize them with some tale of spiritual mayhem. Alas,I have to tell you that (with the exception of my first evocation of Orobas whenit was more a case of my own stupidity than the malice of the spirit) I havenever been attacked by any spirit that I have formally evoked I was, however,nearly killed by a spirit I didn't evoke.Crime statistics show that if you are going to be murdered, it will most likelybe by a family member. This is obviously also the case in the spirit world.As you may recall from chapter two, my Aunt Gladys lived nearly her entire lifein Wallace, NE. Her story is one of tragedy and triumph. Crippled at an earlyage, with a disease that virtually gelatinized her bones, she bravely overcamethe harsh cruelties of prairie life to become one of the most beloved andrespected matriarchs of her community. She was charming. She was witty. All whocame near her immediately found themselves willing slaves of her charisma.Through pure will and strength of character she transformed her wheelchair intoa throne from which she dictated the lives of all within her gravitationalfield.Her favorite servants were little boys—neighbor boys—relatives—it didn't matter.I can't recall ever seeing her without a tiny footman tirelessly runningerrands, emptying her chamber pot, and doing a thousand household chores. Whenthey grew older she allowed them to drive her to the outermost reaches of herqueendom. While we were living with her, she even attempted to recruit Marc andme into her service, but years of self-centered laziness made us poor candidatesfor martyrdom.Please do not misunderstand me, Aunt Gladys was a good woman. She didn't have amalicious gelatinized bone in her body. She did what she had to do and she didit with great style. Nevertheless, it remains a sad fact that many of the dearsouls she dominated docilely allowed their lives and personalities to be drainedof any semblance of independence or will. Her little boys eventually grew older,but few, it can be said, grew to manhood. Without her dynamic direction many ofthem drifted into lives of tragic loneliness.One summer, about a year before she died, Gladys traveled to California for avisit. Constance suggested that we take her to the Huntington Library andBotanical Gardens in San Marino. I heartily agreed. Since Jean-Paul was oldenough to walk, we visited the gardens regularly and pretended we lived there.It is one of the most beautiful places on earth; one hundred and forty-fouracres of magnificent grounds—pine forest, Japanese garden, Shakespearean garden,fish and turtle ponds, Greek gardens, massive rose arbors, herb gardens and theworld's most extensive desert garden. It's paradise—and all of it accessible bywheelchair.As we predicted, Gladys loved the Huntington gardens. It was a thrill justwatching her prairie-parched eyes drink in the exotic colors and forms.Jean-Paul was our guide and I, of course, pushed the wheelchair. Gladys wasvisibly affected. Several times during the day, she made us stop so she couldreach up and hug my neck and tell me it was the happiest day of her life.By afternoon the temperature reached 103 degrees and I was beginning to tire. Weunwisely saved the desert garden for last. It is located in the lowest sectionof the grounds and the way out is an uphill ordeal even when one is not pushinga wheelchair. By the time we reached the parking lot, Jean-Paul and I eachsuffered heat stroke. He threw-up and I broke out in a cold sweat, which Icouldn't bring under control for several hours. Gladys was in bliss. It would bethe last time I saw her alive.We knew Gladys was pleased with her day at the Huntington, but we had no ideajust how pleased she was. She called us as soon as she returned to thank usagain. She cried on the phone. We soon heard from other relatives that it wasall she could talk about. She made multiple copies of all the photographs fromthat day and sent them with detailed descriptions to everyone she knew. She gaveme all the credit for the happiest day of her life, and told everyone I almostdied in the process. After all these years, Lonnie had become her favorite boy.On the night she died, nearly twenty hours before I would learn of her death,Gladys came to me in a frightening vision. I dreamed I was in her old house inWallace lying on my back in her great mahogany bed. It was here the dear womanused to let me sit with her for a few minutes at bedtime and she would read tome the funny paper adventures of Dondi and Alley Oop.This night she was not in the bed. She was standing in the doorway to herbedroom—standing upright without cane or crutches or braces. She slowly walkedto the head of the bed. I was so surprised, I said, “Aunt Gladys, you can walk!”She didn't say a word, but reached toward me and pulled the pillow from under myhead and placed it gently over my face. I tried to push it off, but my hands andarms were paralyzed. I tried to scream but I could not get any air to come outof my throat. I was suffocating. I tried to thrash my body from side to side butI couldn't tell whether or not I was really moving. I think I managed to let outan awful groan, but I could not articulate any words. I groaned again andstruggled against the pillow. I heard Constance's voice telling me to “Breathe!Lon! You're not breathing! Wake up!” I stared wide-eyed into the pillow until itdissolved and I saw the familiar shadows of my own bedroom ceiling. Constancepushed me sharply and yelled again for me to breathe. Finally I found thecontrol to drag in a deep breath and then another.It was a clear case of sleep apnea. It had happened before. I snore likeGodzilla. This was the first time, however, that it had been accompanied by sucha strange and terrifying dream.“I dreamed Aunt Gladys was trying to suffocate me with a pillow.” Constance andI both laughed. Still, I would not put my head back down on the spot where thedream had occurred. I spent the rest of the night on the living-room couch. Thefollowing evening my brother called to tell us that Aunt Gladys had died thenight before.A few days later my mother flew to Nebraska for her sister's funeral. She stayedfor a week afterward to help Gladys’ daughter with the disposition of some ofher things. Mom brought back a handful of memorabilia to divide between mybrother and me. My inheritance was wrapped in tissue and delivered in a largeshopping bag. A lovely card from her daughter accompanied it. She wrote to tellme again that Gladys’ trip to the Huntington was the happiest moment of her lifeand that she hoped I would always think of her mother whenever I looked at thesilken pillow that Gladys hand embroidered just for me."},{"pageContent":"images [../images/00007.jpeg]CHAPTER 27How to End an Autobiography Without DyingAnd now I am faced with the awkward task of ending an autobiography while stillalive. I certainly do not intend to die anytime soon just to provide a cleanending, but as I conclude this little book it might not be a bad idea to pausefor a moment to ponder that undiscovered country from whose bourne no travelerreturns and share with you my thoughts on death.Do I believe in an afterlife? Do I believe in karma and reincarnation? Do Ibelieve in heaven or hell? Am I afraid to die? The answer to all these questionsis a qualified “Yes.”On the other hand, if you ask me if I believe that when I die I will be hauledinto some celestial courtroom to appear before the God of Judgment who willconvict me on evidence of my failure in life to sacrifice my intelligence andcommon sense in order to believe unquestioningly in a particular cult'sinterpretation of the details surrounding an historical or mythological event,and/or my inability, or disinclination to submit to a particular collection ofancient superstitions and tribal taboos, then my answer is an unqualified “No!”I am perpetually amazed that stable, intelligent people—people with driver'slicenses and college degrees—people who can finish the New York Times crosswordpuzzle and run huge corporations—people who otherwise display the most superiorpowers of intelligence and insight can actually look me in the eye and tell mein deadly earnest that they believe:• That all human beings have been cursed by the creator of the universe becauseof the very fact that we were born;• That, because we are already guilty of committing life, the creator hascondemned us to eternal torture after we die;• That we can plea bargain ourselves out of this fate by perfectly surrenderingto certain mental and behavioral parameters that are outlined in a book composedof sixty-six chapters written over a period of hundreds of years by an unknownnumber of authors in an assortment of languages—an unerring book that has beentranslated scores of times by individuals employed by intensely biasedinstitutions;• That after we die our corpses (at some unspecified date in the future) willreanimate like zombies and fly up from our graves and hover in the sky at theside of our deity who, sitting on a flying horse, will slaughter one third ofthe population of the planet. Afterward, this same deity will preside over theultimate kangaroo court in the clouds and issue one-way tickets to the lake offire to the newly murdered and all others who in life did not unquestionablybelieve that all this was the only spiritual game plan in town.I am sorry my friends. I cannot see how blindly accepting the above doctrine (orany of a hundred others just as ludicrous) could possibly be good for one'smental health. As a matter of fact, it appears obvious to me that in order for arational, intelligent person to subscribe to such silliness and still live arelatively normal life, he or she must set aside a small corner of the braindevoted exclusively to religious mental illness, and visit that area asinfrequently as possible.This does not mean that I think that individuals who fervently believe in aspecific after-death scenario do not experience their expectations in themysterious timeless moments of the death coma. On the contrary, I think ithighly likely that one's visions at the moment of death mirror, in perhapsnightmarish detail, the crystallized “reality” of whatever spiritual worldviewhas captured and enslaved the decedent's imagination in life.For this reason, I am particularly saddened when I think of the untold millionsof my fellow human beings who have exited this plane of existence stillharboring tortuous doubts as to their worthiness to pass such an impossiblejudgment. Shouldn't religion be satisfied with terrorizing their devotees intosocial and economic obedience during life? Is it really necessary to demand fromthese pour souls one last act of tragic self-condemnation insidiously designedto trigger horrifying visions and unspeakable terror during the deathexperience?In 1954, I was 6 years old and loved to listen to the radio. That year one of myfavorite songs was Rosemary Cloony's “This Ole House.”1 [part0033.html#fn1] Therefrain went something like:Ain't a-gonna need this house no longerAin't a-gonna need this house no moreAin't got time to fix the shinglesAin't got time to fix the floorAin't got time to oil the hingesNor to mend the windowpaneAin't a-gonna need this house no longerI'm a-gettin’ ready to meet the saintsIt's a perky little tune and I didn't give the words much thought until mymother was sensitive enough to point out that the house in the song was reallysomeone's body and they were singing about getting ready to die. From then onthe song gave me the creeps and I never sang it again. I still can't stand thesong, but it makes a very good point. We are not bodies possessing souls. We aresouls inhabiting bodies.For thousands of years the great Osirian religion of ancient Egypt impressedupon devotees an image of a resurrected body as the key to overcoming death.Changing only a few names and images, Christianity inherited the Osirian formulaand has perpetuated it through the 20th century. The Osirian formula is based onthe incorrect assumption that the sun is born and dies every day and teeterstoward extinction every winter. The identity of the Osirian devotee was centeredin Earth—an Earth that just sits in place, a helpless spectator of the sun'sbirth and death. This is precisely the role played by the pious Christian whocan only hope to overcome death by riding the magical coattails of Christ'sdeath and resurrection—a body hoping to come to life again.Times have changed. We know now that the sun does not die, neither does it needa magical resurrection. Shouldn't it be logical that the next step in spiritualevolution would be to harmonize with our most recent understanding of reality?It's not so hard to move our identity from Earth to the sun. The sun is on allthe time. We are on all the time. There is no life after death—only life. I knewit as an infant. That is why I could never picture myself off. The solution tomy crib meditation is the simple fact that there is no off.The body is bound to wear out. Sooner or later there won't be time to fix theshingles, won't be time to fix the floor. Is it such a catastrophe to leave ahouse that is falling apart? Perhaps the vision I received when I washypnotically regressed in college and the vision of the Enochian spirit EHNBwere not pictures of an actual event, but an allegory of all death experiences.I wouldn't be a bit surprised if one day, when I am incredibly old and trying torecover from a long afternoon of flamenco dancing and unbridled sex, I close myeyes and find myself standing on the roof of my house. In front of me I see awire strung tightly to the house across the street. I hear my friends laughing.Once again the sum total of my life's momentum urges me onward toward newexperiences-urges me on to the narrow wire that joins this ole house to the newone just across the street.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0033.html#ft1] This Old House, written by Stuart Hamblen.

I spent the morning writing, and in the afternoon madea half-hearted attempt to clean up my office. Constance, bless her heart, spentthe whole day getting our home ready for an invasion of out-of-town guests whowill be arriving in a few days to take their O.T.O. Fifth Degree. Last night, myMonday night magick class marked my half centennial with homemade ice cream andcream puffs. There was much laughter and wonderful cards and gifts. I can't denyit, I am a very lucky man. I am surrounded by good spirits.Now that I think about it, I've always been surrounded by good spirits-spiritswho execute their various charges on my behalf through the human vehicles offriends, family, business associates, and even strangers. By the same token, itis clear that I am also surrounded by “evil” spirits who tirelessly labor withdiabolic tenacity to effect my ultimate undoing. Ironically these devils alsomanifest through the human vehicles of friends, family, business associates, andcomplete strangers.Please don't think that I am so presumptuous as to actually believe that allthese people are actually possessed with objective entities that are the angelsor demons of Lon Milo DuQuette. On the contrary, it is painfully obvious to methat all the spirits are my own children, creatures of my unique and personalmagical universe. Everyone else on the planet has their own magical universe,and I am sure there are a great many people for whom Lon Milo DuQuette assumesthe role, from time to time, of good or evil spirit.images [../images/00024.jpeg]Bishops Lon and Constance DuQuette celebrating the Mass of the Gnostic CatholicChurch. I continue to do my best to identify and capture my “evil” spirits and redirecttheir destructive energy toward constructive ends. It is the magician's greatwork and my spiritual occupation. Sometimes I succeed. Sometimes I fail. EliphasLevi put it perfectly in a stanza of his poem, “The Magician”:Their faces and their shapes are terrible and strange,These devils by my might to angels I will change.These nameless horrors I address without affright:On them will impose my will, the law of light.1 [part0034.html#fn1]At the beginning of this book, I acknowledged without apology that I havescorned and rejected the faith of my fathers; that I invoke and worship strangeand terrible gods; that I summon devils and hold congress with angels, spirits,and demons. I also asked whether or not these pursuits disqualify me for a placein the august fellowship of the holy ones. In the absence of a tantrum-throwinggod of judgement, I guess the only person who can answer that question is yourstruly.Do I think that I am a holy man?Sometimes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 [part0034.html#ft1] The Magician, translated from Eliphas Levi's version ofthe famous Hymn, in The Equinox Vol. 1 (1) (London: Spring, 1909); Reprint YorkBeach, ME: Samuel Weiser, 1992), p. 109."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyCassabon, Meric.

Although he takes the subject ofceremonial magick very seriously, he tries to remember not to take himself tooseriously. This rare combination of common sense and humor has in the last tenyears secured him a respected position in the world of modern occultism.Since 1975 he has served as a national and international officer of Ordo TempliOrientis, one of the most influential magical societies of the 20th century. Heis an acknowledged authority on the life and magick of the 0. T. O.'s mostcelebrated member, Aleister Crowley. His landmark work, The Magick of Thelema: AHandbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley (Weiser, 1993), is considered aclassic in its field, and has been hailed as the first useful primer forThelemic ritual magick.However, DuQuette does not confine himself to the Thelemic genre. He travelsextensively and speaks on a broad range of esoteric topics including Qabalah andthe tarot. He is the creator of Tarot of Ceremonial Magick (cards from U.S.Games, book from Weiser, 1995) and is a Certified Grand Master of the AmericanTarot Association.In his most recent work, Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium: Musings onModern Magick (Weiser, 1997), DuQuette departed from the textbook format of hisprevious works and presented a series of critically acclaimed essays andanecdotes of his personal experiences as a practicing magician. My Life with theSpirits continues in this vein, offering the reader a biographical sketch of thefascinating, sometimes terrifying, sometimes hilarious, world of a 20th centurymagician."},{"pageContent":"image [../images/00025.jpeg]"}]
