Even the most ancient manuscripts are copies of copies of orally trans- mitted teachings. Scholars unanimously agree that even the most venerable works are fragmented and corrupted. Nonsecular Qabalists of the nineteenth century (particularly the scholars and adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) readily saw what they perceived to be palpable flaws in basic hermetic logic in the manner that fragments of some of the conflicting texts were pieced together. To their hermetically trained eyes, it was obvious where basic repairs could and should be made within various extant versions of the primary texts, especially The Sepher Yetzirah:l A Book on Creation .£ The Golden Dawn adjustments are, for the most part, evident and necessary corrections and conform with a thousand years of her- metic thought (including astrological and alchemical systems). They mercifully allow the student to initially embark upon the Qabalistic seas with a few recognizable and comforting land- marks still on the horizon. A Golden Dawn Qabalah workbook was eventually annotated and published by Aleister Crowley as Liber 777.£ It is a massive collection of tables of Qabalistic correspondences that organizes the Qabalistic, magical, and mythological universe in conformity with the newly adjusted Sepher Yetzirah. Rabbi Lamed Ben Clif- ford used Liber 777 and the Golden Dawn version of correspon- dences for his teachings and required his students to own a copy and refer often to it. However, while he was happy to initially teach the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"fundamentals of Qabalah by using the Golden Dawn and 777 correspondences, Ben Clifford refused to dogmatically endorse them (or indeed any particular system or textbook, modern or ancient) or ever suggest that one was doctrinally correct, author- itative, or even superior to another. It was clear from his private drawings of the Tree of Life (not included in this volume) that even Ben Clifford deviated in places from the GD777־ correspon- dences. In fact, once his students had mastered the preliminary degrees of study, he urged them to explore other systems and other ways of looking at everything. As he once wrote to San Francisco socialite and patroness Thalassa Therese:j Truth is bigger than systems. If you can't uncover truth in a flawed system you won't be able to uncover it in a perfect one. All are correct! And all are wrong! Don't worry about it! Learn one, and get comfortable with it.

I wish to be completely candid by stating at the outset that this book represents, for all intents and purposes, the second volume in The Chicken Qabalah o f Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford series.^ This is not to say that this book cannot be read, studied, con- sumed, digested, and enjoyed as a self-contained, stand-alone work in its own right; but I would not be altogether honest if I did not stress the fact that I wrote and organized it assuming the reader has already read The Chicken Qabalah and is at least generally familiar with the elementary Qabalistic principles incul- cated in that work. The two works were written to complement and complete each other, and it is my hope that every reader of this work will place a copy of The Chicken Qabalah close at hand as he or she studies this work. When I first pitched the idea for the book that would become The Chicken Qabalah o f Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford to my pub- lisher, Donald Weiser, he appeared to immediately grasp the overall concept of my unorthodox vision and chuckled (in a pa- tronizingly polite way). As he continued to thumb through my silly pitch-book, his smile broadened a bit more, and then he said, “Yes, we'll do it. Looks like fun. But we can't be perpetrating a hoax. You'll have to tell them somewhere that you wrote it.” I promised I would. Well . . . here I am again. Sadly, Donald passed away just a few months ago£ and didn't get the chance to see the newest install- ment of the Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford odyssey.

It actually developed from a series of twelve all-day Qabalah workshops I facilitated over a one-year pe- riod in Beijing, China, in the spring, summer, fall, and winter of 2016. Throughout that busy year, I returned to Beijing every ninety days, at the equinoxes and solstices, and with the help of Ms. Chris Chang (my initiate sister, friend, interpreter, and “Worthy Guide”) initiated twelve candidates into the three degrees of an informal Qabalah initiatory “Order,” created exclusively for my Chinese students. It was for me the magical and spiritual expe- rience of a lifetime. The challenge of having to think carefully (always difficult for me) and thoughtfully choose my words for translation was daunting, but it also forced me to reduce each concept to its most unambiguous essence and relate it to the most universal and simple common denominator. I used hundreds of color slides and illustrations, which helped overcome many of the Ian- guage challenges. Unfortunately, for the purposes of this book, we will have to satisfy ourselves with the written descriptions of many of these. Each Initiation Ceremony was followed by two days of work- shops, exercises, and meditations, all specifically focused on “mysteries,” of each degree— in this case, the mysteries are those of the Three Mother, Seven Double, and Twelve Mother Letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

I was initially flattered when asked by my publisher and colleagues to collect and curate the material for what would become that landmark publication. I never dreamed, however, the assignment would become so challenging or so exasperating. Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford (his real name is still unknown) was a highly eccentric character.2 His followers, although few in number, enthusiastically embraced his nonsectarian doctrines and methods. Unfortunately for his biographers (and future stu- dents), he rarely committed any of his discourses to writing.^ He was hopelessly undisciplined and relied almost exclusively upon person-to-person tutoring and informal interactions within a small circle of disciples, a few of whom took excellent notes; most of whom did not. After his (still-unsolved) disappearance in July of 1997, his col- leagues were burdened with the ponderous task of sifting through the stacks of scrapbooks and manuscripts that towered floor to ceiling in every room of his otherwise charming Long Is- land beach house. Directing the labor of collating and cataloging was Ben Clifford's administrator (and “magical son”) Dr. Gizmo Ben Lamed.

Year after year I de- dined, arguing one cannot get blood from a turnip. There were simply no more Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford texts to publish. I was secure in my belief that the material available to us when we re- searched The Chicken Qabalah represented nearly all of the writ- ings, notes, and interviews known at the time to exist. Happily, that is no longer the case."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"RABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD— DEAD AT LAST The story of how all this “new” material came to light is as curi- ous as everything else surrounding the bizarre life of this enig- matic holy man. Because his disappearance was unexplained and a body was never recovered, Ben Clifford's estate languished in limbo for many years. Legal disposition of his affairs was postponed a dozen times, triggered by “rabbi sightings” reported from around the world. Many of these were obvious hoaxes perpetrated by grief-maddened Chicken Qabalists. Others were disturbingly bizarre and seemed eerily genuine. To this day, many remain unexplained. Perhaps the most dramatic sighting was bolstered by the testi- mony of Sister Gina Martini and eleven Carmelite nuns in Al- bany, New York, who, in 1999, reported being startled after ves- pers by a partially clad intruder matching the rabbi's description, friskily darting in and out of rows of drying laundry in the con- vent courtyard. Two years later, police in Orlando, Florida, re- sponded to a disturbance inside the Noah's Ark attraction at the Holy Land Experience amusement park. A man who boldly iden- tified himself as Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford was subdued and briefly detained for loudly berating a teenage actor portraying the High Priest Caiaphas and for making lewd comments to the mor- bidly obese actress portraying Noah's wife. Naturally, each reported sighting had to be followed up by insurance company detectives whose investigations necessitated repeated postponements of legal proceedings. Finally, on April 1, 2015, Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford was at last pronounced “legally dead” by Judge Terrence Stool of the Superior Court of Suffolk"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"County, New York. News of the final disposition stirred little interest in the esoteric community— most of whom, like me, were certain The Chicken Qabalah would remain the final pub- lished exposition of the teachings of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. Then, on the evening of April 30, 2015, I received a text mes- sage from Dr. Ben Lamed: OMG! 3 bags full of LBC goodies found @ BNL. pis call asap. Apparently ZIPPY real!!! Gizmo. I immediately phoned Dr. Ben Lamed, who was so excited I could hardly follow the particulars of his rambling narrative. I will attempt to summarize: Shortly after Judge Stool pronounced Rabbi Ben Clifford legal- ly dead, he discovered a bag of still-warm onion bagels on the sunroof of his car in the courthouse parking garage. Inside the bag, he found an envelope containing a tiny key, along with a handwritten note that read as follows: Dear Judge ... or whoever declared me legally dead. Hello from the other side! Don't freak out . . . nobody really dies. But you'll find that out. Just don't worry about it. I hope you enjoy the bagels, but please don't eat the key.

(signed) “The Late” Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford It wasn't easy for Dr. Ben Lamed to gain security clearance to the highly secretive Brookhaven National Laboratories (itself the subject of conspiracy theories concerning the Philadelphia exper- iment, time travel, and extraterrestrial intercourse). It seems the rabbi's only connection to Brookhaven had been with its one- time director, Dr. Zaia Youkhanna, an Aramaic scholar and ama- teur Qabalist, who had organized the rabbi's 1975 lecture tour in Baghdad. When Gizmo finally was allowed access to the kitchen area and opened locker #528, he discovered two large and curi- ously decorated carpets rolled up and propped in one corner. He also found three black plastic trash bags stuffed with docu- ments, notebooks, ritual scripts, a Canadian Army first-aid kit, a pitch pipe, some colored pipe cleaners, and a 1967 M inim oog synthesizer. Gizmo pleaded with me to join him in Montauk, and I im- mediately cleared my schedule and booked a flight to New York. What we discovered revealed an exciting and previously"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"unknown facet of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford's life and teaching methods. The most stunning revelation confirmed the existence of an “Order” resembling the rabbi's alleged Qabalah school, the Zerubbabel Institute o f Philosophical Youth (Z.\\I..־P.\\Y.\\). Bi- ographers, myself included, had long assumed Z..־I..־P..־Y.\\ was purely mythological— a whimsical fable he invented as a teaching device. It appears we were wrong. The documents re- vealed that, for a number of years, Ben Clifford was the hiero- phantic director of a strange and highly unorthodox Qabalistic initiatory society. He didn't refer to it specifically as Z.\\I.*.P.\\Y.\\ but rather by the generic designation “Our Holy Order” ( 0 .-.H.*. 0 .\\)• Passports and unsent postcards confirmed that, beginning in 1984 and continuing every other year, he would disappear for as long as six weeks at a time. Not even his closest Montauk col- leagues knew where he went or what he was up to. His Long Is- land students fantasized he was moonlighting as a spy, or that perhaps he had mistresses. Most of them simply assumed he needed to periodically check himself in for drug or alcohol detox. In actuality, he was traveling— all over the world— Wales, Nor- way, Macedonia, Poland, Germany, Australia, Japan, Croatia, Shanghai, Beijing, and Bethel, Connecticut. These were not lec- ture tours. He traveled to initiate student-candidates into a three- degree Qabalah Mystery School. The documents discovered in the kitchen locker contained complete scripts for each of the three initiation ceremonies, along with portfolios of degree-specific study materials, toys, exercises, and meditations.

I have, therefore, organized this book in a format that I believe the good rabbi envisioned— a practical handbook or guide for both the solitary “Chicken Qabalist” and all other adventurous individuals who believe they can play well with others to experience the initi- ation ceremonies and degree exercises of the O/.H/.O.*. or Z.\\I.*.P.\\Y.\\ or whatever you want to call it.

Wake up first! Then study! — Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford from the First-Degree Lecture The preceding quote is from the Lecture section of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford's First-Degree Initiation Ceremony. It succinctly summarizes the raison d'etre of his Qabalah initiation program. Ben Clifford observed that ancient techniques and materials used by religious or traditional Qabalah study programs (while being brilliant and profound for those who have already developed a significant degree of illumination) remain overwhelmingly com- plex and intimidating to all others who are less illuminated and still striving for that illumination. The emphasis of Ben Clifford's work at this level was not so much a matter of “educating the unawakened student,” but of “awakening the student to be educated.” The idea was to trigger the process by putting the student through a series of artfully de- signed emotional-psychological experiences that essentially mu- tate the individual on a subconscious level— a process known as initiation. “Qabalah Initiation is not a ‘learning’ process, but a ‘birthing’ process,” the rabbi once wrote to Irish rock star and critic Rod- ney Orpheus. “It is as though I am dreaming I am a soul who"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"takes a magic pill that makes me pregnant. And my baby, when it is born, is m e — the awakened me!”I Initiation is nothing new to the Western mystery school tradi- tions. Indeed, it seems to be the very essence of the process em- ployed by the Egyptian and Greek mystery schools and cults going even further back into pre-history."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A LADDER? The great modern initiatory societies of the eighteenth, nine- teenth, and twentieth centuries, including Freemasonry, Martin- ists, the Golden Dawn, and the A .,.A.’., generally viewed this progressive series of awakenings as an ascent up the ten Sephiroth f (or Emanations) on the familiar Qabalistic schema, The Tree o f Life .f Rabbi Ben Clifford often referred to the diagram as “a roadmap from godhead to your head.” The Tree of Life graphically illuminates the fundamental Qabalistic doctrines first revealed in the Sepher Yetzirahi (ar- guably the oldest and most venerable Qabalistic text). The rab- bi's own fanciful “translation” of key sections of the text appears in the Chicken Q abalah .£ In the opening words it reveals that Deity . . . created the Universe (with the help of three imag- inary friends, “ Numbers, Letters, & Words”) in Thirty-Two Mysterious Paths of Wisdom. They consist of Ten Sephi- roth out of nothing and of Twenty-Two Letters.£ The “ Numbers” are described as the path of a lightning flash that strikes down from the pure consciousness of godhead (Sephirah One — Kether, the “Crow n”) through decaying levels of consciousness (Sephiroth Two through N ine), until coming to cosmic full stop at the lowest material level of unawakened humanity ( Sephirah Ten — Malkuth, the “Kingdom ”). While the great initiatory societies of the past did not realis- tically expect their members to immediately achieve the progres- sively higher levels of consciousness exemplified by each Sephi- rah, several prominent initiatory orders designed their dramatic graduated degree experiences as allegorical steps that ascend up"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the Tree of Life (from Malkuth to Kether). They organized the structure of their initiations accordingly. The “Twenty-Two Letters” mentioned in the Sepher Yetzirah are those of the sacred Hebrew alphabet. They represent the funda- mental scaffolding of existence itself. When projected on the Tree of Life, the letters represent twenty-two highly specialized facets of intelligence that serve as conduits between the Sephi- roth and (like electrical transformers) step up or step down the frequencies of consciousness of the Sephiroth they connect. While Ben Clifford acknowledged the genius of using the Tree of Life as a model for a series of mystical initiation ceremonies, for his Order he took a much more fundamental (and perhaps more elegant) approach to initiation. He began with the profound assumption that because the true, unadulterated consciousness of each human is ultimately godhead, then godhead already is our true, natural, and essential identity. We don't need to clim b anywhere. Each of us already is number One on the Tree of Life. All lower (sleepier) levels of consciousness with which we may currently identify are illu- sionary— dream selves that we temporarily misidentify as our Self. According to Ben Clifford, our initial initiatory journey toward enlightenment is not a tree-climbing exercise, but instead, a sim- pie process of remembering, reconnecting, re-attuning, and reres- onating with the primal patterns of who and what we already are. Ben Clifford attempted to illustrate this in his “Tuning Fork of God” parable:? For a moment, let's think of the Supreme Consciousness of Godhead as an infinitely loud musical note (let's say . . ."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"“A”). This supreme “A” note is the vibration made by an infinitely huge mega-A tuning fork that is the source vibra- tion of Cod's pure and absolute consciousness. Now, you and I, because we are . . . made in the image o f God, are also this divine \"A” note. Only we express it individually, as if we had our own m ini-A tuning fork. Our true identity is the note (not the tuning fork). When we are fully awake, our personal, private “mini-A” tuning fork is all clean and shiny, and it vibrates in perfect sympathy and perfect unison with God's great universal “mega-A,” which sets it to eternally vibrating. But, in our unawakened dream state, our personal, minia- ture tuning fork is not clean and shiny. It is rusted over by layer upon layer of dreams. With each built-up layer of dream rust, our mini tuning fork loses more and more of its true tone and perfect pitch. With each layer of rust, we fall deeper and deeper asleep to our true identity. We could attempt to remove the rust from the outside— by trying to chip away, bit by bit, each layer of dream-rust from our personal tuning forks. Indeed, that is exactly what our fellow Qabalists have attempted to do for cen- turies, by using the hammer of intellect and the dull chisel of their dogma-restricted imaginations. This is really hard work, especially when we consider the fact that the “work- man\" doing all this chiseling is still asleep— dreaming within layers of dreams far removed from the wise super- vision of Godhead."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Our process is different. Like King Solomon (who, when beginning the task of building the house of God, first en- tered into the “presence of God” seeking only for Wis- dom), we begin by allowing God's big tuning fork to do the hard work for us. We remove the rust by first triggering the primal vibration deep within our little rusted tuning fork, encouraging it to vibrate again in sympathy with the great mega-note— the great genetic code of God. We do this by persistent exposure to formulae of the uni- versal mega-note itself, until our tuning fork can no longer remain unresponsive to its true vibratory nature; until it answers the call and irresistibly begins to quiver and vi- brate in perfect sympathy with God's great universal note— until the vibration becomes so intense and pure that every speck of dream rust, every veil of illusion, is buzzed off the surface of our tuning fork and shed from our soul. What is the “Genetic Code of God”? What are the “for- mulae of the universal mega-note” whose exposure is going to set our little tuning forks a-tingling? You, my dear little tuning fork, are the formula; you and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are the code. The twenty-two letters are alive and are the secret ingre- dients of a magic pill that, once swallowed, implants itself in the womb of your soul and makes you pregnant with the baby of your own awakened self."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE GENETIC CODE OF GODHEAD In a letter written in 1984 to hedge-fund manager Jonathan Tay- lor, Ben Clifford wrote Dear Jonathan, You have written and told me you wish to be “‘initiated’ into the mysteries of Qabalah.” Let me respond by saying I cannot do that. Only you can initiate yourself into the mysteries of Qabalah. However, all the tools necessary to do this are already in your hands.

If you were fully awake you would see this marvelous code working blissfully away like the components of a well-oiled machine of consciousness. Obviously, you are not fully awake (otherwise you would not be mistakenly believing we are having this conver- sation), but the code is still hard at work at the heart of your existence, and if you really want to, you can re-attune and re-calibrate yourself to it. If you really want to be “initiated” into the mysteries of Qabalah, I advise you to immediately take steps to up- grade your hardware, and reboot the operating system of your body and mind by forming healthy living habits. At the same time, you will need to consciously and will-fully reprogram the software of your soul.

They should serve to remind us that Qabalistic “initiation” is not the same thing as Qabalistic “study” or Qabalistic “practice.” This is an important fact to remember, because Ben Clifford's initiatory program was designed not as a classroom course of in- struction (that reiterates seven centuries of corrupted manuscripts), but rather as a dramatic, interactive experiential process designed to program fundamental modifications deep in the candidate's psychel— changes that can only be made at deeper levels of consciousness than the cognizant instruments of reason and intellect can reach.£ In a scathing letter to the editor of Yad Magazine in 1988, Ben Clifford wrote God consciousness is the cosmic birthright of every monad of existence. It is not reserved only for those who have time to play all day with numbers and Bible verses so they can demonstrate how everything in the universe is probably really something else! We proclaim with smug confidence that the Hebrew alpha- bet (with its Three Mother Letters, Seven Double Letters, and Twelve Simple Letters) is the formula and blueprint of being and existence itself. But are we so arrogant as to be- lieve that anyone who cannot speak a certain language or"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"learn a certain alphabet is barred from activating and ac- cessing the universal formulae these letters symbolize? Hell, no! I'm a Chicken Qabalist!£ Even if the Hebrew alphabet never existed . . . 3 would exist! Space-Time would still be a phenomenon of a threefold environment of U p/D ow n; Right/Left; Front/Back. 7 would exist! There would still be an Above and a Below ; an East and a West ; a North and a South all surrounding a Center point. L/gfit and Sound would still fracture and organize in sevenfold primary spectrums of color and music. 12 would exist! The six directions would still intersect at twelve oblique angles. Light and Sound would continue to fracture and organize as twelvefold secondary spec- trums of color and music. Even if we could not read or write or add or subtract num- bers, the sacred alphabet would still be creating and hold- ing existence together, still penetrating our souls as color vibrations that excite the cones and rods of our eyes; still be resonating in our ears as the ordered harmonics of the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"music of the spheres. As Qabalists, we must first swallow these primordial seeds and plant them deep in the secret center of the soul; then let them germinate quietly inside us, as we tinker with numbers and plod along with what we think is our Qabal- istic studies. Look! You can memorize and juggle and manipulate the numbers and Hebrew letters and words till kingdom come! You can dissect the scriptures till your beard reach- es your knees. But if you haven't first inseminated yourself with the pure, innocent, fundamental code, your seeds will be defective, and you will only succeed in making yourself pregnant with a Qabalistic monster— an altogether un- pleasant bore of an individual, obsessed with your own infinite and irrelevant Qabalistic revelations — connecting everything in the universe to everything else . . . but yourself. Following the classic format of the Egyptian Book o f the Dead,* Ben Clifford's degree ceremonies follow the exploits of the awak- ening candidate as he or she unfolds from one level of con- sciousness to another. At each step, the candidate is met with resistance that is overcome by a peculiar character-building adventure that involves surviving an ordeal specifically linked to the dynamics of the degree.* Passing each degree's ordeal liter- ally mutates the candidate's consciousness so that he or she be- comes a new conscious entity, freshly equipped to perceive and function at the new level, and capable of absorbing that level's"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"new lessons and mysteries. Degree-specific secret words, gestures, grips, and other seem- ingly silly claptrap and signs of recognition are an important as- pect to the initiation experience. During the course of the cere- mony, they are repeatedly drilled into the candidate, until they be- come as familiar as a song. There is a very good reason for this. The ceremonies are designed to trigger subsequent and more intimate initiatory dreams and visions in which the candidate must make use of the Signs, Grips, and Words as tools to re- solve more personal (and often more terrifying) metaphoric chal- lenges."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"HOTEL TEMPLE OF INITIATION It is clear by the notes that accompanied the scripts that most of the initiation weekends were held at hotel venues, the Temple and waiting area being a private banquet room and adjacent con- ference room. Officers and candidates were lodged for the week- end at the same hotel and able to conveniently rest and refresh themselves during breaks. The First-Degree ceremony was ideally conferred upon three candidates per occasion. It focused on the mysteries of the dawn of consciousness and the birth of the Three Mother Letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It was a lengthy ceremony, breaking late in the afternoon for a formal dinner and then a rest period, before continuing late in the evening. The Second- and Third-Degree ceremonies were obviously de- signed to be conferred upon one candidate at a time.£ The Third- Degree ceremony was also lengthy and included a formal dinner and rest period, followed by a “ Midnight Meditation.” Other Third-Degree Initiates living in the vicinity were invited to attend the dinner and meditation, and it appears that it was always an occasion for the warm fellowship such as one might expect from any fraternal organization.

You will probably ask yourself, “ Do all Qabalists feel so bewildered and confused at the begin- ning?” The simple answer is, “H ell yes! Don't worry about it!”* The Hebrew Qabalah has a thousand-year traditional history among scholars and intellectuals of the Jewish religion. Like the illuminated masters of every age and culture, the ancient Qabal- ists were aware that God and the secrets of God are present in all things at all times. Nevertheless, for various reasons, certain passionately religious Qabalists chose to focus their investi- gations exclusively on the books of their own culture's sacred scriptures to extract infinite wisdom and divine mysteries from every letter and word written therein. They associated the letters of their language to numbers so that they might glean more wis- dom from the elegant beauty and music of mathematics. The ancient Jewish Qabalists elevated their art and practice to breathtaking heights of intellectual complexity, but in their reli- gious zeal, some of them became blind to the universality of the Great Work. They became “stiff-necked” and dogmatic, asserting the wisdom of Qabalah can be found only in their own scriptures.

I regret to say that, even today, there are those who insist that in order to study Qabalah, you must be an observant Jew. There are those who will dogmatically insist that women are forbidden to study Qabalah. There are those who sin- cerely believe that only a m arried man over forty years of age (who has fathered at least one male child) . . . who must own his own home, and have servants so that he does not have to wash clothes or cook food or clean can study Qabalah. Dear Friends and Comrades, I ask you: How many of us can say we are able to fulfill these requirements? I certainly cannot. We should always honor and respect the rights of others to their sincere and heartfelt beliefs. But there is a dramatic difference between pious “Bible Scholars” and impartial academic scholars; and there is a profound difference between “Traditional Biblical history” and “empirical and objectively verifiable history.” Mod- ern scholars are almost universal in their assertion that the fundamentals of Qabalistic thought are not the exclusive heritage of any one particular religion or culture. Indeed, the funda- mentals can be traced far back in time . . . even to the Sumerians. In fact, what is commonly known as the Jewish Qabalah actually first developed from the mystic Greek philosophers and their ingenious marriage of the Greek alphabet to sacred numbers. Like the Greeks, Jewish mystics used their alphabets to link let- ters and words to numbers and explored the qualities and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"relationships of numbers in order to connect every idea and con- cept in the universe with every other idea and concept in the uni- verse. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Muslim and Christian mystics were exposed to the Greek and Hebrew Qabalahs, and soon began to understand how this marvelous way of organizing human thought could be applied to their spiritual traditions. In the late 1800s, German and English magicians, especially the magicians of the H erm etic O rder o f the Golden Dawn, gathered up universal concepts shared by many of the world's mythologies and religions; they organized and classified their mysteries on a scaffolding of the Hebrew alphabet and the numbers represented by the letters. It is this material that primarily forms the basis of modern Qabalistic practice. And it is this material that we will be working with in Our Holy Order. Qabalah is not a religion. It matters not what religion you are, or even if you embrace no religion at all. You don't have to believe in the objective reality of gods or angels or demons or spirits. Ultimately, concepts such as gods, angels, demons, spirits, scriptures, words, letters, and numbers are merely colorful metaphors that can bring to life in your imagination the infinite and formless facets of the Supreme Consciousness. As modern Qabalists, we honor and embrace the living allegories of our ancient and orthodox predecessors. Used skillfully, the traditional god-names and archangels and angels and spirits and demons serve, as they have always served, as elegant and dra- matic tools of consciousness expansion. We must not, however,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"allow ourselves to again fall victim to the ancient curse of super- stitiously objectifying these sacred abstractions and creating for ourselves yet another silly belief system — and imprisoning our- selves in deeper and deeper layers of dream.

Each time you read through the script, you will in essence be reliving your initiation.

You will play with this toy as a meditation aid when attuning yourself to the Three Mother Letters. You may also wish to create your own, more substantial piece of art, a sculpture or a painting of the three-colored “star.” Art projects like this are very important for the initiate, who must now also become a Qabalah artist. As I have repeatedly stressed, it is not enough that you be a “Qabalah student” who reads and studies traditional and con- temporary literature. You also must be a “Qabalah artist.” Art touches and moves and transforms us at the most primal spir- itual levels (which is precisely where we want to be touched and moved and transformed if we want to wake up!). Where Qabalah is concerned, our canvas is consciousness, and our palette is made from the numbers, names, shapes, colors, smells, musical notes, and the associated concepts of everything in the entire universe, as they are organized and categorized by the Hebrew alphabet. Like it or not, as a First-Degree Initiate, you are now a Qabalah artist. It doesn't matter if you've never picked up a paint brush or a colored pen before in your life. We want you to start doing something like that now! Involving yourself in small, focused, Qabalistic art projects is a serious continuation of your initiatory experience. It is the fastest method— the shortest shortcut, the laziest lazy person's way— to firmly embed the magic essence of each letter of the Hebrew alphabet and Qabalistic principles in your soul!"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"You are totally free (as all artists must be) to design and create your First-Degree, Mother Letter art pieces.

The image was suddenly withdrawn, leaving a blank white screen upon which floated a “ghost” image of the letter appearing like an apparition of the opposite or “flashing” color. Colors, as we see them with our physical eyes (and which we interpret by our conscious minds), actually appear to us as such because they absorb all colors except the one we are looking at. In other words, what our conscious mind (here on the m aterial plane) sees as red is really green on the im m aterial plane of con- sciousness. Your art assignment for the First-Degree is to create three brightly colored “flash cards,” one for each Mother Letter. Do this first by hand, not computer. You will find the names of the appropriate colors itemized on the Table of the Three Mother Letters. For example, for Aleph: 1. On a plain, bright white piece of 8V2 x 11-inch heavy paper or card stock, lightly trace (in pencil) the outline of a large letter Aleph. 2.

Even a simple art project takes many hours to create; so, while you are struggling with drafts and other mundane, time- consuming chores, you should surround yourself with images, colors, music, flavors, and fragrances that you will thereafter associate with the specific letter you are working on. These as- sociations, of course, can be anything, but it is best if they have some vibratory connection to the letter, color, mood, or some quality or emotion attached to the letter. For example, while working on Aleph, you can chew Juicy Fruit ® gum and scent the room with a light incense, or with fresh lemon (for the yellow color), and repeatedly play light and airy (perhaps flute or harp) musical recordings. You can open a window or turn on a fan. For Mem, you could munch blueberries and repeatedly play a favorite recording of Debussy's La M er or Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. For Shin, you could suck red hot cinnamon candy and play selections from Bizet's Carm en , etc. Whatever you choose, make it simple, strong, memorable, and repetitive. It is even a good thing if you start to feel a little overexposed to these things while you are working. The stronger the sense-memory you associate with the letters, the more com- pletely you will have installed them."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Pitch Pipe Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet represents a specific layer or level of universal consciousness, which is reflected in the nat- ural vibratory harmonies of all existence, including the frequen- cies of light and color. At various times during the First-Degree Initiation Ceremony, the movements and the actions that you and the officers made were accompanied by specific musical notes played by our talented (but unseen) Musician. Linking of the Hebrew letters with their specific musical notes is a tech- nique intended to affect you subconsciously and trigger within your psyche a subliminal resonance to those specific frequen- cies of consciousness. In your daily practices and meditations, however, we want you to go out of your way to consciously attune yourself with these specific notes. To help you do this, we are pleased to present you with a quality pitch pipe £ for you to use in the various exer- cises in your First-Degree Portfolio. Of course, if you are a musi- cian or have an organ or other electronic musical device in your home, this pitch pipe will be unnecessary. Your First-Degree Home Temple Now that you are a First-Degree Initiate, you are encouraged to set up your own First-Degree Temple.

Sound like fun? It is! Theoretically, your Temple is a symbolic miniature of the Temple in which you were initiated. But you won't need a whole house or building for your Temple. You won't even need a sepa- rate room (although that would be very cool). You just need a little dedicated space on the floor somewhere for you to place your Altar. Your First-Degree Altar Of course, you can get as fancy as you want with your Altar (after all, you're a Qabalah artist and can go as wild as your sense of art dictates!), but it doesn't need to be a big, expensive piece of furniture. A piece of wood raised from the floor by a few bricks and then covered with a beautiful cloth would work just fine for a First-Degree Altar. It only needs to be stable because it will serve both as your A ltar o f Incense and your Altar o f Light. As you will probably be doing much of your meditation practices while sitting on or near the floor, a low Altar would work beautifully. Be creative and have fun decorating your Altar. At the very least, it should be able to support the candelabra and an incense burner.

The three Hebrew letters them- selves should also be visible. Perhaps some Tarot art . . .

It is hoped that you will establish a reasonable daily routine and will be diligent in following it for a period of ninety days.

While you're in a vision (or dying), symbols are living things— and living things are symbols.]£ The purpose of this exercise is to attune and acclimate your psy- chic body!] to the particular frequency of consciousness (Qabal- istic Intelligence) exemplified by each letter. This is done by the technique of skrying]£ (or traveling in vision)— projecting your consciousness through the gateway^ of the color-polarized floating ghost image of the letter itself, and then observing in vi- sion the conditions of its unique “world.” The details of these vi- sions are unique to each individual. Nobody else can possibly interpret them for you because your visions are delivered through your own personal vocabulary of symbols and metaphors. Once you become accustomed to the technique, you should then start to take control of the experience and become a proac- tive character in your own visionary adventure. Then things get interesting, and the mysteries of the letters begin to unfold as they can only unfold for you. Ride on wings of angels, soar through the heavens, let dragons swallow you, and see what's inside. [Note:] It is vitally important to record the results of each and every skrying session in your journal.

With practice, you will become better attuned to (and better able to interpret) the realities of that level. [Another Note:] Try to “bring back” from every skrying session one symbol or image that you can at least temporarily associate with that world. Draw this symbol in your journal next to its He- brew letter. Here's why. In the objective world of everyday con- sciousness, living things are living things, and symbols are sym- bols. But on the vision plane, it's not like that— there symbols (geometric figures, signs, logos, doodles) are living things. Con- versely, living things (dragons, lions, angels, aardvarks) in vi- sions are symbols of more complex and intangible qualities, hopes, fears, and so on. So, when you bring a symbol back from your vision, you are literally importing a living spiritual being into your sleepy world of objective reality. Treat it with respect, and use it as a key when you reenter that plane during your next session.

Comfortably seat yourself as near as possible to the two cards so that when you gaze at the letter, it essentially fills your field of vision. 4. Take your pitch pipe, find the E note, and blow. 5.

On a plain, bright white piece of 8V2 x 11-inch heavy paper or card stock, lightly trace (in pencil) the outline of a large letter Beth. 2. Using yellow oil, acrylic, or watercolor paint or pens, care- fully fill in the Beth. Be careful to cover over or otherwise erase the pencil line.

Again, it will serve both as your Altar o f Incense and your Altar o f Light. You will replace the three-stemmed candelabra of the First-Degree with the seven-branched Menorah of the Second- Degree. Setup Suggestions Everything in your Second-Degree Temple should bring to your mind some quality or aspect of the number seven and the Seven Double Letters. Your Temple should be illuminated by a seven-branched Menorah with colored candles (from left to right: red, green, yel- low, black, blue, violet, and orange). Your Altar cloth and other hangings could reflect these same colors. Incense should be chosen to be suggestive of planetary influences. The seven He- brew letters themselves should also be visible. Perhaps some Tarot art of the trumps: Magician, High Priestess, Empress, Wheel o f Fortune, Tower, Sun, and Universe.

H T and WG should make m ental note o f key issues in Candidate's stated desires, and, if the opportunity later presents itself, address those personal issues specifically during the evening Banquet.] [Done.] HT: Your words ring true and reveal to us you are indeed in the process of awakening. This pleases us, for in fact . . . we need you. Indeed, without you, none of us would be here— none of this would be happening.

You are the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"temple , and you are the teachings. You are the shrine, and you are the God within the shrine. For the moment, however, this reality remains for you purely theoretical. So, for the moment, let us simply say that you have reached the level in Our Holy Order where you must come to the full realization that you are no longer merely the Candidate, but are, in fact, the key officer of your own initiation. And so, I ask you to linger with us a moment longer and assist us in our work— for three Masters o f the Three and Seven Letters are required to prop- erly Illuminate the Third-Degree Temple before work can begin. [At this point the Temple is still lighted only by the three candles o f the candelabra and by the single Tav candle o f the M enorah.] [WG goes to the Altar o f Incense and adds more incense to the charcoal.] [H T rises from his chair and walks to the area ju st east o f the Altar o f Light.] HT: Worthy Guide, please escort our Sister to west of the Altar of Light. [Done. WG stands to Candidate's right to assist.] HT: [Cont.] We meet at the Altar of Light to enlist your assistance to illu- minate the Temple; for the Sacred Light comes not from the glow of lamps and candles, or even from the fire of the Sun or from"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"the stars. The Sacred Light comes from you , and you alone. Dear Sister, are you prepared to claim your birth-right as the Sacred Light? CANDIDATE: Yes. HT: [Cont.] Then I say to you: Seek yourself first in the Darkness; for in truth, if you cannot discover the Light in the Darkness , you will never discover it anywhere. Please extinguish these dream flames with the spirit of your living breath. [Candidate blows out the candles , plunging the Temple into absolute darkness. A ll m aintain silence fo r approximately thirty seconds.] HT: How peaceful and profound is this Darkness Divine. Such is God-consciousness. No name. No form. No nature. No dream of light. No dream of time. No dream of space. No dream of mo- tion. No dream . . . not even the dream of Self. Nothing to cleave the sweet Darkness and deface this absolute, infinite, and eternal bliss. [H T lights a long-burning match HT: [Cont.] But Absolute Self yearned to know itself—to identify itself. It hungered for Self-Awareness. So, in order to touch itself— in order to experience its own infinite nature, it forsook the paradise"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"of Selfless Self and entered a master-dream of all possible possi- bilities. It concentrated its Absoluteness into a seed of infinite potentiality — a Formless Primal Nothingness, fro m which ALL that can ever be proceeds; and a Nothingness into which ALL that could ever be returns. [H T lights the black Tav candle o f the M enorah.] HT: [Cont.] The Absolute sealed its self into itself as the Sacred Letter Tav. The signature of God. [W C plucks the lighted black Tav candle fro m the M enorah and presents it to the Candidate. For the moment, it is the only light in the Temple.] HT: [Cont.] Tav said, “I AM,” and collapsed its Nothingness into a dream Point— a Singularity without size or position; for indeed, there was no place for the Point to dwell but inside itself. [W C quietly instructs the Candidate to use the f a m e o f the black Tav candle to light the yellow Aleph candle on the candelabra.] HT: [Cont.] And with the Light of the Mother Letter Aleph, the Point created a line that extended upwards and downwards, creating the infin- itely ascending Above and the infinitely descending Below.

What of the Double Letter Tav , the Formless Primal Center? Is not Tav one of the Seven? Is not Tav a Planetary Sphere? HT: Yes, Worthy Guide. Tav is the Sphere of Saturn , but Saturn is unique among Planetary Spheres. On the Tree o f Life , Saturn is the third sacred Emanation of the Supernal Triad that dwells above the terrible Abyss that separates pure God-consciousness from the fragments of dreams we mistake for reality. Saturn is older than the Gods and dwells in a palace quite above, within, and beyond the six spheres of the Macrocosm. . . .

How- ever, even though you are facing your reflection in the mirror, your image is in profile. Try as you may, you can only see the left half of your face and body.

She holds on to your left arm and is trying to kiss you on your check. On your right stands a very handsome, rugged, and masculine version of your- self who tries to kiss you on the other cheek.

This time you are dressed as a very important Priest or Holy person. There are two monks kneeling in front of you to serve you. You don't look at them, because you are deeply entranced in serene meditation. You point to your ear, as if to say, “Listen to the voice of your soul.” Be still for a moment.

You will again need to refer to other books in your own Qabalah reference library, without which your Qabalistic calculations will be impossible. For the Third-Degree, we especially recommend: • Sepher Yezirah: in its entirety, especially Chapters V and VI. Also review as many different translations of the text as possible. Always keep in mind that many seemingly con- flicting Qabalistic concepts can be simultaneously true; but to avoid being hopelessly confused, work only with one system at a time. • Chicken Q abalah : Chapters III and X • 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings And for other topics of general research: • Fractals. Look it up, and behold the Qabalistic wonders of fractals. • The twelve signs of the zodiac; the twelve astrological houses; the zodiacal paths on the Tree of Life; and how the relationships of the elements and planets affect (and are af- fected by) each zodiac sign. • Secondary colors of the rainbow, and the twelve-note"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"musical scale.

(You can even enlarge it a bit if you like.) Print it on the heaviest white paper or card stock available to you. 2. Carefully cut out the pattern. 3. Fold at the lines. When you are done folding, your dodeca- hedron will almost form itself! 4. Tape each edge to its neighbor. (Some edges can be taped from the inside, but some, unfortunately, will need to be taped on the outside.) Note: To avoid this, before cutting out, you may wish to allow room for folding tabs along some of the edges, so they may be more easily taped on the inside, avoiding the necessity to leave exposed tape on the outside surface. Fold in such order that before you completely seal the do- decahedron, you can insert your Second-Degree Cube. Note: To make sure all twenty-two letters are included in your Dodecahedron Rattling Toy, be sure your Second- Degree Cube is properly pierced by your First-Degree pipe cleaner star.

You will find the appropriate colors itemized on the Table of Simple Letters. For example, for Heh: 1. On a plain, bright white piece of 8V2 x 11-inch heavy paper or card stock, lightly trace (in pencil) the outline of a large letter Heh. 2. Using scarlet oil, acrylic, or watercolor paint or pens, care- fully fill in the Heh. Be careful to cover over or otherwise erase the pencil line. Make eleven more flash cards: one for Vav (red-orange); one for Zain (orange); one for Cheth (amber); one for Teth (yellow-greenish); one for Yod (green-yellowish); one for Lamed (emerald green); one for Nun (green-blue); one for Samekh (blue); one for Ayn (indigo); one for Tzaddi (Vio- let); and one for Qoph (crimson-ultraviolet).

Your Altar should be illuminated by the three candles of the First-Degree candelabra and the seven candles of the Second- Degree Menorah.

As always, these exercises are not difficult and do not require a great deal of time to execute.

But Tarot is not the only way the sacred alphabet can be utilized for divinatory purposes. Now that you are armed with all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, you can perform all manner of divinatory exercises, selecting a small number of randomly generated let- ters for the purpose of general augury or to answer specific questions. Possible techniques and applications are limited only by your own imagination. I suggest that you start your exploration by seeking a generic “daily oracle” from three randomly generated Hebrew letters. The technique is simple, but the insights about yourself that you can gain can be profound and life changing. 1. Randomly generate three Hebrew letters. (If you have a twenty-two-sided gaming die, you could simply roll it three times; or any way you can devise to arrive at three num- bers between ו and 22.) 2. Write down all the permutations (i.e., ABC, BCA, CAB, CBA, ACB, BAC). • Using your Hebrew/English Dictionary, determine what, if anything, these letters actually spell in Hebrew. (They might even spell something in English!) • Using your 777 Tables, explore other Qabalistic words of significance that share the same number."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Continue to tinker with the letters using every technique of “games Qabalists play.” Even if you do not understand the “oracle,” record the re- suits and your impressions in your journal."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"VALEDICTION As I've repeatedly reminded you, Qabalah is a system of orga- nizing your mind so that it may more perfectly reflect the Uni- versal Consciousness of Existence itself, and Qabalistic exer- cises and meditations are designed to show us how everything in our world is connected to everything else, how everything is the reflection of everything else, and how every idea and thought are connected to every other idea and thought. Modern mathe- matics offers us a perfectly beautiful and elegant model of what Qabalists (kabbalists/cabalists) have been working with for cen- turies: fractals. Fractals are a mathematical phenomenon that occurs on all levels of nature. Expressed graphically, fractals generate similar replicating patterns at increasingly larger and/or increasingly smaller scales— each level almost identical to the level above it and to the level below it (“evolving” or \"expanding symmetry”). You've probably seen artistically stunning computer-generated examples of fractals. The natural laws that are illustrated by frac- tals are also on display at all times in terms of consciousness. The Supreme Consciousness of Godhead is the master pat- tern; and the infinite multiplicity of all facets of manifest creation (including you and me, and the dimension and objective “real- ity” we believe we inhabit) is merely a fractal chain reaction of God-consciousness. Consciousness. The primary Hermetic axiom “As above, so below” and the Qabalistic adage “ Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether, only after another manner” are explicit declarations of this fundamental truth.

That is why the classic Qabalah-based “God Names” and the traditional names of archangels, angels, intelli- gences, and spirits are often found to be mathematically linked to each other by prime numbers or other numeric harmonics based on the number of a specific Sephirah or Path. For example, some of the \"angels” traditionally associated with the Planetary Sphere of Mercury (Sephirah #8) are the Intel- ligence, “Tirial”: )לאירים( ([Heb: reading right to left, Teth, Yod, Resh, Yod, Aleph, Lamed]) ( 260 = ( = ל א י ר י טI{1 -(8 x 8 ) } 8 ■ל־ and the Spirit, \"Taphthartharath”: )תרתרתפת( ([Heb: reading right to left, Tav, Peh, Tav, Resh, Tav, Resh, Tav]) (0 64)- 1} 1 = 2080 .)2 r8 תר תר תפ ת( = Also, two Intelligences traditionally associated with the zodiac sign Gemini (which is ruled by Mercury) are “Din”: )ויד("},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"([Heb: reading right to left, Daleth, Yod, Nun]) 82 64 or = (ויד) and “Doni\": )ינד( ([Heb: reading right to left, Daleth, Nun, Yod]) (64 = (ינד or 82 Obviously, the number eight (and all cosmic and abstract meanings to all things eight-ish) is the common denomination and “tonic” note within which these “spirits” vibrate and harmo- nize at their specific level. But as you thumb through all the reference books in your library, you will encounter hundreds of examples where these alphanumeric harmonies do not neatly ap- pear in a consistent manner. That is to be expected, given the fact that most of our reference books are compilations from multiple sources written and rewritten, translated and retrans- lated from Hebrew to multiple languages, all with different pro- nunciations and renderings of Hebrew— some even mixed with Greek and Latin and then into English! However, it is abundantly clear that in the mythical “ Eden” of the ideal and pristine Qabalah, the divine letters began as the perfect alphanumeric building blocks forming divine words , which were the perfect alphanumeric building blocks forming di- vine sentences , which were the perfect alphanumeric building blocks forming divine paragraphs , which were the perfect al- phanumeric building blocks forming divine chapters , which were"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"the perfect alphanumeric building blocks of the Book o f Life itself . . . to the M ind o f God itself.

But Tiriel, and Taph- thartharath, and Din and Doni (and all the traditional angels and spirits of the Qabalah and medieval magick) are not in and of themselves crystalized or sacrosanct magical “beings” living objective lives in some Qabalistic boarding house.

Forms and shapes and colors hide the Soul o f Creation. But the Beauty o f the Holy Teachings is seen equally in the Darkness and the Light. — Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford from the First-Degree Initiation It is often said that an artist never finishes a creation but simply abandons it. It certainty feels that way to me. Over the last thirty years I have written quite a number of books, songs, articles, and essays, and, I confess (with no small measure of frustration), they all remain abandoned works-in-progress. The present book has proved to be no exception. Nonetheless, I believe this is how it always must be if my work is truly a “creation.” After all, parents lovingly shelter, nourish, and instruct their children (indeed, many parents persist for- ever). But, naturally, there comes a time when the child, as a vi- able creature, must be unleashed upon the universe to do what- ever must be done in order to fulfill and exhaust his or her cos- mic potentiality. And so, I am about to abandon another child and unleash it upon the world to (for good or ill) exhaust its cos- mic potentiality. It has been my honor and my pleasure to serve as biographer, curator, and editor on behalf of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford. His adolescent impatience with petrified traditions (and his"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"insistence that any spiritual study is useless, unless it facilitates some degree of self-transformation and illumination) mirrors uncannily my own. I'm sure there will be those who will be disappointed that this book does not shed new light on the elegant minutia of the Torah or Sepher Yetzirah or Heichalot or Bahir or Zohar or Sefer Raziel HaM alakh, or Liber AL vel Legis, or spend time playing Gematria games or stacking Qliphoth under Intelligences under Angels under Archangels under God Names. But frankly, those debates (from highly knowledgeable participants) can be found in abun- dance with a single click on a computer link. The rabbi made it clear in the First-Degree Lecture that such Qabalistic tinkerings will always play a part in every Qabalist's personal work and recreation, and the reference material for such exercises is easily found. But he also cautioned that enmeshing the mind (Ruach) in this stuff before the Soul (Neshamah) is prepared is like casting the seeds of the Hebrew alphabet upon the surface of untilled land. They'll sit there— in their unique beauty and potentiality. But, unless the earth is first broken and plowed, the seeds will never take root and grow. They will just remain on the surface as husks— rattling noisily against one another in the wind.l I hope the reader will at least try to appreciate what the rabbi was attempting to do with the initiation ceremonies, toys, exer- cises, and meditations of “Our Holy Order.” Hopefully, I have organized the material in such a way that your reading experience has itself been an initiatory experience, and that the seeds of the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Hebrew alphabet are now stirring and sprouting in your newly mutated Neshamah.

THE DEGREE CEREMONIES: INTRODUCTORY WORDS 1 Ben Clifford disliked the word psyche, believing it too vague. He used it on occasion when it generally served the purpose. A more correct word in this instance might be Nesham ah — the Soul Intuition: The third and second highest of the four parts of the Soul; corresponds to the first Heh ( ה ) [Heb: Heh]of the Tetragrammaton. See Chicken Qabalah, p. 99• 2 Ruach — the Intellect: The second of the four parts of the Soul; corresponds to Vav ( ו ) [Heb: Vav]of the Tetragrammaton. See Chicken Qabalah, p. 98. 3 It is a well-known fact that even though Ben Clifford was adept in his mastery of the Qabalistic applications of the Hebrew alphabet and key words, he was not fluent in the Hebrew Ian- guage. 4 The Book o f the Com ing Forth by Day.

A separate script annotated especially for the Musician was also found, giving more technical and detailed suggestions for the music and projector cues. This script, however, provides more than adequate instructions in footnotes. CEREMONY OF INITIATION: FIRST-DEGREE 1 The waiting area for the First-Degree is a simple room adja- cent to (or very near) the Temple room. There should be a comfortable chair for each candidate and a coffee table with cool water and light snacks. There should also be a small table supporting a mirror and a single white candle. 2 Editor's note: In this place in the initiation script, when WG makes reference to directions (East/West/North/South), she or he is not referring to geographic directions (or Temple directions as indicated by the small compass on the illus- tration of the Temple). Obviously, at the initial stages of ere- ation (which the WG is enacting with these gestures), there is as yet no dimension of space, so the concept of geo- graphic directions has no meaning. “Right/Left/Front/Back” would be just as descriptive. 3 See “Preliminary Notes” above for First-Degree Sign, Grip, and Word."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"4 If the Candidate happens to answer “ No” to this question, WG shall repeat the question slowly and clearly. If the Candi- date again answers “ No,” WG shall remove him or her from the Temple and firmly, yet courteously, inform the Candidate that he or she must immediately leave the building and may not reapply for initiation for a period of one year. This is the standard practice whenever a Candidate refuses to respond in such a manner as to allow the ceremony to continue. 5 The Candidate and officers remain unshod whenever in the Temple room. 6 Jah, spelled Yod Heh ( הי) [Heb: Heh Yod]. 2 See note above. 8 “Hell, yes (or Hell, no)! D on't worry about it!” is one of several classic affirmations o f Chicken Qabalah. 2 See Chicken Qabalah, Chapter 2, The Ten Command-Rants, 15-24: 1. All is One. 2. The First Command-Rant is a lie. All is Nothing. 3. There really isn't a creation, time or space, heaven or earth . . . but there is a you! 4. We perceive there is a creation, time and space, heaven and earth, because of a fundamental defect in our powers of perception. 5. This defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome. 6. In order to overcome our defective powers of perception we must be willing to abuse them until they break. 7. Everything in heaven and earth is connected to everything in heaven and earth. 8. Everything in heaven and earth is the reflection of"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"everything in heaven and earth. 9. Everything in heaven and earth contains the pattern of everything in heaven and earth. 10. Look hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything. סו Editor's note: Marginal notes to the ritual script (and cater- ing receipts found in the rabbi's records) suggest that an elaborately organized “evening meal and entertainment” were an integral and important part of the initiation ceremony it- self. It was clear Ben Clifford wanted the Candidates to thor- oughly enjoy themselves with food, wine, music, and laugh- ter. It was also clear that he wanted the Candidates to have sufficient time after dinner to “sleep off” the effects of the festivities before bathing and returning for the midnight meditation and conclusion of the initiation. ת Ideally, the scale range of the instrument should be from ex- tremely low (e.g., the bass pedal notes of a pipe organ) to ex- tremely high (e.g., high-frequency electronic tone). If this cannot be arranged, notes played on an organ, a harmonium, a piano, handbells, or a guitar will suffice. The only require- ment is that several sustained notes creating specific musical notes and chords must be possible. Editor's note: A choirmaster's pitch pipe was found among the rabbi's degree papers, suggesting that for at least one initiation ceremony he intoned the notes himself or enlisted the services of singers to create the musical effect cues. 12 Editor's note: The slide numbers appear to be irrelevant to anyone but the Musician/Technician. The extant copies of"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"the script were unclear in spots, so we've simply left a ques- tion mark in place of a number. 23 A is the primal vibratory note attributed to the Hebrew letter Tav in its role as the primal dimensionless singularity of pre- creation and the primal center of dimensional creation. 24 E is the note associated with the Hebrew letter Aleph. 23 Note concerning the optical effect of the polarized or “flash- ing” colors: Although the phenomenon of the floating “ghost image” of the Hebrew letter is easy to produce on a brightly lit screen, the Candidates at first may need to be trained to see and hold the image in their mind's eye after they reclose their eyes. It may be necessary (especially for the first few tries) for the Officers (and Musician) to cycle through the se- ries of slides several times until the Candidates excitedly indicate they “see” it. 26 For some people, the phenomenon of the floating ghost image is subtle and not immediately recognized (at least for the first few experiments). HT and WG should assure them- selves that the Candidate is clearly recognizing the flashing color event before continuing with the next letter. 22 C is the note associated with the Hebrew letter Shin. 28 The Closing ceremony of each degree is a modified reversal of the Temple Opening (which the Candidates do not see). It is important that the newly initiated Candidates witness and take part in the Closing ceremonies so they may fully appre- ciate the formulae of the Letters the degree exemplifies. FIRST-DEGREE STUDY PROGRAM 2 See Appendix I for a partial list of works the rabbi expected every initiate to own. The list has been slightly updated by the"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"editors to include valuable texts that have become available since the rabbi's disappearance. 2 In correspondence and essays, the rabbi inconsistently used the spelling Sepher Yetzirah. However, when making refer- ence to a specific edition (as in this case), he used the partic- ular spelling of the title Sepher Yezirah used by the publisher. 3 In contrast to traditions of other initiatory societies of the past (who tried to maintain a strict code of secrecy concerning their sacred ceremonies), it appears that the rabbi was happy to freely disseminate texts of the ceremonies without any mention of secrecy whatsoever. 4 P. 17 of this book. 5 Editor's note: Unfortunately, costs prohibit the publisher from including a pitch pipe with this book. Inexpensive quality pitch pipes are available at music stores (and, of course, on the internet). 6 The self-applied Touch o f Awakening: right thumb on one's own right eyelid; right middle finger on left eyelid; right fore- finger on center of forehead (third eye). 2 Dawn? Let's not kid ourselves. Few of us can arrange our lives to be able to do this regularly at dawn. The important thing is to take a few minutes every day (after you awaken and before you leave for work, school, or whatever occupies your day). 8 Always first cleanse your lungs with three cleansing breaths prior to any and every breathing exercise.
