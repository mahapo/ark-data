We could not remain stationary however much we wish ed. Every right-thinking person wants not merely to move thro ugh life like a sound-producing, perambulating plant, but to develo p - to improve - and to continue the development mentally to the close of physical life. This development can occur only through the improvement of the quality of individual thought and the ideals, actions and conditions that arise as a consequence. Hence a study of the creative processes of thought and how to apply them is of supreme importance to each one of us. This knowledge is the means whereby the evolution of human life on earth may be hastened and uplifted in the process. Humanity ardently seeks \"The Tr uth\" and explores every avenue to it. In this process it has produced a special literature, which ranges the whole gamut of thought from th e trivial to the sublime - up from Divination, through all the Ph ilosophies, to the final lofty Truth of \"The Master Key\". The \"Master Key\" is here given to the world as a means of tapping the great Cosmic Inte lligence and attracting from it that which corresponds to the ambitions, and aspirations of each reader. Every thing and institution we s ee around us, created by human agency, had first to exist as a thought in some human mind. Thought therefore is constructive. Human thought is the spiritual power of the cosmos operating th rough its creature man. \"The Master Key\" instructs the reader how to use that power, and use it both constructively and creatively. The things and conditions we desire to become realities we must first create in thought. \"The Master Key\" explains and guides the process."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"The Master Key\" teaching has hitherto been published in the form of a Correspondence Course of 24 lessons, delivered to students one per week for 24 weeks. The reader, who now receives the whole 24 parts at one times, is wa rned not to attempt to read the book like a novel, but to treat it as a course of study and conscientiously to imbibe the mean ing of each part - reading and re-reading one part only per week before proceedi ng to the next. Otherwise the later parts will te nd to be misunde rstood and the reader's time and mone y will be wasted. Used as thus instructed \"The Mast er Key\" will make of the reader a greater, better personality, and equipped with a new power to achieve any worthy personal purp ose and a new ability to enjoy life's beauty and wonder.

BURGESS"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Foreword Some men seem to attract success, power, wealth, attainment, with very little conscious effort; others conquer with great difficulty; still others fail altogether to re ach their ambitions, desires and ideals. Why is this so? Why sh ould some men realize their ambitions easily, others with diffi culty, and still others not at all? The cause cannot be physical, else the most perfect men, physically, would be the most successful. The difference, therefore, must be mental - must be in the mind; hence mind must be the creative force, must constitu te the sole difference between men. It is mind, therefore, which overcomes environment and every other obstacle in the path of men. When the creative power of thought is fully understood, its effect will be seen to be ma rvelous. But such resu lts cannot be secured without proper application, dili gence, and concentration. The student will find that the laws gover ning in the mental and spiritual world are as fixed and infallible as in the material world. To secure the desired results, then, it is ne cessary to know the law and to comply with it. A proper complianc e with the law will be found to produce the desired result with invariable exactitude. The student who learns that power comes from within, that he is weak only because he has depended on he lp from outside, and who unhesitatingly throws himself on his own thought, instantly rights himself, stands erect , assumes a dominant attitude, and works miracles. It is evident, therefore, that he who fails to fully investigate and take advantage of the wonderful pr ogress which is being made in this last and greatest science, will soon be as far behind as the man who would refuse to acknowledge and accept the benefits which have accrued to mankin d through an understanding of the laws of electricity."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Of course, mind creates negative conditions just as readily as favorable conditions, and when we consciously or unconsciously visualize every kind of lack, limita tion and discord, we create these conditions; this is what many are unconsciously doing all the time. This law as well as eve ry other law is no resp ecter of persons, but is in constant operation and is relentlessly bringing to each individual exactly what he ha s created; in other words, \"Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.\" Abundance, therefore, depends up on a recognition of the laws of Abundance, and the fact that Mind is not only the creator, but the only creator of all there is. Certainly nothing can be created, before we know that it can be created and then make the proper effort. There is no more Electricity in th e world today than there was fifty years ago, but until someone recogn ized the law by which it could be made of service, we received no benefit; now that the law is understood, practically the whole wo rld is lit by it. So with the law of Abundance; it is only those who recognize the law and place themselves in harmony with it, who share in its benefits. The scientific spirit no w dominates every field of effort, relations of cause and effect are no longer ignored. The discovery of a region of law marked an epoch in human progress. It eliminated the elemen t of uncertainty and caprice in men's lives, and substituted la w, reason and certitude. Men now understand that for every result there is an adequate and definite cause, so that when a give n result is desired, they seek the condition by which alone this result may be attained. The basis upon which all law rests was disc overed by inductive reasoning which consists of comparing a number of separate instances with one another until the common factor which gives rise to them all is seen."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"It is this method of study to which the civilized nations owe the greater part of their prosperity an d the more valuable part of their knowledge; it has lengthened lif e, it has mitigated pain, it has spanned rivers, it has brightened th e night with the splendor of day, extended the range of vision, accelerated motion, annihilated distance, facilitated intercourse, and enabled men to descend into the sea, and into the air. What wonder then that men soon endeavored to extend the blessings of this system of study to their method of thinking, so that when it became plainly evident that certain results followed a particul ar method of thinking it only remained to classify these results. This method is scientific, and it is the only method by which we shall be permitted retain that de gree of liberty and freedom which we have been accustomed to look upon as an inalienable right, because a people is safe at home and in the world only if national preparedness mean such things as growing surplus of health, accumulated efficiency in public and private business of whatever sort, continuous advance in the science and art of acting together, and the increasingly dominant end eavor to make all of these and all other aspects of national deve lopment center and revolve about ascending life, single and collec tive, for which science, art and ethics furnish guidance and controlling motives. The Master Key is based on absolute scientific truth and will unfold the possibilities that lie do rmant in the individual, and teach how they may be brought into pow erful action, to increase the person's effective capacity, bringi ng added energy, discernment, vigor and mental elasticity . The student who gains an understanding of the mental laws which are unfolded will come into the possession of an ability to secure results hitherto undreamed of, and which has reward s hardly to be expressed in words."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It explains the correct use of both the receptive and active elements of the mental nature, and instruct s the student in the recognition of opportunity; it strengthens the will and reasoning powers, and teaches the cultivation and best us es of imagination, desire, the emotions and the intuitio nal faculty. It gives initiative, tenacity of purpose, wisdom of choice, in telligent sympathy and a thorough enjoyment of life on its higher planes. The Master Key teaches the use of Mind Power, true Mind Power, not any of the substitutes and perv ersions; it has not hing to do with Hypnotism, Magic or any of the more or less fascinating deceptions by which many are led to think that something can be had for nothing. The Master Key cultivates and deve lops the understanding which will enable you to control the body and thereby the health. It improves and strengthens the Memory. It develops Insight, the kind of Insight which is so rare, the kind which is the distinguishing characteristic of every successful business man, the kind which enables men to see the possibilities as well as the difficulties in every situation, the kind which enables men to discern opportunity close at h and, for thousands fail to see opportunities almost within their gr asp while they are industriously working with situations which unde r no possibility can be made to realize any substantial return. The Master Key develops Mental Power which means that others instinctively recognize that you are a person of force, of character - that they want to do what you wa nt them to do; it means that you attract men and things to you; th at you are what some people call \"lucky\", that \"things\" come you wa y' that you have come into an understanding of the fundamental laws of Nature , and have put yourself in harmony with them; that you are in tune with Infinite; that you understand the law of attraction, the Natural laws of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"growth, and the Psychological laws on which all advantages in the social and business world rest. Mental Power is creative power, it gives you the ability to create for yourself; it does not mean th e ability to take something away from someone else. Nature never does things that way. Nature makes two blades for grass grow where one grew before, and Mind Power enables men to do the same thing. The Master Key develops insi ght and sagacity, increased independence, the ability an d disposition to be he lpful. It destroys distrust, depression, fear, melancholia, and every form of lack limitation and weakness, including pain and disease; it awakens buried talents, supplies initiative, force, energy , vitality - it awakens an appreciation of the beautiful in Art, Literature and Science. It has changed the lives of thousands of men and women, by substituting definite pr inciples for uncertai n and hazy methods - and principles for the foundati on upon which every system of efficiency must rest. Elbert Gary, the chairman of the United States Steel Corporation, said \"The services of advisors, in structors, efficiency experts in successful management are indispensable to most business enterprises of magnitude, but I deem the recognition and adoption of right principles vastly more importance.\" The Master Key teaches right pri nciples, and suggests methods for making a practical application of the principles; in that it differs from every other course of study. It teaches that the only possible value which can attach to any princi ple is in its application. Many read books, take home study courses, attend lectures all their lives without ever making any progress in demonstrating the value of the principles involved. The Ma ster Key suggests methods by"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"which the value of the principles taught may be demonstrated and put in actual practice in the daily experience. There is a change in the thought of the world. This change is silently transpiring in our midst, and is more important than any which the world has un dergone since the downf all of Paganism. The present revolution in the opinions of all classes of men, the highest and most cultured of men as well as those of the laboring class, stands unparalleled in the history of the world. Science has of late made such vast discoveries, has revealed such an infinity of resources, has u nveiled such enormous possibilities and such unsuspected forces, that scientific men more and more hesitate to affirm certain theories as established and indubitable or to deny certain other theories as absurd or impossible, and so a new civilization is being born; customs, creeds, and cruelty are passing; vision, faith and service ar e taking their place. The fetters of tradition are being melted off fr om humanity, and as the dross of materialism is being consumed, thou ght is being liberated and truth is rising full orbed before an astonished multitude. The whole world is on the eve of a new consciousness, a new power and a new consciousness, a new power and a new realization of the resources within the self. The last century saw the most magnificent material progress in history. The present century will produce the greatest progress in mental and spiritual power. Physical Science has resolved matter into molecu les, molecules into atoms, atoms into energy, and it has rema ined for Sir Ambrose Fleming, in an address before the Royal Institution, to resolve this energy into mind. He says: \"In its ultimate essence, energy may be incomprehensible by us except as an exhibition of the direct operation of that which we call Mind or Will.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Let us see what are the most powerful forces in Nature. In the mineral world everything is soli d and fixed. In the animal and vegetable kingdom it is in a state of flux, forever changing, always being created and recreated. In th e atmosphere we find heat, light and energy. Each realm becomes fi ner and more spiritual as we pass from the visible to the invisibl e, from the coarse to the fine, from the low potentiality to high potentiality. When we reach the invisible we find energy in its purest and most volatile state. And as the most powerful forces of Nature are the invisible forces, so we find that the most powerful forces of man are his invisible forces, his spiritual force, and th e only way in which the spiritual force can manifest is through the pr ocess of thinking. Thinking is the only activity which the spirit po ssesses, and thought is the only product of thinking. Addition and subtraction are therefore spiritual transactions; reasoning is a spiritual process; ideas are spirit ual conceptions; questions are spiritual searchlights and logic, argument and philosophy is spiritual machinery. Every thought brings in to action certain physi cal tissue, parts of the brain, nerve or muscle. Th is produces an actual physical change in the construction of the tissue. Therefore it is only necessary to have a ce rtain number of thoughts on a given subject in order to bring about a co mplete change in the physical organization of a man. This is the process by which fa ilure is changed to success. Thoughts of courage, power, inspir ation, harmony, are substituted for thoughts of failure, despair, lack, limitation and discord, and as these thoughts take root, the ph ysical tissue is changed and the individual sees life in a new light , old things have actually passed away, all things have become new, he is born again, this time born of the spirit, life has a new meani ng for him, he is reconstructed and is filled with joy, confi dence, hope, energy. He sees"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"opportunities for success to which he was heretofore blind. He recognizes possibilities which before had no meaning for him. The thoughts of success with which he has been impregnated are radiated to those around him, and they in turn help him onward and upward; he attract to him new and successful associates, and this in turn changes his environment; so th at by this simple exercise of thought, a man changes not only himself, but his environment, circumstances and conditions. You will see, you must see, that we are at the dawn of a new day; that the possibilities are so wonde rful, so fascinating, so limitless as to be almost bewildering. A century ago any man with a Gatling Gun could have annihilated a wh ole army equipped with the implements of warfare then in use. So it is at present. Any man with a knowledge of the possibilit ies contained in the Master Key has an inconceivable advan tage over the multitude."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Part One It is my privilege to enclose here with Part One of The Master Key System. Would you bring into you r life more power? Get the power consciousness. More health? Get the health consciousness. More happiness? Get the h appiness consciousness. Live the spirit of these things until they become your s by right. It will then become impossible to keep them from you. Th e things of the world are fluid to a power within man by which he rules them. You need not acquire this power. You already h ave it. But you want to understand it; you want to use it; you want to control it; you want to impregnate yourself with it, so that you can go forward and carry the world before you. Day by day as you go on and on , as you gain momentum, as your inspiration deepens, as your plans crystallize, as you gain understanding, you will come to realize that this world is no dead pile of stones and timber, but that it is a living thing! It is made up of the beating hearts of humanity. It is a thing of life and beauty. It is evident that it requires understanding to work with material of this description, but those who co me into this understanding, are inspired by a new light, a new force, they gain confidence and greater power each day, they realize their hopes and their dreams come true, life has a deeper, fuller , clearer meaning than before. And, now, Part One. PART ONE 1. That much gathers more is tr ue on every plane of existence and that loss leads to greater loss is equally true. 2. Mind is creative, and c onditions, environment and all experiences in life are the result of our habitual or predominant mental attitude."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"3. The attitude of mind necessarily depends upon what we think. Therefore, the secret of a ll power, all achievement and all possession depends upon our method of thinking. 4. This is true because we must \"be\" before we can \"do,\" and we can \"do\" only to the extent whic h we \"are,\" and what we \"are\" depends upon what we \"think.\" 5. We cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may secure possess ion of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never become conscious of power until we learn that all pow er is from within. 6. There is a world within – a world of thought and feeling and power; of light and life and beau ty and, although invisible, its forces are mighty. 7. The world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall find the solution fo r every problem, the cause for every effect; and since the world w ithin is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are also within our control. 8. The world without is a reflec tion of the world within. What appears without is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom, infinite Power, infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these pot entialities in the world within they will take form in the world without. 9. Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by harmonious conditions, agreeable surr oundings, the best of everything. It is the fo undation of health and a necessary essential to all greatness, all powe r, all attainment, all achievement and all success."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10. Harmony in the world within means the ability to control our thoughts, and to determine for ourselves how any experience is to affect us. 11. Harmony in the world with in results in optimism and affluence; affluence within re sults in affluence without. 12. The world without reflects the circumstances and the conditions of the consciousness within. 13. If we find wisdom in the world within, we shall have the understanding to discern the mar velous possibilities that are latent in this world within, and we shall be given the power to make these possibilities manifest in the world without. 14. As we become conscious of the wisdom in the world within, we mentally take possession of this wisdom, and by taking mental possession we come into actual possession of the power and wisdom necessary to bring into manifestation the essentials necessary for our most complete and harmonious development. 15. The world within is the practical world in which the men and women of power generate courage, hope, enthusia sm, confidence, trust and faith, by which they are given the fine intelligence to see the vision and the practical skill to make the vision real. 16. Life is an unfoldment, not accr etion. What comes to us in the world without is what we alread y possess in the world within. 17. All possession is based on consciousness. All gain is the result of an accumulative consciousness . All loss is the result of a scattering consciousness. 18. Mental efficiency is contin gent upon harmony; discord means confusion; therefore, he who wo uld acquire power must be in harmony with Natural Law."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"19. We are related to the world w ithout by the objective mind. The brain is the organ of this mind and the cerebro-spinal system of nerves puts us in conscious commu nication with every part of the body. This system of nerves resp onds to every sensation of light, heat, odor, sound and taste. 20. When this mind thinks correctly , when it understands the truth, when the thoughts sent through the cerebro-spinal nervous system to the body are constructive, these sensations are pleasant, harmonious. 21. The result is that we build stre ngth, vitality and all constructive forces into our body, but it is thr ough this same objective mind that all distress, sickness, lack, limita tion and every form of discord and inharmony is admitted to our lives. It is therefore through the objective mind, by wrong thinking, that we are related to all destructive forces. 22. We are related to the world w ithin by the subconscious mind. The solar plexus is the organ of this mind; the sympathetic system of nerves presides over all subjec tive sensations, such as joy, fear, love, emotion, respiration, imag ination and all other subconscious phenomena. It is th rough the subconscious that we are connected with the Universal Mind and brought into relatio n with the Infinite constructive forces of the Universe. 23. It is the coordination of these two centers of our being, and the understanding of their functions, wh ich is the great secret of life. With this knowledge we can br ing the objective and subjective minds into conscious cooperation and thus coordina te the finite and the infinite. Our future is entir ely within our own control. It is not at the mercy of any capricious or uncertain external power. 24. All agree that there is but one Principle or Consciousness pervading the entire Universe, occupying all space, and being essentially the same in kind at every point of its presence. It is all"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"powerful, all wisdom and always present. All thoughts and things are within Itself. It is all in all. 25. There is but one consciousness in the universe able to think; and when it thinks, its thoughts be come objective things to it. As this Consciousness is omnipresent, it must be present within every individual; each individual must be a manifestation of that Omnipotent, Omniscient and Om nipresent Consciousness. 26. As there is only one Consciousn ess in the Universe that is able to think it necessarily follows that your consciousness is identical with the Universal Consciousness, or, in other words, all mind is one mind. There is no d odging this conclusion. 27. The consciousness that focuses in your brain cells is the same consciousness which focuses in the brain cells of every other individual. Each individual is bu t the individualization of the Universal, the Cosmic Mind. 28. The Universal Mind is static or potential energy; it simply is; it can manifest only through the indi vidual, and the individual can manifest only through the Universal. They are one. 29. The ability of the individual to think is his ability to act on the Universal and bring it into mani festation. Human consciousness consists only in the ability of man to think. Mind in itself is believed to be a subtle form of static energy, from which arises the activities called ‘thought,’ which is the dynamic phase of mind. Mind is static energy, thought is dynamic energy - the two phases of the same thing. Thought is therefore the vibratory force formed by converting static mind into dynamic mind. 30. As the sum of all attributes are contained in the Universal Mind, which is Omnipotent, Omni scient and Omnipresent, these attributes must be present at all times in their po tential form in every individual. Ther efore, when the i ndividual thinks, the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"thought is compelled by its na ture to embody itself in an objectivity or condition which will correspond with its origin. 31. Every thought therefore is a cause and every condition an effect; for this reason it is absolutely essential that you control your thoughts so as to bring forth only desirable conditions. 32. All power is from within, and is absolutely u nder your control; it comes through exact knowledge and by the voluntary exercises of exact principles. 33. It should be plain that when you acquire a thorough understanding of this law, and ar e able to control your thought processes, you can apply it to an y condition; in other words, you will have come into conscious cooperation with Omnipotent law which is the fund amental basis of all things. 34. The Universal Mind is the life principle of every atom which is in existence; every atom is continually striving to manifest more life; all are intelligent, and all ar e seeking to carry out the purpose for which they we re created. 35. A majority of mankind lives in the world without; few have found the world within, and yet it is the world within that makes the world without; it is therefore creative and everything which you find in your world without has been created by you in the world within. 36. This system will bring you in to a realization of power which will be yours when you understand this relation between the world without and the world within. The world within is the cause, the world without the effect; to chang e the effect you must change the cause. 37. You will at once see that this is a radically new and different idea; most men try to change effect s by working with effects. They"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"fail to see that this is simply changing one form of distress for another. To remove discord, we must remove the cause, and this cause can be found only in the world within. 38. All growth is from within. This is evident in all nature. Every plant, every animal, every human is a living testimony to this great law, and the error of the ages is in looking for strength or power from without. 39. The world within is the Univ ersal fountain of supply, and the world without is the outlet to the stream. Our ability to receive depends upon our recognition of this Universal Fountain, this Infinite Energy of whic h each individual is an outlet, and so is one with every other individual. 40. Recognition is a mental process, mental action is therefore the interaction of the individual upon the Universal Mind, and as the Universal Mind is the intellige nce which pervades all space and animates all living things, this me ntal action and reaction is the law of causation, but the principle of causation does not obtain in the individual but in the Universal Mind. It is not an objective faculty but a subjective process, and the re sults are seen in an infinite variety of conditions and experiences. 41. In order to express life ther e must be mind; nothing can exist without mind. Everything which exists is some manifestation of this one basic substance from wh ich and by which all things have been created and are cont inually being recreated. 42. We live in a fathomless sea of plastic mind substance. This substance is ever alive and active. It is sensitive to the highest degree. It takes form according to the mental demand. Thought forms the mold or matrix from wh ich the substance expresses. 43. Remember that it is in the application alone that the value consists, and that a practical understanding of this law will"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"substitute abundance for poverty, wisdom for ig norance, harmony for discord and freedom for tyran ny, and certainly there can be no greater blessing than these from a material and social standpoint. 44. Now make the application: Se lect a room where you can be alone and undisturbed; sit erect, comfortably, but do not lounge; let your thoughts roam where they will but be perfectly still for from fifteen minutes to half an hour; continue this for three or four days or for a week until you secure full control of your physical being. 45. Many will find this extremel y difficult; others will conquer with ease, but it is absolutely essential to secure complete control of the body before you are ready to progress. Next week you will receive instructions for the next step; in the meantime you must have mastered this one."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Part One - Study Questions with Answers 1.What is the world without in its relation to the world within?

The great task is to discov er the laws of nature to which we are to adjust ourselves. Clear thinking and moral insight are, therefore, of incalcul able value. All processes, even those of thought, rest on solid foundations. The keener the sensibilities, the more acute the judgment, the more delicate the taste, th e more refined the mora l feelings, the more subtle the intelligence, the loftie r the aspiration -- the purer and more intense are the gratifications which existence yi elds. Hence it is that the study of th e best that has been thought in the world gives supreme pleasure. The powers, uses and possibilitie s of the mind under the new interpretations are incomparably more wonderful that the most extravagant accomplishment, or even dreams of material progress. Thought is energy. Active thought is active ener gy; concentrated thought is a concentrated energy . Thought concentrated on a definite purpose becomes power. Th is is the power which is being used by those who do not believe in the virtue of poverty, or the beauty of self-denial. They percei ve that this is the talk of weaklings. The ability to receive and manifest this power depends upon the ability to recognize the Infinite Energy ever dwelling in man, constantly creating and recreati ng his body and mind, and ready at any moment to manifest throu gh him in any needful manner. In exact proportion to the recogn ition of this truth will be the manifestation in the outer life of the individual. Part Two explains the method by which this is accomplished."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PART TWO 1. The operations of the mind ar e produced by two parallel modes of activity, the one conscious, and the other subconscious. Professor Davidson says: \"He wh o thinks to illuminate the whole range of mental action by the light of his own consciousness is not unlike the one who should go about to illuminate the universe with a rushlight.\" 2. The subconscious’ logical pr ocesses are carried on with a certainty and regularity which woul d be impossible if there existed the possibility of error. Our mind is so designed that it prepares for us the most important foundations of cognition, whils t we have not the slightest apprehension of the modus operandi. 3. The subconscious soul, like a benevolent stranger, works and makes provision for our benefit, pou ring only the ma ture fruit into our lap; thus ultimate analysis of thought processes shows that the subconscious is the theatre of the most important mental phenomena. 4. It is through the subconsciou s that Shakespeare must have perceived, without effort, great truths which are hidden from the conscious mind of the student; th at Phidias fashio ned marble and bronze; that Raphael painted Ma donnas and Beethoven composed symphonies. 5. Ease and perfection depend en tirely upon the degree in which we cease to depend upo n the consciousness; playing the piano, skating, operating the typewrit er, the skilled trades, depend for their perfect execution on the process of the sub-conscious mind. The marvel of playing a brilliant pi ece on the piano, while at the same time conducting a vigoro us conversation, shows the greatness of our subconscious powers."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6. We are all aware how dependent we are upon the subconscious, and the greater, the nobl er, the more brilliant ou r thoughts are, the more it is obvious to ourselves t hat the origin lies beyond our ken. We find ourselves endowed with tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc., or whose origin or dwelling place we are wholly unconscious. 7. The value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory. It dir ects our thoughts, tastes, and accomplishes tasks so intricate that no conscious mind, even if it had the power, has the capacity for. 8. We can walk at will; we can raise the arm wh enever we choose to do so; we can give our attent ion through eye or ear to any subject at pleasure. On the ot her hand, we cannot stop our heartbeats nor the circulation of the blood, nor the growth of stature, nor the formation of ne rve and muscle tissue, nor the building of the bones, nor many ot her important vital processes. 9. If we compare these two sets of action, the one decreed by the will of the moment, and the other proceeding in majestic, rhythmic course, subject to no vascillation, but constant at every moment, we stand in awe of the latter, and ask to ha ve the mystery explained. We see at once that thes e are the vital processes of our physical life, and we can not avoi d the inference that these all- important functions are designedly withdrawn from the domain of our outward will with its variat ions and transitions, and placed under the direction of a perma nent and dependable power within us. 10. Of these two powers, the outward and changeable has been termed the \"Conscious Mind,\" or the \"Objective Mind\" (dealing with outward objects). The interior power is called the \"Subconscious Mind,\" or the \"S ubjective Mind,\" and besides its"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"work on the mental plane it controls the regular functions which make physical life possible. 11. It is necessary to have a clea r understanding of their respective functions on the mental plane, as well as of certain other basic principles. Perceiving and operat ing through the five physical senses, the conscious mind deals wi th the impressions and objects of the outward life. 12. It has the faculty of discri mination, carrying with it the responsibility of choice . It has the power of reasoning - whether inductive, deductive, analytical or syllogistic - and this power may be developed to a high degree. It is the seat of the will with all the energies that flow therefrom. 13. Not only can it impress other minds, but it can direct the subconscious mind. In this way the conscious mind becomes the responsible ruler and guardian of the subconscious mind. It is this high function which can completely reverse conditio ns in your life. 14. It is often true that conditions of fear, worry, poverty, disease, inharmony and evils of all kinds dominate us by reason of false suggestions accepted by the unguard ed subconscious mind. All this the trained conscious mind can en tirely prevent by its vigilant protective action. It may properly be called \"the watchman at the gate\" of the great su bconscious domain. 15. One writer has expressed the chief distinction between the two phases of mind thus: \"Conscious mind is reasoning will. Subconscious mind is instinctive desire, the result of past reasoning will.\" 16. The subconscious mind draws just and accurate inferences from premises furnished from outsi de sources. Where the premise is true, the subconscio us mind reaches a fau ltless conclusion, but, where the premise or suggestion is an error, the whole structure"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"falls. The subconscious mind does not engage in the process of proving. It relies upon the consci ous mind, \"the watchman at the gate,\" to guard it from mistaken impressions. 17. Receiving any suggestions as true, the subconscious mind at once proceeds to act thereon in the whole domain of its tremendous field of work. The c onscious mind can suggest either truth or error. If the latter, it is at the cost of wide-reaching peril to the whole being. 18. The conscious mind ought to be on duty during every waking hour. When the \"watchman\" is \"off guard,\" or when its calm judgment is suspended, under a variety of circumstances, then the subconscious mind is unguarded and left open to suggestion from all sources. During the wild exc itement of panic, or during the height of anger, or the impulses of the irresponsible mob, or at any other time of unrestrained pa ssion, the conditions are most dangerous. The subconscious mind is then open to the suggestion of fear, hatred, selfishness, greed, self-depreciation and other negative forces, derived from surrounding persons or circumstances. The result is usua lly unwholesome in the extreme, with effects that may endure to distress it for a long time. Hence, the great importance of guarding the subconscious mind from false impressions. 19. The subconscious mind perc eives by intuition. Hence, its processes are rapid. It does no t wait for the slow methods of conscious reasoning. In fact , it can not employ them. 20. The subconscious mind never sleeps, never rests, any more than does your heart, or your bl ood. It has been found that by plainly stating to the subconscious mind certain specific things to be accomplished, forces are set in operation that lead to the result desired. Here, then, is a source of power which places us in touch with Omnipotence. Here in is a deep principle which is well worth our most earnest study."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"21. The operation of this law is interesting. Those who put it into operation find that when they go ou t to meet the person with whom they anticipate a difficult inte rview, something has been there before them and dissolved the supp osed differences; everything is changed; all is harmon ious; they find that when some difficult business problem presents itself they can afford to make delay and something suggests the proper so lution; everything is properly arranged; in fact, those who have le arned to trust the subconscious find that they have infinite resources at their command. 22. The subconscious mind is the seat of our principles and our aspirations. It is the fount of our artistic and altruistic ideals. These instincts can only be overthrow n by an elaborate and gradual process of undermining th e innate principles. 23. The subconscious mind cannot ar gue controversially. Hence, if it has accepted wrong suggestions, the sure method of overcoming them is by the use of a strong counter suggestion, frequently repeated, which the mind must acc ept, thus even tually forming new and healthy habits of though t and life, for the subconscious mind is the seat of Habit. That which we do over and over becomes mechanical; it is no longer an act of judgment, but has worn its deep grooves in the subc onscious mind. This is favorable for us if the habit be wholesome and right. If it be harmful, and wrong, the remedy is to recognize the omnipotence of the subconscious mind and suggest present actual fr eedom. The subconscious being creative and one with our divine source will at o nce create the freedom suggested. 24. To sum up: The normal functi ons of the subconscious on the physical side have to do with the regular and vital processes, with the preservation of life and the rest oration of health; with the care of offspring, which includes an instinctive desire to preserve all life and improve conditions generally."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"25. On the mental side, it is the storehouse of memory; it harbors the wonderful thought messengers , who work, unhampered by time or space; it is the fountain of the practical initiative and constructive forces of life: It is the seat of habit. 26. On the spiritual side, it is the source of ideals, of aspiration, of the imagination, and is the c hannel through whic h we recognize our Divine Source, and in proportion as we recognize this divinity do we come into an understanding of the source of power. 27. Some one may ask: \"How can the subconscious change conditions?\" The reply is, because th e subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference is one of degree. The whole, as we know, is creative, in fact, it is the only creator there is, consequently, we find that mind is creative, and as thought is the only activity which the mind possesses, thought must necessarily be creative also. 28. But we shall find that there is a vast difference between simply thinking, and directing our though t consciously, systematically and constructively; when we do this we place our mind in harmony with the Universal Mind, we come in tune with the Infinite, we set in operation the mightiest force in existence, the creative power of the Universal Mind. This, as ev erything else, is governed by natural law, and this law is the \"L aw of Attraction,\" which is that Mind is creative, and will automati cally correlate with its object and bring it into manifestation. 29.

Thought, therefore, is the cause, and the experie nces with which you meet in life are the effect. Eliminate, therefore, any possi ble tendency to complain of conditions as they have been, or as they are, because it rests with you to change them and make them what you would like them to be. Direct your effort to a realization of the mental resources, always at your command, from which all real and la sting power comes. Persist in this practice until you co me to a realization of the fact that there can be no failure in t he accomplishment of any proper object in life if you but understand your power and persist in your object, because the mind -forces are ever ready to lend themselves to a purposeful will, in the effort to crystallize thought and desire into actions, events and conditions. Whereas in the beginning of each function of life and each action is the result of conscious though t, the habitual actions become automatic and the thought that contr ols them passes into the realm of the subconscious; yet it is just as intelligent as before. It is necessary that it become automatic, or subconscious, in order that the self-conscious mind may atte nd to other things. The new actions will, however, in thei r turn, be come habitual, then automatic, then subconscious in order that the mind again may be freed from this detail and advan ced to still other activities. When you realize this, you will have found a source of power which will enable you to take care of any situation in life which may develop."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PART THREE 1. The necessary interaction of the conscious and subconscious mind requires a similar intera ction between the corresponding systems of nerves. Judge Troward indicates the very beautiful method in which this interaction is effected. He says: The cerebro- spinal system is the organ of the conscious mind and the sympathetic is the organ of the s ubconscious. The ce rebro-spinal is the channel through which we re ceive conscious perception from the physical senses and exercise control over the movements of the body. This system of nerves ha s its centre in the brain. 2. The Sympathetic System has its centre in a ganglionic mass at the back of the stomach known as the Solar Plexus, and is the channel of that mental action wh ich unconsciously supports the vital functions of the body. 3. The connection between the two systems is made by the vagus nerve which passes out of the cer ebral region as a portion of the voluntary system to the thorax, sending out branches to the heart and lungs, and finally passing th rough the diaphragm, it loses its outer coating and becomes identifi ed with the nerves of the Sympathetic System, so forming a connecting link between the two and making man physica lly a \"single entity\". 4. We have seen that every though t is received by the brain, which is the organ of the conscious; it is here subjected to our power of reasoning. When the objective mind has been satisfied that the thought is true it is sent to the Solar Plexus, or t he brain of the subjective mind, to be made into our flesh, to be brought forth into the world as reality. It is then no longer susc eptible to any argument whatever. The subconscio us mind cannot argue; it only acts. It accepts the conclusions of the objective mind as final. 5. The Solar Plexus has been li kened to the sum of the body, because it is a central point of di stribution for the energy which the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"body is constantly generating. This energy is very real energy, and this sun is a very real sun, and the energy is being distributed by very real nerves to all parts of the body, and is thrown off in an atmosphere which envelopes the body. 6. If this radiation is suffici ently strong the person is called magnetic; he is said to be fille d with personal magnetism. Such a person may wield an immense powe r for good. His presence alone will often bring comfort to the troubled minds with which he comes in contact. 7. When the Solar Plexus is in acti ve operation and is radiating life, energy and vitality to every part of the body, and to every one whom he meets, the sensations are pleasant, the body is filled with health and all with whom he comes in contact experience a pleasant sensation. 8. If there is any interruption of this radiation the sensations are unpleasant, the flow of life and energy to some part of the body is stopped, and this is the cause of every ill to the human race, physical, mental or environmental. 9. Physical because the sun of th e body is no longer generating sufficient energy to vitalize some part of the body; mental because the conscious mind is dependent upon the subconscious mind for the vitality necessary to suppor t its thought, and environmental, because the connection between the subconscious mind and the Universal mind, is being interrupted. 10. The Solar Plexus is the point at which the part meets with the whole, where the finite becomes Infinite, where the Uncreate becomes create, the Universal becomes individualized, the Invisible becomes visible. It is the point at which life appears and there is no limit to the amount of life an individual may generate from this Solar centre."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"11. This centre of energy is Omni potent because it is the point of contact with all life and all intelligence. It can therefore accomplish whatever it is directed to accomplish, and herein lies the power of the conscious mind; the subconscious can and will carry out such plans and ideas as may be suggested to it by the conscious mind. 12. Conscious thought, then, is ma ster of this sun centre from which the life and energy of the en tire body flows and the quality of the thought which we entertai n determines the quality of the thought which this sun will radi ate, and the character of the thought which our conscious mind entertains will determine the character of the thought which this sun will radiate, and the nature of the thought which our consciou s mind entertains will determine the nature of thought which this sun will radiate, and consequently will determine the natu re of the experience which will result. 13. It is evident, therefore, that all we have to do is let our light shine; the more energy we can radiate, the more rapidly shall we be enabled to transmute undesirable conditions into sources of pleasure and profit. The important question, then, is how to let this light shine; how to ge nerate this energy. 14. Non-resistant thought expands the Solar Plexus; resistant thought contracts it. Pleasant thought expands it; unpleasant thought contracts it. Thoughts of courage, power, confidence and hope all produce a corr esponding state, but th e one arch enemy of the Solar Plexus which must be absolutely destroyed before there is any possibility of letting any light shine is fear. This enemy must be completely destroyed; he mu st be eliminated; he must be expelled forever; he is the cloud which hides the sun; which causes a perpetual gloom. 15. It is this personal devil which makes men fear the past, the present and the future; fear t hemselves, their friends and their enemies; fear everything and ever ybody. When fear is effectually"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"and completely destro yed, your light will shine, the clouds will disperse and you will have found th e source of power, energy and life. 16. When you find that you are really one with the Infinite power, and when you can consciously rea lize this power by a practical demonstration of your ability to overcome any adverse condition by the power of your thought, yo u will have nothing to fear; fear will have been destroyed and you will have come into possession of your birthright. 17. It is our attitude of mind toward life which determines the experiences with which we are to meet; if we expect nothing, we shall have nothing; if we dema nd much, we sh all receive the greater portion. The world is ha rsh only as we fail to assert ourselves. The criticism of the world is bitter only to those who cannot compel room for their ideas. It is fear of this criticism that causes many ideas to fail to see the light of day. 18. But the man who knows that he has a Solar Plexus will not fear criticism or anything else; he will be too busy radi ating courage, confidence, and power; he will anticipate success by his mental attitude; he will pound barriers to pieces, and leap over the chasm of doubt and hesitation which fear places in his path. 19. A knowledge of our ability to consciously radiate health, strength and harmony will bring us in to a realization that there is nothing to fear because we are in touch with Infinite Strength. 20. This knowledge can be ga ined only by making practical application of this information. We learn by doing; through practice the athlete comes powerful. 21. As the following statement is of considerable importance, I will put it in several ways, so that you cannot fail to get the full significance of it. If you are religiously inclined, I would say, you"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"can let your light shine. If your mind has a bias toward physical science, I would say you can wake the Solar Plexus; or, if you prefer the strictly scientific in terpretation, I w ill say that you can impress your subconscious mind. 22. I have already told you what t he result of this impression will be. It is the method in which you are now intere sted. You have already learned that the subconsci ous is intelligent and that it is creative, and responsive to the w ill of the conscious mind. What, then, is the most natural way of making the desired impression? Mentally concentrate on the object of your desire; when you are concentrating you are impre ssing the subconscious. 23. This is not the only way, but it is a simple and effective way, and the most direct way, and co nsequently the wa y in which the best results are secured. It is th e method which is producing such extraordinary results that many think that miracles are being accomplished. 24. It is the method by which e very great inventor, every great financier, every great statesman has been en abled to convert the subtle and invisible force of de sire, faith and confidence into actual, tangible, concrete f acts in the objective world. 25. The subconscious mind is a part of the Universal mind. The Universal is the creative principle of the Universe, a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole. This means that this creative power is absolutely unlim ited; it is not bo und by precedent of any kind, and consequently ha s no prior existing pattern by which to apply its constructive principle. 26. We have found that the subcons cious mind is responsive to our conscious will, which means that the unlimited creative power of the Universal Mind is within control of the conscious mind of the individual."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"27. When making a practical appli cation of this principle, in accordance with the exercises given in the subsequent lessons, it is well to remember that it is not n ecessary to outline the method by which the subconscious will produc e the results you desire.

You are the channel by which the undifferentiated is being differentiated, and this differen tiation is being accomplished by appropriation. It only requires r ecognition to set causes in motion which will bring about results in accordance with your desire, and this is accomplished because the Universal can act only through the individual, and the individual can act only through the Universal; they are one. 29. For your exercise this week , I will ask you to go one step further. I want you to not only be perfectly still, and inhibit all thought as far as possible, but re lax, let go, let the muscles take their normal condition; this will remove all pressure from the nerves, and eliminate that tens ion which so frequently produces physical exhaustion. 30. Physical relaxation is a voluntary exercise of the will and the exercise will be found to be of gr eat value, as it enables the blood to circulate freely to an d from the brain and body. 31. Tensions leads to mental unre st and abnormal mental activity of the mind; it produces worry, care, fear and anxiety.

This part will show you why what you think, or do, or feel, is an indi cation of what you are. Thought is energy and energy is power, and it is because all the religions, sciences and philosophi es with which the world has heretofore been familiar have been based upon the manifestation of this energy instead of the energ y itself, that the world has been limited to effects, while ca uses have been ignored or misunderstood. For this reason we have God and the Devil in religion, positive and negative in science, and go od and bad in philosophy. The Master Key reverses the process; it is interested only in cause, and the letters received from stu dents tell a marvelous story; they indicate conclusively that stu dents are finding the cause whereby they may secure for themselves health, harmon y, abundance, and whatever else may be necessary for their welfare and happiness. Life is expressive and it is our business to express ourselves harmoniously and constructively. Sorrow, misery, unhappiness, disease and poverty are not nece ssities and we are constantly eliminating them. But this process of eliminating consists in rising above and beyond limitation of any kind. He who ha s strengthened and purified his thought need not concern himself about microbes, and he who has come into an understanding of the law of abundance will go at once to the source of supply. It is thus that fate, fortune, and de stiny will be controlled as readily as a captain controls his ship, or an engineer, his train. PART FOUR"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"1. The \"I\" of you is not the physical body; that is simply an instrument which the \"I\" uses to carry out its purposes; the \"I\" cannot be the Mind, for the mind is simply another instrument which the \"I\" uses with which to think, reason, and plan. 2. The \"I\" must be something wh ich controls and directs both the body and the mind; something whic h determines what they shall do and how they shall act. When you come into a realization of the true nature of this \"I\", you w ill enjoy a sense of power which you have never before known. 3. Your personality is made up of countless individual characteristics, peculiarities, hab its, and traits of character; these are the result of your former me thod of thinking, but they have nothing to do with the real \"I.\" 4. When you say \"I think\" the \"I\" tells the mind what it shall think; when you say \"I go\" the \"I\" tells the physical body where it shall go; the real nature of this \"I\" is spiritual, and is the source of the real power which comes to men and women when they come into a realization of their true nature. 5. The greatest and most marvelous power which this \"I\" has been given is the power to think, but few people know how to think constructively, or correctly, consequently they achieve only indifferent results. Most people a llow their thoughts to dwell on selfish purposes, the in evitable result of an infantile mind. When a mind becomes mature, it understands th at the germ of defeat is in every selfish thought. 6. The trained mind knows that every transaction must benefit every person who is in any way c onnected with the transaction, and any attempt to profit by the weakness, ignorance or necessity of another will inevitably oper ate to his disadvantage."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"7. This is because the individual is a part of the Universal. A part cannot antagonize any other part, but, on the contrary, the welfare of each part depends upon a reco gnition of the interest of the whole. 8. Those who recognize this principle have a great advantage in the affairs of life. They do not w ear themselves out. They can eliminate vagrant thoughts with facility. They can readily concentrate to the highest possible degree on any subject. They do not waste time or money upon obje cts which can be of no possible benefit to them. 9. If you cannot do these things it is because you have thus far not made the necessary effort. Now is the time to make the effort. The result will be exactly in proportion to the ef fort expended. One of the strongest affirmations which you can use for the purpose of strengthening the will an d realizing your power to accomplish, is, \"I can be what I will to be.\" 10. Every time you repeat it realize who and what this \"I\" is; try to come into a thorough understanding of the true na ture of the \"I\"; if you do, you will become invincible ; that is, provided that your objects and purposes are constructi ve and are therefore in harmony with the creative princi ple of the Universe. 11. If you make use of this affirm ation, use it continuously, night and morning, and as often during the day as you think of it, and continue to do so until it becomes a part of you; form the habit. 12. Unless you do this, you had better not start at all, because modern psychology tells us that when we start something and do not complete it, or m ake a resolution and do not keep it, we are forming the habit of failure; abso lute, ignominious failure. If you do not intend to do a thing, do not start; if you do start, see it through even if the heavens fall; if you make up your mind to do something, do it; let no thing, no one, interf ere; the \"I\" in you has"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"determined, the thing is settled; the die is cast, there is no longer any argument. 13. If you carry out this idea, be ginning with small things which you know you can control and grad ually increase the effort, but never under any circumstances allowing your \"I\" to be overruled, you will find that you can eventual ly control yourself, and many men and women have found to thei r sorrow that it is easier to control a kingdom that to control themselves. 14. But when you have learned to control yourself you will have found the \"World Within\" which controls the world without; you will have become irresistible; men and things will respond to your every wish without any apparent effort on your part. 15. This is not so strange or im possible as it may appear when you remember that the \"World Within\" is controlled by the \"I\" and that this \"I\" is a part or one with the Infinite \"I\" which is the Universal Energy or Spirit, us ually called God. 16. This is not a mere statement or theory made for the purpose of confirming or establishing an idea , but it is a fact which has been accepted by the best religious though t as well as the best scientific thought. 17. Herbert Spender said: \"Amid al l the mysteries by which we are surrounded, nothing is more certai n than that we are ever in the presence of an Infinite and Eter nal Energy from which all things proceed.\" 18. Lyman Abbott, in an address delivered before the Alumni of Bangor Theological Seminary, said : \"We are coming to think of God as dwelling in man rather than as operating on men from without.\""},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"19. Science goes a little way in its search and stops. Science finds the ever-present Eternal Energy , but Religion finds the Power behind this energy and locates it within man. Bu t this is by no means a new discovery; the Bible sa ys exactly the same thing, and the language is just as plain an d convincing: \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of the living God?\" Here, then, is the secret of the wonderful creative power of the \"World Within.\" 20. Here is the secret of power, of mastery. To ov ercome does not mean to go without things. Self-d enial is not su ccess. We cannot give unless we get; we cannot be helpful unless we are strong. The Infinite is not a bankrupt and we who are the representatives of Infinite power should no t be bankrupts either, and if we wish to be of service to others we must h ave power and more power, but to get it we must give it; we must be of service. 21. The more we give the more we shall get; we must become a channel whereby the Universal ca n express activity. The Universal is constantly seeking to express itself, to be of service, and it seeks the channel whereby it can find the greatest activity, where it can do the most good, where it can be of greatest service to mankind. 22. The Universal cannot express through you as l ong as you are busy with your plans, your own purposes; quiet t he senses, seek inspiration, focus the mental acti vity on the within, dwell in the consciousness of your unity with Omnipotence. \"Still water runs deep;\" contemplate the multitudino us opportunities to which you have spiritual access by the Omnipresence of power. 23. Visualize the events, circumst ances and conditions which these spiritual connections may assist in manifesting. Realize the fact that the essence and soul of all things is spiritual and that the spiritual is the real, because it is the life of all there is; when the spirit is gone, the life is gone; it is dead; it has ceased to exist."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"24. These mental activities pertain to the world within, to the world of cause; and conditions and ci rcumstances which result are the effect. It is thus that you become a creator. This is important work, and the higher, loftier, grander and more noble ideals which you can conceive, the more import ant the work will become. 25. Over-work or over-play or o ver-bodily activity of any kind produces conditions of mental ap athy and stagnation which makes it impossible to do the more im portant work which results in a realization of conscious power. We should, therefore, seek the Silence frequently. Power comes through repose; it is in the Silence that we can be still, and when we are still, we can think, and thought is the secret of all attainment. 26. Thought is a mode of motio n and is carried by the law of vibration the same as li ght or electricity. It is given vitality by the emotions through the law of love ; it takes form and expression by the law of growth; it is a product of the spiritual \"I\", hence its Divine, spiritual, and creative nature. 27. From this it is evident t hat in order to express power, abundance or any othe r constructive purpose, the emotions must be called upon to give feeling to the thought so that it will take form. How may this purpose be accompli shed? This is the vital point; how may we develop the faith, the courage, the feeling, which will result in accomplishment? 28. The reply is, by exercise; ment al strength is secured in exactly the same way that physical stre ngth is secured, by exercise. We think something, perhaps with diffi culty the first time; we think the same thing again, and it becomes eas ier this time; we think it again and again; it then becomes a mental habit. We continue to think the same thing; finally it becomes automatic; we can no longer help thinking this thing; we are now posi tive of what we think; there is no longer any doubt about it . We are sure; we know."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"29. Last week I asked you to relax, to let go physic ally. This week, I am going to ask you to let go mentally.

This week, after taking your us ual position, remove all tension by completely relaxing, then me ntally let go of all adverse conditions, such as hatred, anger, worry, jealousy , envy, sorrow, trouble or disappointment of any kind. 31. You may say that you cannot \"l et go\" of these things, but you can; you can do so by mentally determining to do so, by voluntary intention and persistence. 32. The reason that some cannot do this is because they allow themselves to be controlled by th e emotions instead of by their intellect. But those who will be gui ded by the intellect will gain the victory. You will not succeed th e first time you try, but practice makes perfect, in this as in ever ything else, and you must succeed in dismissing, eliminating and completely destroying these negative and destructive thoughts; because they are the seed which is constantly germinating into discordant conditions of every conceivable kind and description. There is nothing truer than that the quality of thought which we entertain correlates certain externals in the outside world. This is the Law from which there is no escape. And it is this Law, this correlative of the thought with its object, that from time immemorial has led the people to believe in special providence.

After stud ying this part carefully, you will see that ever y conceivable force or object or fact is the result of mind in action. Mind in action is thought, and thought is creative. Men are thinking now as they never thought before. Therefore, this is a creative age, and the world is awarding its richest prizes to the thinkers. Matt er is powerless, passive, inert. Mind is force, energy, power. Mind shapes and controls matter. Every form which matter takes is but the expressi on of some pre- existing thought. But thought works no magic tr ansformations; it obeys natural laws; it sets in motion natural for ces; it releases natural energies; it manifests in your c onduct and actions, and these in turn react upon your friends and acquaintances, and eventually upon the whole of your environm ent. You can originate thought, and, since thoughts are creative, you can cr eate for yourself the things you desire. PART FIVE 1. At least ninety per cent of ou r mental life is subconscious, so that those who fail to make use of this mental power live within very narrow limits. 2. The subconscious can and will so lve any problem for us if we know how to direct it. The subco nscious processes are always at work; the only question is, are we to be simply passive recipients of this activity, or are we to consciously direct the work? Shall we have a vision of the destination to be reached, the dangers to be avoided, or shall we simply drift?"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"3. We have found that mind perv ades every part of the physical body and is always capable of being directed or impressed by authority coming from the objective or the more dominant portion of the mind. 4. The mind, which pervades the body, is largely the result of heredity, which, in turn, is simp ly the result of all the environments of all past generations on th e responsive and ever-moving life forces. An understanding of this fact will enable us to use our authority when we find some undesirable trait of character manifesting. 5. We can consciously use all t he desirable characteristics with which we have been pr ovided and we can re press and refuse to allow the undesirable ones to manifest. 6. Again, this mind which pervad es our physical body is not only the result of hereditary tendencies, but is the result of home, business and social environment, where countless thousands of impressions, ideas, prejudices and similar thoughts have been received. Much of this has been r eceived from others, the result of opinions, suggestions or statements; much of it is the result of our own thinking, but nearly all of it has been accepted with little or no examination or consideration. 7. The idea seemed plausible, th e conscious received it, passed it on to the subconscious, where it was taken up by the Sympathetic System and passed on to be built into our physical body. \"The word has become flesh.\" 8. This, then, is the way we are consistently creating and recreating ourselves; we are today the result of our past thinking, and we shall be what we are thinking today, th e Law of Attraction is bringing to us, not the things we should like, or the things we wish for, or the things some one else has, but it brings us \"our own,\" the things which we have created by our thought processes, whether"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"consciously or unconsciously. Unfortunately, many of us are creating these things unconsciously. 9. If either of us were building a home for ourselves, how careful we would be in regard to the pl ans; how we should study every detail; how we should watch the material and select only the best of everything; and yet how care less we are when it comes to building our Mental Home, which is infinitely more important than any physical home, as everything which can possibly enter into our lives depends upon the character of the material which enters into the construction of our Mental Home. 10. What is the character of this material? We have seen that it is the result of the impressions wh ich we have accumulated in the past and stored away in our su bconscious Mentality. If these impressions have been of fear, of worry, of care, of anxiety; if they have been despondent, negative, do ubtful, then the texture of the material which we are weaving t oday will be of th e same negative material. Instead of being of any value, it will be mildewed and rotten and will bring us only more toil and care and anxiety. We shall be forever busy trying to patch it up and make it appear at least genteel. 11. But if we have stored away nothing but courag eous thought, if we have been optimistic, positive, and have immediately thrown any kind of negative thought on the scrap pile, have refused to have anything to do with it, have refused to associate with it or become identified with it in any way, what then is the result? Our mental material is now of the best kind; we can weave any kind of material we want; we can use any color we wish; we know that the texture is firm, that th e material is solid, th at it will not fade, and we have no fear, no anxiety concern ing the future; there is nothing to cover, there are no patches to hide. 12. These are psychological facts; there is no theory or guesswork about these thinking processes; ther e is nothing secret about them;"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"in fact, they are so plain that every one can unde rstand them. The thing to do is to have a mental house-cleaning, and to have this house-cleaning every day, and kee p the house clean. Mental, moral and physical cleanliness are absolute ly indispensable if we are to make progress of any kind. 13. When this mental house-clean ing process has been completed, the material which is left will be suitable for the making of the kind of ideals or mental images which we desire to realize. 14. There is a fine estate awaiting a claimant. Its broad acres, with abundant crops, running water and fine timber, stretch away as far as the eye can see. There is a mans ion, spacious and cheerful, with rare pictures, a well-stocked lib rary, rich hangings, and every comfort and luxury. All the heir has to do is to assert his heirship, take possession, and us e the property. He must use it; he must not let it decay; for use is the cond ition on which he holds it. To neglect it is to lose possession. 15. In the domain of mind and sp irit, in the domain of practical power, such an estate is yours. You are the heir! You can assert your heirship and possess, and use this rich inheritance. Power over circumstances is one of its fruits, health, harmony and prosperity are assets upon its balance sheet. It offers you poise and peace. It costs you only the labo r of studying and harvesting its great resources. It demands no sa crifice, except the loss of your limitations, your servitudes, your weakness. It clothes you with self-honor, and puts a s cepter in your hands. 16. To gain this estate, three processes are necessary: You must earnestly desire it. You must as sert your claim. You must take possession. 17. You admit that those are not burdensome conditions."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"18. You are familiar with the subj ect of heredity. Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, and other physical scie ntists have piled evidence mountain high that heredity is a law attending progr essive creation. It is progressive heredity whic h gives man his erect attitude, his power of motion, the organs of di gestions, blood circulation, nerve force, muscular force, bone structure and a host of other faculties on the physical side. There are even more impressive facts concerning heredity of mind force. All these constitute what may be called your human heredity. 19. But there is a heredity which the physical scientists have not compassed. It lies beneath and ant ecedent to all thei r researches. At a point where they throw up their hands in despair, saying they cannot account for what they see, this divine heredity is found in full sway. 20. It is the benignant force which decrees primal creation. It thrills down from the Divine, direct into every created being. It originates life, which the physical scientist has no t done, nor ever can do. It stands out among all forces su preme, unapproachable. No human heredity can approach it. No huma n heredity measures up to it. 21. This Infinite Life flows through you; is you. Its doorways are but the faculties which comprise your consciousness . To keep open these doors is the Secret of Power. Is it not worthwhile to make the effort? 22. The great fact is, that the source of all life and all power is from within. Persons, circumstan ces and events may suggest need and opportunities, but the insight, strength and power to answer these needs will be found within. 23. Avoid counterfeits.

Those we have come into poss ession of this inheritance are never quite the same again. They have come into possession of a sense of power hitherto undreamed of. They can never again be timid, weak, vacillating, or fe arful. They are indissolubly connected with Omnipotence. So mething in them has been aroused; they have s uddenly discovered that they possess a tremendous latent ability of which they were hereto fore entirely unconscious. 25. This power is from within, bu t we cannot receive it unless we give it. Use is the condition upon which we hold this inheritance. We are each of us but the chan nel through which the Omnipotent power is being differentiated into form; unless we give, the channel is obstructed and we can receive no more. This is true on every plane of exist ence and in every field of endeavor and all walks of life. The more we give, the more we get. The athlete who wishes to get strong must make us e of the strength he has, and the more he gives the more he will get. The fina ncier who wishes to make money must make use of the money he has, fo r only by using it can he get more. 26. The merchant who does not ke ep his goods going out will soon have none coming in; the corporat ion which fails to give efficient service will soon lack customers; the attorn ey who fails to get results will soon lack clients, and so it goes everywhere; power is contingent upon a proper use of the power already in our possession; what is true in ever y field of endeavor, every experience in life, is true of the power from which every other power known among men is begotten -- spiritual power.

This part will give you an excellent understanding of the most wonderful piece of mechanism which has ever been created. A mechanism whereby you may create for yourself Health, Strengt h, Success, Prosperity or any other condition which you desire. Necessities are demands, and demand s create action, and actions bring about results. The process of evolution is constantly building our tomorrows out of our todays. Individual development, like Universal development, must be gradual with an ever-increasing capacity and volume. The knowledge that if we infringe upon the rights of others, we become moral thorns and find ourselves entangled at every turn of the road, should be an indication that success is contingent upon the highest moral id eal, which is \"The greate st good to the greatest number.\" Aspiration, desire and harmonious relations constantly and persistently maintained will accomplish results. The greatest hindrance is erroneou s and fixed ideas. To be in tune with eternal tr uth we must possess poise and harmony within. In order to receive intelligence the receiver must be in tune with the transmitter. Thought is a product of Mind and Mind is creative, but this does not mean that the Universal will c hange its modus o perandi to suit us or our ideas, but it does mean that we can come into harmonious relationship with the Universal, and when we have accomplished this we may ask anyt hing to which we are entitled, and the way will be made plain."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"PART SIX 1. The Universal Mind is so wo nderful that it is difficult to understand its utilitarian powers and possibilities and its unlimited producing effects. 2. We have found that this Mind is not only all intelligence but all substance. How, then, is it to be differentiated in form? How are we to secure the effect which we desire? 3. Ask any electrician what the effect of electricity will be and he will reply that \"Electricity is a form of motion and its effect will depend upon the mechan ism to which it is a ttached.\" Upon this mechanism will depend whether we shall have heat, light, power, music or any of the other marvel ous demonstration of power to which this vital energy has been harnessed. 4. What effect can be produced by thought? The reply is that thought is mind in motion (just as wind is air in motion), and its effect will depend entirely on the \"mechanism to which it is attached.\" 5. Here, then, is the secret of a ll mental power; it depends entirely on the mechanism which we attach. 6. What is this mechanism? You know something of the mechanism which has been invente d by Edison, Bell, Marconi and other electrical wizards, by whic h place and space and time have become only figures of speech, but did you ever stop to think that the mechanism which has been gi ven you for transforming the Universal, Omnipresent Potential Power was invented by a greater inventor than Edison? 7. We are accustomed to exam ining the mechanism of the implements which we use for tilling the soil, and we try to get an understanding of the mechanism of the automobile which we drive,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"but most of us are content to rema in in absolute ignorance of the greatest piece of mechanism which as ever come into existence, the brain of man. 8. Let us examine the wonders of this mechanism; perhaps we shall thereby get a better understanding of the various effects of which it is the cause. 9. In the first place, there is th e great mental world in which we live and move and have our being; this wo rld is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent; it will re spond to our desire in direct ratio to our purpose and faith; th e purpose must be in accordance with the law of our being, that is, it must be creative or constructive; our faith must be st rong enough to g enerate a current of sufficient strength to bring our purpose into manifestation. \"As thy faith is, so be it unto thee,\" bears the stamp of scientific test. 10. The effects which are produc ed in the world without are the result of the action and reaction of the individual upon the universal; that is the process whic h we call thinking; the brain is the organ through which this process is accomplished; think of the wonder of it all! Do you love musi c, flowers, litera ture, or are you inspired by the thought of ancien t or modern genius? Remember, every beauty to which you respo nd must have its corresponding outline in your brain before you can appreciate it. 11. There is not a single virtue or principle in the storehouse of nature which the brain cannot expr ess. The brain is an embryonic world, ready to develop at any tim e as necessity may arise. If you can comprehend that this is a sc ientific truth and one of the wonderful laws of nature, it will be easier for you to get an understanding of the mechanism by which these extraordinary results are being accomplished. 12. The nervous system has been co mpared to an electric circuit with its battery of cells in which force is originated, and its white"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"matter to insulated wires by which the current is conveyed; it is through these channels that every impulse or desire is carried through the mechanism. 13. The spinal cord is the great motor and sensory pathway by which messages are conv eyed to and from the brain; then, there is the blood supply plunging through the veins and arteries, renewing our energy and strength, the perf ectly arranged structure upon which the entire physical body rest s, and, finally, the delicate and beautiful skin, clothing the entire me chanism is a mantle of beauty. 14. This then is the \"Temple of th e living God\" and the individual \"I\" is given control and upon hi s understanding of the mechanism which is within his contr ol will the result depend. 15. Every thought sets the brain cells in action; at first the substance upon which the thought is directed fails to respond, but if the thought is sufficientl y refined and concentrated, the substance finally yields and expresses perfectly. 16. This influence of the mind can be exerted upon any part of the body, causing the e limination of any undesirable effect. 17. A perfect conception and unders tanding of the laws governing in the mental world cannot fail to be of inestimable value in the transaction of business, as it de velops the power of discernment and gives a clearer understanding and appreciation of facts. 18. The man who looks within inst ead of without cannot fail to make use of the mighty forces which will eventually determine his course in life and so bring him into vibration with all that is best, strongest and most desirable. 19. Attention or concentration is probably; the most important essential in the development of mind culture. The possibilities of attention when properly directed are so startling that they would"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"hardly appear credible to the uninitiated. The cultivation of attention is the distinguishing cha racteristic of every successful man or woman, and is the very highest personal accomplishment which can be acquired. 20. The power of attention can be more readil y understood by comparing it with a magnifying glass in which the rays of sunlight are focused; they possess no particul ar strength as long as the glass is moved about and the rays directed from one place to another; but let the glass be held perfectly s till and let the rays be focused on one spot for any length of time, th e effect will become immediately apparent. 21. So with the power of thought; let power be dissipated by scattering the thought from one ob ject to another, and no result is apparent; but focus this power through attention or concentration on any single purpose for any lengt h of time and nothing becomes impossible. 22. A very simple remedy for a ve ry complex situation, some will say. All right, try it, you who have had no experience in concentrating the though t on a definite purpose or object. Choose any single object and concentrate yo ur attention on it for a definite purpose for even ten minutes; you cannot do it; the mind will wander a dozen times and it will be necessary to bring it back to the original purpose, and each tim e the effect will have been lost and at the end of the ten minu tes nothing will have been gained, because you have not been able to hold your thought steadily to the purpose. 23. It is, however, through attentio n that you will fina lly be able to overcome obstacles of any kind th at appear in your path onward and upward, and the only way to acquire this wonderful power is by practice -- practice ma kes perfect, in this as in anything else."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"24. In order to cultivate the power of attention, bring a photograph with you to the same seat in the same room in the same position as heretofore.

We may personalize this power and call it God, or we may think of it as the essence or spirit, which permeates all things, but in either case the effect is the same. So far as the individual is concern ed, the objective, the physical, the visible, is the personal, th at which can be cognized by the senses. It consists of body, brai n and nerves. The subjective is the spiritual, the invisible, the impersonal. The personal is conscious becau se it is a pers onal entity. The impersonal, being the sa me in kind and quality as all other Being, is not conscious of itself an d has therefore been termed the subconscious. The personal, or conscious, has th e power of will and choice, and can therefore exercise discrimination in the selection of methods whereby to bring about the solution of difficulties. The impersonal, or spiritual, being a part or one with the source, and origin of all power, can nece ssarily exercise no such choice, but, on the contrary, it has Infinit e resources at its command. It can and does bring about results by methods concer ning which the human or individual mind can have no possible conception. You will therefore see that it is your privil ege to depend upon the human will with all its limitations and misconceptions, or you may utilize the potentialities of Infi nity by making use of the subconscious mind. Here, then, is the scientific explanation of the wonderful power which has been put within your control, if you but understand, appreciate and recognize it."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"One method of consciously utiliz ing this omnipotent power is outlined in Part Seven. PART SEVEN 1. Visualization is the process of making mental images, and the image is the mold or model which will serve as a pattern from which your future will emerge. 2. Make the pattern clear and ma ke it beautiful; do not be afraid; make it grand; remember that no limitation can be placed upon you by any one but yourself ; you are not limited as to cost or material; draw on the Infinite for your supply, construct it in your imagination; it will have to be there before it will ever appear anywhere else. 3. Make the image clear and clea n-cut, hold it firmly in the mind and you will gradually and constantly bring the thing nearer to you. You can be what \"you will to be.\" 4. This is another psychological fact which is well known, but unfortunately, reading about it will not bring about any result which you may have in mi nd; it will not even help you to form the mental image, much less bring it into manifestation. Work is necessary - labor, hard mental l abor, the kind of effort which so few are willing to put forth. 5. The first step is idealization. It is likewise the most important step, because it is the plan on which you are going to build. It must be solid; it must be permanent. Th e architect, when he plans a 30- storey building, has every line an d detail pictured in advance. The engineer, when he spans a chasm, first ascertains the strength requirements of a million separate parts. 6. They see the end before a singl e step is taken; so you are to picture in your mind what you want; you are sowing the seed, but"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"before sowing any seed you want to know what the harvest is to be. This is Idealization. If you are not sure, return to the chair daily until the picture becomes plain; it will gradually unfold; first the general plan will be dim, but it will take shape, the outline will take form, then the details, and you will gradually develop the power by which you will be enabled to formulate plans which will eventually materialize in the obj ective world. You will come to know what the future holds for you. 7. Then comes the process of visualization. You must see the picture more and more complete, s ee the detail, and, as the details begin to unfold the ways and means for bringing it into manifestation will develop. On e thing will lead to another. Thought will lead to action, act ion will develop methods, methods will develop friends, and friends w ill bring about circumstances, and, finally, the third step, or Materialization, will have been accomplished. 8. We all recognize the Universe must have been thought into shape before it ever could have beco me a material fact. And if we are willing to follow along the li nes of the Great Architect of the Universe, we shall find our thou ghts taking form, just as the universe took concrete form. It is the same mind operating through the individual. There is no difference in kind or quality, the only difference is one of degree. 9. The architect visualizes his buildi ng, he sees it as he wishes it to be. His thought becomes a plastic mold from which the building will eventually emerge, a high one or a low one, a beautiful one or a plain one, his vision takes fo rm on paper and eventually the necessary material is utilized and the building stands complete. 10. The inventor visualizes his id ea in exactly th e same manner, for instance, Nikola Tesla, he w ith the giant intellect, one of the greatest inventors of all ages, the man who has brought forth the most amazing realities, always vi sualizes his inventions before"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"attempting to work them out. He did not rush to embody them in form and then spend his time in correcting defects. Having first built up the idea in his imaginati on, he held it there as a mental picture, to be reconstructed and im proved by his thought. \"In this way,\" he writes in the Electrical Experimenter. \"I am enabled to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of, and see no fault anywhere, I put into co ncrete, the product of my brain. Invariably my devise works as I conceived it should; in twenty years there has not been a singl e exception.\" 11. If you can conscientiously fo llow these directions, you will develop Faith, the kind of Faith that is the \"Substance of things hoped for, the evidence of thin gs not seen\"; you will develop confidence, the kind of confidence that leads to endurance and courage; you will develop the po wer of concentration which will enable you to exclude all though ts except the ones which are associated with your purpose. 12. The law is that thought will manifest in form , and only one who knows how to be the divine thinker of his own thoughts can ever take a Master's place and speak with authority. 13. Clearness and accuracy are ob tained only by re peatedly having the image in mind. Each repeate d action renders the image more clear and accurate than the preced ing, and in proportion to the clearness and accuracy of the image will the outward manifestation be. You must build it firmly and secu rely in your mental world, the world within, before it can take fo rm in the world without, and you can build nothing of value, even in the m ental world unless you have the proper mate rial. When you have the material you can build anything you wish, but make sure of your material. You cannot make broadcloth from shoddy."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"14. This material will be brought ou t by millions of silent mental workers and fashioned into the fo rm of the image which you have in mind. 15. Think of it! You have over five million of these mental workers, ready and in active us e; brain cells they are called. Besides this, there is another reserve force of at least an equal number, ready to be called into action at the slightest need. Your power to think, then, is almost un limited, and this means that your power to create the kind of materi al which is necessary to build for yourself any kind of environment which you desire is practically unlimited. 16. In addition to these millions of mental workers, you have billions of mental workers in t he body, every one of which is endowed with sufficient intellig ence to understand and act upon any message or suggestion given. These cells are all busy creating and recreating the body, but, in addition to this, they are endowed with psychic activity whereby they can attract to themselves the substance necessary for perfect development. 17. They do this by the same law and in the sa me manner that every form of life attracts to itself the necessary material for growth. The oak, the rose, the lily, all require certain material for their most perfect expression and they secure it by silent demand, the Law of Attraction, the most ce rtain way for you to secure what you require for your most complete development. 18. Make the Mental Image; make it clear, distinct, perfect; hold it firmly; the ways and means will develop; supply will follow the demand; you will be led to do the right thing at th e right time and in the right way. Earnest De sire will bring about Confident Expectation, and this in turn must be reinforced by Firm Demand. These three cannot fail to bring about Attainment, because the Earnest Desire is the feeling, the Confident Expectation is the thought, and the Firm Demand is th e will, and, as we have seen,"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"feeling gives vitality to thought and the will holds it steadily until the law of Growth brings it into manifestation. 19. Is it not wonderful that man has such tremendou s power within himself, such transcendental facu lties concerning which he had no conception? Is it not strange that we have always been taught to look for strength and power \"with out?\" We have been taught to look everywhere but \"within\" an d whenever this power manifested in our lives we were told that it was something supernatural. 20. There are many who have come to an understanding of this wonderful power, and who make serious and conscientious efforts to realize health, power and othe r conditions, and seem to fail. They do not seem able to bring the Law into operation. The difficulty in nearly every case is that they are dealing with externals. They want money, po wer, health and abundance, but they fail to realize that these are effects and can come only when the cause is found. 21. Those who will give no attention to the world without will seek only to ascertain the truth, will look only for wisdom, will find that this wisdom will unfold and disclose the source of all power, that it will manifest in though t and purpose which will create the external conditions desired. This truth will find expression in noble purpose and courageous action. 22. Create ideals only, give no thought to external conditions, make the world within beautiful an d opulent and the world without will express and manifest the condition which you have within. You will come into a realization of your power to create ideals and these ideals will be projected into the world of effect. 23. For instance, a man is in debt . He will be continually thinking about the debt, concentrating on it, and as thoughts are causes the result is that he not only fastens th e debt closer to him, but actually creates more debt.

Visualize th e condition which the Law of Abundance creates; this will result in manifestation. 25. If the law operates perfectly to bring about poverty, lack and every form of limitation for thos e who are continually entertaining thoughts of lack and fear, it will op erate with the same certainty to bring about conditions of abundan ce and opulence for those who entertain thoughts of courage and power. 26. This is a difficult problem fo r many; we are too anxious; we manifest anxiety, fear, distress; we want to do something; we want to help; we are like a child who has just planted a seed and every fifteen minutes goes and stirs up the ear th to see if it is growing. Of course, under such circumstances, the seed will never germinate, and yet this is exactly what many of us do in the mental world. 27. We must plant the seed and le ave it undisturbed. This does not mean that we are to sit down a nd do nothing, by no means; we will do more and better work then we have ever done before, new channels will constantly be provide d, new doors will open; all that is necessary is to have an open mind, be ready to act when the time comes. 28.

Is not this a wonderful thought? Is it not wonderful to know that our lives are not subject to caprice or variability of any kind? That they are governed by la w. This stability is our opportunity, because by complying with the law we can secure the desired effect with invariable precision. It is the Law which makes the Universe one grand paean of Harmony. If it were not for law, the Universe would be a Chaos instead of a Cosmos. Here, then, is the secret of the origin of booth good and evil, this is all the good and evil there ev er was or ever will be. Let me illustrate. Thoug ht results in action , if your thought is constructive and harmonious, the result will be good; if your thought is destructive or in harm onious, the result will be evil. There is therefore but one law, one principle, on cause, one Source of Power, and good and evil are simply words which have been coined to indicate the result of our action, or our compliance or non-compliance with this law. The importance of this is well illus trated in the lives of Emerson and Carlyle. Emerson loved the good and his life was a symphony of peace and harmony, Carlyle hated the bad, and his life was a record of perpetual discord and inharmony. Here we have two grand men, eac h intent upon achieving the same ideal, but one makes use of constr uctive thought and is therefore in harmony with Natural Law, the other makes use of destructive thought and therefore brings u pon himself discord of every kind and character."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"It is evident therefore that we are to hate nothing, not even the \"bad,\" because hatred is destructiv e, and we shall soon find that by entertaining destructive thought we are sowing the \"wind\" and in turn shall reap the \"whirlwind.\" PART EIGHT 1. Thought contains a vital prin ciple, because it is the creative principle of the Universe and by its nature will combine with other similar thoughts. 2. As the one purpose of life is growth, all principles underlying existence must contribute to give it effect. Thought, therefore, takes form and the law of grow th eventually brings it into manifestation. 3. You may freely choose what y ou think, but the result of your thought is governed by an immu table law. Any line of thought persisted in cannot fail to produce its result in the character, health and circumstances of the indivi dual. Methods whereby we can substitute habits of constructive thinking for those which we have found produce only undesirable ef fects are therefore of primary importance. 4. We all know that this is by no means easy. Mental habits are difficult to control, but it can be done and the way to do it is to begin at once to substitute constructive thought for destructive thought. Form the habit of analy zing every thought. If it is necessary, if its manifestation in the objective will be a benefit, not only to yourself, but to all whom it may affect in any way, keep it; treasure it; it is of value; it is in tune with the Infinite; it will grow and develop and produce fruit an hun dred fold. On the other hand, it will be well for you to keep this quotation from George Matthews Adams, in mind, \"Learn to keep the door shut, keep out of your mind, out of your office , and out of your world, every"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"element that seeks admittance wi th no definite helpful end in view.\" 5. If your thought has been critical or destructive, and has resulted in any condition of discord or in harmony in your environment, it may be necessary for you to cultiv ate a mental attitude which will be conducive to constr uctive thought. 6. The imagination will be found to be a great assistance in this direction; the cultivation of the imagination leads to the development of the ideal out of which your future will emerge. 7. The imagination gathers up the material by which the Mind weaves the fabric in which your future is to be clothed. 8. Imagination is the light by which we can penetrate new worlds of thought and experience. 9. Imagination is the mighty in strument by which every discoverer, every inventor, opened the way from precedent to experience. Precedent said, \"It canno t be done;\" experience said, \"It is done.\" 10. Imagination is a plastic power, molding the things of sense into new forms and ideals. 11. Imagination is the constructive form of thought which must precede every constructive form of action. 12. A builder cannot build a structur e of any kind until he has first received the plans from the archit ect, and the arch itect must get them from his imagination. 13. The Captain of Industry canno t build a giant corporation which may coordinate hundreds of smalle r corporations and thousands of employees, and utilize millions of dollars of capital until he has first created the entire work in his imagination. Objects in the material world are as clay in the potter's hand; it is in the Master"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Mind that the real things are crea ted, and it is by the use of the imagination that the work is do ne. In order to cultivate the imagination it must be exercised. Exercise is necessary to cultivate mental muscle as well as physical muscle. It must be supplied with nourishment or it cannot grow. 14. Do not confuse Imagination with Fancy, or that form of daydreaming in which some people like to indulge. Daydreaming is a form of mental dissipation whi ch may lead to mental disaster. 15. Constructive imagination me ans mental labor, by some considered to be the ha rdest kind of labor, but, if so, it yields the greatest returns, for all the great things in life have come to men and women who had the capacity to think, to imagine, and to make their dreams come true. 16. When you have become thorough ly conscious of the fact that Mind is the only creative princi ple, that it is Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, and that you can consciously come into harmony with this Omnipo tence through your power of thought, you will have taken a long step in th e right direction. 17. The next step is to place yourself in position to receive this power. As it is Omnipresent, it must be within you. We know that this is so because we know that all power is from within, but it must be developed, unfolded, cultiva ted; in order to do this we must be receptive, and this receptiv ity is acquired just as physical strength is gained, by exercise. 18. The law of attraction will certainly and unerringly bring to you the conditions, environment, and expe riences in life, corresponding with your habitual, characteristic , predominant mental attitude. Not what you think once in a while wh en you are in church, or have just read a good book, BUT your predominant mental attitude is what counts."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"19. You can not entertain weak, ha rmful, negative thoughts ten hours a day and expect to bring about beautiful, strong and harmonious conditions by ten minute s of strong, positive, creative thought. 20. Real power comes from with in. All power that anybody can possibly use is within man, on ly waiting to be brought into visibility by his first recognizing it , and then affirming it as his, working it into his consciousness until he becomes one with it. 21. People say that they desire abunda nt life, and so they do, but so many interpret this to mean that if they will exercise their muscles or breathe scientifically, eat certain foods in certain ways, drink so many glasses of water every day of just a certain temperature, keep out of drafts, they will attain the abundant life they seek. The result of such methods is bu t indifferent. However, when man awakens to the truth, and affirms his oneness with all Life, he finds that he takes on the clear eye, the elastic step, the vigor of youth; he finds that he has discovered th e source of all power. 22. All mistakes are but the mist akes of ignorance. Knowledge gaining and consequent power is what determines growth and evolution. The recognition and demonstration of knowledge is what constitutes power, and this power is spir itual power, and this spiritual power is the power which li es at the heart of all things; it is the soul of the universe. 23. This knowledge is the result of man's ability to think; thought is therefore the germ of man's conscious evolution. When man ceases to advance in his thou ghts and ideals, his forces immediately begin to disintegrate and his countenance gradually registers these changing conditions. 24. Successful men make it their bu siness to hold ideals of the conditions which they wish to real ize.

Thoughts are the material s with which they build, and the imagination is their mental work shop. Mind is the ever-moving force with which they secure the persons and circumstance necessary to build their success st ructure, and imagination is the matrix in which all great things are fashioned. 25. If you have been fa ithful to your ideal, you will hear the call when circumstances are ready to materialize your plans and results will correspond in the e xact ratio of your fidelity to your ideal. The ideal steadily held is what pr e-determines and attracts the necessary conditions fo r its fulfillment. 26. It is thus that you may weave a garment of spirit and power into the web of your entire existen ce; it is thus that you may lead a charmed life and be forever protected from all harm; it is thus that you may become a positive force whereby conditions of opulence and harmony may be attracted to you. 27.

Follow the great steel plates through the foundries, see the thousands of men employed in their production; go still further back, and see the ore as it come s from the mine, see it loaded on barges or cars, see it melted and properly treated; go back still further and see the architect and engineers who planned the vessel; let the thought carry yo u back still further in order to determine why they planned the vessel; you wi ll see that you are now so far back that the vessel is something in tangible, it no l onger exists, it is now only a thought existing in the brain of the architect; but from where did the order come to pl an the vessel? Probably from the Secretary of Defense; but probab ly this vessel was planned long before the war was thought of, and that Congress had to pass a bill appropriating the money; possi bly there was opposition, and speeches for or against the b ill.

PART NINE 1. There are only three things wh ich can possibly be desired in the \"world without\" and each of them can be found in the \"world within.\" The secret of finding them is simply to apply the proper \"mechanism\" of attachment to the omnipotent power to which each individual has access. 2. The three things which a ll mankind desires and which are necessary for his highest expres sion and complete development are Health, Wealth and Love . All will admit that He alth is absolutely essential; no one can be happy if th e physical body is in pain. All will not so readily admit that W ealth is necessary, but all must admit that a sufficient supply at le ast is necessary, and what would be considered sufficient for one, would be considered absolute and painful lack for another; and as Nature provides not only enough but abundantly, wastefully, lavishly , we realize that any lack or limitation is only the limitation which has been made by an artificial method of distribution. 3. All will probably admit that Love is the third, or maybe some will say the first essential necessary to the h appiness of mankind; at any rate, those who possess all three, Health, Wealth, and Love, find nothing else whic h can be added to thei r cup of happiness. 4. We have found that the Universa l substance is \"All Health,\" \"All Substance\" and \"All Love\" and that the mechanism of attachment whereby we can consciousl y connect with this In finite supply is in our method of thinking. To think corr ectly is therefore to enter into the \"Secret Place of the Most High.\""},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"5. What shall we think? If we know this we shall have found the proper mechanism of attachm ent which will relate us to \"Whatsoever things we desire.\" This mechanism may seem very simple when I give it to you, but r ead on; you will find that it is in reality the \"Master Key,\" the \"Aladd in's lamp,\" if you please; you will find that it is the foundation, the imperative condition, the absolute law of well-doing, which means, well-being. 6. To think correctly, accurately, we must kn ow the \"Truth.\" The truth then is the underlying prin ciple in every business or social relation. It is a condition preceden t to every right action. To know the truth, to be sure, to be conf ident, affords a satisfaction beside which no other is at all comparabl e; it is the only solid ground in a world of doubt, con flict and danger. 7. To know the Truth is to be in harmony with t he Infinite and Omnipotent power. To know the truth is, therefore, to connect yourself with a power which is irresistible and which will sweep away every kind of discord, inharm ony, doubt or error of any kind, because the \"Truth is mighty and will prevail.\" 8. The humblest intellect can readily foretell the result of any action when he knows that it is based on truth, but the mightiest intellect, the most profound and penetrating mind loses its way hopelessly and can fo rm no conception of the results which may ensue when his hopes are based on a premise which he knows to be false. 9. Every action which is not in harmony with Truth, whether through ignorance or design, will result in discord, and eventual loss in proportion to its extent and character. 10. How then are we to know the truth in order to attach this mechanism which w ill relate us to the Infinite?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"11. We can make no mist ake about this if we realize that truth is the vital principle of the Univer sal Mind and is Omnipresent. For instance, if you require health, a rea lization of the f act that the \"I\" in you is spiritual and that all spirit is one; that wherever a part is the whole must be, will bring abou t a condition of health, because every cell in the body must manifest the truth as you see it. If you see sickness; they will manifest sick ness; if you see perfection they must manifest perfection. The affi rmation, \"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmoni ous and happy\", will bring about harmonious conditions. The reason for this is because the affirmation is in stri ct accordance with the Truth, and when truth appears every form of error or dis cord must necessarily disappear. 12. You have found that the \"I\" is spiritual, it must necessarily then always be no less than perfect, the affirmation. \"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, lo ving, harmonious and happy\" is therefore an exact sc ientific statement. 13. Thought is a spiritual activity and spirit is creative, therefore the result of holding this thought in mind, must necessarily bring about conditions in harmony with the thought. 14. If you require Wealth a realizatio n of the fact that the \"I\" in you is one with the Universal mind which is all substance, and is Omnipotent, will assist you in brin ging into operation the law of attraction which will bring you into vibration with those forces which make for success and bring about conditions of power and affluence in direct proportion with the character and purpose of your affirmation. 15. Visualization is the mechan ism of the attachment which you require. Visualization is a very different process from seeing; seeing is physical, and is therefor e related to the objective world, the \"world without,\" but Visual ization is a product of the imagination, and is therefore a pr oduct of the subjective mind, the \"world within.\" It therefore po ssesses vitality; it will grow. The"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"thing visualized will manifest its elf in form. The mechanism is perfect; it was created by the Master Architect who \"doeth all things well,\" but unfortunatel y sometimes the operator is inexperienced or inefficient, bu t practice and dete rmination will overcome this defect. 16. If you require Love try to realize that the only way to get love is by giving it, that the more you give the more you will get, and the only way in which you can give it, is to fill yourself with it, until you become a magnet. The me thod was explained in another lesson. 17. He who has learned to bring the greatest spiritual truths into touch with the so-called lesser th ings of life has discovered the secret of the solution of his problem. One is always quickened, made more thoughtful, by his near ness of approach to great ideas, great events, great natural objects, and great men. Lincoln is said to have begotten in all who came near him the feeling awakened when one approaches a mountain, an d this sense asserts itself most keenly when one comes to realize that he has laid hold upon things that are eternal, the power of Truth. 18. It is sometimes an inspiration to hear from someone who has actually put these principles to the test, someone who has demonstrated them in their own life. A letter from Frederick Andrews offers the following insight: 19. I was about thirteen years ol d when Dr. T. W. Marsee, since passed over, said to my mother: \"T here is no possible chance, Mrs. Andrews. I lost my little boy the same way, after doing everything for him that it was possible to do. I have made a sp ecial study of these cases, and I know there is no possible chance for him to get well.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"20. She turned to him and said: \"D octor, what would you do if he were your boy?\" and he answered, \"I would fi ght, fight, as long as there is a breath of life to fight for.\" 21. That was the beginning of a long drawn-out battle, with many ups and downs, the doctors all ag reeing that there was no chance for a cure, though they encouraged and cheered us the best they could. 22. But at last the victory cam e, and I have grown from a little, crooked, twisted, cripple, going about on my hands and knees, to a strong, straight, well formed man. 23. Now, I know you wa nt the formula, and I will give it to you as briefly and quickly as I can. 24. I built up an affirmation for myself, taking the qualities I most needed, and affirming for myself over and over again, \"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy.\" I kept up this affirmation, always the same, never varying, till I could wake up in the night and find myself repeating, \"I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy.\" It was the last thing on my lips at night and the first thing in the morning. 25. Not only did I affirm it for myself, but for others that I knew needed it. I want to emphasize this point. Whatever you desire for yourself, affirm it for others, and it will help you both. We reap what we sow. If we send out thou ghts of love and health, they return to us like brea d cast upon the waters ; but if we send out thoughts of fear, worry, jealousy, anger, hate, etc., we will reap the results in our own lives. 26.

If we build the defects back in to our bodies year after year, we have no one to blame but ourselves. 27.

At first we can't keep the evil thoughts from coming, but we can keep from entertaining them . The only way to do this is to forget them -- which means, get so mething for them. This is where the ready-made affirmation comes into play. 28. When a thought of anger, jealousy, fear or worry creeps in, just start your affirmation going. The w ay to fight darkness is with light -- the way to fight cold is with heat -- the way to overcome evils is with good. For myself , I never could find any help in denials. Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish. - Frederick Elias Andrews 29. If there is anything you require, it will be well for you to make use of this affirmation; it cannot be improved upon. Use it just as it is; take it into the silence with you, until it sinks into your subconsciousness, so that you can use it anywhere, in your car, in the office, at home; this is the ad vantage of spiritual methods; they are always available. Spirit is omni present, every ready; all that is required is a proper recogniti on of its omnipotence, and a willingness or desire to become th e recipient of its beneficent effects. 30. If our predominant mental attitu de is one of power, courage, kindliness and sympathy, we sha ll find that our environment will reject conditions in correspondence with these thoughts; if it is weak, critical, envious and dest ructive, we shall find our environment reflecting conditions co rresponding to these thoughts. 31.

This week visualize a plant; take a flower, the one you most admire, bring it from the unseen in to the seen, plant the tiny seed, water it, care for it, place it where it will get the direct rays of the morning sun, see the se ed burst; it is now a li ving thing, something which is alive and beginning to search for the means of subsistence. See the roots penetr ating the earth, watch them shoot out in all directions and rememb er that they are living cells dividing and subdividing, and th at they will soon number millions, that each cell is intellig ent, that it knows what is wants and knows how to get it.

You will be enabl ed to formulate your plans in accordance with exac t knowledge. You will know how to control any situation by bringing adequate causes into play. When you win, as you will, you w ill know exactly why. The ordinary man, who has no definite knowledge of cause and effect, is governed by his feelings or emotions. He thinks chiefly to ju stify his action. If he fails as a businessman, he says that luck is against him. If he dislikes music, he says that music is an expensive luxury. If he is a poor office man, he says that he could succeed better at some outdoor work. If he lacks friends, he says his individuality is too fine to be appreciated. He never thinks his problem through to the end. In short, he does not know that every eff ect is the result of a certain definite cause, but he seeks to console himself with explanations and excuses. He thinks only in self-defence. On the contrary, the man who underst ands that there is no effect without an adequate cause thinks im personally. He gets down to bedrock facts regardless of consequen ces. He is free to follow the trail of truth wherever it may lead. He sees the issue clear to the end, and he meets the requirement s fully and fairly, and the result is that the world gives him all that it has to give, in friendship, honor, love and approval. PART TEN 1. Abundance is a natural law of the Universe. The evidence of this law is conclusive; we see it on every hand. Everyw here Nature is lavish, wasteful, extravagant. No where is economy observed in"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"any created thing. Profusion is manifested in everything. The millions and millions of trees and flowers and plants and animals and the vast scheme of reproduction where the process of creating and recreating is forever going on, all indicates the lavishness with which Nature has made provision for man. That there is an abundance for everyone is evident, but that many fail to participate in this abundance is also eviden t; they have not ye t come into a realization of the Universality of al l substance, and that mind is the active principle whereby we are related to the things we desire. 2. All wealth is the offspring of power; possessions are of value only as they confer power. Even ts are significant only as they affect power; all things represen t certain forms and degrees of power. 3. Knowledge of cause and effect as shown by the laws governing electricity, chemical affinity and gravitation, enables man to plan courageously and execute fearlessly. These laws are called Natural Laws, because they govern in the physical world, but all power is not physical power; there is also mental power, and there is moral and spiritual power. 4. Spiritual power is su perior because it exists on a higher plane. It has enabled man to discover the law by which these wonderful forces of Nature could be harnes sed and made to do the work of hundreds and thou sands of men. It has en abled man to discover laws whereby time and sp ace have been annih ilated and the law of gravitation to be overcome. The operation of this law is dependent upon spiritual contact, as Henry Drummond well says: 5. \"In the physical world as we know it, there exists the organic and the inorganic. The inorganic of the mineral world is absolutely cut off from the plant or animal wo rld; the passage is hermetically sealed. These barriers have never yet been crossed. No change of substance, no modification of environment, no chemistry, no electricity, no form of energy, no evolution of any kind can ever"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"endow a single atom of the mine ral world with the attribute of Life.\" 6. \"Only by the bending down into this dead world of some living form can those dead atoms be gifted with the properties of vitality; without this contact with life th ey remain fixed in the inorganic sphere forever. Huxley says that the doctrine of Bi ogenesis (or life only from life) is victorious a ll along the line, and Tyndall is compelled to say: 'I affirm that no shred of trustworthy evidence exists to prove that life in our day has ever appeared independent of antecedent life.' 7. \"Physical laws may explain the inorganic, Biology explains and accounts for the development of th e organic, but of the point of contact Science is silent. A simi lar passage exists between the Natural world and the Spiritual worl d; this passage is hermetically sealed on the natural side. The doo r is closed; no man can open it, no organic change, no mental energy, no moral effort, no progress of any kind can enable any huma n being to enter the spiritual world.\" 8. But as the plant reaches down into the mineral world and touches it with the mystery of Li fe, so the Universal Mind reaches down into the human mind and endows it with new, strange, wonderful and even marvelous qu alities. All men or women who have every accomplished anything in the world of industry, commerce or art have accomplishe d because of this process. 9. Thought is the connecting link between the Infi nite and the finite, between the Universal and the individual. We have seen that there is an impassable barrier between the organic and the inorganic, and that the only way that matter can unfold is to be impregnated with life; as a seed reaches down in to the mineral world and begins to unfold and reac h out, the dead matter begins to live, a thousand invisible fing ers begin to weave a suitable environment for the new arrival, an d as the law of growth begins to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"take effect, we see the process continue until the Lily finally appears, and even \"Solomon in a ll his glory was not arrayed like one of these\". 10. Even so, a thought is dropped into the invisible substance of the Universal Mind, that substance from which all things are created, and as it takes root, the la w of growth begins to take effect and we find that conditions and environment are but the objective form of our thought. 11. The law is that Thought is an active vital form of dynamic energy which has the power to corr elate with its object and bring it out of the invisible substance from which all things are created into the visible or objective world. This is the law by which, and through which all things come into manifestation; it is the Master Key by which you are admitted into the Secret Place of the Most High and are \"given dominion over all things.\" With an understanding of this law you m ay \"decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee.\" 12. It could not be otherwise; if the soul of the Universe as we know it is the Universal Spirit, th en the Universe is simply the condition which the Uni versal Spirit has made for itself. We are simply individualized spirit and are creating the conditions for our growth in exactly the same way. 13. This creative power depend s upon our recognition of the potential power of spirit or mind and must not be confused with Evolution. Creation is the calling in to existence of that which does not exist in the objective world. Ev olution is simply the unfolding of potentialities involved in th ings which already exist. 14. In taking advantage of the wonderful possibilities opened up to us through the operatio n of this law, we must remember that we ourselves contribute nothing to its efficacy as the Great Teacher said: \"It is not I that doeth the works, but the Father that dwelleth"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"in me, He doeth the work\". We must take exactly the same position; we can do nothing to a ssist in the manifestation, we simply comply with the law, an d the All-originating Mind will bring about the result. 15. The great error of the present day is the idea that Man has to originate the intelligence whereby t he Infinite can proceed to bring about a specific purpose or re sult. Nothing of this kind is necessary; the Universal Mind can be depended upon to find the ways and means for bringing abou t any necessary manifestation. We must, however, create the id eal, and this ideal should be perfect. 16. We know that the laws gov erning Electricity have been formulated in such a way that this invisible power can be controlled and used for our benefit and comfort in thousands of ways. We know that messages are carried around the world, that ponderous machinery does its bidding, that it now illuminates practically the whole world, but we know too that if we consciously or ignorantly violate its law by touchi ng a live wire, when it is not properly insulated, the result will be unpleasant and possibly disastrous. A lack of under standing of the laws governing in the invisible world has the sa me result, and many are suffering the consequences all the time. 17. It has been explained that the law of causation depends upon polarity, a circuit must be formed ; this circuit ca nnot be formed unless we operate in harmony with the law. How shall we operate in harmony with the law unless we know what the law is? How shall we know what the Law is? By study, by observation. 18. We see the law in operation eve rywhere; all nature testifies to the operation of the law by silently , constantly expressing itself in the law of growth. Where there is growth, there must be life; where there is life there must be harmony, so that everything that has life"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"is constantly attracting to itself the conditions and the supply which is necessary for its most complete expression. 19. If your thought is in harmony with the creative Principle of Nature, it is in tune with the Infinite Mind, and it will form the circuit, it will not return to you voi d; but it is pos sible for you to think thoughts that are not in tune with the Infinite, and when there is no polarity, the circuit is not formed. What, then, is the result? What is the result when a dynamo is generating electricity, the circuit is cut off and there is no outlet? The dynamo stops. 20. It will be exactly the same wi th you, if you en tertain thoughts which are not in accor dance with the Infinite and cannot therefore be polarized; there is no circuit, you are isolated, the thoughts cling to you, harass you, worry you, an d finally bring about disease and possibly death; the ph ysician may not diagnose the case exactly in this way, he may give it some fancy name which has been manufactured for the various ills which are the result of wrong thinking, but the cause is the same nevertheless. 21. Constructive thought must nece ssarily be creative, but creative thought must be harmonious, and th is eliminates all destructive or competitive thought. 22. Wisdom, strength, courage and all harmonious conditions are the result of power and we have se en that all power is from within; likewise, every lack, limitation or adverse circumstance is the result of weakness, and weakness is simply absence of power; it comes from nowhere, it is nothing -- the remedy then is simply to develop power, and this is ac complished in exactly the same manner that all power is developed, by exercise. 23. This exercise consists in making an application of your knowledge. Knowledge will not ap ply itself. You must make the application. Abundance will not come to yo u out of the sky, neither will it drop into your lap, but a conscious re alization of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"law of attraction and the intention to bring it into operation for a certain, definite and specific purpos e, and the will to carry out this purpose will bring about the materi alization of your desire by a natural law of transference.

This week select a blank sp ace on the wall, or any other convenient spot, from where you us ually sit, mentally draw a black horizontal line about six inches long , try to see the line as plainly as though it were painted on the wall; now mentally draw two vertical lines connecting with this horizontal line at either end; now draw another horizontal line connec ting with the two vertical lines; now you have a square.

It is well, however, to remember that while every effect is the result of a cause, the effect in turn becomes a cause, which creates other effects, which in turn create s till other causes; so that when you put the law of attraction into op eration you must remember that you are starting a trai n of causation for good or otherwise which may have endless possibilities. We frequently hear it said, \"A very distressing situation came into my life, which could not have b een the result of my thought, as I certainly never entertained any th ought which could have such a result.\" We fail to remember that like attracts like in the mental world, and that the thou ght which we entertain brings to us certain friendships, companionships of a particular kind, and these in turn bring about conditions and environment, which in turn are responsible for the conditio ns of which we complain. PART ELEVEN 1. Inductive reasoning is the process of the objective mind by which we compare a number of separate instanc es with one another until we see the common factor that gives rise to them all. 2.

It is the dividing line between superstition and intelligence; it has eliminated the elements of unc ertainty and caprice from men's lives and substituted law, reason, and certitude. 4.

When, by virtue of this principl e, the world to which the senses were accustomed had bee n revolutionized; when the sun had been arrested in his course, the apparen tly flat earth had been shaped into a ball and set whirling around him; when the inert matter had been resolved into active elem ents, and the universe presented itself wherever we directed the te lescope and micr oscope, full of force, motion and life; we are cons trained to ask by what possible means the delicate forms of organi zation in the midst of it are kept in order and repair. 6. Like poles and like forces repel themselves or remain impenetrable to each other, and this c ause seems in general sufficient to assign a proper place and distance to stars, men and forces. As men of different virtues enter into partnership, so do opposite poles attract eac h other, elements that have no property in common like acids and gases cling to each other in preference and a general exchange is ke pt up between the surp lus and the demand. 7. As the eye seeks and receives satisf action from colors complementary to those which are given, so does need, want and desire, in the largest sense, induc e, guide and determine action. 8. It is our privilege to become co nscious of the principle and act in accordance with it. Cuvier sees a tooth belonging to an extinct race of animals. This tooth wants a body for the performance of its function, and it defines the peculiar body it stands in need of with such precision that Cuvier is able to reconstruct the frame of this animal."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"9. Perturbations are observed in the motion of Uranus. Leverrier needs another star at a certain pl ace to keep the solar system in order, and Neptune appears in th e place and hour appointed. 10. The instinctive wants of the animal and the in tellectual wants of Cuvier, the wants of nature and of the mind of Leverrier were alike, and thus the results; here the thoughts of an existence, there an existence. A well-defined lawful want, therefore, furnishes the reason for the more complex operations of nature. 11. Having recorded correctly the answers furnished by nature and stretched our senses with the gr owing science over her surface; having joined hands with the leve rs that move the earth; we become conscious of such a close, varied and deep contact with the world without, that our wants and purposes be come no less identified with the harmonious operations of this vast organization, than the life, liberty, and happiness of the citizen is identified with the existence of his government. 12. As the interests of the individu al are protected by the arms of the country, added to his own; and his needs may depend upon certain supply in the degree that they are felt more universally and steadily; in the same manner does conscious citizenship in the Republic of nature secure us fr om the annoyances of subordinate agents by alliance with superi or powers; and by appeal to the fundamental laws of resistance or inducement offered to mechanical or chemical agents, di stribute the labor to be performed between them and man to the best advantage of the inventor. 13. If Plato could have witnessed the pictures executed by the sun with the assistance of the phot ographer, or a hundred similar illustrations of what man does by induction, he would perhaps have been reminded of the intelle ctual midwifery of his master and, in his own mind might have ar isen the vision of a land where all manual, mechanical labor and repetition is assi gned to the power of nature, where our wants are satisfied by purely mental"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"operations set in motion by th e will, and where the supply is created by the demand. 14. However distant that land may appear, induction has taught men to make strides toward it and has surrounded him with benefits which are, at the same time, rewards for past fidelity and incentives for more a ssiduous devotion. 15. It is also an aid in concentra ting and strengthening our faculties for the remaining part, giving unerring solution for individual as well as universal problems, by the mere operations of mind in the purest form. 16. Here we find a method, the spir it of which is, to believe that what is sought has been accomplished, in order to accomplish it: a method, bequeathed upon us by the same Plato who, outside of this sphere, could never find how the ideas became realities. 17. This conception is also el aborated by Swedenborg in his doctrine of correspondences; and a still greater teacher has said, \"What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall h ave them.\" (Mark 11:24) The difference of the tenses in th is passage is remarkable. 18. We are first to believe that our desire has already been fulfilled, its accomplishment will then follow. This is a concise direction for making use of the creative power of thought by impressing on the Universal subjective mind, the partic ular thing which we desire as an already existing fact. 19. We are thus thinking on the plane of the absolute and eliminating all consideration of conditions or limitation and are planting a seed which, if left undisturbed, will finally germinate into external fruition."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"20. To review: Inductive reasoning is the process of the objective mind, by which we compare a numbe r of separate instances with one another until we see the common factor that gives rise to them all. We see people in every civilized country on the globe, securing results by some process which th ey do not seem to understand themselves, and to which they usua lly attach more or less mystery. Our reason is given to us for the purpose of ascertaining the law by which these results are accomplished. 21. The operation of this thought pr ocess is seen in those fortunate natures that possess everything th at others must acquire by toil, who never have a struggle with conscience because they always act correctly, and can never conduct th emselves otherwise than with tact, learn everything easily, comple te everything they begin with a happy knack, live in eternal harm ony with themselves, without ever reflecting much what they do, or ever experiencing difficulty or toil. 22. The fruit of this thought is, as it were, a gift of the gods, but a gift which few as yet realize, appreciate, or understand. The recognition of the marvelous power which is possessed by the mind under proper conditions and th e fact that this power can be utilized, directed, and made ava ilable for the solution of every human problem is of transcendental importance. 23. All truth is the same, whether st ated in modern scientific terms or in the language of apostolic times. There are timid souls who fail to realize that the very comp leteness of truth requires various statements -- that no one human form ula will show every side of it. 24. Changing, emphasis, new lan guage, novel interpretations, unfamiliar perspectives, are not, as some suppose, signs of departure from truth but on the cont rary, they are evidence that the truth is being apprehended in new relations to human needs, and is becoming more gene rally understood."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"25.

The time has arrived when man has learned the se crets of mastery and the way is being prepared for a new social order, more wonderful than anything every heretofore dreamed of. The conflict of modern science with theology, the stu dy of comparative religions, the tremendous power of new social movements, all of these are but clearing the way for the new orde r. They may have destroyed traditional forms whic h have become antiquated and impotent, but nothing of value has been lost. 27.

Thought reaches its loftiest activity when plung ed into its own mysterious depth; when it breaks through the narrow compass of self and passes from truth to trut h to the region of eternal light, where all which is, was or ever will be, melt into one grand harmony. 32. From this process of self contemplation comes inspiration which is creative inte lligence, and which is undeniably superior to every element, force or law of nature, because it can understand, modify, govern and apply them to its own ends and purposes and therefore possess them. 33.

In the fourth paragraph you will find the following statement: \"You must first have the knowledge of your power; second, the courage to dare; third, the faith to do.\" If you concentrate upon the thoughts given, if you give them your entire attention, you will find a worl d of meaning in each sentence, and will attract to yourself other thoughts in harmony with them, and you will soon grasp the full significance of the vital knowledge upon which you are concentrating. Knowledge does not apply itself; we as individuals must make the application, and the application consists in fertilizing the thought with a living purpose. The time and thought which most pe rsons waste in aimless effort would accomplish wonders if properly directed with some special object in view. In order to do this , it is necessary to center your mental force upon a specific t hought and hold it there, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. If you have ever looked through the viewfinder of a camera, you found that when the object was not in focus, the impression was indistinct and possibly blurred, but when the proper focus was obtained the picture was clear and distinct. This illustrates the power of concentration. Unless you can concentrate upon the ob ject which you have in view, you will have but a hazy, indifferent, vague, in distinct and blurred outline of your ideal and the results will be in accordance with your mental picture. PART TWELVE 1. There is no purpose in life th at cannot be best accomplished through a scientific understanding of the crea tive power of thought."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"2. This power to think is common to all. Man is, because he thinks. Man's power to think is infinite, consequently his creative power is unlimited. 3. We know that thought is building for us the thing we think of and actually bringing it nearer, yet we find it difficult to banish fear, anxiety or discouragement, all of which are powerful thought forces, and which continually send the things we desire further away, so that it is often one step forward and two steps backward. 4. The only way to keep from going backward is to keep going forward. Eternal vigilance is the price of success. There are three steps, and each one is absolutely essential. You must first have the knowledge of your powe r; second, the courage to dare; third, the faith to do. 5. With this as a basis you can co nstruct an ideal business, an ideal home, ideal friends, and an i deal environment. You are not restricted as to material or cost. Thought is omnipotent and has the power to draw on the In finite bank of primary substance for all that it requires. Infinite resources are therefore at your command. 6. But your ideal must be sharp, clear-cut, definite; to have one ideal today, another tomorrow, and a third next week, means to scatter your forces and accomplish nothing; your result will be a meaningless and chaotic combina tion of wasted material. 7. Unfortunately this is the result which many are securing, and the cause is self evident. If a sculptor started out with a piece of marble and a chisel and changed his ideal every fifteen minutes, what result could he expect? And why should you expect any different result in molding the greatest and most plastic of all substances, the only real substance? 8. The result of this indecision and negative thought is often found in the loss of material wea lth. Supposed in dependence which"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"required many years of toil and ef fort suddenly disappears. It is often found then that money and property are not independence at all. On the contrary, the only independence is found to be a practical working knowledge of the creative power of thought. 9. This practical working method cannot come to you until you learn that the only real power wh ich you can have is the power to adjust yourself to Divine and unchangeable principl es. You cannot change the Infinite, but you can come into an understanding of Natural laws. The reward of this understanding is a conscious realization of your ability to adju st your thought faculties with the Universal Thought which is Om nipresent. Your ability to cooperate with this Omnipotence will indicate the degree of success with which you meet. 10. The power of thought has many counterfeits which are more or less fascinating, but th e results are harmful instead of helpful. 11. Of course, worry, fear, and all negative thoughts produce a crop after their kind; those who ha rbor thoughts of this kind must inevitably reap what they have sown. 12. Again, there are the Phenom ena seekers who gormandize on the so-called proofs and demonstra tion obtained at materializing séances. They throw open their me ntal doors and soak themselves in the most poisonous currents wh ich can be found in the psychic world. They do not seem to un derstand that it is the ability to become negative, recep tive and passive, and thus drain themselves of all their vital forc e, which enables them to bring about these vibratory thought forms. 13. There are also the Hindu worshippers, who see in the materializing phenomena which ar e performed by the so-called adepts, a source of power, forge tting, or never seeming to realize that as soon as the will is wi thdrawn the forms wither, and the vibratory forces of which they are composed vanish."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"14. Telepathy, or thought transfer ence, has received considerable attention, but as it re quires a negative mental state on the part of the receiver, the practice is harmfu l. A thought may be sent with the intention of hearing or seei ng, but it will bring the penalty attached to the i nversion of the principle involved. 15. In many instances, hypnotism is positiv ely dangerous to the subject as well as the operator. No one familiar with the laws governing in the mental world would think of attempting to dominate the will of another, for by so doing, he will gradually (but surely) divest hims elf of his own power. 16. All of these perversions have their temporary satisfaction and for some a keen fascination, but there is an infinitely greater fascination in a true understanding of the world of power within, a power which increases with use; is permanent instead of fleeing; which not only is potent as a re medial agency to bring about the remedy for past error or results of wrong thinking, but is a prophylactic agency protecting us from all manner and form of danger, and finally is an actual creative force with which we can build new conditions and new environment. 17. The law is that thought will correlate with its object and bring forth in the material world the co rrespondence of the thing thought or produced in the mental world. We then discern the absolute necessity of seeing that every t hought has the inherent germ of truth in order that the law of gr owth will bring into manifestation good, for good alon e can confer any pe rmanent power. 18. The principle which gives th e thought the dynamic power to correlate with its object, and th erefore to master every adverse human experience, is the law of at traction, which is another name for love. This is an eternal and fundamental principle, inherent in all things, in every system of Ph ilosophy, in every Religion, and in every Science. There is no getting aw ay from the law of love. It is"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"feeling that imparts vitality to tho ught. Feeling is desire, and desire is love. Thought impregnated wi th love becomes invincible. 19. We find this truth emphasized wherever the po wer of thought is understood, The Universal Mind is not only Intelli gence, but it is substance, and this substance is the attractive force which brings electrons together by the law of a ttraction so that they form atoms; the atoms in turn are brought toge ther by the same law and form molecules; molecules t ake objective forms; and so we find that the law of love is the creative force behind every manifestation, not only of atoms, but of worlds, of the Universe, of everything of which the imagination can form any conception. 20. It is the operation of this ma rvelous law of attraction which has caused men in all ages and all times to believe that there must be some personal being who responded to their petitions and desires, and manipulated events in order to comply with their requirements. 21. It is the combination of Th ought and Love which forms the irresistible force, called the law of attraction. All natural laws are irresistible, the law of Gravitation , or Electricity, or any other law operates with mathematical exactitu de. There is no variation; it is only the channel of distribution which may be imperfect. If a bridge falls, we do not attribute th e collapse to any variation of the law of gravitation. If a light fails us, we do not conclude that the laws governing electricity cannot be depended upon, and if the law of attraction seems to be impe rfectly demonstrated by an inexperienced or uninf ormed person, we are not to conclude that the greatest and most infallible law upon wh ich the entire system of creation depends has been suspended. We sh ould rather conclude that a little more understa nding of the law is required, for the same reason that a correct solution of a difficult problem in Mathematics is not always re adily and easily obtained. 22.

Educated desire is the most potent means of bringing into action the law of attraction. 23. Man is so constituted that he must first create the tools, or implements by which he gains the power to think. The mind cannot comprehend an entirely new idea until a corresp onding vibratory brain cell has been prepared to receive it. This explains why it is so difficult for us to receive or app reciate an entirely new idea; we have no brain cell capable of receiving it; we are therefore incredulous; we do not believe it. 24. If, therefore, you have not b een familiar with the Omnipotence of the law of attraction, and the scientific method by which it can be put into operation, or if you have not been familiar with the unlimited possibilities which it opens to those who are enabled to take advantage of the resources it offers, begin now and create the necessary brain cells which will enable you to comprehend the unlimited powers which may be yours by coope rating with Natural Law. This is done by con centration or attention. 25. The intention governs the attention. Powe r comes through repose. It is by concentration that deep thoughts, wise speech, and all forces of hi gh potentiality are accomplished. 26. It is in the Silence that you get into touch with the Omnipotent power of the subconscious mind fr om which all power is evolved. 27. He who desires wisdom, power, or permanent success of any kind will find it only within; it is an unfoldment.

Spiritual science has previously been the football of the uneducated, the superstitious, t he mystical, but men are now interested in definite methods and demonst rated facts only. We have come to know that thinki ng is a spiritual process, that vision and imagination preceded ac tion and event, that the day of the dreamer has come. The following lines by Mr. Herbert Kaufman are interesting in this connection. \"They are the architects of greatnes s, their vision lies within their souls, they peer beyond the veils and mists of doubt and pierce the walls of unborn Time. The belted wheel, the trail of steel, the churning screw, are shuttles in th e loom on which they weave their magic tapestries. Makers of Empire , they have fought for bigger things than crowns and higher seats than thrones. Your homes are set upon the land a dreamer found . The pictures on its walls are visions from a dreamer's soul. They are the chose few -- the blazers of the way. Walls crumbl e and Empires fall, the tidal wave sweeps from the sea and tears a fortress from its rocks. The rotting nations drop off from Time's bough , and only things the dreamer's make live on.\" Part Thirteen which follows tells why the dreams of the dreamer come true. It explains the law of causation by which dreamers, inventors, authors, finan ciers, bring about the realization of their desires. It explains the law by which the thing pictured upon our mind eventually becomes our own."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"PART THIRTEEN 1. It has been the te ndency, and, as might be proved, a necessity for science to seek the explan ation of everyday facts by a generalization of those others wh ich are less frequent and form the exception. Thus does the eruption of the volcano manifest the heat which is continually at work in the interior of the earth and to which the latter owes much of her configuration. 2. Thus does the lightning reveal a subtle power constantly busy to produce changes in th e inorganic world, and, as dead languages now seldom heard were once ruling among the nations, so does a giant tooth in Siberia, or a fossil in the depth of the earth, not only bear record of the evolution of past ages, but thereby explains to us the origin of the h ills and valleys which we inhabit today. 3. In this way a generalization of facts which are rare, strange, or form the exception, has been the ma gnetic needle guid ing to all the discoveries of i nductive science. 4. This method is founded upon reason and experience and thereby destroyed superstition, prec edent and conventionality. 5. It is almost three-hundred ye ars since Lord Bacon recommended this method of study, to which the civilized nations owe the greater part of their prosperity and th e more valuable part of their knowledge; purging the mi nd from narrow prejudices, denominated theories, more effect ually than by the keenest irony; calling the attention of men from heav en to earth more successfully by surprising experiments than by the most forcible demonstration of their ignorance; educating the inventive faculties more powerfully by the near prospect of useful discoveries thrown open to all, than by talk of bringing to light the i nnate laws of our mind. 6. The method of Bacon has seized the spirit and aim of the great philosophers of Greece and carried them into effect by the new"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"means of observation which another age offered; thus gradually revealing a wondrous field of know ledge in the infi nite space of astronomy, in the microscopic eg g of embryology, and the dim age of geology; disclosing an order of the pulse which the logic of Aristotle could never have unveiled, and analyzing into formerly unknown elements the material comb inations which no dialectic of the scholastics could force apart. 7. It has lengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has extinguished diseases; it has increased the fer tility of the soil; it has given new securities to the mariner; it has sp anned great rivers with bridges of form unknown to our fathers; it has guided the thunderbolt from heaven to earth; it has lighted up night with th e splendor of day; it has extended the range of hum an vision; it has multiplied the power of the human muscles; it has accelerated motion; it has annihilated distance; it has facilita ted intercourse, correspondence, all friendly offices, all dispatch of business; it has enabled men to descend into the depths of the sea, to soar into the air, to penetrate securely into the noxious recesses of the earth. 8. This then is the true nature and scope of induction. But the greater the success which men hav e achieved in the inductive science, the more does the whol e tenor of their teachings and example impress us with the necessity of obse rving carefully, patiently, accurately, with all the instrument s and resources at our command the individual facts before venturing upon a statement of general laws. 9.

In short, by the va lue we set upon truth, by our hope in a steady and universal progress, not to permit a tyrannical prejudice to neglect or mutilate unwelcome facts, but to re ar the superstructure of science upon the broad and unchan geable basis, of full attention paid to the most isolated as well as the most frequent phenomena. 11. An ever-increasing material ma y be collected by observation, but the accumulated facts are of very different value for the explanation of nature, and as we esteem most highly those useful qualities of men which are of the ra rest occurrence, so does natural philosophy sift the facts and attach a pre-eminent importance to that striking class which cannot be accounted for by the usual and daily observation of life. 12. If then, we find that certai n persons seem to possess unusual power, what are we to conclude? Fi rst, we may say, it is not so, which is simply an acknowledgment of our lack of information because every honest investigat or admits that there are many strange and previously unaccountable phenomena constantly taking place. Those, however, who become acqua inted with the creative power of thought, will no longer consider them unaccountable. 13. Second, we may say that they are the result of supernatural interference, but a scie ntific understanding of Natural Laws will convince us that there is nothin g supernatural. Every phenomenon is the result of an accurate defi nite cause, and the cause is an immutable law or principle, wh ich operates with invariable precision, whether the law is put into operation consciously or unconsciously. 14. Third, we may say that we are on \"forbidden ground,\" that there are some things which we should not know. This objection was used against every adva nce in human kno wledge.

Thought will bring about cond itions in correspondence with the predominant mental attitud e. Therefore, if we f ear disaster, as fear is a powerful form of thought, disa ster will be the certain result of our thinking. It is this form of thought which frequently sweeps away the result of many ye ars of toil and effort. 17. If we think of some form of material wealth we may secure it. By concentrated thought the requi red conditions will be brought about, and the proper ef fort put forth, which will result in bringing about the circumstances necessary to realize our desires; but we often find that when we secure the things we thought we wanted, they do not have the effect we ex pected. That is, the satisfaction is only temporary, or possibly is the reverse of what we expected. 18. What, then, is the proper method of procedure? What are we to think in order to secure what we really desire? What you and I desire, what we all desire, what e very one is seekin g, is Happiness and Harmony. If we can be truly happy we shall have everything the world can give. If we are happy ourselves we can make others happy. 19.

The old orthodox way of thi nking was to be \"a worm,\" to be satisfied with our portion whatever it is; but the modern idea is to know that we are entitled to the best of everyth ing, that the \"Father and I are one\" and that the \"Fat her\" is the Universal Mind, the Creator, the Original Substance fr om which all thi ngs proceed. 21. Now admitting that this is all true in theory, and it has been taught for two thousand years, and is the essence of every system of Philosophy or Religion, how are we to make it practical in our lives? How are we to get the actual, tangible results here and now? 22. In the first place, we must put our knowledge into practice. Nothing can be accomplished in any other way. The athlete may read books and lessons on physical training all his life, but unless he begins to give out strength by actual work he will never receive any strength; he will eventually ge t exactly what he gives; but he will have to give it first. It is ex actly the same with us; we will get exactly what we give, but we shall h ave to give it first. It will then return to us many fold, and the gi ving is simply a mental process, because thoughts are causes and cond itions are effects; therefore in giving thoughts of cour age, inspiration, health or help of any kind we are setting causes in motion whic h will bring about their effect. 23. Thought is a spiritual activity and is therefore creative, but make no mistake, thought will create nothing unless it is consciously, systematically, and co nstructively directed; and herein is the difference between idle thinking, which is simply a dissipation of effort, and cons tructive thinking, which means practically unlimited achievement. 24. We have found that everything we get comes to us by the Law of Attraction. A happy thought cannot exist in an unhappy consciousness; therefore the consc iousness must change, and, as the consciousness changes, all cond itions necessary to meet the changed consciousness must gradually change, in order to meet the requirements of the new situation."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"25.

This does not mean that some thought is cr eative, but that all thought is creative. This same principle can be brought into operation in a negative way, through the process of denial. The conscious and subconscious ar e but two phases of action in connection with one mind. The relation of the subconscious to the conscious is quite analogous to that existing between a weather vane and the atmosphere. Just as the least pressure of the atmosphere causes an action on the part of the weather vane, so does the least thought entertained by the conscious mind produce w ithin your subconscious mind action in exact proportion to the depth of feeling characterizing the thought and the intensity with which the thought is indulged. It follows that if you deny un satisfactory c onditions, you are withdrawing the creative power of your thought from these conditions. You are cutting them away at the root. You are sapping their vitality. Remember that the law of growth necessarily governs every manifestation in the objective, so that a denial of unsatisfactory conditions will not bring about in stant change. A plant will remain visible for some time after its ro ots have been cut, but it will gradually fade away and eventual ly disappear, so the withdrawal of your thought from the cont emplation of unsatisfactory conditions will gradually, but sure ly, terminate these conditions.

PART FOURTEEN 1. The Universal Energy in which all motion, light, heat, and color have their origin, does not partake of the limitation of the many effects of which it is the cause, but it is supreme over them all. This Universal Substance is the source of all Power, Wisdom and Intelligence. 2. To recognize this Intelligence is to acquaint yourself with the knowing quality of Mind and through it to move upon the Universal Substance, and bring it in to harmonious rela tions in your affairs. 3. This is something that the most learned physical science teacher has not attempted -- a field of di scovery upon whic h he has not yet launched; in fact, but few of the materialistic schools have ever caught the first ray of this light. It does not seem to have dawned upon them that wisdom is just as much present everywhere as are force and substance. 4. Some will say, if these prin ciples are true, why are we not demonstrating them? As the fundamental principle is obviously correct, why do we not get proper results? We do. We get results in exact accordance with our understanding of the law and our ability to make the proper application. We secured no results from the laws governing electricity until so meone formulated the law and showed us how to apply it. 5. This puts us in an entirely new relation to our environment, opening up possibilities previously undreamed of, an d this by an"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"orderly sequence of law which is naturally involved in our new mental attitude. 6. Mind is creative and the princi ple upon which this law is based is sound and legitimate and is inhere nt in the nature of things; but this creative power does not origin ate in the individual, but in the Universal, which is the source and fountain of all energy and substance, the individual is simp ly the channel for the distribution of this energy. The individual is the means by which the Universal produces the various combinations which result in the formation of phenomena. 7. We know that scientists have resolved matter into an immense number of molecules; these mol ecules have been resolved into atoms, and the atoms into electron s. The discovery of electrons in high vacuum glass tubes containing fused terminals of hard metal, indicates conclusively that these electrons f ill all space; that they exist everywhere, that they are om nipresent. They fill all material bodies and occupy the whole of what we call empty space. This, then, is the Universal Substance from which a ll things proceed. 8. Electrons would forever remain electrons unless directed where to go to be assembled into atoms and molecules, and this director is Mind. A number of electrons revolving around a center of force constitutes an atom; atoms unite in absolutely regular mathematical ratios and form molecules, and thes e unite with each other to form a multitude of compounds which un ite to build the Universe. 9. The lightest known atom is h ydrogen and this is 1,700 times heavier than an electron. An at om of mercury is 300,000 times heavier than an electron. Electrons are pure negative electricity, and as they have the same potentia l velocity as all other cosmic energy, such as heat, light, electricity and thought, neither time nor space require consideration. The m anner in which th e velocity of light was ascertained is interesting."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"10. The velocity of light was obt ained by the Danish astronomer Roemer in 1676, by observing t he eclipses of Jupiter's moons. When the earth was nearest to Ju piter, the eclipse appeared about eight and one-half minutes too soon for the calculations, and when the earth was most remote from Ju piter, they were about eight and one-half minutes too late. Roemer concluded the reason to be that it required 17 minutes for light fr om the planet to traverse the diameter of the earth's orbit, which measured the difference of the distances of the earth from Jupiter. This calculation has since been verified, and proves that light travels about 186,000 miles a second. 11. Electrons manifest in the bo dy as cells, and possess mind and intelligence sufficient for them to perform their functions in the human physical anatomy. Every part of the body is composed of cells, some of which operate inde pendently; others in communities. Some are busy building tissue, while others ar e engaged in forming the various secretions necessary for the body. Some act as carriers of material; others are the surgeons whose work it is to repair damage; others are scavengers, car rying off waste; others are constantly ready to repel invaders or other undesirable intruders of the germ family. 12. All these cells are moving fo r a common purpose and each one is not only a living organism, but has sufficient intelligence to enable it to perform its necessary duties. It is also endowed with sufficient intelligence to conserve the energies and perpetuate its own life. It must, therefore, secu re sufficient nourishment and it has been found that it exercises c hoice in the selection of such nourishment. 13. Each cell is born, reproduces it self, dies and is absorbed. The maintenance of health and life its elf depends upon the constant regeneration of these cells."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"14. It is therefore apparent that th ere is mind in every atom of the body; this mind is negative mind, and the power of the individual to think makes him positive, so that he can control this negative mind. This is the scientific ex planation for metaphysical healing, and will enable anyone to understand the prin ciple upon which this remarkable phenomenon rests. 15. This negative mind, which is contained in every cell of the body, has been called the subconscious mind, because it acts without our conscious knowledge . We have found that this subconscious mind is responsive to the will of the conscious mind. 16. All things have their origin in mind, and appearances are the result of thought. So that we see th at things in themselves have no origin, permanency, or reality. Since they are produced by thought, they can be eras ed by thought. 17. In mental, as in natural scie nce, experiments are being made and each discovery lifts man one st ep higher toward his possible goal. We find that every man is th e reflection of the thought he has entertained during his lifetime. This is stamped on his face, his form, his character, his environment. 18. Back of every effect there is a cause, and if we follow the trail to its starting point, we shall fi nd the creative principle out of which it grew. Proofs of this are now so complete that this truth is generally accepted. 19. The objective world is controlle d by an unseen and, heretofore, unexplainable power. We have, heretofore, personalized this power and called it God. We have now, however, learned to look upon it as the permeating essence or Princi ple of all that exists -- the Infinite or Un iversal Mind. 20. The Universal Mind, being infinite and omnipotent, has unlimited resources at its command, and when we remember that it"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"is also omnipresent, we cannot escape the conclusion that we must be an expression or mani festation of that Mind. 21. A recognition and understanding of the resources of the subconscious mind will indicate that the only difference between the subconscious and the Universal is one of degree. They differ only as a drop of water differs fr om the ocean. They are the same in kind and quality, the differe nce is one of degree only. 22. Do you, can you, appreciate th e value of this all-important fact; do you realize that a recognition of this tremendous fact places you in touch with Omnipotence? T he subconscious mind being the connecting link between the Un iversal Mind and the conscious mind, is it not evident that the conscious mind can consciously suggest thoughts which the subconsci ous mind will pu t into action, and as the subconscious is one with the Universal, is it not evident that no limit can be pl aced upon its activities? 23. A scientific understanding of this principle will explain the wonderful results which are secure d through the power of prayer. The results which are secured in this way are not brought about by any special dispensations of provi dence, but on the contrary, they are the result of the operation of a perfectly natural law. There is, therefore, nothing either religi ous or mysterious about it. 24. Yet there are many who are not ready to enter into the discipline necessary to think co rrectly, even tho ugh it is evident that wrong thinking has brought failure. 25. Thought is the only reality; conditions are but the outward manifestations; as the thought cha nges, all outward or material conditions must change in order to be in harmony with their creator, which is thought. 26.

This experiment was made by Jacques Loch, M.D., Ph.

If the plants are allowed to dry out, the aphids (parasites), previously wingless, change to winged insects. After the metamorphosis, the animals leave the plants, fly to the wind ow and then creep upward on the glass.\" It is evident that these tiny insects found that the plants on which they had been thriving were dead, and that they could therefore secure nothing more to eat and drink from this source. The only method by which they could save themselves from starvation was to grow temporary wings and fly, which they did. Experiments such as these indicate that Omniscience as well as Omnipotence is omnipresent and that the tiniest living thing can take advantage of it in an emergency.

All the great eternal forces act in solemn silence, but it is in our power to place ourselves in harm ony with them and thus express a life of comparative peace and happiness. 3. Difficulties, inharmonies, and obstacles, indicate that we are either refusing to give out what we no longer need, or refusing to accept what we require. 4. Growth is attained through an exchange of the old for the new, of the good for the better; it is a conditional or reciprocal action, for each of us is a complete th ought entity and this completeness makes it possible for us to re ceive only as we give. 5. We cannot obtain what we lack if we tenaciously cling to what we have. We are able to consciously control our conditions as we come to sense the purpose of what we attract, and are able to extract from each experience only what we require for our further growth. Our ability to do this determines the degree of harmony or happiness we attain. 6. The ability to appropriate w hat we require for our growth, continually increases as we re ach higher planes and broader visions, and the greater our abilities to know what we require, the more certain we shall be to discer n its presence, to attract it and to absorb it. Nothing may reach us except what is ne cessary for our growth. 7. All conditions and experiences th at come to us do so for our benefit.

The inexorable requirements of growth demand that we exert the greatest degree of attraction for what is perfectly in accord with us. Our highest happiness will be best attained through our understanding of, and conscious cooperation with natural laws. 10. In order to possess vitality thought must be impregnated with love. Love is a product of the emotio ns. It is therefore essential that the emotions be control led and guided by the intellect and reason. 11. It is love which imparts vita lity to thought and thus enables it to germinate. The law of attraction, or the law of love, for they are one and the same, will bring to it the necessary material for its growth and maturity. 12. The first form which thought will find is language, or words; this determines the importance of words; they are the first manifestation of thought -- the vessels in which thought is carried. They take hold of the ether and by setting it in mo tion reproduce the thought to others in the form of sound. 13. Thought may lead to action of any kind, but whatever the action, it is simply the thought attempting to express itself in visible form. It is evident, therefore, that if we wish desirable conditions, we can afford to entertain only desirable thoughts. 14. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that if we wish to express abundance in our lives, we can afford to think abundance only, and as words are only thou ghts taking form, we must be especially careful to use nothin g but constructive and harmonious language, which when finally crys tallized into objective forms, will prove to our advantage. 15.

It is with words that we must express our thoughts, and if we are to make use of higher forms of truth, we may use only such material as has been carefully and intelligently sele cted with this purpose in view. 18. This wonderful power of clothing thoughts in the form of words is what differentiates ma n from the rest of the animal kingdom; by the use of the written word he has been enabled to look back over the centuries and see the stirring scenes by which he has come into his pr esent inheritance. 19. He has been enable d to come into commun ion with the greatest writers and thinkers of all time, and the combined record which we possess today is therefore the expre ssion of Universal Thought as it has been seeking to take form in th e mind of Man. 20. We know that the Universa l Thought has for its goal the creation of form, and we know that the individual thought is likewise forever attempting to express itself in form, and we know that the word is a tho ught form, and a sentence is a combination of thought forms, therefore, if we wi sh our ideal to be beautiful or strong, we must see that the word s out of which this temple will eventually be created ar e exact, that they are put together carefully, because accuracy in building word s and sentences is the highest form of architecture in civilizatio n and is a passpo rt to success. 21.

Words may become me ntal places that will live forever, or they may become shacks which the firs t breeze will carry away. They may delight the eye as well as the ear; they may contain all knowledge; in them we find the history of the past as well as the hope of the future; they are liv ing messengers from which every human and superhuman activity is born. 23. The beauty of the word consis ts in the beauty of the thought; the power of the word consists in the power of the thought, and the power of the thought consists in its vitality. How shall we identify a vital thought? What are its dist inguishing characteristics? It must have principle. How shall we identify principle? 24. There is a principle of Mathema tics, but none of error; there is a principle of health, but none of disease; there is a principle of truth, but none of dishonesty; ther e is a principle of light, but none of darkness, and there is a prin ciple of abundance, but none of poverty. 25. How shall we know that this is true? Because if we apply the principle of Mathematics correctly we shall be certain of our results. Where there is health there will be no disease. If we know the Truth we cannot be deceived by error. If we let in light there can be no darkness, and where th ere is abundance there can be no poverty. 26. These are self-evident facts, bu t the all-important truth that a thought containing principle is v ital and therefore contains life and consequently takes root, and eventu ally but surely and certainly displaces the negative thoughts, wh ich by their very nature can contain no vitality, is one which seems to have been overlooked. 27.

For this reason Insight must be exercised so that the thought which we entertain contains no mental, moral or physical germ which we do not wish ob jectified in our lives. 31. Insight is a faculty of the mind whereby we are enabled to examine facts and conditions at long range, a kind of human telescope; it enables us to understand the diffic ulties, as well as the possibilities, in any undertaking. 32. Insight enables us to be prepared for the obstacles which we shall meet; we can therefore over come them before they have any opportunity of caus ing difficulty. 33.

Everything th at lives has periods of birth, growth, fruitage, and decline. Th ese periods are governed by the Septimal Law. The Law of Sevens governs the days of the week, the phases of the moon, the harmonies of sound, ligh t, heat, electricity, magnetism, atomic structure. It governs the life of individuals and of nations, and it dominates the activities of the commercial world. Life is growth, and growth is change, each seven years period takes us into a new cycle. The fi rst seven years is the period of infancy. The next seven the period of childhood, representing the beginning of individual responsibil ity. The next seven represents the period of adolescence. The fo urth period marks the attainment of full growth. The fifth period is the constructive period, when men begin to acquire property, possessions, a home and family. The next from 35 to 42, is a period of reactions and changes, and this in turn is followed by a period of reconstruction, adjustment and recuperation, so as to be ready for a new c ycle of sevens, beginning with the fiftieth year. There are many who think that the world is just bout to pass out of the sixth period; that it will soon enter into the seventh period, the period of readjustment, reconstr uction and harmony; the period which is frequently referred to as the Millennium. Those familiar with thes e cycles will not be disturbed when things seem to go wrong, but can apply the principle outlined in these lessons with the full assurance th at a higher law will invariably control all other laws, and that through an unde rstanding and conscious operation of spiritual laws, we can convert every seeming difficulty into a blessing."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"PART SIXTEEN 1. Wealth is a product of labor. Ca pital is an effect, not a cause; a servant, not a master; a means, not an end. 2. The most commonly accepted defi nition of wealth is that it consists of all useful and agre eable things which possess exchange value. It is this exchange va lue which is th e predominant characteristic of wealth. 3. When we consider the small add ition made by wealth to the happiness of the possessor, we find that the true value consists not in its utility but in its exchange. 4. This exchange value makes it a medium for securing the things of real value whereby our ideals may be realized. 5. Wealth should then never be desi red as an end, but simply as a means of accomplishing an end. Success is contingent upon a higher ideal than the mere accumulation of riches, and he who aspires to such success must form ulate an ideal for which he is willing to strive. 6. With such an ideal in mind, the ways and means can and will be provided, but the mistake must no t be made of substituting the means for the end. There must be a definite fixed purpose, an ideal. 7. Prentice Mulford said: \"The man of success is the man possessed of the greatest spiritual understanding and every great fortune comes of superior and truly spiritual power.\" Unfortunately, there are those wh o fail to recognize this power; they forget that Andrew Carnegie's mother ha d to help support the family when they came to America, that Harriman's father was a poor clergyman with a salary of only $200 a year, that Sir Thomas Lipton started with only 25 cent s. These men had no other power to depend upon, but it did not fail them."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"8. The power to create depends en tirely upon spiritual power; there are three steps, idealization, vi sualization and materialization. Every captain of indust ry depends upon this power exclusively. In an article in Everybody's Magazine, Henry M. Flagler, the Standard Oil multi-millionaire, adm itted that the secret of his success was his power to see a thing in its completeness. The following conversation with the reporter shows his power of idealization, concentrat ion and visualization, all spiritual powers: 9. \"Did you actually vision to yourself the whole thing? I mean, did you, or could you, really cl ose your eyes and see the tracks? And the trains running? And hear the whistles blowing? Did you go as far as that?\" \"Yes.\" \"How clearly?\" \"Very clearly.\" 10. Here we have a visi on of the law, we see \"cause and effect\", we see that thought necessarily prec edes and determines action. If we are wise, we shall come into a realization of the tremendous fact that no arbitrary condition can ex ist for a moment, and that human experience is the result of an orderly and ha rmonious sequence. 11. The successful businessman is more often than not an idealist and is every striving for higher and higher standards. The subtle forces of thought as they crysta llize in our dail y moods is what constitutes life. 12. Thought is the plastic material with which we build images of our growing conception of life. Use determines its existence. As in all other things our ability to rec ognize it and use it properly is the necessary condition for attainment. 13. Premature wealth is but th e forerunner of humiliation and disaster, because we cannot perman ently retain anything which we do not merit or which we have not earned. 14. The conditions with which we meet in the world without, correspond to the conditions which we find in th e world within."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"This is brought about by the law of attraction. How then shall we determine what is to ente r into the world within? 15. Whatever enters the mind thr ough the senses or the objective mind will impress the mind and result in a mental image which will become a pattern for the creat ive energies. These experiences are largely the result of environm ent, chance, past thinking and other forms of negative thought, and must be subjected to careful analysis before being entertained. On the other hand, we can form our own mental images, through our own interior processes of thought regardless of the thoughts of others, regardless of exterior conditions, regardless of environm ent of every kind, and it is by the exercise of this power that we can control our own destiny, body, mind and soul. 16. It is by the exercise of this po wer that we take our fate out of the hands of chance, and consci ously make for ourselves the experiences which we desire, because when we consciously realize a condition, that condition will eventu ally manifest in our lives; it is therefore evident that in the last analysis thinking is the one great cause in life. 17. Therefore, to control though t is to control circumstances, conditions, environment, and destiny. 18. How then are we to control th ought; what is the process? To think is to create a thought, but the result of the thought will depend upon its form, its quality and its vitality. 19. The form will depend upon the mental images from which it emanates; this will depend upon the depth of the impression, the predominance of the idea, the clarity of the vision, the boldness of the image. 20. The quality depends upon its substance, and this depends upon the material of which the mind is composed; if this material has"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"been woven from t houghts of vigor, strength, courage, determination, the thought w ill possess these qualities. 21. And finally, the vitality depends upon the feeling with which the thought is impregnated. If th e thought is constructive, it will possess vitality; it will have life, it will grow, deve lop, expand, it will be creative; it will attract to itself everything necessary for its complete development. 22. If the thought is destructive, it will have within itself the germ of its own dissolution; it will die, but in the process of dying, it will bring sickness, disease, and ev ery other form of discord. 23. This we call evil, and when we bring it upon ourselves, some of us are disposed to attribute our difficulties to a Supreme Being, but this supreme being is si mply Mind in equilibrium. 24. It is neither good no r bad, it simply is. 25. Our ability to differentiate it into form is our ability to manifest good or evil. 26. Good and evil therefore are not entities, they are simply words which we use to indicate the result of our actions, and these actions are in turn predetermined by the character of our thought. 27. If our thought is constructive and harmonious we manifest good; if it is destructive and discordant we manifest evil. 28. If you desire to visualize a di fferent environment, the process is simply to hold the ideal in mind , until your vision has been made real; give no thought to persons, places or things; these have no place in the absolute; the envir onment you desire will contain everything necessary; the right persons, and the right things will come at the right time and in the right place."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"29. It is sometimes not plain how character, ability, attainment, achievement, environm ent and destiny can be controlled through the power of visualization, but this is an exact scientific fact. 30. You will readily see that what we think determines the quality of mind, and that the quality of mi nd in turn determines our ability and mental capacity, and you can readily understand that the improvement in our ability will natu rally be followed by increase in attainment and a greater control of circumstances. 31. It will thus be seen that Natura l laws work in a perfectly natural and harmonious manner; everything seems to \"just happen.\" If you want any evidence of this fact simply compare results of your efforts in your own life, when yo ur actions were prompted by high ideals and when you had selfish or ulterior motives in mind. You will need no further evidence. 32. If you wish to bring about the realization of any desire, form a mental picture of success in your mind, by consciously visualizing your desire; in this way you w ill be compelling success, you will be externalizing it in your li fe by scientific methods. 33. We can only see wh at already exists in the objective world, but what we visualize, already exists in the spiritual world, and this visualization is a substantial token of what will one day appear in the objective world, if we are fait hful to our ideal. The reason for this is not difficult; visualization is a form of imagination; this process of thinking forms impressions on the mind, and these impressions in turn form concepts and ideals, and they in turn are the plans from which the Master ar chitect will weave the future. 34. The psychologists have come to the conclusion that there is but one sense, the sense of feeling, and that all other senses are but modifications of this one sense; this being true, we know why feeling is the very fountain head of power, why the emotions so easily overcome the intellect, and why we must put feeling into our"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"thought, if we wish resu lts. Thought and feeling is the irresistible combination. 35. Visualization must, of course, be directed by the will; we are to visualize exactly what we want; we must be careful not to let the imagination run riot. Imagination is a good servant but a poor master, and unless it is controlled it may easily lead us into all kinds of speculations and conc lusions which have no basis or foundation of fact whatever. Ever y kind of plausible opinion is liable to be accepted without any analytical examination and the inevitable result is mental chaos. 36. We must therefor e construct only such mental images as are known to be scientifically true. Subject every idea to a searching analysis and accept nothing which is not scientifically exact. When you do this you will attempt nothing but what you know you can carry out and success will crown your efforts; this is what businessmen call far-sightedness; it is much the same as insight, and is one of the great secret s of success in all important undertakings. 37.

Great discoveries are the result of long-continued investigation. The science of mathematics requires years of concentrated effort to master it, and the greatest science -- that of the Mind -- is revealed only through concentrated effort. 6. Concentration is much misunder stood; there seems to be an idea of effort or activity associated wi th it, when just the contrary is necessary. The greatness of an actor lies in the fact that he forgets himself in the portrayal of his character, becoming so identified with it, that the audience is swayed by the realism of the performance. This will give you a go od idea of true concentration; you should be so interested in yo ur thought, so engrossed in your subject, as to be conscious of nothing else. Such concentration leads to intuitive perception and immediate insight into the nature of the object con centrated upon."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"7. All knowledge is the result of co ncentration of this kind; it is thus that the secrets of Heaven and Earth have been wrested; it is thus that the mind becomes a magn et and the desire to know draws the knowledge, irresist ibly attracts it, makes it your own. 8. Desire is largely subconscious; conscious desire rarely realizes its object when the latter is out of immediate reach. Subconscious desire arouses the latent facu lties of the mind , and difficult problems seem to solve themselves. 9. The subconscious mind may be aroused and brought into action in any direction and made to serve us for any purpose, by concentration. The practice of conce ntration requires the control of the physical, mental, and phys ical being; all modes of consciousness whether physical, mental, or physical, must be under control. 10. Spiritual Truth is therefore the controlling factor; it is this which will enable you to grow out of limited attainment and reach a point where you will be able to translate modes of thought into character and consciousness. 11. Concentration does not mean mere thinking of thoughts, but the transmutation of these tho ughts into practical values; the average person has no conception of the mean ing of concentration. There is always the cr y \"to have\" but never th e cry \"to be\"; they fail to understand that they cannot have one without the other, that they must first find the \"kingdom\" before they can have the \"things added.\" Momentary enth usiasm is of no value; it is only with unbounded self-confidence that the goal is reached. 12. The mind may place the ideal a little too high and fall short of the mark; it may attempt to soar on untrained wings and instead of flying, fall to earth; but that is no reason for not making another attempt."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"13. Weakness is the only barrier to mental attainment; attribute your weakness to phys ical limitations or mental uncertainties and try again; ease and perfection are gained by repetition. 14. The astronomer centers his mi nd on the stars and they give forth their secrets; the geolog ists centers his mind on the construction of the earth and we hav e geology; so with all things. Men center their minds on the probl ems of life, and the result is apparent in the vast and complex social order of the day. 15. All mental discovery and atta inment are the result of desire plus concentration; desire is the strongest mode of action; the more persistent the desire, the more au thoritative the revelation. Desire added to concentration will wre nch any secret from nature. 16. In realizing great thoughts, in experiencing grea t emotions that correspond with great thoughts, th e mind is in a state where it appreciates the value of higher things. 17. The intensity of one moment's earnest concentration and the intense longing to beco me and to attain may take you further than years of slow normal and forced effort; it will unfa sten the prison bars of unbelief, weakness, impo tence and self-belittlement, and you will come into a realizatio n of the joy of overcoming. 18. The spirit of initiative and or iginality is developed through persistence and continuity of ment al effort. Business teaches the value of concentration and encou rages decision of character; it develops practical insight and qui ckness of conclusion. The mental element in every commercial pursuit is dominant as the controlling factor, and desire is the pred ominating force; all commercial relations are the extern alization of desire. 19. Many of the sturdy and substa ntial virtues are developed in commercial employmen t; the mind is steadied and directed; it becomes efficient. The principal necessity is the strengthening of"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the mind so that it rises superior to the distractions and wayward impulses of instinctive life and thus successfully overcomes in the conflict between the hi gher and lower self. 20. All of us are dynamos, but the dynamo of itself is nothing; the mind must work the dynamo; then it is useful and its energy can be definitely concentrated. The mi nd is an engine whose power is undreamed; thought is an omni-worki ng power. It is the ruler and creator of all form and all events occurring in form. Physical energy is nothing in comparison with the omnipotence of thought, because thought enables man to harness all ot her natural power. 21. Vibration is the action of thou ght; it is vibration which reaches out and attracts the material ne cessary to construct and build. There is nothing mysterious con cerning the power of thought; concentration simply implies that consciousness can be focalized to the point where it becomes identified with the object of its attention. As food absorbed is th e essence of the body, so the mind absorbs the object of its attent ion, gives it life and being. 22. If you concentrate on some matter of im portance, the intuitive power will be set in operation, and help will come in the nature of information which will lead to success. 23. Intuition arrives at conclusions without the aid of experience or memory. Intuition often solves pr oblems that are beyond the grasp of the reasoning power. Intuition often comes with a suddenness that is startling; it reveals the tr uth for which we ar e searching, so directly that it seems to come fr om a higher power. Intuition can be cultivated and developed; in order to do this it must be recognized and appreciated; if the intuitive vi sitor is given a royal welcome when he comes, he will come agai n; the more cordial the welcome the more frequent his visits will bec ome, but if he is ignored or neglected he will make his vi sits few and far apart."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"24. Intuition usually comes in the Silence; great minds seek solitude frequently; it is here that a ll the larger problems of life are worked out. For this reason every businessman who can afford it has a private office, where he will not be disturbed; if you cannot afford a private office you can at least find somewhere, where you can be alone a few minutes each day, to train the thought along lines which will enable you to develop that invincible power which is necessary to achieve. 25. Remember that fundamentally the subconscious is omnipotent; there is no limit to the things that can be done when it is given the power to act. Your degree of success is determined by the nature of your desire. If the nature of your desire is in harm ony with Natural Law or the Universal Mind, it will gradually emancipate the mind and give you invincible courage. 26. Every obstacle conquered, ever y victory gained, will give you more faith in your powe r, and you will have gr eater ability to win. Your strength is determined by your mental attitude; if this attitude is one of success, and is perm anently held with an unswerving purpose, you will attract to y ou from the invisible domain the things you silently demand. 27. By keeping the thought in mind , it will gradually take tangible form. A definite purpose sets caus es in motion which go out in the invisible world and find the mate rial necessary to serve your purpose. 28. You may be pursuing the symb ols of power, instead of power itself. You may be pursuing fame instead of honor, riches instead of wealth, position instead of se rvitude; in either event you will find that they turn to ashes just as you overtake them. 29.

The race has usually been fo r money and other mere symbols of power, but with an understanding of the true source of power, we can afford to ignore the symb ols. The man with a large bank account finds it unnecessary to load his pockets down with gold; so with the man who has found the tr ue source of power; he is no longer interested in its shams or pretensions. 31. Thought ordinarily leads outwar dly in evolutionary directions, but it can be turned within wher e it will take hold of the basic principles of things, the heart of things, the spirit of things. When you get to the heart of things it is comparatively easy to understand and command them. 32. This is because the Spirit of a thing is the thing itself, the vital part of it, the real substance. The form is simply the outward manifestation of the spir itual activity within. 33. For your exercise this week concentrate as nearly as possible in accordance with the method outlined in this lesson; let there be no conscious effort or activity asso ciated with your purpose. Relax completely, avoid any thought of a nxiety as to results. Remember that power comes through repose. Let the thought dwell upon your object, until it is completely iden tified with it, until you are conscious of nothing else. 34. If you wish to eliminate fear, concentrate on courage. 35. If you wish to eliminate lack, concentrate on abundance. 36. If you wish to eliminate di sease, concentrate on health. 37.

This is brought about through the law of attraction. This principle is the sole means by which the indi vidual is differentiated from the Universal. Think for a moment, what woul d a man be if he were not a husband, father, or brother, if he were not interested in the social, economical, political or religious world. He would be nothing but an abstract theoretical ego. He exists, therefore, only in his relation to the whole, in his relation to other men, in his relation to society. This relation constitutes his environment and in no other way. It is evident, therefore, that the individual is simply the differentiation of the one Unive rsal Mind \"which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,\" and his so-called individuality or personality consists of nothing bu t the manner in which he relates with the whole. This we call his environment and is brought about by the law of attraction. Part Eighteen, which follows, has some thing more to say concerning this important law. PART EIGHTEEN 1. There is a change in the thought of the world. This change is silently transpiring in our midst, and is more important than any which the world has un dergone since the downf all of Paganism. 2. These present revolution in the opinions of all classes of men, the highest and most cultured of men as well as those of the laboring class, stands unparallele d in the history of the world."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"3. Science has of late made such vast disc overies, has revealed such an infinity of resource s, has unveiled such enormous possibilities and such un suspected forces, that scientific men more and more hesitate to affirm cert ain theories as established and beyond doubt or to deny other theories as absurd or impossible. 4. A new civilization is being born ; customs, creeds, and precedent are passing; vision, faith and service are taking their place. The fetters of tradition are being melted off from humanity, and as the impurities of materialism are be ing consumed, thought is being liberated and truth is rising full robed before an astonished multitude. 5. The whole world is on the ev e of a new consciousness, a new power, and a new realizat ion within the self. 6. Physical Science has resolved matter into molecu les, molecules into atoms, atoms into energy, and it has remained for Mr. J. A. Fleming, in an address before the Royal Institution, to resolve this energy into mind. He says, \"In its ultimate essence, energy may be incomprehensible by us except as an exhibition of the direct operation of that which we call Mind or Will.\" 7. And this mind is the indwelling and ultimate. It is imminent in matter as in spirit. It is the su staining, energizing, all pervading Spirit of the universe. 8. Every living thing must be sustained by this omnipotent Intelligence, and we find the differ ence in individual lives to be largely measured by th e degree of this in telligence, which they manifest. It is greater intelligence t hat places the animal in a higher scale of being than the plant, th e man higher than the animal, and we find that this in creased intelligence is again indicated by the power of the individual to contro l modes of action and thus to consciously adjust himself to his environment."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"9. It is this adjustment that occupies the attention of the greatest minds, and this adjustment con sists in nothing else than the recognition of an existing order in the universa l mind, for it is well known that this mind will obey us precisely in proportion as we first obey it. 10. It is the recognition of Natura l Laws that has enabled us to annihilate time and space, to soar in the air and to m ake iron float, and the greater th e degree of intelligence the greater will be our recognition of these Natural Laws and the greate r will be the power we can possess. 11. It is the recognition of the self as an individualization of this Universal Intelligence th at enables the individu al to control those forms of intelligence which have not yet reached this level of self- recognition; they do not know that this Universal Intelligence permeates all things ready to be called into action; they do not know that it is responsive to ev ery demand, and they are therefore in bondage to the law of their own being. 12. Thought is creative and the principle on which the law is based is sound and legitimate and is inhere nt in the nature of things; but this creative power does not origin ate in the individual, but in the universal, which is th e source and foundation of all energy and substance; the individual is simply the channel for the distribution of this energy. 13. The individual is simply th e means by which the universal produces the various combinations which result in the formation of phenomena, which depe nds upon the law of vibration, whereby various rates of rapidity of moti on in the primary substance form new substances only in certai n exact numerical ratios. 14. Thought is the invisible link by which the individual comes into communication with the Universa l, the finite with the Infinite, the seen with the Unseen. Thought is the magic by which the"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"human is transformed into a bein g who thinks and knows and feels and acts. 15. As the proper apparatus has en abled the eye to discover worlds without number millions of miles away, so, with the proper understanding, man has been enabl ed to communicate with the Universal Mind, the source of all power. 16. The Understanding which is usually developed is about as valuable as a VCR without a vide otape; in fact , it is usually nothing more than a \"belief\", which means nothing at all. The savages of the Cannibal Islands beli eve something; but that proves nothing. 17. The only belief which is of any value to anyone is a belief that has been put to a test and demonstrat ed to be a fact; it is then no longer a belief, but has become a living Faith or Truth. 18. And this Truth has been put to the test by hundreds of thousands of people and has been fo und to be the Truth exactly in proportion to the usefulness of the apparatus which they used. 19. A man would not expect to locat e stars hundreds of millions of miles away without a sufficiently strong telescope, and for this reason Science is continually engaged in building larger and more powerful telescopes and is cont inually rewarded by additional knowledge of the heavenly bodies. 20. So with understanding; men are continually making progress in the methods which they use to co me into communication with the Universal Mind and its infinite possibilities. 21.

The expression of growth is met in a most beautiful manner through the instrumentality of this Universal Principle. 24. In order to grow we must ob tain what is essential for our growth, but as we are at all times a complete tho ught entity, this completeness makes it possible for us to receive only as we give; growth is therefore conditioned on reciprocal action, and we find that on the mental plane like attracts like, that mental vibrations respond only to the extent of their vibratory harmony. 25. It is clear, therefore, that thoughts of abu ndance will respond only to similar thoughts; the wealth of the individual is seen to be what he inherently is. Affluence with in is found to be the secret of attraction for affluence without. The ability to produce is found to be the real source of wealth of th e individual. It is for this reason that he who has his heart in his work is certain to meet with unbounded success. He will give and continually give; and the more he gives, the mo re he will receive. 26. What do the great financiers of Wall Street, the captains of industry, the statesmen, the gr eat corporation attorneys, the inventors, the physicians, the au thors -- what do each of these contribute to the sum of human happiness but the power of their thought? 27.

Attention has been held to be the distinguishing mark of genius. The cultivation of attent ion depends upon practice. 32. The incentive of attention is in terest; the greater the interest, the greater the attention; the greater the attention, the greater the interest, action and reaction; begin by paying attention; before long you will have aroused interest; th is interest will attract more attention, and this attention will produce more inte rest, and so on. This practice will enable you to cu ltivate the power of attention. 33. This week concentrate upon your power to create; seek insight, perception; try to find a logical ba sis for the faith which is in you.

Then let the thought rest on the fact that the spiritual man also lives an d moves and has his being in a similar but subtler energy upon wh ich he must depend for life, and that as in the physical world no life assumes form until after a seed is sown, and no higher fruit than that of the parent stock can be produced; so in the spiritual worl d no effect can be produced until the seed is sown and the fruit w ill depend upon th e nature of the seed, so that the results which you secure depe nd upon your perception of law in the mighty domain of causation, the highest evolution of human consciousness.

But we do know that by conforming to the requirements of the law by which electricity is governed , it will be our obedient servant; that it will light our homes, our cities, run our machinery, and serve us in many useful capacities. And so it is with vital force. A lthough we do not know what it is, and possibly may never know, we do know that it is a primary force which manifests through livin g bodies, and that by complying with the laws and principles by which it is governed, we can open ourselves to a more abundant inflow of this vital energy, and thus express the highest possible degree of mental, moral, and spiritual efficiency. This part tells of a very simple way of developing this vital force. If you put into practice the information outlined in this lesson you will soon develop the sense of power which has ever been the distinguishing mark of genius. PART NINETEEN 1.

In seeking the truth we are seek ing ultimate cause ; we know that every human experience is an effect; then if we may ascertain the cause, and if we shall find that this cause is one which we can consciously control, the effect or the experience will be within our control also. 3. Human experience will then no longer be the football of fate; a man will not be the child of fortune, but destiny. Fate and fortune will be controlled as readily as a captain controls his ship, or an engineer his train. 4. All things are finally resolvab le into the same element and as they are thus translatable, one into the other, they must ever be in relation and may neve r be in opposition to one another. 5. In the physical world there ar e innumerable contrasts, and these may for convenience sa ke, be designated by distinctive names. There are sizes, colors, shades or ends to all things. There is a North Pole, and a South Pole, an in side and an outside, a seen and an unseen, but these expressions me rely serve to place extremes in contrast. 6. They are names given to two di fferent parts of one quantity. The two extremes are relative; they ar e not separate entities, but are two parts or aspects of the whole. 7. In the mental world we fi nd the same law; we speak of knowledge and ignorance, but ig norance is but a lack of knowledge and is therefore found to be simply a word to express the absence of knowledge; it has no principle in itself. 8. In the Moral World we again find the same law; we speak of good and evil, but Good is a reality, something tang ible, while Evil is found to be simply a negativ e condition, the absence of Good. Evil is sometimes thought to be a very real condition, but it has no principle, no vitality, no life; we know this because it can always"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"be destroyed by Good; just as Truth destroys Error and light destroys darkness, so Evil vanishes when Good appears; there is therefore but one principle in the Moral World. 9. We find exactly the same law obtaining in the Spiritual world; we speak of Mind and Matter as two separate entities, but clearer insight makes it evident that ther e is but one operative principle and that is Mind. 10. Mind is the real and the eterna l. Matter is forever changing; we know that in the eons of time a hund red years is but as a day. If we stand in any large city and let the eye rest on the innumerable large and magnificent buildings, the vast array of modern automobiles, cellular telephones, the electric lights, and all the other conveniences of modern civilizat ion, we may remember that not one of them was there just over a century ago, and if we could stand on the same spot in a hu ndred years from now, in all probability we should find that but few of them remained. 11. In the animal kingdom we find the same law of change. The millions and millions of animals come and go, a few years constituting their span of life. In the plant world the change is still more rapid. Many plants and nea rly all grasses come and go in a single year. When we pass to the inorganic, we expect to find something more substantial, but as we gaze on the apparently solid continent, we are told that it arose from the ocean; we see the giant mountain and are told that the pl ace where it now stands was once a lake; and as we stand in awe be fore the great cliffs in the Yosemite Valley we can easily trace the path of the glaciers which carried all before them. 12. We are in the presence of cont inual change, and we know that this change is but the evolution of the Universal Mind, the grand process whereby all things are c ontinually being cr eated anew, and we come to know that matter is but a form which Mind takes and is"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"therefore simply a condition. Matter has no principle; Mind is the only principle. 13. We have then come to know that Mind is the only principle which is operative in the physic al, mental, moral and spiritual world. 14. We also know that this mind is static, mind at rest, we also know that the ability of the indivi dual to think is his ability to act upon the Universal Mind and convert it into dynamic mind, or mind in motion. 15. In order to do this fuel must be applied in the form of food, for man cannot think without eating, and so we find that even a spiritual activity such as thinking cannot be converted into sources of pleasure and profit except by ma king use of material means. 16. It requires energy of some kind to collect electricity and convert it into a dynamic power, it requires th e rays of the sun to give the necessary energy to sustai n plant life, so it also requires energy in the form of food to e nable the individual to think and thereby act upon th e Universal Mind. 17. You may know that thought co nstantly, eternally is taking form, is forever seeki ng expression, or you may not, but the fact remains that if your thought is po werful, constructive, and positive, this will be plainly evident in the state of your health, your business and your environment; if yo ur thought is weak, critical, destructive and negative generally, it will manifest in your body as fear, worry and nervousness, in your finance as lack and limitation, and in discordant conditions in your environment. 18.

What are our schools, ou r universities, but mental powerhouses, places where ment al power is being developed? 21. As there are many mighty powe rhouses for the application of power to ponderous machinery, wh ereby raw material is collected and converted into the necessities and comforts of life, so the mental powerhouses collect the raw material and cultivate and develop it into a power which is infinitely supe rior to all the forces of nature, marvelous though they may be. 22. What is this raw material wh ich is being collected in these thousands of mental powerhouses all over the world and developed into a power which is evidently controlling every other power? In its static form it is Mind - in its dynamic form, it is Thought. 23. This power is superior becaus e it exists on a higher plane, because it has enabled man to di scover the law by which these wonderful forces of Nature could be harnessed and made to do the work of hundreds and thousands of men. It has enabled man to discover laws whereby time and sp ace have been annihilated, and the law of gravitation overcome. 24. Thought is the vital force or energy which is being developed and which has produced such star tling results in the last half century as to bring about a wo rld which would be absolutely inconceivable to a man existing only 50 or 25 years ago.

How, then, does it manifest in form? In electrical science a battery is formed by connecting th e opposite poles of zinc and copper, which causes a current to fl ow from one to the other and so provides energy. This same process is repeated in respect to every polarity, and as all form simply d epends upon the rate of vibration and consequent relations of atoms to each other, if we wish to change the form of manifestation we must change the polarity. This is the principl e of causation. 27.

Theologians have to ld us that God is Love, and that God is Omnipresent. If this be tr ue, there is no place where God is not. Where, then, is Ev il, Satan and Hell? Let us see:God is Spirit.Spirit is the Creative Principle of the Universe. Man is made in the im age and likeness of God. Man is therefore a spiritual being. The on ly activity which spirit possesses is the power to think. Thinking is therefore a cr eative process. All form is therefore the result of the thinking process. The destruction of form must al so be a result of the thinking process. Fictitious representations of form are the result of the creative power of thought, as in Hypnotism. Apparent representation of form are the result of the crea tive power of thought, as in Spiritualism. Invention, organization and constr uctive work of all kinds are the result of the creative power of thought, as in concentration. When the creative power of thought is manifested for the benefit of humanity, we call the result good . When the creative power of thought is manifested in a destru ctive or evil manner, we call the result evil. This indicates the origin of both good and evil; they are simply words which have been coined in order to i ndicate the nature of the result of the thinking or creative process. Thought necessarily precedes and predetermines action; action precedes and predetermines condition. Part Twenty will throw more light upon this important subject.

The spirit of you is -- you; without the spirit you would be nothing. It becomes active through your recognition of it and its possibilities. 2. You may have all the wealth in Christendom , but unless you recognize it and make use of it, it w ill have no value; so with your spiritual wealth: unless you recognize it and use it, it will have no value. The one and on ly condition of spirit ual power is use or recognition. 3. All great things co me through recognition; the scepter of power is consciousness, and thought is its messenger, and this messenger is constantly molding the realities of the invisible world into the conditions and environments of your objective world. 4. Thinking is the true business of life, power is the result. You are at all times dealing with the magical po wer of thought and consciousness. What results can you expect so long as you remain oblivious to the power which has b een placed within your control? 5. So long as you do this you limit yourself to superficial conditions, and make of yourself a beast of burden for those who think; those who recognize thei r power; those who know that unless we are willing to think we shall have to work, and the less we think the more we shall have to work, and the less we shall get for our work. 6. The secret of power is a perfec t understanding of the principles, forces, methods and combinations of Mind, and a perfect understanding of our relationship to the Universal Mind. It is well to remember that this principle is unchangeable; if th is were not so, it would not be reliable; all principles are changeless."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"7. This stability is your opportunity; you are its active attribute, the channel for its activity; the Un iversal can act only through the individual. 8. When you begin to perceive that the essence of the Universal is within yourself -- is you -- you beg in to do things; you begin to feel your power; it is the fuel which fires the imagination; which lights the torch of inspiration; which gives vitality to thought; which enables you to co nnect with all the invi sible forces of the Universe. It is this power which wi ll enable you to plan fearlessly, to execute masterfully. 9. But perception will co me only in the Silence ; this seems to be the condition required for all grea t purposes. You are a visualizing entity. Imagination is your workshop. It is here that your ideal is to be visualized. 10. As a perfect understanding of the nature of this power is a primary condition for its manifestat ion, visualize the entire method over and over again, so that y ou may use it whenever occasion requires. The infinity of wisdom is to follow the method whereby we may have the inspiration of the omnipotent Universal Mind on demand at any time. 11. We can fail to recognize this world within, and so exclude it from our consciousness, but it will still be the basic fact of all existence; and when we learn to re cognize it, not only in ourselves, but in all persons, events, things and circumstances we shall have found the \"Kingdom of h eaven\" which we are to ld is \"within\" us. 12. Our failures are a result of th e operation of exactly the same principle; the principle is unchangeable; its operation is exact, there is no deviation; if we think lack, limitation, discord, we shall find their fruits on every hand; if we think poverty, unhappiness or disease, the thought messengers will carry the summons as readily as any other kind of thought and th e result will be just as certain. If"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"we fear a coming calamity, we shal l be able to say with Job, \"the thing I feared has come upon me\"; if we think unkindly or ignorantly we shall thus attract to ourselves the results of our ignorance. 13. This power of thought, if unde rstood and correctly used, is the greatest labor-saving device ever dreamed of, but if not understood or improperly used, the result will in all probability be disastrous, as we have already seen; by the help of this power you can confidently undertake things that are seemingly impossible, because this power is the secret of all inspiratio n, all genius. 14. To become inspired means to get out of th e beaten path, out of the rut, because extraordinary results require extraordinary means. When we come into a recognition of the Unity of all things and that the source of all power is within, we tap the source of inspiration. 15. Inspiration is the art of imbibi ng, the art of self-realization; the art of adjusting the individual mind to that of the Universal Mind; the art of attaching the proper mechanism to the source of all power; the art of differentiating the formless into form; the art of becoming a channel for the flow of Infinite Wisdom; the art of visualizing perfection; the art of realizing the omnipresence of Omnipotence. 16. An understanding and appreciation of the fact that the infinite power is omnipresent and is therefore in the infinitely small as well as the infinitely large will enable us to absorb its essence; a further understanding of the fact that this power is spirit and therefore indivisible will enable us to appreciate its pres ent at all points at the same time. 17.

Do not confuse these methods with those of the clairvoyant; they have nothing in co mmon. Inspiration is the art of receiving and makes for all that is best in life; your business in life is to understand and command these invisi ble forces instead of letting them command and rule you. Powe r implies service; inspiration implies power; to understand and apply the method of inspiration is to become a superman. 20. We can live more abundantly every time we breathe, if we consciously breathe with that intent ion. The IF is a very important condition in this case, as the inte ntion governs the attention, and without the attention you can secure only the results which every one else secures. That is, a supply equal to the demand. 21. In order to secure the larg er supply your demand must be increased, and as you consciousl y increase the demand the supply will follow, you will find yourself coming into a larger and larger supply of life, energy and vitality. 22. The reason for this is not di fficult to understand, but it is another of the vital mysteries of life which does not seem to be generally appreciated. If you make it your own, you will find it one of the great realities of life. 23.

Every time we breathe we fill our lungs with air and at the same time vitalize our body with th is Pranic Ether which is Life itself, so that we have the o pportunity of making a conscious connection with All Life, All Intelligence and All Substance. 25. A knowledge of your relation and oneness with this Principle that governs the Universe and th e simple method whereby you can consciously identify yourself wi th it gives you a scientific understanding of a law whereby you may free yourself from disease, from lack or limitation of any kind; in fact, it enables you to breathe the \"breath of life\" into your own nostrils. 26. This \"breath of life\" is a su perconscious reality. It is the essence of the \"I am.\" It is pu re \"Being\" or Universal Substance, and our conscious unity with it en ables us to localize it, and thus exercise the powers of this creative energy. 27. Thought is creative vibration and the quality of the conditions created will depend upon the qualit y of our thought, because we cannot express powers which we do not possess. We must \"be\" before we can \"do\" and we can \"do\" only to the extent to which we \"are,\" and so what we do will necessarily co incide with what we \"are\" and what we are depends upon what we \"think.\" 28. Every time you think you start a train of causation which will create a condition in strict acco rdance with the quality of the thought which originated it. Thought which is in harmony with the Universal Mind will result in corr esponding conditions. Thought which is destructive or discor dant will produce corresponding results.

You are free to use this marvelous creative power as you will, but you must take the consequences. 29. This is the danger from what is called Will Power. There are those who seem to think that by fo rce of will they can coerce this law; that they can sow seed of one kind and by \"Will Power\" make it bear fruit of another, but the fundamental principle of creative power is in the Universal, and therefore the idea of forcing a compliance with our wishes by th e power of the individual will is an inverted conception which may appear to succeed for a while but is eventually doomed to fail ure - because it antagonizes the very power which it is seeking to use. 30. It is the individual attempting to coerce the Universal, the finite in conflict with the Infinite. Ou r permanent well-being will be best conserved by a conscious cooperatio n with the continuous forward movement of the Great Whole. 31.

Th at He is Spirit and you are made in \"His image and likeness\" and th at the only difference between His spirit and your spirit is one of degree, that a part must be the same in kind and qua lity as the whole. When you can realize this clearly you will have found the s ecret of the creative power of thought, you will have found the or igin of both go od and evil, you will have found the secret of the wonderful power of concentration, you will have found the key to the solution of every problem whether physical, financial, or environmental.

This is the secret of the wonderful power of prayer. We know that the universe is govern ed by law; that for every effect there must be a cause, and that the same cause, under the same conditions, will invariably pr oduce the same effect. Consequently, if prayer has ever be en answered, it will always be answered, if the proper condition s are complied with. This must necessarily be true; otherwise the universe would be a chaos instead of a cosmos. The answer to prayer is therefore subject to law, and this law is definite, exact and scientific, just as are the laws governing gravita tion and electricity. An understanding of this law takes the foundation of Ch ristianity out of the realm of superstition and credulity and plac es it upon the firm rock of scientific understanding. But, unfortunately, there are comp aratively few persons who know how to pray.

The real secret of power is consciousness of power. The Universal Mind is unconditional; t herefore, the more conscious we become of our unity with this mind, the less conscious we shall become of conditions and limitations, and as we become emancipated or freed from conditions we come into a realization of the unconditional. We have become free! 2. As soon as we become conscious of the inexhaustible power in the world within, we begin to dr aw on this power and apply and develop the greater possibilities which this discernment has realized, because whatever we beco me conscious of, is invariably manifested in the objective world, is brought forth into tangible expression. 3. This is because the Infinite Mind, which is the source from which all things proceed, is one and indivisible, and each individual is a channel whereby this Eternal Energy is being manifested. Our ability to think is our ability to act upon this Universal Substance, and what we think is what is created or produced in the objective world. 4. The result of this discovery is nothing less than marvelous, and means that mind is extraordinary in quality, limitless in quantity, and contains possibilities without nu mber. To become conscious of this power is to become a \"live wi re\"; it has the same effect as placing an ordinary wire in contact with a wire that is charged. The Universal is the live wire. It carri es power sufficien t to meet every situation which may aris e in the life of every individual. When the individual mind touches the Univ ersal Mind it receives all the power it requires. This is the worl d within. All sci ence recognizes the reality of this world, and all power is contingent upon our recognition of this world."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"5. The ability to eliminate im perfect conditions depends upon mental action, and mental action depends upon co nsciousness of power; therefore, the more consci ous we become of our unity with the source of all power, the great er will be our power to control and master every condition. 6. Large ideas have a ten dency to eliminate all smaller ideas so that it is well to hold idea s large enough to counteract and destroy all small or undesirable tendencies. This will remove innumerable petty and annoying obstacles fr om your path. You also become conscious of a larger world of t hought, thereby increasing your mental capacity as well as placing yourself in position to accomplish something of value. 7. This is one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing victory, one of the accomplishments of the Master- Mind. He thinks big thoughts. The creative energies of mind find no more difficulty in handling larg e situations, than small ones. Mind is just as much present in the Infinitely large as in the Infinitely small. 8. When we realize these facts concerning mind we understand how we may bring ourselves a ny condition by creating the corresponding conditions in our c onsciousness, because everything which is held for any length of time in the consciousness, eventually becomes impressed u pon the subconscious and thus becomes a pattern which the creative energy will wave into the life and environment of the individual. 9. In this way conditions are produc ed and we find that our lives are simply the reflection of our predominant thoughts, our mental attitude; we see then that the scie nce of correct thinking is the one science, that it includes all other sciences. 10. From this science we lear n that every thought creates an impression on the brain, that these impressions create mental"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"tendencies, and these tendencies create ch aracter, ability and purpose, and that the combined action of char acter, ability and purpose determines the experiences with which we shall meet in life. 11. These experiences come to us through the Law of Attraction; through the action of this law we meet in the world without the experiences which correspon d to our world within. 12. The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that \"like attracts like\", consequently the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature. 13. This mental attitude is our pe rsonality and is composed of the thoughts which we have been creati ng in our own mind; therefore, if we wish a change in conditions al l that is necessary is to change our thought; this will in turn change our mental attitude, which will in turn change our personality, which will in tu rn change the persons, things and conditions, or , the experiences with which we meet in life. 14. It is, however, no easy matter to change the mental attitude, but by persistent effort it may be accom plished; the mental attitude is patterned after the mental pictur es which have been photographed on the brain; if you do not like th e pictures, destroy the negatives and create new pictures; this is the art of visualization. 15. As soon as you have done th is you will begin to attract new things, and the new things will corr espond to the new pictures. To do this: impress on the mind a perf ect picture of the desire which you wish to have objectified and continue to hold the picture in mind until results are obtained. 16.

Do not hesitate to aspire to the highest possibl e attainments in anything you may undertake, for the mind forces are ever ready to lend themselves to a purposeful wi ll in the effort to crystallize its highest aspirations into acts, accomplishments, and events. 18. An illustration of how these mi nd forces operate is suggested by the method in which all our ha bits are formed. We do a thing, then do it again, and again, and again, until it becomes easy and perhaps almost automatic; and t he same rule applies in breaking any and all bad habits; we stop doing a thin g, and then avoid it again, and again until we are entir ely free from it; and if we do fail now and then, we should by no m eans lose hope, for the law is absolute and invincible and gives us credit for every effort and every success, even though our ef forts and successes are perhaps intermittent. 19. There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in your own idea; remember that Nature is plastic to the ideal; think of the id eal as an already accomplished fact. 20. The real battle of life is one of ideas; it is being fought out by the few against the many; on the on e side is the constructive and creative thought, on the other si de the destructive and negative thought; the creative thought is do minated by an ideal, the passive thought is dominated by appearance s. On both sides are men of science, men of letters , and men of affairs. 21.

In the last analysis there are but these two classes; all men will have to take their pl ace on one side or the other; they will have to go forward, or go back; there is no standing still in a world where all is motion; it is this attempt to stand still that gives sanction and force to arbitrary and unequal codes of law. 23. That we are in a period of transition is evidenced by the unrest which is everywhere apparent. The complaint of humanity is as a roll of heaven's artillery, commencing with low and threatening notes and increasing until the soun d is sent from cloud to cloud, and the lightning splits the air and earth. 24.

The issue between the old regi me and the new, the crux of the social problem, is entirely a question of conviction in the minds of the people as to the na ture of the Universe. When they realize that the transcendent force of spirit or mind of th e Cosmos is within each individual, it will be possible to frame laws that shall consider the liberties and rights of the many instead of the privileges of the few. 26.

It is through the law of vibration that the mind exercises this control over the body. We know that every mental action is a vibration, and we know that all form is simply a mode of motion, a rate of vibration. Therefore, any given vibration immediately modifies every atom in the body, every life cell is affected and an entire chemical change is made in every group of life cells. 6. Everything in the Universe is what it is by virtue of its rate of vibration. Change the rate of vi bration and you cha nge the nature, quality and form. The vast panora ma of nature, both visible and invisible, is being constantly cha nged by simply c hanging the rate of vibration, and as thought is a vi bration we can also exercise this power. We can change the vibr ation and thus produce any condition which we desire to manifest in our bodies. 7. We are all using this power ever y minute. The trouble is most of us are using it unconsciously and thus producing undesirable results. The problem is to use it intelligently and produce only desirable results. This should not be difficult, becau se we all have had sufficient experience to know wh at produces pleasant vibration in the body, and we also kno w the causes which produce the unpleasant and disagreeable sensations. 8. All that is necessary is to consult our own e xperience. When our thought has been uplifted, progre ssive, constructive, courageous, noble, kind or in any other way desirable, we have set in motion vibrations which brought about ce rtain results. When our thought has been filled with envy, hatred, jealousy, criticism or any of the other thousand and one forms of di scord, certain vibrations were set in motion which brought about certain other results of a different nature, and each of these rates of vibration, if kept up, crystallized in form.

Someone says something to you which strikes you as ludicrous and you laugh, possibly un til your whole body shakes, which shows that thought has control over the muscles of your body; or someone says something which excites your sympathy and your eyes fill with tears, which show s that thought controls the glands of your body ; or someone says something which makes you angry and the blood mounts to your cheek, which shows that thought controls the circulation of your blood. But as these experiences are all th e results of the action of your objective mind over the body, the re sults are of a temporary nature; they soon pass away and leave th e situation as it was before. 11. Let us see how the action of the subconscious mind over the body differs. You receive a wound ; thousands of cells being the work of healing at once; in a fe w days or a few weeks the work is complete. You may even break a bone. No surgeon on earth can weld the parts together (I am not re ferring to the insertion of rods or other devices to strengthen or replace bones). He may set the bone for you, and the subjective mind will immediately begin the process of welding the parts toge ther, and in a short time the bone is as solid as it ever was. You may swallow poison; the subjective mind will immediately discover the danger and make violent efforts to eliminate it. You may b ecome infected with a dangerous germ; the subjective will at once commence to build a wall around the infected area and destroy the infection by absorbing it in the white blood corpuscles which it supplies for the purpose. 12. These processes of the subcon scious mind usually proceed without our personal knowledge or direction, and so long as we do not interfere the result is perfect, but, as these millions of repair cells are all intelligent and respo nd to our thought, they are often"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"paralyzed and rendered impotent by our thoughts of fear, doubt, and anxiety. They are like an army of workmen, ready to start an important piece of work, but ever y time they get started on the undertaking a strike is called, or plans changed, until they finally get discouraged and give up. 13. The way to health is founded on the law of vibration, which is the basis of all science, and this law is brought into operation by the mind, the \"world within.\" It is a matter of individual effort and practice. Our world of power is with in; if we are wise we shall not waste time and effort in trying to d eal with effects as we find them in the \"world without,\" which is only an external, a reflection. 14. We shall always find the cause in the \"world within\"; by changing the cause, we change the effect. 15. Every cell in your body is inte lligent and will respond to your direction. The cells are all creators and will create the exact pattern which you give them. 16. Therefore, when perfect images are placed before the subjective, the creative energies will build a perfect body. 17. Brain cells are constructed in the same way. Th e quality of the brain is governed by the state of mind, or mental attitude, so that if undesirable mental attitudes are conveyed to the subjective they will in turn be transferred to the body; we can therefore readily see that if we wish the body to mani fest health, strength and vitality this must be the pr edominant thought. 18. We know then that every el ement of the human body is the result of a rate of vibration. 19. We know that mental action is a rate of vibration. 20. We know that a higher rate of vibration governs, modifies, controls, changes, or destroys a lower rate of vibration."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"21. We know that the rate of vi bration is governed by the character of brain cells, and finally, 22. We know how to create th ese brain cells; therefore, 23. We know how to make any ph ysical change in the body we desire, and having secured a work ing knowledge of the power of mind to this extent, we have come to know that there is practically no limitation which can be plac ed upon our ability to place ourselves in harmony with natural law, wh ich is omnipotent. 24. This influence or control over th e body by mind is coming to be more and more generally unde rstood, and many physicians are now giving the matter their earn est attention. Dr. Albert T. Shofield, who has written several im portant books on the subject, say, \"The subject of me ntal therapeutics is still ignored in medical works generally. In our physiologies no references is made to the central controlling power that rules the body for its good, and the power of the mind over the b ody is seldom spoken of\". 25. No doubt many physicians treat nervous diseases of functional origin wisely and well, but what we contend is that the knowledge they display was taught at no school, was learned from no book, but it is intuitive and empirical. 26. This is not as it should be. The power of mental therapeutics should be the subject of careful, special and scientific teaching in every medical school. We might pursue the subject of maltreatment, or want of treatment , further in detail and describe the disastrous results of neglected cases; but the task is an invidious one. 27. There can be no doubt that few patients are aware how much they can do for themselves. What the patient can do for himself, the forces he can set in motion are as yet unknown.

Mental therapeutics may be directed by the patient himself to calming the mind in excitement, by arousing feelings of joy, hope, faith, and love; by suggesting motives for exertion, by regular mental work, by diverting the thoughts from the malady. 28. For your exercise this week concentrate on Tennyson's beautiful lines \"Speak to Him, thou, for He hears, and spirit with spirit can meet, Closer is He than breathing, and ne arer than hands and feet.\" Then try to realize that when you do \"Speak to Him\" you are in touch with Omnipotence. 29. This realization and recognitio n of this Omnipresent power will quickly destroy any and every form of sickness or suffering and substitute harmony and perfection. Then remember there are those who seem to think that sickness and suffering are sent by God; if so, every physician, every surgeon and every Red Cross nurse is defying the will of God and hospit als and sanitariums are places of rebellion instead of houses of mercy. Of course, this quickly reasons itself into an absurdity, but ther e are many; who still cherish the idea. 30. Then let the thought rest on the fact that until recently theology has been trying to teach an impo ssible Creator, one who created beings capable of sinning and then allowed them to be eternally punished for such sins. Of course the necessary outcome of such extraordinary ignorance was to create fear in stead of love, and so, after two thousand years of this kind of propaganda, Theology is now busily engaged in apologi zing for Christendom. 31.

We have found that thought is th e creative activity behind every constructive enterprise. We can therefore give nothing of more practical value than our thought. Creative thought requires attention, and the power of attention is, as we have found, the weapon of the Super-man. Attention develops concentration, and conc entration develops Spiritual Power, and Spiritual Power is the mightiest force in existence. This is the science which embraces all sciences. It is the art which, above all arts, is rele vant to human life . In the mastery of this science and this art there is oppo rtunity for unending progression. Perfection in this is not acquired in six days, nor in six weeks, nor in six months. It is the labor of life. Not to go forward is to go backward. It is inevitable that the entertain ment of positive, constructive and unselfish thoughts should have a far-reaching effect for good. Compensation is the keynote of the universe. Nature is constantly seeking to strike an equilibrium. Where something is sent out something must be received; el se there should be a vacuum formed. By observance of this rule you c annot fail to profit in such measure as to amply justify your effort along this line. PART TWENTY-THREE"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"1. The money consciousness is an attitude of mind; it is the open door to the arteries of commerce. It is the receptive attitude. Desire is the attractive force which sets the current in motion and fear is the great obstacle by which the current is stopped or completely reversed, turned away from us. 2. Fear is just the opposite fro m money consciousness; it is poverty consciousness, and as the law is unchangeable we get exactly what we give; if we fear we get what we feared. Money weaves itself into the entire fabric of our very existence; it engages the best thought of the best minds. 3. We make money by making friends, and we enlarge our circle of friends by making money for them , by helping them, by being of service to them. The first law of succ ess then is service, and this in turn is built on integrity and justic e. The man who at least is not fair in his intention is simply ignorant; he has missed the fundamental law of all exchange; he is impossible; he will lose surely and certainly; he may not know it; he may think he is winning, but he is doomed to cer tain defeat. He cannot cheat the Infinite. The law of compensation will demand of him an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. 4. The forces of life are volatile; they are composed of our thoughts and ideals an d these in turn are molded into form; our problem is to keep an open mind , to constantly reach out for the new, to recognize opportunity, to be interested in the race rather than the goal, for the pleasure is in the pursuit rather than the possession. 5. You can make a money magnet of yourself, but to do so you must first consider how you can make money for other people.

What benefits one must benefit all. 6. A generous thought is filled w ith strength and vitality, a selfish thought contains the ge rms of dissolution; it will disintegrate and pass away. Great financiers are simp ly channels for the distribution of wealth; enormous amounts co me and go, but it would be as dangerous to stop the outgo as the income; both ends must remain open; and so our greatest success will come as we recognize that it is just as essential to give as to get. 7. If we recognize the Omnipotent pow er that is the source of all supply we will adjust our consciousness to this supply in such a way that it will constantly attract al l that is necessary to itself and we shall find that the mo re we give the more we get. Giving in this sense implies service. The banke r gives his money, the merchant gives his goods, the author gives his thought, the workman gives his skill; all have something to gi ve, but the more they can give, the more they get, and the more they get the more they are enabled to give. 8. The financier gets much because he gives m uch; he thinks; he is seldom a man that lets anyone else do his thinking for him; he wants to know how results are to be secured; you must show him; when you can do this he will furnish the mean s by which hundreds or thousands may profit, and in pr oportion as they are successful will he be successful. Morgan, Ro ckefeller, Carnegie and others did not get rich because they lost money for other people; on the contrary, it is because they made money for other people that they became the wealthiest men in the we althiest country on the globe. 9. The average person is entirely innocent of any deep thinking; he accepts the ideas of others, and repeats them, in very much the same way as a parrot; this is read ily seen when we understand the method which is used to form public opinio n, and this docile attitude on the part of a large ma jority who seem perfectly willing"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"to let a few persons do all their thin king for them is what enables a few men in a great many countrie s to usurp all the avenues of power and hold the millions in subjection. Creative thinking requires attention. 10. The power of attention is call ed concentration; this power is directed by the will; for this reason we must refuse to concentrate or think of anything except th e things we desire. Many are constantly concentrating upon sorr ow, loss and di scord of every kind; as thought is creative it necessarily follows that this concentration inevitable leads to more loss, more sorrow and more discord. How could it be otherwise? On the other hand, when we meet with success, gain, or an y other desirable condition, we naturally concentrate u pon the effects of these things and thereby create more, and so it follows that much leads to more. 11. How an understanding of this principle can be utilized in the business world is well told by an associate of mine: 12. \"Spirit, whatever else it may or may not be, must be considered as the Essence of Consciousness, the Substance of Mind, the reality underlying Thought. And as all ideas are phases of the activity of Consciousness, Mind or Thought, it follows that in Spirit, and in it alone, is to be found the Ultimat e Fact, the Real Thing, or Idea.\" 13. This being admitted, does it not seem reasonable to hold that a true understanding of Spirit, and its laws of manifestation, would be about the most \"practical\" th ing that a \"practical\" person can hope to find? Does it not seem cert ain that if the \"practical\" men of the world could but re alize this fact, they would \"fall all over themselves\" in getting to the place in which they mi ght obtain such knowledge of spiritual things and laws? These men are not fools; they need only to grasp this fundamental fact in order to move in the direction of that which is th e essence of all achievement."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"14. Let me give you a concrete example. I know a man in Chicago whom I had always considered to be quite materi alistic. He had made several successes in life; a nd also several fa ilures. The last time I had a talk with him he was practically \"down and out,\" as compared with his former business condition. It looked as if he had indeed reached \"the end of his rope,\" for he was well advanced into the stage of middle-age, and new ideas came more slowly, and less frequently to him than in former years. 15. He said to me, in substance: \"I know that all things that \"work out\" in business are the result of Thought; any fool knows that. Just now, I seem to be short on thou ghts and good ideas. But, if this \"All-Mind\" teaching is correct, it should be possible for the individual to attain a ‘direct connec tion’ with Infinite Mind; and in Infinite Mind there must be the possibility of all kinds of good ideas which a man of my cour age and experience could put to practical use in the business world, and make a big success thereof. It looks good to me; and I am going to look into it.\" 16. This was several years ago. T he other day I heard of this man again. Talking to a friend, I said: \"What has come of our old friend X? Has he ever gotten on his feet again?\" The friend looked at me in amazement. \"Why,\" said he, \"don't you know about X's great success? He is the Big Man in the '_________ Company' (naming a concern which has mad a phen omenal success during the last eighteen months and is now we ll known, by reason of its advertisements, from one end of the country to another, and also abroad). He is the man who su pplied the BIG IDEA for that concern. Why, he is about a hal f-million to the good and is moving rapidly toward the million mark ; all in the space of eighteen months.\" I had not connected this man with the enterprise mentioned; although I knew of the wonderful success of the company in question. Investigation has shown that the story is true, and that the above stated facts are not exaggerated in the slightest."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"17. Now, what do you think of that ? To me, it mean s that this man actually made the \"direc t connection\" with Infinite Mind -- Spirit -- and, having found it, he set it to work for him. He \"used it in his business.\" 18. Does this sound sacrilegious or blasphemous? I hope not; I do not mean it to be so. Take away the implication of Personality, or Magnified Human Nature, from the conception of the \"The Infinite,\" and you have left the conception of an Infinite Presence- Power, the Quintessence of which is Consciousness -- in fact, at the last, Spirit. As this man, also, at the last, must be considered as a manifestation of Spirit; there is nothing sacrilegious in the idea that he, being Spirit, should so harmonize himself with his Origin and Source that he would be able to manifest at least a minor degree of its Power. All of us do this, more or less, when we use our minds in the direction of Creative Thought. This man did more, he went about it in an intensely \"practical\" manner. 19. I have not consulted him about his method of procedure, though I intend doing so at the fi rst opportunity, bu t, he not only drew upon the Infinite Supply for the ideas which he needed (and which formed the seed of his succ ess), but that he also used the Creative Power of Thought in building up for himself an Idealistic Pattern of that which he hoped to manifest in material form, adding thereto, changing, improving its detail, from time to time -- proceeding from the general outline to the finished detail. I judge this to be the facts of the case, not alone from my recollection of the conversation a few years ago, but also because I have found the same thing to be true in the cases of other prominent men who have made similar manifestation of Creative Thought. 20. Those who may shrink from this idea of employing the Infinite Power to aid one in his work in the material world, should remember that if the Infinite objected in the least to such a"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"procedure the thing could never hap pen. The Infinite is quite able to take care of itself. 21. \"Spirituality\" is quite \"practic al,\" very \"practical,\" intensely \"practical.\" It teaches that Spir it is the Real Thing, the Whole Thing, and that Matter is but plastic stuff, which Spirit is able to create, mould, manipulate, and fashi on to its will. Spirituality is the most \"practical\" thing in the world -- the only really and absolutely \"practical\" thing that there is! 22. This week concentrate on the fa ct that man is not a body with a spirit, but a spirit with a body, and that it is for this reason that his desires are incapable of any permane nt satisfaction in anything not spiritual. Money is therefore of no value except to bring about the conditions which we desire, and these conditions are necessarily harmonious. Harmonious conditions necessitate sufficient supply, so that if there appears to be any lack, we should realize that the idea or soul of money is service, and as this thought takes form, channels of supply will be opened, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that spiritual methods are entirely practical.

If you are inclined to be religious, the greatest religious teacher the world has ever known made th e way so plain that all may follow. If your mental bias is to ward physical science, the law will operate with mathematical certainty. If you are inclined to be philosophical, Plato or Emerson may be your teacher, but in either case, you may reach degrees of power to which it is impossible to assign any limit. An understanding of this principle, I believe, is the secret for which the ancient Alchemists vainly sought, because it explains how gold in the mind may be transmuted into gold in the heart and in the hand. PART TWENTY-FOUR 1. When the scientists first put t he Sun in the center of the Solar System and sent the earth spinni ng around it, there was immense"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"surprise and consternation. The whole idea was self-evidently false; nothing was more certain than the movement of the Sun across the sky, and anyone could se e it descend behind the western hills and sink into the sea; scholars raged and scientists rejected the idea as absurd, yet the evidence has finally carried conviction in the minds of all. 2. We speak of a bell as a \"sound ing body,\" yet we know that all the bell can do is to produce vibr ations in the air. When these vibrations come at the rate of sixteen per second, they cause a sound to be heard in the mind. It is also possible for the mind to hear vibrations up to the rate of 38,000 vibrations per second. When the number increase s beyond this, all is s ilence again; so that we know that the sound is not in the bell, it is in our own mind. 3. We speak and even think of the Sun as \"giving light.\" Yet we know it is simply giving forth ene rgy which produces vibrations in the ether at the rate of four h undred trillion a second, causing what are termed light waves, so that we know that we call light is simply a form of energy and th at the only light ther e is, is the sensation caused in the mind by the moti on of the waves. When the number increases, the light changes in color, each change in color being caused by shorter and more rapid vibrations; so that although we speak of the rose as being red, th e grass as being green, or the sky as being blue, we know that the colors exist only in our minds, and are the sensations experienced by us as the result of the vibrations of light waves. When the vibr ations are reduced below four hundred trillion a second, they no lo nger affect us as light, but we experience the sensation of heat. It is evident, therefore, that we cannot depend upon the evidence of the senses for our information concerning the realities of things; if we did we should believe that the sun moved, that the world was flat instead of round, that the stars were bits of light instead of vast suns."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"4. The whole range then of the theory and pr actice of any system of metaphysics consists in knowing the Truth concerning yourself and the world in which you live; in knowing that in order to express harmony, you must think harmony; in order to express health you must think health; and in order to express abundance you must think abundan ce; to do this you must reverse the evidence of the senses. 5. When you come to know that every form of disease, sickness, lack and limitation are simply t he result of wrong thinking, you will have come to know \"the Trut h which shall make you free.\" You will see how mountains may be removed. If these mountains consist only of doubt, fear, distrust or other forms of discouragement, they are none the less real, and they need not only to be removed but to be \"cast into the sea.\" 6. Your real work consists in co nvincing yourself of the truth of these statements. When you have succeeded in doing this you will have no difficulty in thinking the tr uth, and as has been shown, the truth contains a vital principl e and will manifest itself. 7. Those who heal diseases by me ntal methods have come to know this truth, they demonstrate it in their lives and the lives of others daily. They know that life, hea lth and abundance are Omnipresent, filling all space, and they know th at those who allow disease or lack of any kind to manifest, have as yet not come into an understanding of this great law. 8. As all conditions are thought creations and therefore entirely mental, disease and lack are simply mental conditions in which the person fails to perceive the truth; as soon as the error is removed, the condition is removed. 9. The method for removing this e rror is to go into the Silence and know the Truth; as all mind is one mind, you can do this for yourself or anyone else. If you have learned to form mental images"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"of the conditions desired, this will be the easiest and quickest way to secure results; if not, results can be accomplished by argument, by the process of convincing yours elf absolutely of the truth of your statement. 10.

This is an exact scientific st atement in accordance with every system of Metaphysics in existen ce, and no perma nent results are ever secured in any other way. 12. Every form of concentratio n, forming Mental Images, Argument, and Autosuggestion are all simply meth ods by which you are enabled to re alize the Truth. 13.

As soon as you have succeeded is doing this the result will have been accomplished, and the person will be free. 14. But remember that thought is creative and consequently every time you allow your thought to rest on any inharmonious condition, you must realize that su ch conditions are apparent only, they have no reality, that spirit is the only reality and it can never be less than perfect. 15.

We can get no understanding of the truth from the world without; the world without is relati ve only; Truth is absolute. We must therefore find it in the \"world within.\" 17. To train the mind to see Truth on ly is to express true conditions only, our ability to do this will be an indication as to the progress we are making. 18. The absolute truth is that th e \"I\" is perfect and complete; the real \"I\" is spiritual and can ther efore never be less than perfect; it can never have any lack, limitation , or disease. The flash of genius does not have origin in the molecular motion of the brain; it is inspired by the ego, the spiritual \"I\" which is one with the Universal Mind, and it is our ability to recognize this Unity which is the cause of all inspiration, all genius. These results are far reaching and have effect upon gen erations yet to come; they are the pillars of fire which mark the path th at millions follow. 19. Truth is not the result of logical training or of experimentation, or even of observation; it is the product of a developed consciousness. Truth within a Caesar, manifests in a Caesar's deportment, in his life and his action; his influence upon social forms and progress. Your life and your actions and your influence in the world will depend upon t he degree of truth which you are enabled to perceive, for truth will not manifest in creeds, but in conduct. 20.
