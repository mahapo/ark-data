Without the use of psychedelic substances, I think solving the UFO dilemma is going to be as thankless a task as attempting to understand the universe without availing yourself of the use of a telescope.

Erickson. As I read, I periodically gaze up at giant pine trees beyond my property and I’m reminded that many of these trees were living hundreds of years ago, before the advent of automobiles, electricity, fast food, or even the printing press. We are a long way from our roots of music, art, spirituality, ecstatic dance, and shamanism. Furthermore, we have abandoned many of the techniques that brought us here. This book brings us a little closer to our roots as it touches on the many topics linked directly to our ancestry. It unlocks doors that will lead to a better understanding of the many legends, myths, and facts regarding humanity, reality, history, mysticism, and the possibilities the future holds. In my opinion, any book that can bring together human consciousness, shamanism, symbolism, mythology, occult anatomy, ancient folklore, UFOs, DNA, technology, DMT, music, and the Holy Grail into one title is a book worth reading. Reading this book is like taking a bite of the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. With many quotations and interviews, Blake Erickson has laid out his research in a format that is easy to read, effortless to understand, and a joy to discover. His research will open your eyes to subjects you may have never considered. This book will challenge your beliefs; its chapters and topics hit upon almost every mystery that has puzzled mankind. While no book can answer every riddle; Erickson has made a sincere effort to drive a stake into the heart of the mysteries. Many of these mysteries are right under our nose, yet we never know they are there. Like casting dye into clear water to reveal its currents, this book shakes the Tree of Knowledge and reveals its fruits. - Andrew Rutajit"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 14 "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 15 Preface T he Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge is a phrase which is referenced in the story of The Garden of Eden found in the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament. The book of Genesis in modern Christian Bibles, and the Hebrew/Judaic origins of these scriptures reflect the relationship that Christianity shares with its Hebrew ancestral roots and the practice of shamanism. In the tale of The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge we find heavy implications of shamanic knowledge and the sacred entheogenic plants used for the purposes of accessing the spirit realms. These entheogens have been used throughout all of human history in practically every culture, and they are a direct reflection of the origins of modern humanity. Be prepared to climb the alchemical and shamanic Tree of Knowledge, and digest the wisdom of the Forbidden Fruit. In this book, the phrase- ‘Forbidden Fruit’ refers to the entheogenic plants and fungi found growing in nature that contain psychoactive ingredients capable of producing the psychedelic experience within the human entity. The phrase- ‘Tree of Knowledge’ refers to a ‘body of information’, which in this case happens to be information about shamanic wisdom. In the subtitle, the phrase ‘Opening The Third Eye’ refers to the activation/stimulation of the pineal gland and the secretion of natural psychoactive neurochemicals. Together these titles sum up the concepts included within the pages of this book. Disclaimer: The author of this book does NOT promote the use of any illegal substance.

Prepare yourself for a journey that will weave seemingly irrelevant subjects into a sacred geometrical outline for understanding these mysterious concepts. If you find supernatural or paranormal events fascinating, this book will read as an enigmatic philosophical endeavor with much splendor! Alternative psychology, consciousness, and mythology discussed in laymen’s terms will open your mind for intellectual engagement. By discussing the history of religion and symbolism, and the folklore of our ancestors, this book will take you into the occult and esoteric realm of consciousness inhabited by the first humans. Discover the roots of art, music, dance, and spirituality and the relationships these share with our ancestor’s collective knowledge of the plants found in nature. Tap into the mystery of the crop circle/UFO/alien abductio n phenomena by reviewing biblical passages and other historical accounts, including recent scientific discoveries related to the human brain and natural psychoactive neuro-chemicals. By discussing such topics as altered states of consciousness and the connection this has with our ancestral roots, our dreams, birth, death, and even near- death experiences, I hope to provide a map for the neo- shamanic realities discovered through such methods as: music, dance, meditation, entheogenic initiation, sleep, and the contact phenomena. Finally after reading through the chapters and weaving the sacred form of knowledge within your mind, you will discover the reasoning behind the writing of this book and what led me to put together such a piece of information. I hope this book will politely, and sometimes perhaps unsympathetically, open your mind to different"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 18 possibilities, different ways of looking at the universe.

A simple few pounds of meat capable of creating any kind of manifestation, capable of mathematics, sciences, arts, magic, problem solving, love and awareness. And we call this the human brain. Located within the skull resides the brain. This complex mass of neural cells, synapses, neurotransmitters, glands, lobes and cerebral hemispheres happens to be the driving force behind every single conscious and unconscious thought form. Some people say that our brain is god, and according to Dr. Timothy Leary (1920-1996)- former Harvard Professor and author of, Your Brain is God- 1988, this appears to be the case. From the moment you are brought into the cosmos through physical mani festation, your birth, the brain turns itself on or powers up! The moment that our physical form ceases to exert energy is the moment that our brain logs off or shuts down. Now we begin to understand the brain as an incredible technology. Like that of a modern digital computer which controls the function of operations, receiving and transmitting signals in the form of 0’s and 1’s (binary code for computers), our brains too transmit and receive signals in the form of yes’s and no’s. The yes’s are the signals that go through and create a thought form, the no’s are the signals that don’t make it into thought form. Before I go on, I feel that it is necessary for us to broadly cover the biology of the human brain, to provide us with a basic understanding of what our brain is composed of. Try to hold an image of the human brain in your"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 22 mind; its wrinkly texture split into two hemispheres compacted perfectly to rest inside your head. Now try imagining the separate compartments of glands and lobes that are connected to each other similar to rooms connected to each other within a house, these compartments are capable of allowing communication with each other through individual nerve cells called neurons. Neurons are like humans traveling from room to room creating reality and life within a house. Without the neurons, the house would sit dead quiet collecting dust- brain dead. Now, just like the human being inside of a house, the neuron itself is made up of several contributing factors that allow its existence. Similar to our body, the neuron too has a cell body which is the central part of a neuron that contains the control hub or nucleus. Basically, if a neuron was like a human being, the brain of the neuron would be the nucleus, found inside the cell body. Simply stated, the nucleus and cell body together are called the neuron, just like we would call a human body with a brain, a human. Now, as humans have arms and legs, or a tree has branches, the cell body of the neuron also has appendages called dendrites. “ Dendrites are small branches that extend out from the cell body and receive messages from other neurons .”- 1 Obviously, if we have these dendrites receiving messages, there must be a sender or transmitter, this is called the axon, equal to the dendrites in the sense that it is neuron branches, but instead of coming from another neuron, axons transmit to other neurons. So, here we witness perpetual flowing energy of In’s and Out’s, exactly like that of our breathing pattern constantly flowing in and out of the cosmic yin-yang. And, of course, we will try to consciously witness this in ourselves but it always comes back to us in the form of thought, intangible thought. That mysterious action that arises from us, creating and destroying, loving and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 23 fearing, now and then, here and there, constant but utterly intangible. This is the major part of being a human-entity regardless of political, religious or cultural status. Thought form is our Birthright. “ Neurons are grouped in complex networks that make the largest computer seem like a child’s toy. The nervous system is composed of 100 billion neurons about as many as the number of stars in our galaxy .”-2 This brings new meaning to the old saying: “ As above, So below !”-3 To make things more interesting, we introduce the chemical. Of course, all thoughts are actually chemicals! “ Neurons can take on the functions of wires and batteries because, like all living cells, they are wet. Neurons are sacs filled with one type of fluid on the inside and bathed in a different type of fluid on the outside. This is an important FACT! Both types of fluid are thick “soups” of dissolved chemicals, including ions, which are particles that carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. ”-4 Take a magnet for an example, the negative charge of one magnet is attracted to the positive charge of another magnet, opposites attract, yin and yang! So, within the neuron a negative charge attracts a positive charge outside of the neuron, providing us with the power source of thought, I think it is worth repeating here that absolutely every single thought you have, had, or will have is the result of chemicals/drugs within your brain. We will continue a discussion on the brain chemicals later in the chapter, but before we get too deep into that I want to illustrate for you: “ the synapse, a space found between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 24 another .”-5 Imagine a forest full of enormously ancient trees, stretching up, and reaching out. The branches of one tree extend out and almost touch that of another tree. This is what a neuron with its dendrites and axons would look like. However, there remains a gap between the touching branches, this is the synaptic gap. “ The electrical action potential cannot jump across this synaptic gap however. Instead, the neural message is carried across the gap by CHEMICAL substances called neurotransmitters .”-6 “ The neurotransmitter floats across the gap and “fits” into receptor sites on the adjacent dendrite membrane like Keys fitting into Locks .”-7 As we begin to understand the process of ‘thinking’ in this manner, it is important for us to set aside judgment of chemicals and drugs that we may have predetermined prior to the understanding of our very own thought process. While reading this manuscript please try to hold in mind, the importance of these chemicals within our brains. They are inside our brains for a very important reason. More on this to come later in the chapter and throughout the book. Three parts of the Brain: (Hindbrain, Midbrain, Forebrain) The lowest part of our brain, located at the rear base of the skull, is what we call the hindbrain. Consisting of the cerebellum, responsible for memory, learning and muscle movement. The medulla responsible for breathing and reflexes, and the pons responsible for balance and hearing. Moving along we have the midbrain or the area which is primarily a reflex center for orienting"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 25 the eyes and ears, as well as postural reflexes. Then filling the rest of the skull is the forebrain which includes the thalamus who routes sensory messages to appropriate parts of the brain, the hypothalamus who’s involved in our motives and emotions. The amygdala who plays a role in our anger and rage. The hippocampus involved in formation of new memories and then the cerebral cortex who is involved in controlling conscious experience and intelligence.- 8 I’m simply touching briefly on these very important structures. Please understand, this is because I am not a doctor or a psychologist. I am a human being who wants to portray a simpler version of this information. This is so you will be able to familiarize yourself with the parts of the brain, in order for you to better understand the rest of this manuscript. As we continue within the brain we recognize frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. The frontal lobes are located right behind our foreheads and are involved in planning and organizing, voluntary motor movements and speech. The parietal lobes are part of the cerebral cortex and contains the soma-to-sensory area involved in body senses. Then we have the temporal lobes who are also part of the cerebral cortex. They are the areas associated with hearing and understanding language. Moving along we have the occipital lobes found in the rear of the brain, involved in processing sensory information from the eyes. So anything that you have ever seen with your eyes takes place in the back of your skull.-8 An interesting side note, scientists have used"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 26 their current technology to take pictures of the active brain looking at an object, then a picture of the brain imagining the object in the mind, and startling enough the same areas of the brain light up!!! So we must ask the question what sees? Is it our eyes or our brain? And on that note where is reality. Inside or outside our brains? Early we held an image of the brain in our minds eye, with its wrinkly appearance split into two hemispheres. These hemispheres are part of the cerebral cortex that are divided into left and right and connected by the corpus callosum. We may realize the male and female qualities in both these hemispheres. The left hemisphere focusing primarily on the material, separateness, logical, and reasonable thoughts very male like. The right hemisphere however is focused on creativity, spirit, interconnectedness, and the mysterious, much like feminine aspects. Parallel processing takes place between the two hemispheres thus we get the use of both sides of our brains. “The brain’s amazing capacity for parallel processing magnifies its ability to use it 100 billion neurons and their trillions of connections to produce our complex, actions, emotions, and thoughts .”-9 The Endocrine System As we look inside our brains we come across particular glands that secrete hormones or chemical substances. These glands, specifically, the pineal, pituitary, adrenal, and thyroid, are all part of the endocrine system. “ This system consists of a number of glands that secrete neuropeptides into the bloodstream. When these neuropathies reach other endocrine glands they influence their functions,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 27 providing communication and coordination among the endocrine glands .”-10 If we look at hormones, we see that they are practically identical to some chemical neurotransmitters. Perhaps you have heard serotonin or dopamine, these are two neurotransmitters that affect our lives daily. When secreted into the blood stream serotonin is used to regulate sleep, dreaming, appetite, anxiety, depression, and the inhibition of violence. Dopamine is involved in controlling our large muscle movements. Lack of dopamine is an example of Parkinson’s disease, which causes the experience of uncontrollable muscle tremors and movement problems. Neuropeptides happen to have an influence over the action of other neurotransmitters, often considering them modulators of the other chemicals. The pituitary gland is the helper gland, secreting chemicals to support the activity of other glands in the endocrine system. “ Perhaps its most important function is regulating the body’s reactions to stress and resistance to disease. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that have important effects on the body - notably in controlling blood pressure, thirst, and body growth .” -11 Both adrenal glands are located on the kidneys and are involved in physical and emotional arousal. The thyroid gland is directly below our voice box and is the regulator of metabolism. Metabolism is simply the means through which the body uses energy. I’d say that is pretty important if we are energy. The Pineal Gland Finally we come to the mysterious Pineal gland, a.k.a. ‘The Third Eye.’ It is located in the center of the brain directly behind our forehead. A gland so"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 28 mysterious that we still don’t know all of its functions. However, in order to relate to the topic of this manuscript, we shall discuss the pineal’s chemical components. To begin with, we know that melatonin is a chemical secreted from the pineal gland. Melatonin plays the important role of regulating our light and darkness, day and night, sleep patterns. Picture this, with recent technology and electricity, the human being has been exposed to more artificial light and less natural sunlight. This could certainly effect the melatonin levels in our brains. Something else of interest is that melatonin is affected by the seasonal changes. We witness this in ourselves every year. Spring arrives and humans are outside enjoying the beauty of rebirth on our planet earth, fresh flowers, new leaves, green grass, etc... The sun thus penetrates our bodies and creates a natural flow of chemicals in our brains making us feel good. We can come to understand that melatonin is practically a chemical cousin of serotonin. In the spring time, serotonin and melatonin levels are balancing out after dark/inside-most-of-the-time winter. The importance of these chemicals is beyond words. We can only imagine a zombie being the substitute for a human being without these mystery-molecules. Here is a key point to remember, the pineal gland is shrouded with mystery because of one particular chemical molecule called dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, and it’s possible synthesis taking place in the pineal gland. This mystifying compound is a psychoactive chemical that literally transports the consciousness of the human being into an entirely new alien dimension that harbors life forms and intelligence. Anyone who has experienced DMT has encountered this alien dimension. And yet, we as society are practically clueless about it. Why? If this is something inside all our brains shouldn’t we all know and have the right to know just what this chemical is? Well, fortunately we have Dr. Rick Strassman to thank for his research about this molecule. Rick Strassman M.D. is a Clinical Associate Professor of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 29 Psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, and his book titled, DMT: the Spirit Molecule , is a wonderful read for anyone interested in the medical research of the drug and the startling accounts told by the patients who were volunteers. This one chemical, DMT, is literally all over the place. Like a cosmic agent, it keeps coming up again and again. You can find it in plants, tree bark, grass, animals, and, of course, humans. Strassman gave it the term the Spirit Molecule, for what I am considering four main, very interesting reasons. One, it produces mystical and spiritual experiences in an individual. Two, it transcends a part of the human mind that no longer associates itself with the physical body but instead is associated with a spirit realm, ether-like and translucent. Three, forty nine days after conception, the human fetus comes to life with a possible flood of this chemical pouring out of the brain and into the bloodstream. Four, at the moment of near death humans often experience white light, out-of-body, angels and transcendence, which possibly results from a DMT-chemical secretion within the brain. The psychedelic surge into the abyss of the unknown. Perhaps, it is a possibility that our energy force or life force, the essence of what makes you alive, enters and exits our physical body in the form of a chemical secretion. A similar theory is put forth by Dr. Strassman, and, I would have to say it seems like the best theory so far. Nothing that I have researched or learned about has ever been able to explain this process better than this theory, because it is the combination of spiritual and biological knowledge that make us what we are. “DMT is known to be made in red blood cells, brain, lung, and probably adrenal gland. The pineal theory remains only a theory at this point. None of these theories have been substantiated nor refuted —no-one has looked at the questions by designing and running"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 30 research studies to address them.” - Rick Strassman M.D. “ I was drawn to DMT because of its presence in all of our bodies. I believed the source of this DMT was the mysterious pineal gland, a tiny organ situated in the center of our brains. Modern medicine knows little about this little gland’s role, but it has a rich ‘metaphysical’ history. Descartes, for example, believed the pineal was the ‘seat of the soul,’ and both Western and Eastern mystical traditions place our highest spiritual center within its confines. I therefore wondered if excessive pineal DMT production was involved in naturally occurring ‘psychedelic’ states. These might include birth, death and near-death, psychosis, and mystical experiences. Only later, when the study was well underway, did I also begin considering DMT’s role in the ‘alien abduction’ experience.” - 12 I must ask the question again, why wouldn’t it be a chemical that begins and ends life, if everything we ever experience in life, through the thought process, is the result of chemicals??? Now we are starting to look deep within what it means to be human, alive and conscious. In a later chapter, we will get into the role that DMT plays during the ‘alien abduction’ experience. “ Western and Eastern mystical traditions are replete with descriptions of a blinding white light accompanying deep spiritual realization. The “enlightenment” usually is the result of a progression of consciousness through various levels of spiritual, psychological, and ethical development."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 31 All mystical traditions describe the process and its stages.”- 13 So, here we see that all mystical traditions, it doesn’t matter what religion or practice you choose, they all refer to the same mystical experience, not doctrine and dogma, but actual human experience regardless of belief structure. Absolutely every single human has the potential capability of having a mystical experience. This isn’t something that is saved only for the chosen few, or for prophets, or Jesus, Krishna, or Buddha even, this is something that all human beings have the Birthright to, all of us. If we don’t consciously experience it during our lifetime, we will when we die, and already have when we were born. However, we are capable of exploring the dimensions revealed to us by DMT while we are still alive; strangely this is a crime in our western society. The very molecule itself is a schedule 1 Illegal substance, and I must stop myself from laughing and crying at the same time knowing that we are all walking around with this schedule 1 illegal drug inside our heads. Naturally, distractions must control our society if we don’t know that our brains harbor an illegal drug and thousands of receptor sites specifically designed for drugs that have been made illegal, by men who don’t want us to have access to them, for some conspiracy of a reason. These receptor sites have been designed through our DNA and are like locks that have a perfect key or chemical to unlock them. So understand, that our government is not telling us that there are all kinds of fantastic doors that lead to rooms inside our minds and that these doors are locked but there are keys that exist to open them. Instead, our governments don’t want us to explore our own minds; they make it illegal to do so, thus outlawing the keys. Why? The time has come, technology is available, minds are opening, and we are learning more about the human being than we’ve known recently. In Ancient times however, our ancestors certainly were familiar with these concepts. They got"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 32 high constantly, without shame, without a guilty conscience, without laws restricting this kind of inner exploration. In fact, they were the ones who handed down the ideas of spirituality to the present day human, probably a wisdom that was adopted through mystical/psychedelic experiences. We certainly did not invent spirituality recently. If anything we have forgotten spirituality in this materialistic egotistical society. But we are still human and capable of accessing the spirit realms. More on this to come in later chapters. I must add that the creator of our DNA is one sly intelligence, that must get high itself. If it/they/god/divine/etc. designed us to have the receptors to get high, than it is aware of this state of being, and must have found it a worthy addition to our DNA. Animals get high as well without laws restricting them. Whether or not the Pineal Gland is the organ responsible for producing DMT, this will come to light with further studies and scientific research. But what is important for us to understand is that this chemical does exist in our cerebrospinal fluids, red blood cells, brain, and the lungs, therefore, within our human bodies exists the most powerful psychedelic compound known to mankind. We inherit a birthright to consciousness, the full spectrum, ALL of it. If then, our own consciousness and its entire potential is acknowledged, we can move beyond this preconceived notion that all altered states of consciousness are bad, and that the substances that alter our minds are equally negative. This is the notion we need to erase off the chalkboard of our current paradigm. We need to re-draw our maps and begin to explore this vitally important aspect of being a human, which is, our infinite consciousness."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 33 Chapter 2 - Consciousness E ver stop and wonder what you are? A body? A personality? An ego? A song? A container or vessel? DNA? Are you an alien? Or perhaps, Consciousness? Now bear in mind that Consciousness is far from being a physical thing that we can see and measure with our modern science, because it is not the brain. The brain is just a few pounds of meat, consciousness on the other hand is the energy that animates the physical brain and gives it life. We human beings have been blessed with invisible energy, divine energy. Energy that animates our third-dimensional physical body, but cannot be seen by the human eye. This “force” if you will, has the power to create and manifest realities . Quite similar to the organic natural processes we find repeated in the un / known universe. Within our own being, and when I say “being” I refer to that which is actually “isness” (funny word yes), within our being we are collectively imitating that which creation itself represents, that representation is “ Being ART .” Read on and I will demonstrate to you the truth in the sentences I provided above. This is the fun part, so bear with me. As I sit here in front of the laptop, its 8:05 PM on June 16 th , 2007. This is the only time there will ever be an 8:05 PM on June 16 th , 2007 and I just lived it and survived. Whew! But really, how often does a human being think to his/her self that this is the only experience there will ever be of this present moment in time, living in this time that is so temporary and ever changing? In a world where humans seem to do the same routine every week, get up go to work come home and sleep. I doubt uncle Bob, or little Nancy, or old Wynona are thinking about this. And why should they? It is seemingly irrelevant and pointless, or is it? Though my interest here is not to confuse you with theories of time, I am trying to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 34 provide an example of how this invisible force does in fact exist. By my demonstration of simply being conscious or aware of the time and my existence within that time, something invisible happened inside and outside of me. The part of me that thinks, (well, it thought), and therefore was alive with energy yet out of sight, remaining unseen. The part outside of me went by like the sun goes across the sky, allowing my energy to exist, to experience this invisible phenomena. A phenomena so remarkable, it is allowing you to experience these words on this paper, but it is certainly not tangible. Nothing you can grasp with your hands. Nothing you can see with the eye. Not Physical. The only thing that can see IT, is consciousness itself. Look in a mirror and see what you are, or what you are not. The “IT” I speak of is used by the psychological field as the word, Consciousness. It is also perceived by the religious communities as a different word known as the soul. I must add here the other word commonly referred to across the globe spanning ALL cultures, this word is spirit. Lets assume these words are revealing to us the same concept, soul=spirit=consciousness. If so, then we stumble upon an exciting journey ahead of us full of curiosity and wonder. The words I write here are for you, not because I think you need to know something that I do, but because I know that you already know . You would know if you are conscious. Silly for me to try to point that out. However, we all need reminded once in a while, otherwise we fall asleep and let our conscious experience slip away. Our very essence, what is this thing? Consciousness..?..?..? Invisible, Intangible, Clearly non physical. So without it being physical, then where does it exist if not in the 3 rd dimension???? What dimension then? Or maybe it is multi-dimensional??? This seems like a possible solution. Science has of course proved the reality of multiple dimensions, possibly 4,5,6,7,8,9...maybe infinite. The simple notion of a"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 35 multiple dimensional rea lity sets up a catapult reaction of questions that must be asked and issues that need to be addressed by the human race, and now sooner than later. First question of course is, What are Human Beings? Well according to the simplified modern scientific perspective humans are intelligent physical entities that exist in the 3 rd dimension of reality. Pretty basic a 3 rd grader could comprehend it. However this doesn’t answer the question, what are human beings? It only gives us information about the physical attributes of being a human and not the whole picture. We have learned that consciousness is certainly a vital aspect to the human being, a phenomena invisible to sight. Hidden Energy. Why couldn’t our body be in the 3 rd dimension while our consciousness could be capable of many dimensional experiences??? No one has a reasonable explanation for why not. But we have evidence to believe this could be the reality of things. I need only one example among many, Dreaming. An altered state of consciousness when we are somewhere, but not in the body. If we leave 3-D every night when we sleep, then where, or what dimension do we go to? And every human has dreams. Consciousness has a spectrum to it. Lets envision this spectrum like the musical scale or a range of frequencies. From Low to High sounds, infinite both ways but only audible to humans within a certain range of frequencies. Remember this; there exists sounds that humans cannot hear because it is beyond our sense capabilities. As with sound and hearing we have sight and vision. Our physical anatomy has eyeballs capable of seeing only certain range of frequencies that reflect light for our consciousness to then interpret as perception of something, someone, or someplace. Ok, well if there are sounds that exist we can’t hear, then there are probably things we cannot see with our eyes. And trust me, there are plenty of things you can’t see with your eyes, like radio frequencies, cell phone"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 36 signals, microwaves, and musical frequencies, but nevertheless they are there. Humans can only perceive less than 1 millionth of reality, according to the Electromagnetic Spectrum and the visible band of light. Instruments are invented, to help us perceive previously hidden things, for example the microscope and the telescope. BAM inventions that gave us visions of things we had never seen with our naked eyes before. Both on a micro level and macro level. We could eventually see deep into the heavens above us extending out into eternity, and we could see the underworlds of cellular reality, and the activity of atoms infinitely sinking into the very foundation of everything in existence. What an incredible revolutionary item was the microscope, invented over 400 years ago. We now have space telescopes like the Hubble in America bringing us images of the Milky Way Galaxy and other far reaching star systems. In a collective reality we are on the cusp of revolutionary information regarding life in the universe, including our own life. Later in this manuscript, we’ll discover instruments that our ancient ancestors used to explore their consciousness with. To repeat the beginning of this chapter, ever stop to wonder what you are? The simple answer to that is, LIFE. The universe is swimming with the existence of intelligent life, because life cannot be anything but intelligent. Humans are one species of life on one living planet named Earth, a planet full of thousands of diverse species of life. And, must I add: our planet Earth is only one living planet among multiple galaxies full of thousands of stars. Mathematically the chances of Earth being the only planet in the universe capable of intelligent life is improbable, leaving us to conclude we are theoretically, not alone in the universe. If you need any further proof of life in the universe, perhaps you could consider the fact that our earth is alive and living. Planets are organisms much like you and I are. So, perhaps other planets are alive as well, giving birth to life, just as our"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 37 Mother Earth gave birth to us. The Spectrum of Consciousness In this section of the chapter Consciousness is viewed as a full spectrum having highs and lows and in- betweens. An example of a similar frequency spectrum is the musical scale. With the existence of 12 tones per octave, the 13 th tone being exactly one whole scale above the first and sharing it’s note name. Remember the connection between the number 12 and 13 in relationship to the story of Christ and his 12 disciples, 13 men total or one entire octave scale. I suggest this is no coincidence, the author of this play perhaps had knowledge of the musical frequency spectrum/consciousness spectrum. We are handed down myths, legends, and stories embedded with hidden knowledge, but sometimes it’s obvious knowledge that we only need pointed out to be able to see. We can now take a look at the differences in this consciousness frequency spectrum. Waking Consciousness (in-between) It’s the middle of the day. You are awake, alert, and responding to the external variables that surround you. People around you appear to be acting the same as yourself, awake and doing the same kinds of activities with their consciousness, talking, reading, working, thinking, making reality with their minds without realizing it. Dramatic, I know. But it’s not every second we stop and contemplate anything of considerable importance. We are computers that get distracted by pop-up ads and the commercials on TV. Our consciousness is in a neutral state while during waking consciousness, capable of flying really High or sinking very Low. In a nutshell, waking consciousness is what"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 38 you are probably experiencing as you read this. However, some of these words are energetically charged prior to you reading them and they resonate at different frequencies that you may feel when you read them. One example of this would be what your immediate feelings are when you read the word Love . I’m sure that the word Love makes you feel much different than the word Fear . These words resonate at completely opposite frequencies, and it takes consciousness to feel that opposition. So, as you read the words throughout this manuscript, your consciousness may feel highs and lows because of the orchestration of words being used. Speaking or writing is similar to creating music, in that creation takes place through the medium of consciousness, our consciousness. Low vibrations (depression, sadness, hatred) When a human being is depressed or ill, their consciousness is functioning at a lower frequency than regular. The human vehicle, the body, lacks energy to charge itself because the battery/brain isn’t feeding it enough food, as a result of many possible things such as atmosphere, peers, boredom, poor input levels, negative external variables, medication, the list is endless... However this state of consciousness is absolutely necessary. Why you may ask? It’s like that old metaphor about beauty and ugliness, would you recognize a flower is beautiful if you had nothing ugly to compare it with??? Would we be able to perceive happiness if we didn’t have sadness? Everything has got its Yin and Yang, EVERYTHING ! So in the lower range of consciousness we are affected by the negative media giving news reports about war, disease, murders, negativity. We are affected by our society so much that we can barely recognize our own divine individuality among the sea of faces conforming on the TV screen. When in a lower state of consciousness thoughts are"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 39 seldom revolutionary and they happen with friction. We stop thinking straight when we are upset. Humans are very easily put into a low vibrating state of being. When humans do not understand their own consciousness, they are easily manipulated. All that it takes to overcome this manipulation is Awareness. Be aware of what is being put into your consciousness. If you don’t vibe with it, find something else. Find a higher frequency. Higher frequencies (love, ecstasy, mystical, genius) Of course, on the other end of the spectrum exists frequencies vibrating at higher and faster rates. The very best example of this is Love. The highest frequency a human can contemplate is Love. Many things can make our consciousness vibrate in these higher realms. Including music, plants, animals, meditation, prayer, happiness, the contemplation of the divine, and the practice of Peace and Love. When we vibrate at faster rates we can easily have epiphanies, or mystical experiences, light bulbs of wonderful ideas bright up, and we have revolutionary breakthrough thoughts. Genius vibrates at a very high frequency, opposite that of stupidity. I’m sure you have met someone who is thinking on a very high and intellectual level that it makes you wonder how they are capable of such ideas. Perhaps you yourself are a genius, maybe without realizing it? Well I suppose I view genius as something all humans are capable of. With the right ingredients in place, the dish will taste wonderful. Being high is probably one of the best feelings in the world, high in love, high on life, high in your thoughts. We daydream when we get bored, in order for our consciousness to find a higher ground. Something entertaining, wishes, dreams, visions, and fantasies are played out in our mind. For an explanation of this, we all know that higher frequencies exist and we rather enjoy the way they make us feel, so we tend to be"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 40 attracted to these highs. Something as simple as a crop circle in a field can have such a profound impact on our consciousness that we get high just contemplating its meaning, mystery, and beauty. Within all of us, we have a mystery, so fantastic and phenomenal that occasionally when we look in the mirror we see ourselves, but god is the one looking back at us, and that’s when you are the highest . Once your third eye opens and the mystical experience occurs within your consciousness, you are never the same again. Once you learn that the Divine permeates your entire being and that you are God becoming aware of the God within, your perception is cleansed. Christ Consciousness It really cracks me up to think how easy it is for your average American to call you crazy for being that high, so high you think god is inside you? And yet, they will be the ones claiming to be followers of a man, who said exactly what is being said here, without realizing one’s own lack of mystical awareness they forget his words, “the kingdom of heaven is within you.” Christ is one of the best examples of what it means to be high, vibrating at the highest frequencies known to man, a frequency many people term as, Christ Consciousness or Infinite Love. Please understand, my intention here is to point things out that to my intuition seem to be collectively agreeable. Christ was a loving person, not hateful, nor fearful. Some people say he wasn’t human at all, but instead was a myth constructed from various esoteric concepts. But if he was an actual human who walked this planet, within the consciousness spectrum, he was in the higher realms. I hope you would agree. However, Christ was certainly not the only human who resonates at this frequency; among the many we see Buddha, Muhammad, Osiris, Quetzalcoatl, and Enki. The list goes on through every human civilization spanning the whole of known history. We have always been aware of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 41 the high states of consciousness. And, the interesting thing is that all humans no matter what point in time, or what geographical location, all have the ability to get high or go low. Including you and I. Altered States The rest of this manuscript focuses on information related specifically to this section, on Altered States of Consciousness, (ASC). The best example of an ASC, as I’ve previously mentioned, can be found in every human being during sleep. We call this phenomena dreaming . I use this example to describe what an altered state of consciousness resembles, because dreaming is indeed an altered state itself. Visions occur during sleep, stories play themselves out, information is available, however, it is up to the individual experiencing the dream to interpret the information. I’m sure we’ve all wondered about our dreams. How do they happen? Are they important? What causes us to dream? And, if we look back in history, we discover our ancestors weighed great importance on dreaming. They believed dreaming to be a psychic phenomena that encodes spiritual wisdom that must be interpreted, usually by the shaman figure of the community. Why would the shaman interpret the dreams? Well, because a shaman is the one who is full of knowledge and wisdom related to these altered states of consciousness. Thus, having firsthand experience of non-ordinary realms, and the capabilities of interpreting the dreams. The chapter on the Brain gave us a glimpse into the chemicals found inside us, and the importance of each molecule playing a functioning role in the human experience. As I had made mention of the spirit molecule: DMT, we see this is a naturally occurring psychoactive chemical found in the brain and possibly the human pineal gland. This may be the substance that"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 42 is released in the middle of the night, giving way to a whole surge of visual perceptions that we call our dreams . It seems like a natural connection, considering the content of the dreams with the content of the DMT experience. For more information on this chemical, again, I highly recommend reading Dr. Rick Strassman’s book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule , 2001. The point that I am making here is, to familiarize you with what exactly an altered state of consciousness is. Dreaming is the best example simply because we all do it. I’m positive that not everyone has ingested a magical mushroom. So, it’s hard for me to explain that as a common ground for everyone to understand altered states of consciousness. The mushroom experience is indeed an altered state, but it is its own experience altogether. Later, during chapter five, research based on these magical fungi will be revealed. Other practices used to alter consciousness include: prolonged dancing, rhythmic drumming, trance/techno/tribal/rock music, sensory deprivation, starvation/fasting, meditation, and, of course, the ingestion of a psychedelic fungi/fruit/plant/substance. These are all methods used by the shaman to enter an ASC. For a person experiencing an altered state of consciousness for the very first time, excluding dreaming, what typically happens is a flood of mass confusion, paranoia, clueless understanding, and incredible suggestibility jumps into your consciousness. Why? This clearly doesn’t seem like a fun experience for anybody. However, when we learn why this happens we can better understand the process of the shaman. From the day we are born, our minds begin to download our conditioning of consciousness. Everything we know is a result of what we have learned, experienced, and been conditioned to believe. The reason why a person experiences all of the confusion when having their first psychedelic experience is a result of wiping our conditioned minds clean of all debris"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 43 picked up along the way. As a result everything you think you know, fades away. Then nothing makes sense, because what you thought you knew, is missing. This is certainly a rebirth of some kind. Wiping your slate clean and giving birth to a whole new perspective of reality, that has always existed but you had never learned about it yet. In layman’s terms: Altered states of consciousness typically de-condition the human mind, and reprograms it to a different perspective of the reality we live in. And, usually, it is a life changing, spiritual, cosmic and dimensional perspective that people develop after having such experiences. The connection to nature, and our Earth, is renewed through this transformation and humans feel a belonging to this planet that gives us a home in the infinite cosmos of the divine. In and Out of Body Another interesting aspect of human consciousness is its mobility, and the threshold of the inner/outer body experience. When we are inside the body, during waking consciousness, we orient ourselves with the physical reality and the laws that govern such constructs. However, when we have an out-of-body experience (OBE), our consciousness no longer abides by the laws that govern the physical version of reality. Instead, during an OBE our consciousness/spirit/soul/etc. has the mobility of a bird, flying to and from various scenes and/or settings. Dreaming is a prime example of a natural out-of-body experience. Although according to scientific studies our physical brains register to be just as active during waking consciousness as during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, our consciousness is no longer confined to the spatial dimensions of 3-D. Next time you wake up from a dream, think to yourself, where was I just at?? We go to the other side every night when we sleep, just as the shaman travels to the other side when he/she perturbs the mind. And as you have learned,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 44 dreaming is only one example of an altered state of consciousness that can induce out-of-body experiences, plant hallucinogens are the other commonly used method to induce this out-of-body journey. Speaking from personal experience, I feel that the out-of-body voyages which have occurred during my life have provided me with a sort of proof for the existence of my consciousness beyond the fragility of my human body. This has given me capabilities to explore and discover various realms of reality during such instances. Time ceases to exist. Culture is evaporated into the warmth of novelty. Philosophies soak themselves in the sea of thought. As the tide of human history comes crashi ng down around you, leaving you naked and harmless. The collective versions of reality remain exactly that: the-collective-versions-of- reality. It is the individual’s own understanding of reality which is molded by the kind of spiritual experiences which the individual has during their lifetime."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 45 Chapter 3 - Spirituality C ontemplation of the invisi ble provides us with insight into the profound realms of the human mind, the imagination, and the spirit. All great inventors, writers, musicians, storytellers, teachers, architects, artists, carpenters, and magicians use the imagination to achieve the creation they intend to manifest. We live in a world full of imagination. Reality is just our imagination. You are the imagination of what you think you are. Every human uses imagination, some more than others. This activity takes place within our consciousness, within the invisible realms. Practically every civilization of mankind has its myths, folklore, religions, legends, creation stories, and knowledge of the universe, passed down through spoken word, songs, books, tablets, architecture and art. Plenty of different religions cover the planet and it is clear that religion plays a large part of the human history. Religion can be something like a stamp which you put upon your forehead to show the world what you imagine you are. But religion is based on understanding Spirit, or spirit realms and the beings that inhabit them, including: gods, angels, demons, extraterrestrials, fairies, elves, gnomes, light beings, etc. Humans around the world practice religions that are filled with various spirit-beings, you and I are probably included, unless you are nihilistic/atheist. But no matter what religion you are affiliated with, or what deity you worship, it all came from somewhere. Spirituality had to start being practiced at some distant point in history. Let’s take a look at the origins of spirituality as they may be unfamiliar to you. Spiritual Origins Over 30,000 years ago on planet Earth existed a"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 46 species of hominids that looked very much like ourselves, hunters and gatherers, roaming the earth trying to survive. These early hominids may have had similar if not identical anatomies to the modern humans we know today. However, we see they had no art, no spirituality, no symbolism, no written language, the very things that make us modern civilized human beings. Their consciousness was at a rather slow level of imagination. Something, however, sparked a fire across the whole world, igniting the consciousness of these early hominids to start creating Art and Symbolism. When we look back into history around 15-30,000 years ago, rock caves began to develop elaborate art work depicting supernatural beings, animals, therianthropes (human animal hybrids), spirits, deities, psychedelic squiggles, zigzags, waves, and circular imagery. We are left with the impression that these first forms of art indicates some sort of practiced spirituality or religious activity among our early ancestors. Symbolism entered our consciousness once we started expressing our imagination through making art. Spirituality is expressed through this symbolism. A new understanding of the world was interpreted through the imagination of these artists. The very dawn of modern humanity was a result of this initiation into the act of creating art and becoming like the creator of the universe. Again, we remember the relevant ancient statement: “ As above, So below .”-3 There must have been a catalyst that triggered such a profound evolutionary leap. We can consider the fact that humans share similar neurological networking within the brain. And they share similar dietary habits, depending on habitat location. To slightly paraphrase Graham Hancock’s recent and extensively wonderful book titled, Supernatural: Meetings with the ancient teachers of mankind : “ A simple explanation for encounters with supernatural beings arise from the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 47 universal human neurological capacity to enter altered-states of consciousness- states of deep trance in which extremely realistic hallucinations are seen. Many anthropologists are convinced that as far back as the Upper Paleolithic, our ancestors placed high value on hallucinations and made extensive use of psychoactive plants to induce them. Among a variety of other methods such as rhythmic drumming, dancing, starvation, sensory deprivation, plant use however was the most commonly used method. In the hunter gatherer societies it was typically the role of the shaman (medicine man) the ritual specialist who is able to make the perilous journey to the hallucinatory otherworld and return with healing knowledge. Professor David Lewis- Williams takes the view that the first notions of the existence of supernatural realms and beings, the first “religious” ideas about them, the first art representing them, and the first mythologies concerning them, were all derived from the experiences of hallucinating shamans. The cave art around the world depict images of hallucinations seen by shamans in altered states of consciousness. Since both we and the shaman-artists of the Upper Paleolithic share the same modern human neurology, it follows that there may after all be some possibility of a bridge between us and them- some possibility for us to see what they saw and, despite the passage of tens of thousands of years, to gain direct"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 48 experiential insight into the roots of their beliefs .”-14 So this explains to us that a human being with the designated role of the shaman in society, would enter into an altered-state of consciousness by ingesting some psychoactive plant or fungi. They would then travel through a realm of spirits and search for the knowledge that they would bring back to heal members of their community. This realm was one of bright and colorful visions that inspired the shaman who saw them to draw upon the inside of the cave walls, where the ceremonies could have taken place. The shaman painted the things seen during the visions. Creating for us the dawn of art, symbolism, spirituality, religion, music and imagination. Music was a large part of practicing these altered-states, as the shaman would beat his drum and chant during his visions to increase their intensity. Here we see the first use of music becoming part of human culture. Prior to using the drum or flute the only music humans had to listen to was their voice, breathing, heartbeats, birds and animals, thunder in the sky, and the rivers rushing downstream. The drum was one of the first musical instruments, and a profoundly spiritual one. ‘ The first drums dates back to 6000 BC, over 8,000 years ago, if not longer than that .’-15 We will discuss more about the impact music had on humans later on during the chapter about Vibration and Frequency. Visionary Realm For anyone who has ever experienced the psychedelic state of consciousness, they would agree the imagery, if they experienced any, involved geometric patterns, colors, shapes, sometimes encounters with beings, jeweled cities, and strange brightly lit rooms. This is what modern humans are reporting and it matches exactly with what our ancestors depict in their"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 49 cave art. ‘ The very word “psychedelic” stems from the Greek words Psyche (mind) and Delos (manifest) in other words: to make the mind manifest itself. ’-16 In correlation with the psychedelic plant use, we hear of very similar visions seen during mystical/religious experiences, during near-death experiences, during alien abductions, and during deep states of meditation. The answer for this can be found in our neuro-chemical brain. The chapter on the Brain explained how the various chemicals influence our conscious experiences, and, if psychedelic chemicals already exist inside us, such as DMT, then we can understand why similar imagery keeps popping up throughout human history. Human beings cannot stop a vision. They happen either naturally or induced. When we sleep, we dream, as a possible result of these hallucinogenic chemicals inside of us. We may not be able to control our dreams and the visions seen during sleep, but we can choose when to sleep in order to experience a dream. Just as we can choose when to alter our consciousness to experience spiritual visions, however we cannot control the visions themselves, they happen involuntarily without our input. We can simply observe the visions, participate in, and then interpret them. The funny thing about these visionary realms similar to a thought is that they certainly are not physical, instead they are ethereal. Invisible to the naked eye but blatantly obvious to the human with the mystical goggles on. As participants in the visionary realm, because we seem to be participating in the visionary experience, our consciousness is beyond the physical body. Perhaps, if you were to ask a shaman whether or not he thinks the visions are as real as this reality, or just simple hallucinations? The response would more than likely be: that the visions are real, if not more real, than this reality. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 50 Left Brain Science Most scientists are quick to explain away supernatural phenomena such as UFO sightings, alien contact, angels and demons, psychic abilities, spiritual encounters, etc. as being mere hallucinations, or misinterpretations by the observer. The reason why most scientists may have this stance, I assume, is the result of funding/money. This is what keeps their physical scientific instrument research alive. Money is physical so scientists tend to stick to the physical world for their explanations of reality, the provable realm, the ‘payable’ realm. Not that science is atrocious by any means; it is a wonderful tool that should be used by the human race to prove certain things that are indeed true. However, it represents only the left portion of the human brains potential, reasonable and logical thinking. In order to arrive at a more fulfilled explanation of the reality we live in, we need to rely on our entire brain potential, both hemispheres left and right. Logic needs to connect itself to the Mystery. Reason needs to connect to Imagination. Physical reality needs to connect to Invisible realms. Why? Because just like the yin-yang we can’t have up without down, opposites will always be connected whether we want to admit it or not. So, a scientist could tell us we are delusional if we think the spiritual realms are a reality. And religious fundamentalists could tell us we are delusional if we think that science has the answers about life. We can laugh at both arguments as nothing but gibberish where one does not recognize the others contributions. Nevertheless, if we look at both sides spiritual and scientific as being part of the one whole, we can reach a much larger perspective on understanding the nature of the universe we reside in. If we understand that the first form of religion/spirituality was also the first form of a scientific practice, and that the first scientist was a sort of priest or shamanic medicine man who understood how the human"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 51 mind worked, and by using his scientific knowledge of certain plants and their chemical properties he/she was able to harvest us the first spiritual and scientific traditions, we can then better understand the myths handed down from ancient cultures. Ancient Legends In ancient Egyptian culture, we are told about the god Thoth, the bringer of civilization, astronomy, astrology, mathematics, geometry, writing, science, medicine, and magic. Let’s take this at face value and say Thoth had knowledge of both science and spirituality/magic. Thoth passed this information on to the growing civilization of Egypt and they practiced it collectively. I suggest the possibility that Thoth doesn’t represent one specific person, but rather a form of knowledge or perhaps a group of humans around the world who practiced altered-states of consciousness and gave birth to a spiritual/scientific age of humanity. Egypt is not the only civilization we read about which speaks of a deity who brought us this knowledge. The Aztec religion explains a god named Quetzalcoatl who did all the things mentioned above about the god Thoth. Quetzalcoatl represents the same thing Thoth does. Interestingly enough when looking at the word Quetzalcoatl we see it means “feathered bird- serpent”. In other words, a serpent that can fly. In legend the serpent represents wisdom, knowledge, and healing powers. The widely used symbol for Western medicine is the caduceus , or staff of Hermes. The caduceus is a symbol showing a staff pillar with two serpents wrapped around it, with spread wings at the top. Two serpents entwined together clearly represent a strand of human DNA. The wings demonstrate to us the divine capabilities latent in the human DNA for astral flight or flight of consciousness as the result of the knowledge of certain medicine. A very different representation of the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 52 serpent can found in modern Christianity with its depiction of the Devil or Satan being a winged serpent. How could the same image mean completely different things to different cultures? If you find yourself driving around town try looking for the caduceus symbol, it is on every medical health center and hospital. Why? Especially when most western Christians think a winged serpent represents evil? Perhaps, this knowledge has been flipped around and used against their own psyche, guarding them from the truth about the origins of our species, and the original symbolism of the caduceus which is a symbol for medicine, drugs, alchemy, and the Forbidden Fruit. Without going into a conspiracy theory for why we have opposing views of the same image, I will continue to point out our religious views and explain the hidden knowledge found in scripture. Its rather blatant, once you put the pieces of the puzzle together. What is described in the Bible and other ancient sacred texts about visions, encounters, voices in the head, miracles, and acts of healing, regarded as supernatural phenomena, more than likely did occur, and something had to induce them. Could it have been the Forbidden Fruit? What is Spirituality? I was just looking at Wikipedia’s definition of the term “spirituality”, and it said something worth noting here: Spirituality relates to matters of sanity and of psychological health. Like some forms of religion, spirituality often focuses on personal experience. Many spiritual traditions, accordingly, share a common spiritual theme: the \"path\", \"work\", practice, or tradition of perceiving and internalizing one's \"true\" nature and relationship to the rest of existence, and of becoming free of the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 53 lesser egoic self (or ego) in favor of being more fully one's \"true\" \"Self\".- 17 So like some but certainly not all religions, spirituality is a direct personal experience of the divine with the aim of dissolving the unwanted ego. If most religions and forms of spirituality consist of similar agenda’s, that being the practice of perceiving our true nature and relationship with the divine, then why can’t we all agree that the names and words we use in our religions may be different but at the root of it all the common theme is our relationship with the divine? When we look up the word “Divine” in the dictionary we find several references consisting of: 1 . having godlike nature: being God or a god or goddess 2. relating to God, gods, or goddesses: connected with, coming from, or caused by God or a god or goddess 3. connected with worship: relating to the worship or service of God or a god or goddess 4. lovely: pleasing, attractive, or well performed .-18 What difference is there if a person goes to a church to be with their god, or a person sits in a field watching the clouds roll by to be with their god? It is the same practice with differing methods, that is all. The methods we use to access the divine should never be held against us by people in positions of power who think they know better. We are the ones who know what works best for our own personal spiritual development. We have known for thousands of years. The problem is, we’ve let go of our responsibility and gave it to the hands of men who have become sick with the greed for power within an institution that takes our individual freedom, the freedom to perceive the divine with our own minds. Look out and you will recognize the corruption and secrecy at the heart of religious organizations. Look within and you will see sacred"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 54 geometry harmoniously penetrating your very being, the divine energy. Sun of God All the different religions came from somewhere, started somehow, and were inspired by prior knowledge. Christianity is probably the best example of these prior spiritual concepts embedded within it. Becoming Rome’s official state religion in 313AD by Emperor Constantine, who, by the way, was a pagan Sun worshipper. Look at the relationship in the words (Pagan-worship of the Sun God, and Christian-worship of the Son of God.) If this is the first time you have had this pointed out to you, understand it is no mistake. Before there was a Christianity or Jesus, a very popular religion on earth was called Paganism. Paganism is a religious practice directly linked to nature, shamanism and astrotheology. Paganism has many deities, or gods, one main deity is the Sun, bringer of light, life, and energy. The Sun is revered as a supreme god. Without it, religions or concepts of God wouldn’t exist; thoughts wouldn’t exist because we wouldn’t exist to have them. Many different cultures around the world worship this Divine being. Egypt named the Sun-Ra, the Sun God. In Hinduism they refer to the Sun as Surya Deva, the solar deity. Many African tribes use the local word for \"Sun\" as the name for their supreme being. Indonesia, in some cases refers to the Sun as the “founder” or “father” of the tribe. It is by no mistake that we have adopted these ancient beliefs for modern versions of Christianity. The problem with the cult of Judeo-Christian traditions is the fight for power within the church. The power the priests have to command obedience and create inquisitions. To burn the books they don’t want you to read, keeping anything that would inhibit their power over you out of reach. I’m not trying to say Christians or Catholics are corrupt, it’s just that the history of their Church is the bloodiest of all. If we look together at the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 55 history of the Christian Church we find much bloodshed. From the burning of witches, to the Inquisition, from the crusades, to the imposition of belief. Christians tend, to not want to acknowledge this dark side of their history. Christians are made to believe, that anyone who wasn’t a ‘Christian’, was indeed a heretic or devil worshipper. What poppycock that turns out to be. Claiming someone is affiliated with the devil because they are not Christian, is no different than claiming someone is stupid because they weren‘t educated in a public school. Heretics are those people who are smart enough to think for themselves, as opposed to being told what to think by some organized religion or institution. Heretics are those outsiders that choose, not to conform with the mass of people that happen to be blind to the damages they’ve created. The shamans are considered heretical, because they access the divine without going through the ‘Church’s version of Christ’ to experience it. Funny thing is, Christ himself represents the same aspects of the Shaman, healing knowledge, divine encounters, herbal use, meditation/prayer, self-reflection, transcendence, mystical states of consciousness, and love for the spirit. In fact ‘ Christ’ is a title, taken from the Greek word, ‘ Christos’, meaning ‘ the anointed one’. This title was given to the human, Jesus, referring to a state of consciousness he accessed by becoming anointed with the holy oil, psychoactive chemical, possibly DMT. ‘ Shaman’ is a title given to a human who accesses similar states of consciousness. In other words, we could, if we want to, use the terms Shaman and Christ interchangeably. For both terms refer to the same state of consciousness accessed by a human being. Angels, Aliens, and Elves Of course when we talk about spirituality we can hardly go much further without discussing Spirit beings. There is a long list of entities that can be considered spirit beings. Among these entities we find: angels,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 56 demons, fairies, elves, gnomes, sprites, goblins, extraterrestrials, ghosts, light beings, therianthropes, gods and goddesses. These spirits have their domain or realm where they exist, some would say our consciousness itself harbors their home. Others claim they have their own reality, independent from our mind. Perhaps both are correct. If we consider our consciousness exists in multiple dimensions, then maybe these spirits appear to us only when we are in altered states of consciousness. Graham Hancock offers an eloquent explanation for how the human brain works in comparison to a radio. Paraphrased, he claims that our consciousness is much like a radio, capable of accessing different frequencies that broadcast different channels. Currently we are accessing Channel Normal, the waking/neutral state. If we alter our consciousness, or change the channel to a different frequency then we are able to access the programs being broadcast on that frequency. When we do this, the programs may broadcast different visual realities full of diverse imagery and life forms. It may be hard to swallow if one has never had personal experience with these states of mind. But if one does the research, they will find that all over the world humans have been altering their consciousness to access the “spirits” for thousands of years. Shamans most notably use this method for healing purposes. The evidence for proof of these spirit entities lie in our mythologies, our religions, our folklore, our imagination, and our entertainment. When talking about these spirits we should recognize the similarities found among them. The fairies, gnomes, sprites, and elves for instance, are a small people, harboring magical powers, enchanting and mysterious, slightly mischievous, and apparently very playful. One of the most interesting stories I’ve come across related to fairies would be the Fairy Ring Dance. A musical dance performed in a circular rotation by multiple fairies found in the small clearing of a field. An impression of a circle can be left"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 57 behind in the grass, enabling a human to enter the fairy realm. Note here, the crop circle relationship to the fairy ring. Almost acting as a portal, or dimensional gate. According to folk tales, this circular indentation is a doorway to spirits that will lead the human into a new dimension full of these small entities, fairies. Beautiful music, colors, imagery, and information exists in this place. Who wouldn’t want to participate in this dance? If given the chance, I’m sure I would join. Please don’t forget the connections we find in this story with the earlier and later chapters of this book. The information is all relevant. Notice these points listed below: 1. The role of music/frequency 2. The role of the circle dance 3. The circular crop formation left behind 4. The portal to another dimensional realm 5. The small people/entities in this realm 6. The human participant All of the things mentioned above can be related to shamanism, alien abduction, crop circles, near-death experiences, altered states of consciousness, and psychedelic voyages. It is interesting that one story can include a form of altering human consciousness through the method of dance, while involving music/frequency, then followed by encounters with other dimensional beings in an apparently separate reality from our own. With a crop circle representing the gateway, the human has access to the spirit realm by altering their consciousness and then entering the portal to the other side. Funny how this particular folk legend comes from European history, and we seem to find tons of crop circles appearing near Stonehenge in England. Coincidence? I doubt it. Another point to be made regarding one form of these spirit entities we often call gnomes or elves... Why do we always see depictions of gnomes with mushrooms? In yards and gardens all over the world you can see the two together. It is as if the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 58 gnome/mushroom relationship is part of this same phenomena, the phenomena of altered states of consciousness (ASC) and little beings. In a later chapter I will discuss the mushroom connection to ASC. By no means is this relationship of gnomes and mushrooms a coincidence. Gnomes represent little people in a magical realm, identical to fairies and elves. Angels and Demons are both included in this category of “spirit beings”, for the obvious reason that they are mentioned in most religions. Both sides are represented, light and dark, good and evil, up and down, heaven and hell. Angels represent the beautiful light, while demons represent the ugly darkness. Recognize the yin-yang symbolism. My mother has always had a connection with angels, so I’ve been around the idea of these entities most of my life. I can say that the connection angels and demons have with the other spirit entities, is the supernatural otherworldly realm that they exist in. They seem to influence human affairs and human reality. Now we’ll touch on the most recent phenomena, Alien/Extraterrestrials. However this information is anything but recent. Stories involving ET’s and their flying craft have been with us since before Biblical times. So where do I begin? Regarding the UFO mystery we find millions of reports throughout all of human history. In modern times these sightings seem to be increasing more and more each year. Later on in Chapter 11, we’ll discuss the UFO subject further. For now I want to ask this question, who is operating these craft? Well, some humans think that they are us from the future; others think they are beings from a far away planet. Some people think they are demons, while others think they are angels. Some would claim they are multi-dimensional entities that visit this dimension once in a while. Still other people think they are our creators, the genetic scientists that gave birth to our species. And some people think they are teachers, observers, designers or just a figment of our imaginations. So you see, how"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 59 can I possibly know what these beings actually are? But, for you I will dive into my imagination, intuition and spirit, to bring us some kind of idea of what we are dealing with here. Let me first point out what I know about us humans. We can be good, or we can be bad. That’s not very difficult to see. If we can assume humans are either of these two, I’m sure ET’s can be either good or bad as well. The lovely opposition of yin and yang. Now, naturally I cannot say that aliens are bad guys, no more than I can say they are the good guys, for the reason that they are probably both good and bad. With that being said we hopefully won’t have a bias toward these beings. Here, I want to make a point about the abduction scenario. Apparently humans are reporting being taken by these beings aboard their craft and having the entities speak with them telepathically. When we look at the relationship between this and the fairy ring dance story, we notice some interesting connections. Typically the aliens are reported to be smaller than we are, so they are a small people just like the elves, and fairies are. The motion of the circle dance opening up a portal is related to the motion of the flying saucer swirling and traveling through space and possibly multiple dimensions. Music or Frequency is used in the Fairy Dance to lure the human into the portal. When right before an abduction occurs, the human reports a high pitch buzzing in the ear, some frequency is heard and then all of a sudden the ET’s appear. These are interesting connections that make me ask, is it coincidence or simply the same phenomena? With so much information to sift through, why do we keep coming across similar incidents that parallel ancient texts and folk tales? Whitley Strieber is a famous author, radio host of Dreamland, and an alien abductee. With books such as Communion , Transformation , The Greys , and 2012, his work gives us a direct look inside of his personal ET abductions. In order to tie in the fairy dance with the alien realm, I’ve taken a few passages from his book,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 60 Transformation, we read: “ In December 1987 I was given proofs of Jacques Vallee’s new book, Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact, in order to write a foreword. I was fascinated to see that the traditional journey to Magonia, or “land of the fairy,” often started with three drops of liquid being placed on the traveler’s head or face. Vallee mentions that a young woman who was taken had her right eye soaked in “a green dew,” whereupon she could see many wonderful things. Another had “three drops of precious dew” dripped on her left eyelid before making such a journey. The “nurse” (ET) gave me drops on my tongue. I have always known that .”-19 “ Someone I perceived to be a nurse or stewardess dropped three drops of a clear liquid out of an eyedropper onto my tongue. ”-20 “ What is the drug that induces the voyage to Magonia “Land of the fairy”? Is it a powerful hallucinogen, or something that acclimatizes the body so that it can slip across space-time to another world ?”-21 These passages are prime examples of the correlation between hallucinogenic chemicals, altered- states of consciousness, spirit/extraterrestrial contact, folk legends, and of course multi-dimensional experience. The ET’s themselves may represent a vast amount of life forms that can include fairies, elves, angels, demons, and other various entities. Different cultures use different words to describe the same phenomena. However, the main point to be made here is that encounters with spirits most always occur during an"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 61 Altered-State of Consciousness. If the human has not induced the ASC consciously, the experience itself is enough to alter your consciousness. They also take place in a different location or dimension then where the human was prior to the experience. Once we start putting two and two together, we realize that we arrive at four. And, once we put the natural, biological, altered- states of consciousness together with the contact of spirits generated during such experiences, we realize we arrive at a similar mythological tale found in the Garden of Eden, partaking of the Forbidden Fruit to open the eyes of mankind, knowing good (wisdom) from bad (ignorance). Cartoon Symbolism Without mentioning the symbolism that is blatantly found in cartoons, I would be omitting a large influential aspect of this Forbidden Fruit/spirit contact story. Growing up as a kid watching Saturday morning cartoons, I never paid much attention to the artistic/symbolic details embedded in the weekly episodes coming through the electronic medium of the television screen. Instead, playfully and light-heartedly, I would enjoy the colorful and imaginative stories that were being flashed before my premature consciousness. The amount of hidden symbolism did not seem to impact my conscious-mind until much later in my life, not until I began the research for this book. After watching season one of Smurfs , I knew it would be necessary to add this section for your reading pleasure. Instantly, after pressing the play button on the DVD remote, the room was filled with the audible sensation of a happy Smurf song. Not only was this friendly and enchanting music pumping through the speakers, but simultaneously the images flashed across the screen of these little ‘blue’ smurfs with white caps, dancing around, singing, filled with happiness. As the narrator was introducing the show, the words stuck in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 62 my mind as he explained, the smurfs as being good !! The other main character, Gargamel, the classic ‘villain’ and his pet cat Azrael were the root of all mishaps in the Smurf Village. Gargamel is consistently trying to find the little Smurf Village in order to destroy the smurf’s happiness, which he despises. I find it important to note, that Gargamel is an evil human wizard who wishes to find the smurfs in the forest and then destroy them (typically by eating them). The intentions behind this wizard are negative, evil, and down-right ‘fun hating’. I wonder if this human wizard would have more positive intentions, perhaps the smurfs would bring him to their village and share their happiness with him. This is a vital lesson to learn from this cartoon, evil leads to unhappiness, good leads to happiness. The more obvious point I’d like to touch on, is the fact that these little blue entities called ‘smurfs’ live in the forest, and their village is filled with mushroom houses. And within practically every smurf house hangs a picture, with an image of the mushroom! So they live in and around, and seem to cherish/almost worship this particular fruit found in the forest. If you are paying attention, this will hit you with no surprise. The Smurfs is a cartoon deeply embedded with symbolism of little blue entities that use magic, happiness, music, and nature, all to their benefit. In one particular episode, I recall the intentions of Gargamel searching the forest for the Smurf Village , so Papa Smurf creates a magical potion which renders the village invisible to the negative human trying to find and destroy it. This is another great lesson to be learned from this cartoon. These entities, called smurfs, choose to disappear from the visual realm of humans who have negative intentions. The last emphasis to be made here, is that wherever you see colorful mushrooms you are likely to see the smurfs running around in their little innocent reality. Could this cartoon be based on ancient, sacred, alchemical, and shamanic knowledge?? Without a doubt! A short list of various cartoons that include"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 63 ‘small beings’, and often enough the mushroom, will provide further evidence to support this cartoon symbolism mystery. Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs, David the Gnome, Peter Pan (Tinker Bell fairy), Santa’s Elves, Fantasia, Alice in Wonderland, Lilo and Stitch, Mario Brothers , etc... As you can see, cartoons are probably the safest, most efficient way to convey the sacred wisdom of shamanism through symbolism, entering the subconscious mind of the humans around the world. The last thing I’d like to add, to finish off this cartoon symbolism section, would be the intentional use of mushrooms. The Mario Brothers put it in the face of all their viewers, the shamanic use of mushrooms to make the character ‘bigger’, with more energy, more life, and much stronger. Alice in Wonderland partakes in eating the mushroom which makes her larger than life, or smaller than a bug, which is needed for her in order to pass through the magic doorway traveling deeper into Wonderland. I will discuss this mushroom in chapter 5. However, the important thing to remember here is that there is not just one medium through which this knowledge has been passed down through the generations. Cartoons are simply the newer version of oral story telling traditions common among tribal cultures. The cartoon has replaced and enhanced the mystery teachings of our ancestral shamans in the modern western civilizations."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 65 Chapter 4 - Ancient Ancestors L ooking back into human history we will notice some correlations between the past and the present, namely the religious spiritual experience seems to be the same. But before we examine this information it is very important for us to research and learn about our ancient ancestors. So, in this chapter, I will be highlighting significant points that we humans collectively should understand about our past and its myths. The information presented here is based on legitimate research and should not be regarded as fanciful stories, although they are myths, the difference between fact and fiction is indistinguishable. However, I will also include theories that seem like probable scenarios of our origins. Evolution is a topic that cannot be ignored when discussing our origins. Growing from one organism into an entirely different one seems like science-fiction, yet a butterfly exists and it comes from a caterpillar. I will say I don’t know the truth about humans evolving from apes millions of years ago, to me, it seems highly improbable. But I am not saying that evolution doesn’t exist. Science and all its sensibility proves evolution to be a reality. So, any Christian fundamentalists out there espousing the falsification of evolution are speaking on behalf of belief and not proof. This is where I take both sides of the argument regarding evolution and creationism, and accept both theories as possible. To a certain extent there must be some kind of High Intelligence at work who created life forms on this planet (pun intended). Use whatever name you’d like: God, Aliens, Spirit, etc. I find it highly doubtful that creation was all just mere accident, as science would like us to believe. If this was the case and we are all here by mere coincidence, there is really no point in life, and thus the evolution of consciousness would not exist. Fortunately,"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 66 our consciousness is evolving and technology is one small but huge example of our own revolutionary conscious evolution. Our intelligence has evolved to a point where we are capable of flying into the cosmos and we’re exploring the vast realities of the known universe. I would call this a serious form of evolution just within our own consciousness. I can only offer theories that are in circulation around the globe, regarding the origins of the Homo sapiens, meaning “wise-humanoid.” The theories I’m about to explain to you are certainly not new, or the only theories, and they could be erroneous. However, it is information that has been imbedded in our ancient mythology across the world for thousands of years. Babylonian Myth In the Babylonian-Sumerian creation myth, dating back to 5000 BC, a group of beings came from space and were called the Anunnaki, meaning “Those who from heaven came to earth.” Two of these beings were brothers named Enlil (lord of air) and Enki (lord of earth) Lord = High Priest. According to this myth the two brothers created the human species using genetic manipulation (something we humans are recently stumbling upon). This new species was possibly a hybrid race, crossing the DNA of early hominids (Homo erectus and/or Neanderthals) who roamed the earth at the time, and the Anunnaki extraterrestrial DNA, to create an intelligent species called Man. According to the myth, we were created to be a slave species who would mine the earth for the Anunnaki. Fortunately Enki, the God of wisdom and magic, considered by some to be an alchemist, took pity upon this new species of man and decided to teach them the secrets of love and mating. Because of this defiance, Enlil (the jealous brother) created great deluges to punish mankind for this act of constant love-making, mating and reproduction, by sending drought, famine, and plague to wipe out the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 67 human race. Enki rivals this by teaching mankind the knowledge of irrigation, granaries, and medicine. Following that an infuriated Enlil planned to wipe out humanity by means of a great flood. However, Enki warns some humans about the impending flood and instructs them to build a boa t and fill it with the animals of the earth. Sound like Noah and his Ark?? Thanks to Enki, the human species survived the cataclysm and began new civilizations. This High Priest-Lord of the Earth, taught humanity about medicine, magic, love, and civilization. Keep this story in mind throughout the book when referring to the knowledge of medicine, plants, and spirituality. In order to describe this knowledge we use the word shamanism. So simply put, according to the Babylonian myth, Enki was the first shaman medicine man, or High Priest. For a more detailed look into this story I recommend ancient Sumerian linguist/author Zecharia Sitchin. Also author Erich Von Daniken and his books provide valuable information related to these ancient astronauts. Egyptian Mythology Now we can look at another ancient civilization’s myth of human origins, dating back past 3000 BC. The Egyptian civilization is one of great knowledge including, astrology, medicine, spirituality, language, irrigation, art, mathematics, science, and myth. Full of such wisdom, we should be asking where and how they developed it. If we look at their religion and mythology, we can learn. According to Egyptian mythology, the king pharaohs who conquered and ruled Egypt were from the royal family bloodline of the gods. In this myth, Osiris was the first King of Egypt when his jealous brother Set killed him and then scattered the body pieces around the earth, to be collected by Isis the wife of Osiris, Osiris is later to be resurrected. Set took the throne only to be challenged by Osiris’ and Isis’ son, Horus, who would defeat Set and become the new king"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 68 and father of all pharaoh descendants. Within this drama, we have a huge clue to the puzzle. Pharaohs considered themselves to be direct descendants from the gods, and having royal blood meant having the right to rule. These gods were considered more than human, thus a god. But they gave birth to the human species, and passed on their knowledge to help the Egyptian civilization grow and prosper. I can barely discuss Egypt without talking about the pyramids of Giza. Created with absolute mathematical precision, and astrological codes, the creators of these monuments were anything but uneducated mas ons. With such profound advanced knowledge of: the stars and astrology, mathematics including the golden ratio and pi, building construction, and some unknown form of technology capable of moving hundred ton stones into place, we have to consider that these gods of Egyptian religion helped construct the great civilization of Egypt and the monuments found there. The Sphinx is a wonder that is still being debated over when it was built. Some say it was constructed during the height of Egyptian civilization around 2500 BC, others claim it was built possibly 10,000 or more years ago. So, we are still trying to figure out just how, when, and why these mysterious monuments were erected and who is responsible for them. The key point to remember here is that Humanity and Civilization were handed down to Egypt by gods from the stars/heavens. Egyptian monuments, such as the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid will be discussed in further detail later in this book, during the chapter on Ancient Monuments. Biblical Mythology Without ruling out the Bible as an ancient document with a description of our origins, let’s look at its explanations. In the very first book of the Bible, Genesis, we read the origin tale and the Garden of Eden. This Old Testament myth includes a psychedelic fruit,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 69 knowledge and wisdom, and the origins of human kind. Pay attention to these references of shamanism throughout the Bible story. Without pointing out the numerous contradictions found in the modern Holy Bible, I will just point out a few in this section. In the first chapter Genesis we find a chronological timeline of creation: The first day of creation God separated light and darkness. The second day he separated the sky and the earth. The third day he separated water on earth to create land and sea, then commanded that the earth produce all kinds of plants, those that bear fruits and grains, and God was pleased with what he created. On the fourth day God then created the Sun and Moon to separate and give light to the day and night- somehow after he had already separated the light from the darkness on the first day. Then on the fifth day God filled the waters with many kinds of living beings, and filled the air with birds. Then God created all kinds of animal life, domestic and wild, large and small. Notice here the chronological order of events. God has supposedly already created animals and birds, before the creation of humankind. But then on the sixth day God decides to create man, after he has already created animals and birds. Remember this. Genesis 1:26-28- Then God said, “And now We will make human beings; they will be like Us and resemble Us. They will have power over the fish, the birds, and all animals, domestic and wild, large and small.” So God created human beings, making them to be like himself. He created them male and female, blessed them and said, “Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control.”- 22 Genesis 1:29- “ I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 70 eat.” -23 Genesis 1:31- God looked at everything he had made, and he was very pleased. - 24 First of all who was God talking to when he said, “ And now WE will make human beings and they will be like US and resemble US. ”?????-22 Clearly there is someone else there, indicating a group of gods that must look like humans. Second off, everything God made pleased him including the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. Next, we look at the garden. Garden of Eden After the seventh day of rest, God had created the entire universe according to Genesis 2:1-4. Keeping in mind the chronological order of events, the Bible contradicts itself again saying: Genesis 2:5- there was no plants on the earth and no seeds had sprouted, because he had not sent any rain, and there was no one to cultivate the land .- 25 This says after the universe had been created and the 3 rd day had already passed when God previously created plants with fruit upon the earth, but after the first 7 days had passed he then decides to send rain to grow plants contradicting the timeline. Genesis 2:8-9, Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the East and there he put the man he had formed. He made all kinds of beautiful trees grow there and produce good fruit. In the middle of the garden stood the tree that gives life and the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 71 bad.- 26 Notice the importance of these two verses when God created all kinds of tree that produce GOOD FRUIT, never does it mention a tree that produces bad fruit . Then he creates the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life, to me these sound like very important trees that mankind should know about, the names are dead giveaways. Let’s take a look at these trees in more depth. Genesis 2:15-17, Then the Lord God placed man in the Garden of Eden to cultivate it and guard it. He told him, “You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. You must not eat the fruit of that tree; if you do, you will DIE the same day.”- 27 This is another contradiction because it is an example of the Church’s version of ‘the Lord’ deliberately lying to the humans as we will see later on. After the first week had passed and God had already made male and female on the 6 th day, previously creating animals and birds on the 5 th day, the timeline then contradicts itself again: claiming that after God placed man in the garden of Eden and told him not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, he then decides to create animals and birds after man was created so that man would have a suitable companion, then God brings all these creatures to the man to see what he would name them. However the timeline explained that God already had created the animals before he made man. Unfortunately the animals that he made were not suitable companions to help man. Then, we glimpse a bit of ancient genetic manipulation. The scientist that God is, took a rib from the man, using man’s DNA to create a female. But remember that the timeline claims female and male were both created on the 6 th day, contradicting itself explaining creation out of order."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 72 The Wise Serpent and Forbidden Fruit Genesis 3:1-7 Now the serpent was the most cunning animal that the Lord God had made. The serpent asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any tree in the garden?” “We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,” the woman answered, except the tree in the middle of it. God told us not to eat the fruit of that tree or even touch it; if we do, we will die.” The serpent replied, “That’s not true; you will not die. God said that because he knows that when you eat it, you will be like God and know what is good and bad.” The woman saw how beautiful the tree was and how good its fruit would be to eat, and she thought how wonderful it would be to become wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he also ate it. As soon as they had eaten it, they were given understanding... - 28 In these passages of the Genesis we learn that the serpent was one of the wisest creatures God had made, and that he tells Eve the Truth about the Forbidden Fruit-that she will surely not die but instead would become like God and gain wisdom . Here we all must ask who the serpent is, and who is this version of a jealous god? We see a God who deliberately lies to the humans in order to prevent them from becoming enlightened and gaining knowledge that will make the humans godly. For what ridiculous reason would a loving version of God want to withhold knowledge of Truth?? The serpent tells the truth because he is wise. He shares his wisdom with the woman which is out of knowledge of the truth . The humans eat some kind of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 73 fruit that alters their consciousness and they become like God . In other words, they take a substance that gives them heavenly vision and insight into a new mystical and spiritual reality. Sounds to me like our modern understanding of shamanism. The Forbidden Fruit is clearly a psychedelic agent, whether it is the psilocybin mushroom, the amanita muscaria mushroom, or some other herbal plant with psychoactive ingredients in it, we can collectively admit this story is talking about something that grows on the earth that alters our consciousness and changes our perspective while giving us knowledge. It is rather ironic that the story of the psychedelic fruit in the garden of Eden follows immediately after the creation of mankind upon the Earth. And, another point is that the Church’s version of God eventually punishes mankind for taking and eating the fruit, by kicking him out of the Garden of Eden. Here we have the origins of the man-made concept: sin. However, it is extremely dangerous and important to realize who brought sin into existence, within this myth. Did man create sin by eating from the tree or did the Church’s version of God create sin to justify his tricking the humans not to eat the fruit or else they would die (which they did not die)? In this story, God seems more cunning than the serpent, because he is the one who tricks the humans into believing him, but deliberately lies in order to prevent the humans from gaining knowledge. The wise serpent just tells the truth knowing there isn’t much gain in it for him, other than passing on spiritual knowledge about the psychedelic fruit. Considering this research provides some evidence in the Genesis myth about the connection of the origins of modern humanity as a result of the use of altered states of consciousness. We are handed down blatant clues to the truth about our origins and what spawned our spiritual understandings. Through these myths, we can better understand ourselves and the current state of humanity. Simply put, the Genesis story"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 74 with its creation of the universe and mankind, then eating the Forbidden Fruit is directly linked to shamanism as an evolutionary catalyst for modern humanity. But remember, who tells the story? Shaman - The Medicine Man The shaman is a key figure in human history. We find that the shaman was the first form of a priest, doctor, musician, artist, and healer. Perhaps you are not familiar with the practice of shamanism, in which case I hope this section will give you a better understanding. Shamanism was the very first form of religion, spirituality, and medicine. Long before Judeo- Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Catholicism, etc, shamanism was our very first connection to the spirit realms and the plant life. Without being an actual organized religion, shamanism instead is a practice of different techniques used to alter human consciousness in order to access the spirits. Without being an organized institution such as the modern religions of today full of doctrine and dogma, instead it was a form of certain knowledge pertaining to an individual experience that is common to all human beings, past, future, or present. The shaman has knowledge of nature and the plants she produces. Which plants are spiritual, which plants are medicinal, which plants are aphrodisiacs, which plants alter our consciousness. The shaman uses the plants, herbs, and fungi of the earth for these purposes. They also make use of music while ingesting entheogens to enhance the visions of the spiritual journey. We will be discussing some of the key plants, fungi, and herbs used by the shaman in the next chapter. Eucharist Placebo So, if shamanism is not a religion, instead it is certain body of knowledge related to altered states of"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 75 consciousness, then we can see how different it is from modern religions that include the Eucharist with its symbolic eating bread and drinking wine to symbolize Christ’s body and blood. The interesting thing about this placebo mystical experience is that humans don’t have anything happen to their consciousness when they eat the churches version of “Christ’s body”, because it is symbolic of something else . The only thing that happens to the consciousness of a person who participates in Eucharist at Church is they become obedient fearful worshipers to their God and his overlords priests, bishops, cardinals, and popes. This is the complete opposite of what shamanism represents. When the shaman eats the Forbidden Fruit, or the sacred plant entheogen: (Generate-God-Within), something does happen to their consciousness and they experience a true mystical state of mind, transcending anything that would result from a mere eating of ordinary bread. Now I must ask, why would the Church condemn those who experiment with this certain shamanic knowledge to be heretics, if it wasn’t something that threatened the Church’s survival? Why would eating something that gives you a mystical experience of the divine, and direct knowledge from the plants of the Nature Goddess, scare the Church so much that they would need to kill millions of human beings in the name of their Christian God??? The Witch trials are but one small example of the utter disgusting brutality of the Church. Witches are considered to be shamans themselves. They use herbs and plants to alter their consciousness and fly through the astral realm on their magical broom sticks while their body lie motionless on a bed at home since it is their consciousness that is doing the flying. Paganism is a nature bound religion, worshiping and understanding that humans are a representation of Mother Nature herself. This, too, is considered heretical knowledge according to the Church. Basically anything that is not taught by the Church is considered WRONG, and heretical or worse yet, as the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 76 fear inducing term- Satanic. The Church uses scare tactics and Fear to rule over their very obedient followers who choose not to think for themselves but instead believe everything the church preaches. They also believe what the church condemns to be evil, without having any truthful knowledge over the subject matter. I apologize if I offend you with this material but it is more than obvious . If you don’t want to consider asking these questions, perhaps you prefer the bliss of ignorance. Remember, the story about Jesus Christ, is that he was a revolutionary. That’s exactly what the Church doesn’t want, someone waking people up and starting to change things from their current paradigm into something BETTER . Thus destroying the Church and the power it has over Earth-bound humans. It is after all the Church which tells the Bible’s version of what happened in the Garden of Eden. Why would they create a jealous God that lies to the humans in order to prevent them from eating the True Eucharist? Maybe, those men in power within the Church had the knowledge of shamanism but instead of using it to heal humanity they used it for their own greedy evil ways and prevented anyone else from knowing the truth about human spirituality and its origins. Without condemning those heretics over the hundreds of years who hold this knowledge, anyone could practice what our first ancestors practiced and truly experience God for themselves. This would mean no power for the Church. Thus, I hope you can see what I am getting at here: The only power the Church has, is the result of it’s followers and their faith that the Church is telling them the TRUTH . But, if this information is accurate, we learn that the Church does anything but tell its followers the Truth . It is not wrong of me to mention here, the billions of dollars invested by the Catholic Church to COVERUP the molestation issue with their priests and little children.

The Entheogens used by our ancestors are one of the first forms of a technology that are capable of allowing access to other dimensions through the medium of consciousness. They act as a Stargate, if you will, taking the consciousness of the voyager through the veil into an entirely new alien dimension. We will discuss forms of technology in a later chapter, however, this section is designed to teach you about the natural entheogens. I am choosing to focus on specific plants and fungi in particular, mainly because the ones I’ll be discussing with you are the key to this book. With the abundant amount of information in circulation around the globe regarding these psychedelic plants, knowledge is available to us now much more so than in previous centuries. You will find that different cultures make use of different plants and fungi. Indeed, across the entire world, we find examples of psychedelic plant use. From the mushroom munching tribes of Central America, to the ayahuasca-brew ingesting villages found in the Amazon Rainforest, to the cannabis smoking college students all across the world, to the herbal using witches who were burned at the stake during the Catholic Inquisition, and the Peyote Religions of Native American Indians, we can clearly see that this phenomena is a part of human culture, whether we like it or not. And, it is more than obvious who doesn’t like it. Usually those who are willing to kill in order to suppress the information, namely the Totalitarian Church & State. In non-industrialized societies around the world,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 80 people have developed a sacred relationship with hallucinogenic plants which they consider to be- Plants of the Gods, Food of the Gods, and even Flesh of the Gods. Any food source that had a profound effect on the mind and body of the user, giving way to healing visions, voices, and rebirth scenarios, would certainly not be considered evil. Only a Western Civilization overwhelmed by an Industrial Revolution and a Totalitarian religion would pass nature’s most prized gifts off as heretical or evil. In fact, in most cases, before shamanism was even known about in our society, the first few anthropologists that documented the use of these plants among tribal cultures, actually condemned the shamans and people who ingested the plant as being possessed by the ignorant Christian version of the devil. Without ever experiencing it for themselves, these anthropologists arrived at a premature notion that these tribal people were dealing with evil spirits. Simply because the Westerners were conditioned by their Christian society to believe that anything not affiliated with the Church was heretical or evil. Over many millennia these plants and fungi have been used for sacred purposes. Much older than the story of Jesus or Buddha, some consider that these plants were our very first spiritual teachers. As of only the last century, 1900-2000 AD, has Western society been able to consider the knowledge of shamanism and its plant allies. Still our industrialized civilization does not approve of natural plants that can be used for such purposes as healing, spirituality, or medicine, for the simple reason that the Pharmaceutical Companies cannot profit off a plant that can be grown naturally. What these companies do is they take an already existing plant and they alter its chemical structure so that they can put a patent on their “ invention ”, which by the way most typically, just treats the symptoms of disease instead of curing the disease altogether. This way, they are assured financial profit from us because we continue to buy their altered medicine only to prolong or cover up our"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 81 sickness and never truly heal it. These companies cannot put a patent on an already occurring substance found in natural growing plants or fungi, because who can claim ownership of this?? I will be getting into the actual experiences provided by these entheogens; however it is necessary to identify some of these specific plant/fungi in order to continue with the experiences that follow ingestion. At the start of the list we find the magical mushrooms/fungi. There are several different species of mushrooms, but, for the purpose here, I will only include the two that are relevant, Psilocybe and Amanita muscaria. If you are already familiar with these f ungi, this will be a good review. If not, you are about to learn sacred knowledge. Little Flowers of the Gods The psilocybin fungi appear as a small golden- brown mushroom cap resting on top of a beige colored stem that bruises blue when touched. The home of this fungus is typically the dung piles left behind from grazing cattle in grassland habitats. Somehow tiny invisible spores spread themselves from previous psilocybin mushrooms and land in these poo piles. Eventually, the spores mix in with their new home and create mycelium, a loose network of the delicate filaments that form the body of a fungus. Once the mycelium is ready, the poo pile will give birth to tiny little pin heads that eventually grow into the mushrooms. If we can paint a picture in our minds: It’s a warm summer’s day, in a grassland that is home to large animals such as cattle. Walking through the field, we notice a small round thing growing out of a pile of shit on the wet grassy surface, not a very appetizing appearance, however, we are hungry and there is not much else to eat that is close by. We pluck the small flower from its home. Look at it and decide whether or"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 82 not we want to digest it. It looks good enough, so we put it in our mouth and chew the acrid tasting substance. We don’t think much of it, and we walk away certainly not expecting to have a full blown psychedelic voyage. This could be a scenario of how our ancient ancestors more than likely stumbled upon the knowledge of entheogenic mushrooms thousands of years ago. It could have been a mere accident that we discovered them, but, once we did, we were never the same again. Instantly, after the discovery of this hallucinogenic fruit, we began to implement it into spiritual, medicinal, and psychological understanding. Possibly, before we could even communicate with each other using language, the psilocybin fungi may have induced glossolalia, a sort of spontaneous form of speech resulting from the voice of the participator. The birth of language could be a result of humanities use of such fungi. I’m not saying this is fact, but there really isn’t much else evidence about how humanity started to use language, thus this is a probable scenario. Terence McKenna To use a relevant quote from the brilliant shamanic-linguistic, the late Terence McKenna, 1946- 2000, in one of his books titled, Food of the Gods: The search for the original tree of knowledge , page 53 under the title of Catalyzing Consciousness we read: “ Psilocybin specifically activates the areas of the brain concerned with processing signals. A common occurrence with psilocybin intoxication is spontaneous outbursts of poetry and other vocal activity such as speaking in tongues, though in a manner distinct from ordinary glossolalia. In cultures with a tradition of mushroom use, these phenomena have given rise to the notion of discourse with spirit doctors and"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 83 supernatural allies. Researchers familiar with the territory agree that psilocybin has a profoundly catalytic effect on the linguistic impulse . Once activities involving syntactic self- expression were established habits among early human beings, the continued evolution of language in environments where mushrooms were scarce or unavailable permitted a tendency toward the expression and emergence of the ego. If the ego is not regularly and repeatedly dissolved in the unbounded hyperspace of the Transcendental Other, there will always be slow drift away from the sense of self as part of nature’s larger whole. The ultimate consequence of this drift is the fatal ennui that now permeates Western civilization .”-29 As Terence so eloquently put it, if the human ego is not “repeatedly dissolved” it will lead to a “slow drift away from the sense of self as part of nature’s larger whole”. If a simple mushroom dissolves our ego in the “unbounded hyperspace of the Transcendental Other”, then perhaps it is exactly what was needed for our evolution in the past, and the evolution needed now, during the present, in order to change the direction of the future. If something in nature can connect us back to nature herself, then let us learn about it collectively during this time in human history. We are now in desperate need of breaking away from the current patterns of materialism and ego bound societies that have brought war and destruction to our planet. If, as Terence explains, we have a chance to directly experience the sense of self as part of nature’s larger whole, then we should investigate and research this possibility for any truth it may have. I highly recommend Terence McKenna and his work to anyone"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 84 who reads this manuscript who may have a further interest. He provides in-depth research regarding the shamanic use of plants and fungi. He was a wonderful loving human being who brought experiential knowledge to the public of westernized society. With such a brilliant intelligence, Terence explains his shamanic wisdom in a very poetic and mind opening fashion. Another quote from McKenna’s Food of the Gods , explains the importance of this knowledge resulting from hallucinogenic fungi. Under the title Shamanism as Social Catalyst , we read: “ And at its fullest, shamanism is not simply religion, it is a dynamic connection into the totality of life on the planet. If, as suggested earlier, hallucinogens operate in the natural environment as message-bearing molecules, exopheromones, then the relationship between primate and hallucinogenic plant signifies a transfer of information from one species to another. The benefits to the mushroom arise out of the hominid domestication of cattle and hence the expansion of the niche occupied by the mushroom. Where plant hallucinogens do not occur, cultural innovation occurs very slowly, if at all, but we have seen that in the presence of hallucinogens a culture is regularly introduced to ever more novel information, sensory input, and behavior and thus is moved to higher and higher states of self-reflection. The shamans are the vanguard of this creative dance .”-30 So, the point I would like to make here is the transfer of information from the fungi to the hominids, as explained above. What kind of information are we"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 85 talking about here? Clearly it is spiritual, mystical, and often enough visual/auditory information. Remember earlier on in the chapter about spirituality, I mentioned briefly the accounts in the Bible, of divine visions, voices in the head, healings, and angel/demon spirit encounters probably resulting from some kind of catalyst more than likely hallucinogenic in nature, perhaps the psilocybin mushrooms. Indeed, we can consider the Forbidden Fruit found in the Garden of Eden as being the mushroom itself. Fitting the criteria, like a key in a lock, the mushroom has consciousness altering abilities that transfers knowledge of good and bad to the users. The very word EnTheoGen used to describe these fungi means to “generate the god within you”, exactly matching the explanation of the Forbidden Fruit as described by the wise serpent. Coincidence?? Teonanacatl’s Experience The experience a human has under the mushroom is one of almost unexplainable ecstatic phenomena. When we ingest Teonanacatl-“God’s Flesh” another name given to the psilocybin mushroom by the natives of Mexico, we don’t recognize any initial differences in our consciousness, until the fungi reach our digestive system and enter our blood stream. Roughly 15 to 45 minutes after ingestion the human will certainly feel different. The onset of the experience tends to give the participant sweaty palms, and the sensation of some new perspective of thinking that one does not typically have on a regular day. This new perspective may include in-depth analysis regarding the material reality that surrounds the person, immediate objects, people, external stimuli, all seem to take on a new meaning and appearance. For example: If a person takes the entheogen in nature, with trees, grass and animal life surrounding them, they may begin to penetrate the very essence of what they are viewing to be full of life and spirit . At the right dosage, the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 86 mushroom will provide a visual display of colors, geometric shapes, and occasionally the sight of faces or beings, all overlaying the material reality as an ether- ghostly presence. The person’s thoughts will be consistently loud, almost sounding like a voice from someone or something else while remaining to be translated through the individual’s own inner voice. So, it seems as if this is our own voice , but the information- thought material being provided is absolutely alien to the virgin psychedelic voyager. The thoughts are almost forced into our psyche during the experience at an overwhelming rate that cannot easily be decoded unless the individual is experienced and prepared for it. Thus, we have shamans who are well versed in this state of consciousness, that provide the ordinary person with understanding about what they’ve seen/heard during the visions and encounters. The experience itself may last 3-8 hours depending on the dosage taken. After the climactic peak of visions dissipates, the participant will slowly come down from their heavenly flight of soul. At the end of the whole ordeal, the person is never the same again. How can you remain who you were, once you have learned of directly-divine truth regarding yourself and the nature of the universe you live in? In most cases the person reevaluates the path they are walking in life, spiritual, psychological, and philosophical, in order to make any changes required. It brings up buried emotions, memories, and current situations, regarding the person’s life, and it gives us an opportunity to view ourselves from an entirely different perspective than what we normally associate with- our ego. This new perspective is much more wholesome, nourishing, and beneficial to the human because, as McKenna explained, it dissolves the ego and connects us with nature’s larger whole. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 87 Presents under the Christmas Tree Indeed the Christmas holiday that we all have come to know, is a direct representation of shamanism and the gnosis of a different kind of hallucinogenic fungi called Amanita muscaria . This specific mushroom can be found all around the world in Christmas post cards and holiday art work especially. A. muscaria is one explanation for why the colors of Christmas are green, red, and white. You will see how this is the case in the coming sentences. It is also considered by some to be The Holy Grail as I will describe later on. The Amanita muscaria when fully grown is the mushroom with a brilliant red cap poke-a-doted with white spots, resting on top of a white stem. Thus the resemblance to red and white colored Christmas presents found under the green coniferous tree, which is the home to this species of fungi. In the book titled, Astrotheology and Shamanism, authors Jan Irvin and Andrew Rutajit present a very detailed and thoroughly researched investigation into the ancient mysteries of star worship/knowledge, shamanism, and myths regarding the mushrooms, gods, and fertility cults. They have gathered the material of their book and created a video documentary called The Pharmacratic Inquisition summarizing the information of their book into about a 2 hour lesson. Please watch it for further research and explanations. In this book, Andrew and Jan highlight the Amanita muscaria mushroom and its connection to the Christmas holiday/Christi an mythology. Under the section title- Which came first-the mushroom or the spore? : “ The Christmas tree is not just a symbol for eternal life, which is what many Christian children are told. It is literally the Tree of Knowledge from the Garden of Eden.” “The Amanita is the fruit of this Tree of Knowledge/Life"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 88 because neither the A. muscaria nor the Amanita pantherina can grow without a tree as their host. The A. muscaria mushrooms flourish under pine trees and other coniferous trees such as spruce, larch, cedar, and fir. Also, they flourish under betula trees such as Birch. These trees remain undisturbed summer and winter. ”-31 “ One thing often seen when mushroom hunting is something that resembles small white stones near the Amanita flushes. These small white stones are actually more Amanita mushrooms that are in the egg stage of the growth cycle. They too, are the mushrooms, although they have yet to spring up out of the ground. The first time that we can really see (in nature) the mushroom in its first stage of growth-a small white stone .” -32 Could these small white stones be the infamous philosophers stone? If we read on what follows the above paragraph, the authors include a Bible passage: Thomas 19: Blessed is he who came into being before he came into being. If you become my disciples and listen to my words, these stones will minister to you. For there are five trees for you in Paradise which remain undisturbed summer and winter and whose leaves do not fall. Whoever becomes acquainted with them will not experience death. -33 Revelation 2:17, “ To those who win the victory I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give each of them a white stone on which is written a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it.” - 34"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 89 Clearly the trees described here match perfectly with those trees that give birth to the fruit of the mushroom, the coniferous Christmas Tree. It also clearly states that the stones will minister to you and that if you acquaint yourself with them, you will not experience death. Is this not what the mushroom does to the person ingesting them? Another interesting fact Irvin and Rutajit present in their book, Astrotheology and Shamanism : “ Mycelia, having more connections than the human brain, are interesting because the argument exists that these mushrooms contain information (or have a memory). When these mushrooms are ingested, it could be suggested that the data contained within these mushrooms is transferred to the user. Many people who have eaten psilocybin mushrooms acknowledge that the mushroom actually speaks to them .”- 35 The entire growth cycle of the Amanita muscaria , can be interpreted into myths. The first stage we cannot witness with our eyes, the tiny spores penetrate the mycelium almost like the soul entering the human embryo. The next phase is the birth of an egg- looking white stone, almost paralleling the birth of the ego. Andrew and Jan point out the relationship between the words “egg” and “ego”, ego deriving from the word egg. We shall continue to evaluate the mystery of the rest of the mushrooms growth cycle, however, now we should look at the significance of the egg in modern myths. Easter Eggs Of course most westerners are familiar with the Easter egg hunt, or at least the image of an Easter bunny who has the Easter eggs. Here we will read another"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 90 passage from Astrotheology and Shamanism that combines two relevant myths, the Easter bunny and the mushroom gnomes. “The gnome is often associated with the mushroom and the hare with eggs (and mushrooms as well). It seems odd not to question why we use a rabbit to symbolize eggs at Easter when rabbits do not lay eggs. Even stranger still would be to not question why we include eggs in the Easter celebration.” “The Tradition of Easter egg hunting found its way into modern times because our ancestors provided their children with baskets and sent them into the woods to look underneath the trees and shrubbery for the sacred sacrament: the often egg- shaped mushroom used in many tribal rituals.”- 36 If we consider the gnome relationship with mushrooms for just a second, and if we observe the similarities in their appearances, we could very well arrive at the conclusion that the gnome-with his mushroom cap-shaped hat, and long white beard underneath-could possibly represents the mushroom itself. A sort of anthropomorphism. However, I’m going to stretch it even further and say that the small being that the gnome is, he could represent the little elflike entities frequently encountered by humans who ingest the right amount of fungi. As Terence McKenna refers to them, they are the: “self-transforming machine elves”. Clearly the gnome is a mythological entity that is thought to exist only in fairy tales, but what if this entity was actually discovered by some hallucinating human and then was explained through myth as a simple way of revealing its existence? What better way to teach the world about something than through worldwide myths that encompass a public society who has little knowledge of the suppressed information being"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 91 described here? Speaking of spreading truth through apparently fabricated myth, legend or religion, lets now take a look at the rest of the Amanita muscaria growth cycle and see how it can be considered The Holy Grail . The Holy Grail In the current year 2007, most people around the globe have become acquainted with some form of a concept regarding The Holy Grail. After the release of Dan Brown’s novel The DaVinci Code, (then turned into a hit movie starring Tom Hanks), the world has started to really contemplate what this holy grail actually is. Of course The DaVinci Code suggests that the grail could be a bloodline from the Christian savior, Jesus Christ and his wife Mary Magdalene. And, I am not saying this isn’t the case, because anything is a possibility. I just find the next suggestion on what The Holy Grail actually is, to be more attainable, and more believable, considering the connections. Once the egg stage of the growth cycle is completed the mushroom will go through a phase of becoming erect. The head of the mushroom keeps growing and eventually breaks away from the thin veil attached from the stem. (It is suggested by some, that this is the source of the male circumcision ritual.) Once the cap of the mushroom has broken the veil and it begins to expand and grow upward, the edges start to reach toward the sun. “ The Amanita will continue to grow upward, flattening itself into a small table. One may wish to keep in mind that the Knights of the Round Table were the keepers and protectors of the Holy Grail. From the table stage of the mushroom, the cap continues to upturn and the cap becomes somewhat of a cup or a chalice and will often hold the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 92 morning dew. When the morning dew collects in the cup of the upturned mushroom cap, some of the psychedelic substances are drawn out of the mushroom and into the water. Consequently, the water is colored red, like blood. The bright red pigments originates in the mushroom’s cap and “bleeds into” the water. This will fade the mushroom from a bright red into an orange-like or golden cup. Although the psychedelic effects would not be as intense as a belly-full of mushrooms, one could literally take this golden, chalice-shaped mushroom from nature and drink the blood of ‘Jesus’ from the Holy Grail.”- 37 So, here we see, the obvious representation of a golden grail that holds the blood of Christ, and when you drink of it, your mind is filled with Christ Consciousness. To provide even more connecting evidence; if we superimpose the final stages of the mushroom during its grail phase with the crucified image of Jesus, we can witness the connections for ourselves. The white spots on the red cap of the mushroom look like thorns sticking out like a crown around the cup. The outsides of the cap are turned upward like the arms of Jesus, and the stem is his legs hanging on the middle pillar of the cross. It’s a rather blatant image that we may have never considered, with all the hype about Jesus’ bloodline being The Holy Grail. The connections made in this mushroom grail story, are far more digestible, no pun intended, with the relationship to what is included in the Tale of the Holy Grail. This tale includes a golden cup, Christ’s blood, and a Round Table of Knights (shamans) who protect the secrets of this Holy Grail. Within the Bloodline version of the Holy Grail, we don’t find these clues to be self evident as in the mushroom version. However I will"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 93 agree that the cup could represent the womb to the mother (Mary) of Christ’s children, and that the blood of Christ could be the “bloodline” of Christ. And, perhaps there did exist Knights that guarded this secret, but what about the golden color of the cup? Obviously this myth can be interpreted in many different ways, but still the mushroom version and the other theories in circulation still hold sway to the possible meaning of The Holy Grail. For further information regarding the myths, legends, and research about the Amanita muscaria mushroom, I suggest Jan and Andrew’s book Astrotheology and Shamanism , and James Arthur and his book Mushrooms and Mankind. The story of Santa being a version of a shaman- coming through the chimneys of the tribe members houses, with a bag full of Amanita muscaria on the eve of December 25 th , the Winter Solstice celebration to witness the birth of the new “Sun of God”, can be found on (www.gnosticmedia.com). Plant Allies The shaman will typically have certain plant allies, that he works with in his practices. The mushrooms discussed above are two versions of this; however, there are hundreds of different plants used by shamans. Various shamanic plants and herbs include: Cannabis, Hashish, Tobacco, Datura, Iboga, Opium, Salvia Divanorum, Peyote (mescaline), San Pedro, Ayahuasca, DMT, Syrian Rue, Kava kava, Sage, Mandrake, and Ergot (LSD). The list goes on and on, as I have only touched on key shamanic plants most of which contain some form of psycho- activity. With numerous plants that grow naturally in the wild, these seemed to be significant enough that shamans discovered and used them thousands of years ago and continue to use them.

That which has remained untainted Truth lasting for thousands of years. Perhaps, we should acknowledge Western civilization’s arrogant history of deeming these plants and their users as heretical. Then again, ignorance is bliss, a painfully stubborn ecstasy. However, if we, as a representation of Western civilization, do step up and apologize for our selfish conquering attitudes, our arrogant justifications, and our hypocritical history, then we may, indeed, have a chance to learn, evolve, and expand our collective consciousness into a peaceful explorer of the inner dimensions of space, full of life and alien beings, that has been so eloquently mastered and taught by the shamans throughout the ages. This is known as the Human Birthright ! Consciousness is our birthright, and no law passed in Congress or the Vatican can take that away from us. True Freedom, (ironically “freedom” is the driving force in the War on Terror and the War on Drugs), but true Freedom absolutely includes our freedom to explore our Spirits=Souls=Consciousness. Who has the right to strip your ‘conscious decision making’ or ‘birthright to consciousness’ away from you? The choice is in our hands. Only we can decide what to do with our own consciousness. So, please make a peaceful, intelligent, decision and don’t frown upon someone who chooses to do something different with their consciousness, because, after all, that is their ‘Divinely-given’ right as well. The legality of a plant should never be an issue among humans. Unfortunately, practically all of the plants listed above are under the illegal drugs category according to our United States Federal Law.

Eye balls deep in muddy waters, fucking hypocrite ”-38 If we take an intelligent, non-biased look into these plants and fungi we just might discover elements of ourselves that have been left relatively unexplored for over 2000 years. With so many predictions about the future of the world coming to an end, perhaps, the psychedelic phenomena will be the catalyst , as it was in the past, that will give birth to an evolutionary change in our consciousness that will begin the New Age of understanding the Cosmos, that we humbly live in: With Freedom to Explore!"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 97 Chapter 6 - A Reality Full of Dimensions L et’s ask the age-old philosophical question: What is reality? Well, really though, what is reality?? This chapter is designed to pull that question apart, and address the concepts that the question itself entails. Reality, as you and I perceive it, takes place in the 3 rd dimension. At least, the physical aspects of this reality take place in the 3 rd dimension. However, as I asked earlier, is our consciousness in the 3 rd dimension or multiple dimensions? Scientists are trying to prove the existence of these many varieties of dimensions, but, of course, these explanations are above the lay person’s ability to conceive. The best metaphor I’ve come across to signify what these multiple dimensions might be like, is the idea of music. After all, absolutely everything is music! The concept of music is very interesting as it cosmically surrounds us. If one were to watch the cyclical motion of the planets around the sun, one would be directly observing the cosmic effect of music. If one were to sit in silence and hear nothing but their heart beating, one would directly experience music taking place within their own body. The point I’m trying to make is: music is everywhere, in everything, and omnipotent. Or, if you wanted to say, Music is God, I wouldn‘t disagree. I will be going into more depth on the topic of music in the next chapter. With music being a metaphor for us to understand reality and the many layers of dimensions encompassing reality, we can view frequencies such as high, medium, and low, as existing collectively with each other (during a song for example) to create one piece of music, or in this case reality. I went to college for Audio Engineering and while I was there, I picked up on the Frequency Range"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 98 and the notion that each instrument has its own particular tone, timbre, and range, which makes it sound different from the rest of the instruments. Thus, the simple reason why so many different instruments exist is that they all sound slightly different. But, while I was in class, learning about the mix of a particular song and the placement of each instrument within that mix, I quickly picked up on the blending of various frequencies within a song. It’s obvious that different frequencies mesh rather well, but some do not, intending that every masterpiece and every song ever created has within it a combination of various dimensions of frequencies. To make it simple: Listen to a song. Can you hear the drums, guitars, bass, and vocals, as separate parts of the whole song? If you can, you are observing the multiple dimensions within the reality of that particular song! The average human has a designated hearing range that includes frequencies or sounds that are audible to them. Some people have the ability to hear really high pitched frequencies that someone else may not be able to hear with their ears. So, every human has unique sense perceptions . This does not stop with the sense of hearing, because it includes all of the 5 main senses: Sight, Taste, Smell, Touch, and Hearing. Everyone’s 5- sense perceptions are exceptional to themselves. In other words, one person may be able to hear something that someone else can’t, or see a vision of something that somebody else can’t see, or smell a scent that somebody else cannot smell, or taste a flavor that is undetectable by someone else, or feel something that someone else can’t. So you see, humans are individually unique in the respect that they all perceive this apparently “ same ” reality to be something completely different. You probably have a different vision of the universe than I do, and, rightly so, we should respect each other’s individuality in this sea of creation. After all, if we perceived everything to be the same as one another, what could we ever learn? "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 99 3 rd Dimension If we were to discuss the 3 rd dimension (our physical home), we should understand that perception of the same thing coming from two different states of consciousness will give us two different explanations regarding what is being perceived. The 3 rd dimension may seem like a very tangible and explainable thing. Science is trying to prove the physicality of the material reality, however, what has science discovered? They discovered that when you get to the very essence of physical objects, such as your body, the chair, your house, the earth, a rock, or anything physical, the building blocks of matter are atoms. And atoms themselves are anything but, physical. Containing probably 95% empty space, and less than 5% physical structure, scientists stumbled upon the truth that there is really not much to the foundation of physical existence, except empty space... Well, if that doesn’t blow your mind, I don’t know what will. If the 3 rd dimension is not very physical to begin with, why would other dimensions resemble this one? If we go back to music for a second and we use it as a metaphor again, the foundation of a song typically is the rhythm section, more specifically the percussion section. If you imagine the sound of a bass drum, you can pretend to notice how it drives the song along keeping time, usually always arriving on the first count of each measure. Boom- 2- 3- 4, Boom- 2- 3- 4 etc... The very sound of the bass drum reminds me of a physical object, like a thump to the chest from a fist, it can appear to be physical. But if we know the truth about the sound we are hearing, it is like 95% non- physical, the other less than 5% which may actually have an impact physically upon your body and in your ears. After all, if my hand is not a 100% physical thing, according to modern science, and it’s just a vibrational frequency with maybe less than 5% actual physicality, then why can’t a vibration caused by a bass drum"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 100 represent the same aspect of reality that my hand does? Without trying to confuse you, what I’m intending to explain is how a bass drum can be very symbolic of this 3 rd dimension. Setting a sort of foundational vibration to build other vibrations upon. Yes, the wall is there, it is real and it seems physical because if I punch my fist into it, it will without a doubt cause me physical pain. But, remember what perceives this pain? My brain is the one who tells me that it hurts, and my brain tricks me into thinking that I just had a 100% physical experience, when actually it was less than 5% physical and 95% illusion . Dimensional Entities Humans are, apparently, a 3 rd dimensional entity. We are a life-form that has a body with senses that are tuned into the 3 rd dimension. But, as we’ve learned so far, our consciousness is capable of being temporarily retuned to pick up other dimensional realms. This retuning takes place as result of chemical ingredients inside our human brains, and with the help of certain plants and fungi. The human being picks up the things in the environment around them through visual and other sensory stimulation. So, if humans are an example of this (3 rd ) dimension’s life-form, then what about the other dimensions? Angels must live in a different realm. Aliens are said to be capable of dimensional time-travel. And, even Heaven is thought to exist in a separate dimension or reality from this one. The point: We have always been entities that exist in this multidimensional reality and we will always remain entities that live in this multi-dimensional reality. Regardless of belief, conditioning, or ignorance. So, there is really not much we can do about the existence of other dimensional entities, other than be aware of them. Taking another glance at these entities I’m going to reference a book titled, A Complete Guide to Faeries & Magical Beings by Cassandra Eason."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 101 “On 10 December 1954 at a place called Chico-Cerro de las, beings no more than 4 feet tall, were reported to have landed in a Spacecraft and attacked two hunters. From France, too, came accounts of goblin-like creatures from space attacking people, mocking them and dancing around . In 1955, in one of the earliest reported direct encounters with extra-terrestrial beings in the USA, five tiny goblin-like creatures with dark, wrinkled skin, large ears and eyes were seen by a family outside their Kentucky farm. The farmer shot at one of the creatures, but the bullet fell off it with a metallic sound.”- 39 To connect these strange dimensional beings with the alien phenomena, the following quote is taken from the same page as the paragraph above. “And are fairies, especially in view of their apparent ability to fly, extra- terrestrials who were interpreted by our ancestors as nature spirits?” “Alien abductions also share characteristics with fairy kidnappings- the need to reproduce with humans, and the fact that alien abductions operate outside the material time frame. Except in the case of the noble, tall, alien Nordics, who resemble the statuesque opalescent fairies, and the entities that are usually known as greys. Greys are extra- terrestrial beings believed to be smaller than the average adult, with greyish skin pigmentation, huge oval heads, staring almond eyes and spindly limbs.

They not only share physical characteristics with goblins, but, like fairies, are often amoral, curious about humans rather than showing any empathy with them and as capable of behaving with cruelty as with kindness. Fairies have their magic rings, whilst aliens are implicated in the sudden appearance of crop circles. With both fairy and alien encounters lights may appear in the sky.”- 39 What is the point? The point is, that if a human reporting encounters with these entities is simply ‘crazy’, than we also have to consider the possibility that the humans who choose not to open their minds to the possibility of these kinds of experiences is just as ‘crazy’. ‘Crazy’ or ‘insane’ are just scapegoat terms used by ignorant individuals who can’t perceive the mystery of the universe or the mystery of their own existence. It truly makes me disappointed with the human race, that we are so quick to explain the unexplainable by means of insanity. It’s ridiculous!! Then again, there is a fine line between brilliance and insanity. If you think these people are just loonies, or crazies, I highly suggest observing your own mentality, your own understanding of the universe. Is your mind open to infinite possibilities? If it is not, then is it healthy? Near Death Experience When a person is announced that they are clinically dead, while they are away , they report visions shared by thousands of people around the world who have undergone the Near-Death experience. Now, when we understand that the pineal gland possibly releases a flood of a psychedelic chemical during physical death,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 103 namely DMT-the most powerful psychoactive chemical known to man, we can tie the near-death experience visions together with the psychedelic experienced visions. I found an interesting quote from a book titled The Custodians: Beyond Abduction by Dolores Cannon, related to these various experiences. Under the title section, The Aliens Speak : “ This is my pattern when I have a good subject capable of deep trance. I try to gather information about different topics and then later combine and compare them for validity. Thus when I asked her to describe what she was seeing after her death, I already had an idea of what I expected her to say. In the beginning her voice was sluggish and she spoke slowly.

And they are monitoring what’s going on down there in the ocean, on the continents. They are observing it. They know more. I’m learning. And they’re letting me watch. They do this because there’s another force that guides them, and they are messengers for this force. They do it to help mankind. They understand more easily.

D: Can you see what these beings look like? S: They’re dressed in white. They look white all over. And they have a round head and look shorter, like a space body. And they have bigger eyes. They’re sitting in chairs and moving things: dials and the switches. They have a big window to look out. It’s in a round circle. There’s a structure in the middle that is an orb object. Half sphere flat edge on bottom. Seemed to be supported off floor by legs. Transparent- inside a sparkling crystal seemed to be moving. Sparkling tiny pieces constantly in motion. Long tube coming from ceiling to enclose top part of sphere. Tube solid but transparent. Light (?) coming down through this. It had something to with propulsion of the ship, and it also directed cloaking device .”-40 Knowing that this is what one account of hypnotized near-death experience explained through a vision, perhaps we should observe an account of the pure DMT experience, conducted by Dr. Strassman during his government approved research, and maybe you can see the connections for yourself. From the book titled DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Dr. Rick Strassman , we find a direct example of this: During the first few minutes of his non- blind high dose of DMT, Jeremiah burst out in several exclamations: “Whoa!” “Wow!” “Incredible!” He began beaming, a huge smile across his face. He seemed to be having a great time. “It was a nursery. A high-tech nursery"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 105 with a single Gumby, three feet tall, attending me. I felt like an infant. Not a human infant, but an infant relative to the intelligences represented by the Gumby. It was aware of me, but not particularly concerned. Sort of a detached concern, like a parent would feel looking into a playpen at his one- year-old lying there. As I went into it, I heard a sound: hmmm . Then I heard two to three male voices talking. I heard one of them say, “He’s arrived.” I felt evolution occurring. These intelligences are looking over us. There is hope beyond the mess we are making for ourselves. I couldn’t change the experience at all. I couldn’t have anticipated it or even imagined it. It was a total surprise! I tried to open to love but that was silly. All I could do was observe it.”- 41 Several months later Jeremiah received his double-blind 0.4 mg/kg DMT dose. At 5 minutes he began, “That was much more intense than the first major dose. It’s a different world. Amazing instruments. Machine-type things. There was one person operating some of this stuff. I was in a big room; he was in another part of it. I feel a little shaky...a little hypersensitive...there are little tremors going through my body.” “There was a big machine in the center, with round conduits, almost writhing- not like a snake, more in a technical manner. The conduits were not open at the end. They were solid blue-gray tubes, made of plastic? The machine felt as if it was rewiring me,"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 106 reprogramming me. There was a human, as far as I could tell, standing at some type of console, taking readings or manipulating things. He was busy, at work, on the job. I observed some of the results on that machine, maybe from my brain. It was a little frightening, almost unbearably intense. It all began with a whining, whirring sound .”- 42 After reading these accounts, can you see the relationship between people’s experience of being abducted by aliens, taken upon a UFO, and the experience people have while under the psychedelic influence, encountering beings and machinery that are unexplainable to this conventional realm of reality? In my thinking, I feel, that the unexplainable phenomena of alien contact, spirit contact, or encounters with fairies, elves, etc. is directly linked to the spontaneous flood of chemical secretions within the human brain . But, for the person who is not familiar with altered-states of consciousness, or has never consciously experienced the psychedelic state, how could they explain their experience of alien contact in relation to what is experienced under the influence of psychoactive compounds? If you have never read about altered states, never experienced them, or have no interest in them, and then one day you happen to have an experience without consciously choosing to, as a result of the natural release of compounds inside your brain, how could you explain your experience in a conventional way? Star Kids as Shamans Some of you reading this may be familiar with the concept of Star Kids and Indigo Children. There is some current research circulating the globe suggesting these particular enigmatic young humans, who are capable of psychical, metaphysical, and highly shamanic abilities, are being born in large numbers within the past"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 107 100 years. Mary Rodwell, author of Awakening : How Extraterrestrial Contact Can Transform Your Life, also counselor/founder of AC ERN (Australian Close Encounter Research Network) has been working with humans from around the world who have experienced the contact phenomena, have developed amazing abilities as a result, and/or humans who are just trying to understand what happened to them and fear secular/public ridicule about such topics as alien abduction, etc., and thus chose ACERN as a safe outlet for understanding this mysterious phenomena. Mary is a wonderfully intelligent and open-minded individual who sheds light on these enigmatic subjects. Recently, I sent Mary an email asking her what she thought about the connection between Star Kids and the Shaman figures throughout history, and this was some of the response: Blake - If you are familiar with Dr. Strassman's research on the naturally occurring psychoactive chemical (DMT), perhaps you can see where I'm coming from, in wondering that perhaps star children, alien abductees, etc, are having such experiences as a result of biological neurochemical secretions possibly found in the pineal gland? Certainly the artwork and scripts that abductees and star kids often draw resembles the similar things observed by humans who underwent the clinical DMT studies, and for that matter all psychedelic art throughout history. Mary Rodwell - Yes I believe, based on my research ,that it may be that these individuals may naturally produce the hormones that 'trigger' altered states of consciousness /awareness to access this multidimensional vision. Blake - Is there a possibility that the mass sightings of UFOs around the world, and alien abduction experiences are in fact a reality which humans happen to be able to 'tune' their consciousness to, through natural neurochemical secretions of this particular psychoactive compound? Mary Rodwell - This kind of compound may be"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 108 naturally produced by the star kids but as yet as far as I am aware its not been isolated or confirmed that this may be happening. Blake - Could star kids be the new shaman figures? Mary Rodwell - Quite possibly as they seem to naturally access their multidimensional world. Blake - Something else of interest is the rise in the Earth's base frequency. I go into theories about the effect these frequencies have on our brain/consciousness and the possibility that the exponential rise in crop circles, UFO sightings, alien abductions, scientific discoveries, esoteric knowledge, metaphysical information, etc. could all be connected to our neurochemical secretions and their multidimensional abilities. (downloaded during: REM sleep, entheogenic experiences, meditation, and other various altered states) Mary Rodwell - I am sure this is precisely what is happening. There is a strong possibility that star kids do have neurochemical excretions of this psychoactive compound, beyond the average amount. This is possibly a result from either: ET/Human genetic upgrades, the frequency change of the earth, or some other as yet unknown phenomena. You can find out more about Mary Rodwell and ACERN by going to the website: www.acern.com.au Brain Procedures There is one thing I want to touch on before moving on to the next section. People who claim they have been ‘abducted by aliens’ have also claimed that medical experiments were performed on their body. One example of this would be, the forcing of a needle-like utensil into the nostril of the human abductee to place an implant inside the brain, performed by the ETs. In Mary Rodwell’s book, Awakening , she talks about an account of this happening to an individual named Simon"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 109 Chrystal, who independently explored the same ideas that I’ve been pursuing in this book. ‘His conclusion regarding this type of implant procedure is that they are put in through the nasal cavity and then into the brain, to activate the pineal gland (believed to be the main trigger for perceiving non-physical realities). Simon refers to an account in Professor John Mack’s book, “Abduction”, which he says is identical to his own, whereby ‘Catherine’ experiences a metal instrument being pushed into her nostril, inserted to about six inches and then feeling something break in her head. Simon said that this duplicated his experience exactly.’ -43 You may recall, the Egyptian use of a method for extracting a certain organ from the human brain prior/during/or after death. Perhaps this procedure in Egypt was something that I retrieved from my memory banks and regurgitated it here, however, to back this up I recently watched an interesting special based on the medical procedure called, Trepanation. Trepanation is a medical technique used in the Egyptian times and on through the ages by various cultures who understood the significance of its practice. Apparently, trepanning means to remove a portion of the skull in order to treat health problems related to intracranial diseases. Trepanation was carried out for both medical and mystical purposes. It is claimed by some people to hold a third-eye awakening power, simply by opening a hole in the skull to release unwanted pressure and/or energy. In the Mütter Museum, found in the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, one can view an entire collection of historical skulls with the remains of trepanation procedures, bored into the top portion of the human skull. So, what is the connection? Why do alien abductees claim they have had something in their brain"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 110 ‘punctured’ during the experience? Why would Ancient Egyptians practice a similar method of extracting a ‘particular’ organ at death, or open a hole in the skull for religious significance? What organ would hold such spiritual value for the Egyptians that they would practice this method? Same goes for the scenario of the alien medical experiments. Both methods (excluding Trepanation’s hole in skull method) use a utensil that is forced through the nasal cavity of the human, and both methods seem to focus on the same brain organ. If you could, hypothetically, watch a utensil being put through someone’s nose and forced into their brain, the organ that would be focused upon could be the Pineal Gland. And so, I hope you follow my reasoning here. That, perhaps, the experience that people abducted by aliens have, referring to this medical procedure, could be the ‘aliens’ decision to ‘activate’ or ‘stimulate’ the pineal gland of that human. Why? Perhaps, to open their spiritual eye? Then again, it could be a malicious act of violence, a form of physical/mental rape, with the human participant unwilling subjected to the procedure. However, as I understand it, these people have returned peacefully back to this reality, without any kind of threat or malicious hostility. In my opinion, I feel the former scenario seems more probable than just a malicious act. And, why then, did the Egyptians practice such a similar method during funerary events? Could it be merely a coincidence, that these two separate occurrences hold such similarities? Perhaps, the Egyptians picked this method up, from their own encounters with these entities? Does the extracted pineal gland serve some kind of a honorary/healing/spiritual purpose? Could it be the seat of the soul, as Descartes philosophized? Positive Energy I’d like to share a story here about a vision I had once in a dream, or a day-dream. The vision began with a young child; I think it was a 4 year old boy"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 111 approximately. The boy was walking through a wooded forest. Thick shrubbery surrounded the path that he was following. Colors like gr een and brown engulfed the scenery. The child was in a happy reality. While he walked he was playing with some toy, he eventually dropped the toy object and kneeled down to pick it up. As he took his attention away from his environment a dark negative energy, like an evil spirit, started to swarm in around the child. The darkness erased the colorful reality that the child was in seconds ago. As the child stood up, he looked the demonic entity in the eye... giggled, “Heh heh!” then turned around and walked down the path again. Immediately this dark force was sucked out of the child’s reality and back into the hell that it came from. The child’s laughter, innocence, and playfulness destroyed the life force of the “demon” and brought the peacefulness of a child’s imagination back into reality. The message: Positive energy works, so use it and watch the results. What do we know? If you have seen the documentary What The Bleep Do We Know? , the leading scientists, psychologists, philosophers, and many great minds, all provide their theories on reality and what we actually know about it. I suggest watching this if you haven’t had the chance yet, it can teach you some very positive things about yourself and human beings in general. From what I picked up on, the theme throughout the documentary is: We Create Reality with Our Thoughts. Every second of every day, humans are reality manifesting entities who project their meta-programmed concepts of reality. So the lesson is that you can manifest anything you put y our mind to. Our brains are the most powerful form of technology that we have on earth. Look what this technology has created for us so far. We have created machinery that takes us into outer space! And the technology inside of us, can in -plore, a"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 112 sort of inner space. I do suggest we research this technology further. Fortunately with the use of the internet and globalization, research on such technology is accessible to the average human being, which wasn’t available hundreds of years ago. John C. Lilly M.D. Scientist John C. Lilly (1915-2001) and his incredible mind, introduced the world to some very fascinating scientific conundrums during the 20 th century. With an education in technology, biology, and neurology, Lilly sprang upon the world the notion of stimulating the brain of a monkey with electrode shockers to repeat and/or imitate the neurological activity of a previously measured natural stimulation, in order to see if this method would control the neurological activity in the brain, thus resulting in controlling behavior through an external means. However, the baffling and frightening method of being able to control the behavior of a human came into reality once the US government took sincere interest in John’s work. Could it be coincidental that around this same time in history, the television was being heavily implanted into the houses of most Americans? John C. Lilly became a very concerned scientist that did not want the use of his newly discovered methods to be used in the wrong hands, or as a means of weaponry against the human race. Lilly’s main objective in his research was to create a scientific means through which he could further study the scientific/philosophical question about the differences between the brain/mind relationship. If, an electrical stimulation could recreate, in the neurological networking of the brain, a controlled activity, then what would explain the mind if an external electrical shock can create the identical activity? This was a true philosophical/scientific conundrum. Later on, John focused his research efforts on studying the brain/mind of dolphins and this relationship"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 113 to various consciousness implications found inside human brain/mind. The isolated flotation tank revolutionized his studies regarding the human mind. Under the influence of mind altering compounds, floating within the isolation tank, and then losing all bodily sensation, the only thing left was his suspended central nervous system and his naked human mind. These studies eventually taught the scientist particular truths regarding the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the human brain. Emphasizing the various levels or states of consciousness. John passed on his research with a cautious attitude, preventing him from sharing some of the deepest and most interesting discoveries during his research, for reasons of keeping his professional-scientific status amongst his colleagues, suspending all accusations against his mental health. He was a very smart man, John C. Lilly M.D. Programming the Human Biocomputer , is a book written by John C. Lilly, pertaining to the neurological-conditioned programs of the human being. These programs are simply just that, programs. Just like programs on the television screen, feeding that version of reality. The human mind is so fantastic and complex that it can simply change the channel in order to access a new program of reality. Whatever program is being broadcast through your consciousness, it will always remain a conditioned program. Only when one is willing to go out of one’s body in order to attain a bird’s eye view of the reality of the human situation, can one access the infinite level of consciousness which is, in reality, multidimensional and immortal! The Brainwashing of the Human Mind Often enough, the fantastic world inside of the Human Mind can become like a lost fish in the ocean of consciousness, in desperate need of a guiding path, or someone real to swim with, someone to share the reality of this life with. And with the installation of the"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 114 television into modern society, this box of circuitry has replaced the innate human desire to swim with a real someone else in the sea of consciousness. The TV has been the #1 Reality Feeder for the majority of Americans, and also, other countries around the globe. When I say ‘reality feeder’, I think of this term as a bin of food which the herd of sheep can eat from, the food in this particular feeder happens to be information and/or disinformation which the herd of humans fill their consciousness with, creating their versions of reality. When the average medium for a source of information is the television, and that information is most often disinformation, the reality being fed to the majority of these people will, without a doubt be a #1 Reality Feeder . When reality is being spoon fed to you in this manner, the Brainwashing of the Human Mind is inevitable. Fortunately, now information can be accessed more openly through the medium of the Global Matrix Mind of the World Wide Web. This new medium allows the human to choose what information one wants to put into one’s consciousness. As opposed to the previous spoon feeding method delivered through the television programs. I have yet to mention the other mediums through which most humans access information about the nature of reality , namely politics, science, and religions. These dominating systems, seemingly separate, yet remaining on the same side of the coin, are a major source of disinformation. Religions implant disinformation about the reality of the universe into the minds of the followers. Through the use of sacred art, music, and ritual, the blatant layers of dogma encompass the consciousness of the human followers to ‘believe in’ this narrow version of reality . Science dismisses the concept of spirituality, by relying on physical proof. Politics implant disinformation about the reality of the earth crisis into the minds of the nations citizens. Through the use of media coverage/manipulation, glad-hand personalities, the baffling waste of human intelligence,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 115 and the idol-worshipped behavior of these political figures, the citizens who are plugged into this version of reality actually buy into it. Brainwashed, not to see the utter hypocrisy or the infinite potential within each and every human to lead the world into a more positive reality. To question authority, to question reality, to merely contemplate existence, this is the true philosophical/spiritual endeavor that leads a human to an accurate version of Reality. Reality is simple: all humans are designed to contemplate and create their own versions of reality through the gift of the Human Mind. Foundation of Reality explained by a Comedian During this chapter we skimmed over the concept of reality, briefly touching on music as a metaphor for the explanation of Dimensions. Hopefully, you picked up on the connection I’m making between altered states of consciousness and the relationship with making contact with beings or spirits. We learned that physical reality is actually a vibrational frequency. To quote the brilliant comedian Bill Hicks: “ All matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. We are all One Consciousness, experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as Death. Life is just a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves!”- 44 I think Hicks pretty much sums up what I’m trying to explain here, through this joke he explains about a young man tripping on acid who reaches these very conclusions. Something of relevance, Bill Hicks also did a bit about his own personal UFO encounter under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms. In this bit Bill explains that: “ I have seen UFOs split the sky like a sheet...I have seen seven balls of light"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 116 come off a UFO, lead me onto their ship, explain to me telepathically that we are all one and there is no such thing as death...I laid in a field of grass for four hours going, ‘My God...I love everything.’ The heavens parted, God looked down and rained gifts of forgiveness onto my being, healing me at every level, psychically, physically, emotionally. And I realized our true nature is spirit, not body, that we are eternal beings.”- 44"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 117 Chapter 7 - Music vibration/frequency A s you have probably noticed music has been discussed throughout the chapters. I use music as a metaphor often, simply because it works so well. Whether or not you are a music fan yourself, I’m sure you can understand the important role that music plays on human emotion and our psychology. To be honest, the best cure for any lower emotional frequency is: a great song! Next time you are feeling down or bored, just play some music that you know you’ll enjoy and observe the change in your thoughts, it’s sensational. Along with being a cure, music itself is a teacher. A masterful instructor that teaches us directly about felt experience, of simply being . By listening to music, paying attention to what you are hearing, (not letting your thoughts cloud the melodies), you are in the moment. Your consciousness becomes aware of itself when recognizing the harmony, melody, rhythm, synchronicity, and emotion, which are portrayed through the music. The human brain is capable of making a logical sensibility of the sound mixture. I began playing guitar around 12-13 years old, started a band with my best friends, and initiated a musical career that continues through today. Playing music by yourself is one thing, but playing music with other people, other spirits, is entirely an unexplainable phenomena that you simply have to float along with. It’s as if you are conversing with the other musicians through the medium of the music. The conversation is between instruments; they have to get along in order to have beautiful music, because if they fight with each other the music will suffer as a result lacking the proper blend of ingredients. I can make a statement by strumming a particular chord on the guitar; let’s say “C” major. Instantaneously you will recognize the emotion"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 118 in that chord by what frequencies are blending together. A chord is a series of tones sounded together. If a chord is Major, the tones within it will be based on the Major Scale. In general, Major = Lighthearted & Minor = Somber. So if you heard a “D” Minor chord, it wouldn’t sound at all like the “C” Major chord. “D” Minor is a very serious sounding chord, compared to the playfulness of “C” Major. By being able to communicate through music, we have something positive to focus our energy on. Origin of Music What is music but a series of vibrations and frequencies? So, when did this all start? Where did the first vibrations come from? Where did the entire spectrum of frequencies come from? We can’t really say that music originated on our planet, because it is not something reserved specifically for earth, but extends itself out into the infinite cosmos. So, we could pretend that the “Big Bang” was the first frequency/vibration ever experienced in our reality. I can’t prove this of course, but I’m sure if the “Big Bang” theory is remotely accurate then we can rest assured that a vibration did occur during that first BANG!!! In the beginning was the word, and the word was Sound. Ok, so if music originated in the cosmos, Earth is a planet inside of that cosmos that just happens to have creatures that are capable of recognizing, enjoying, and participating in music, that creature is the Human Being. We are incredibly lucky to have this kind of privilege. Music is an immediate representation of what Magic really is. Magicians and musicians are interchangeable terms, because they both use their intention to manifest something within their reality. I’ve joked with a few of my friends that I occasionally feel like some kind of Wizard, when I hold a guitar, bass, or drum sticks- these remind me of the magician’s magical wand or a wizard’s staff. And what does the magician"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 119 do with his wand? They use their wand to manifest something with their Intention into reality. When did humans begin to notice music? In order for them to start creating it, they would have needed to pick it up during some distant point in history. I suggest shamanism as a root to the foundation of music and art in general. Whoever participated in shamanic initiations made use of music: tribal drumming, chanting, singing, and various instrumentations. Either as a result from the altered states of consciousness, or as a means to alter consciousness, music and shamanism will forever be linked to each other, like a pen to paper. Vibrations and Frequencies A Vibration is a repetitive periodic oscillation. An example of a vibration would be when a guitar string is plucked and the result is a sound. A waveform is a serpentine pattern. The full cycle of a waveform, includes the upper and lower halves of a 360 degree circular pattern unveiled as a serpent, called a wavelength. Frequency is the rate of the wavelength within a second of time. In other words, the frequency of the vibrating string depends on the number of times it oscillates a wavelength during a second. Our consciousness itself is a frequency. Absolutely everything has a vibration and a frequency. The planets, stars, the sun and moon, our bodies, plants, mushrooms, thoughts, and the infinite everything has a frequency. The Earth’s Heartbeat Our earth resonates at a frequency, called the Schuman Resonance named after the discoverer: German physicist Winfried Otto Schumann. “Earth's Rising Base Frequency, Earth's background base frequency, or \"heartbeat,\" (called Schumann resonance, or SR) is rising dramatically."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 120 Though it varies among geographical regions, for decades the overall measurement was 7.8 cycles per second. This was once thought to be a constant; global military communications developed on this frequency. Recent reports set the rate at over 11 cycles, and climbing. Science doesn't know why, or what to make of it.” - 45 So the heartbeat or frequency of the earth is climbing higher and higher. We live within that frequency. The frequency of our consciousness is directly affected by the change in resonance of our earth, which is being recorded during this moment in evolution. Simply put, ou r thoughts are immediately affected by the increasing heartbeat of the earth. Our human brains vibrate to the heartbeat of the earth. If this heartbeat is increasing, our brains will be stimulated by these new frequencies. Is this making sense to you? If you sit in a room that is playing beautiful music, the energy you feel will resonate to that energy. If you sit in a room that is playing a horror movie with screams of death in the air, you will feel the difference in energy being put out. If our planet is reaching a higher frequency resonation than it has previously experienced, the truth can be observed as plain as day: Our planet is undergoing a revolution, evolving from a lower vibrating frequency to a higher one. This is being proven scientifically. Even our planet is trying to “get high”!!! Vibrating the Pineal Gland Earlier we talked about parts of the human brain, including glands that secret neurotransmitter chemicals, particularly the Pineal Gland-Third Eye. The most powerful psychoactive molecule discovered by humans so far is a naturally occurring chemical found inside our brains. That chemical is the spirit molecule: DMT."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 121 When discussing vibrations, particularly the heartbeat of the earth, we can learn how it affects the stimulation of our pineal gland thus possibly creating secretions of this chemical. If the increase in this planets frequency continues, it will undoubtedly have an effect on our brains. Unfortunately after childhood, the human pineal gland begins to calcify itself and therefore by adulthood, the chemical secretions may not flow as they possibly could. This is the reason why many adults do not spontaneously enter visionary trance states on a regular basis, without some form of stimulation. As you have learned, plants and fungi work the best; however, music is one of the many methods that have always worked for the possible human decalcification of the pineal gland. If you can imagine those Tibetan monks sitting in the lotus position, chanting “Ommmmmmmmmmmmm mhhhhhhhh...” we can ask the question, what is the purpose of that? There are several reasons for chanting “omm”, including: a method to Focus Attention, the Healing Effects of Sound, a way to Praise the Divine, Conjuring Spirits, and the physical vibration of the pineal gland in order to secrete the psychedelic chemicals, thus creating mystical, healing, and positive changes in the individual who is doing the chanting. Why else would they practice this method over the centuries and include it into their spirituality? If you look at Tibetan art work or Oriental art, I’m sure you can notice the psychedelic quality of the colors, images, and patterns that are included. Kundalini Energy According to various teachings, Kundalini is a type of corporeal energy, in Sanskrit it means “coiling like a snake.” In English versions, kundalini represents a serpentine or frequency waveform power. This “corporeal energy” coils at the base of the human spinal"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 122 column. When activated , this serpentine frequency rises through our body along the spine passing through various energy vortexes called Chakras. Each time this energy passes through a chakra, it opens and activates that particular chakra-healing and cleansing any energy blockages, then continues its serpentine path up the spine to the next chakra. According to Hindu texts such as, Ā gamas or Tantras, there exist 7 main chakra centers along the spinal column. The base chakra or 1 st is located in the genital region, the 2 nd at the navel section, the 3 rd around the abdomen region, the 4 th at the heart, the 5 th at the throat, the 6 th at the third eye, and the 7 th is the halo or crown chakra. It is understood that kundalini can travel up the spine activating each energy point until it reaches the 7 th chakra, and then heals the entire human body and provides the consciousness of the human being with mystical and ecstatic thoughts. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 all good children go to Heaven! Once all chakra points have been activated and cleansed, our consciousness has an immediate effect; we receive the keys to unlock the Doors of Perception inside our minds. Remember the tale of the Garden of Eden? The wise serpent provides the secrets that open up the minds of the humans to become like that of God. There is obvious symbolism taking place within the concept of the serpent. The snake could represent kundalini energy, but it can also represent the human’s double-stranded DNA. I suggest the serpent in Genesis, is in fact both Kundalini and human DNA, because they coincide perfectly with each other. So the serpent is anything but evil, as the Bible depicts it. Remember those who wrote the Bible were in charge of the Church, and the Church’s main objective is trying to imprison the human soul into a set belief system designed to limit human consciousness. As we learned earlier, consciousness, spirit, and soul are all interchangeable terms. So if the institution of the Church prevents its followers from learning a different kind of truth than what the Church presents, you can clearly see the concept that suppresses"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 123 freedom of consciousness, spirit, or the human soul. God never stopped speaking to or through humans, as the Bible portrays him doing. But certain authority figures claim to have contact with God, and as a result, we should bow down before their “Holy Feet” because the average obedient follower doesn’t think they can have contact with the divine, other than through a priest or pope... Kundalini energy is another symbolic example of the caduceus, or the staff of Hermes/Mercury, the symbol for medicine. The serpents begin at the foot of the staff entwining themselves upward, they reach the top of the staff, which is usually a circular ending point, staring at the circular object (pineal gland) they activate it and then angelic wings spread themselves out over the top of the staff finishing the image of the caduceus. As Andrew Rutajit and Jan Ir vin show in their book Astrotheology and Shamanism , the caduceus is a symbol for medicine in western society. But, it can also be the symbol for the tree of life, the mushroom, a messenger (Mercury was the messenger god), and the biblical interpretation of the staff that Moses was directed by God to raise for healing purposes, by crucifying a serpent upon the cross and that when people looked at it they were healed, as in John 3:14. Could the serpent represent both Christ and Wisdom at the same time? This is what the Gnostic Christian belief is. Also, the theory that the mushroom itself is the “Son of God”, “Flesh of God”, the initiation of becoming “Christ”. This brings a whole new look at John 3:16, which might read something like this if we accepted this theory- “For God loved the world so much that he gave the mushroom, so that everyone who consumes it may not die but have eternal life.” Mathematics and Music The spirals of our cosmos contain within them a Golden Ratio, this can be expressed as a mathematical"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 124 constant, or the term Pi. This mathematical concept is found throughout nature and the universe. When discussing Math, I need a credible reference, because I am not a mathematician, so I picked up a recent book in the bookstore called, The Golden Ratio: The story of phi, the world’s most astonishing number by Mario Livio. “The most famous of these numbers is the number pi ( π ), which is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. The value of pi, 3.14159..., has fascinated many generations of mathematicians.” -46 Mario Livio does a great job of bringing us an example of nature’s relationship to these sacred numbers as we read on: “The Golden Ratio’s attractiveness stems first and foremost where it is least expected. Take, for example, an ordinary apple, the fruit often associated (probably mistakenly) with the Tree of Knowledge that figures so prominently in the biblical account of humankind’s fall from grace, and cut it through its girth. You will find that the apple’s seeds are arranged in a five- pointed star pattern, or Pentagram. Each of the five isosceles triangles that make the corners of a pentagram has the property that the ratio of the length of its longer side to shorter one (implied base) is equal to the Golden Ratio, 1.618...” -47 As you can see, the apple, the supposed Forbidden Fruit, contains the sacred pentagram within it. Throughout nature we find sacred numbers. Being a musician myself, I can say we are constantly partaking in numbers and mathematical concepts that are expressed through the music. The funny thing about"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 125 music is that even though it is 100% mathematically explainable, it is almost an unconscious event that consists of mathematics. The listener or musician may not be consciously thinking about the math that they are hearing, but instead the melodies, the rhythms, the emotions; the felt experience of the emotions being expressed through the music. Math is there always; however we use it, without even being aware of it from time to time. Now, I’m sure you can just focus on the mathematical aspect of music, constantly counting in your head and adding the measures and melodies up. Different parts of the song take on mathematical familiarities. We recognize when a part repeats itself and we are familiar with the concepts it has already presented in our heads. The wonderful thing about mathematics in music is that you can truly witness the perfection and the beauty in what mathematics can create. My own personal opinion regarding math in music at this moment is this: You don’t have to pay attention to the mathematics persistently in order to enjoy what it has created, because sometimes if you are constantly focusing on numbers you will miss out on the actual life that math creates which is so much more beautiful than a jumble of numbers in your head. Initiation through Music Why do humans love really loud rock concerts? They leave the shows feeling like they just had a spiritual experience. Well, that is because they probably did have a spiritual or mystical experience. The loud vibrations of the music coming out of the huge speakers cause an activation of the pineal gland through a current of kundalini that rises through the chakra points reaching the third eye, finally the pineal gland may release psychoactive chemicals that give way to a spiritual experience. This has a positive healing effect, although our ears may be ringing and sore from the amplification. The first rock n roll concert I ever went to, I left there"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 126 feeling amazingly alive, happy, and full of positive energy. Now, clearly, rock n roll concerts are not the only way to experience this feeling, any musical performance can do the trick. It just takes the right attitude, the right music, and the right moment, to open up your mind and transform your spirit. “Initiation through music” reminds me of an image. A night time scene around a large bon fire. An entire tribe of humans gathered around dancing, singing, connecting. The music rises up out of the scene, giving one central language that speaks to each and every soul participating in the initiatory ceremony. The fire provides its warmth, its light, and its spirit to the human tribe pounding on the drums and singing praises to the divine. Hopefully, this is a familiar image for you, and perhaps you wonder why? Music has and always will be an initiatory spiritual experience . Our ancestors are the ones who handed down the concept of music to their grandchildren who eventually became us. I believe we owe some respect to the knowledge that our ancient parents contained, including music, spirituality, medicine, and myths. Vibes & Emotions We are emotionally equipped creatures that respond to situations in reality with a variety of these emotions. Each emotion we know: happiness, sadness, acceptance, despair, frustration, guilt, compassion, euphoria, anxiety, doubt, loneliness, pride, pleasure, hope, grief, sympathy, fear, love, ecstasy, etc... each of these vibrate at a different rate, they sing their songs in different keys. The wonderful thing about all these emotions is that they add color, and flavor to life. They are our intuitive signals, flashing that what we are experiencing is making us feel this particular emotion because... Humans have the amazing ability to pick up on vibes/vibrations. Some are more sensitive to vibes than others, but I would think you can tell the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 127 difference between the vibes of celebration, and the vibes during a hellish war being fought by humans. I firmly believe that if you learn to trust your vibes, your intuition, and your emotions, that reality will play out in your favor. The constant struggle that some people go through in life could be made much easier with the trust of their own emotions. Emotions are like divine messengers, which reveal the truth about the human experience. However, emotions can arise with severe impact from the conditioned state of the human mind. Emotions are themselves a representation of the Whole , dark and light, yin and yang, good and bad. The conditioned mind uses emotion to justify its behavior. For example: An emotional argument arrives from- belief, or conditioned thoughts, when the emotions themselves are clouded by a stubborn mentality that is not open to the other side of the argument, the emotions fail to represent good . They are then representing the other half of their existence. I can speak from my own experience, when I used to consider myself to be a “Christian” I would get into some very heated debates simply to prove my stubborn conditioned point. However, I had only known what I had learned . Without ever considering or learning about the other side of the argument, in this case religious or spiritual beliefs, I quickly dismissed the whole picture only to stay Velcro-ed to my chosen side of the coin, brainwashed to believe in the only right religion-Christianity. However, now I see things incredibly different. Once I had an initial experience of ( quest )ioning Christian authority, I began a quest to learn the truth about the rest of the world’s ideas, concepts, beliefs, myths, and finally to learn the truth about the origins of my former belief system, Christianity. The root of the word question is quest, and to question is one of the greatest gifts humans have been blessed with. Once I stepped away from the sheep herding belief system, I had an opportunity to view my former self from a completely different perspective than I had ever contemplated prior to"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 128 questioning it. The funny thing is, I would have previously considered a person in a situation such as I was in to be stepping off the path away from God, on the other hand I had now felt as if I was just starting to walk the path of understanding, knowledge, and truth that is God. This was my initiation that set me on my journey to research, and eventually write this book. I’m not claiming to be anything but a human. I’m not saying you have to agree with me. All that I am saying is, consider the other side of your argument before you let emotion control you, do some research instead. This has been a great benefit to me and others who have done the same. “Question Authority, Think For Yourself”- Dr. Timothy Leary, Harvard Ph. D- 48 Don’t let other people think for you, use your brain and think for yourself. Reclaim your mind. Reclaim your consciousness. Reclaim your spirit! Music of the Mind I’ll leave this chapter with a section about our thoughts. Thoughts are a fascinating thing; we all experience them, but what exactly are they? They are music. Music being broadcast over the Radio of Consciousness. Thoughts are songs that play inside our minds, sending us information, knowledge, emotions, realities, and understanding. Intuition is the song of your spirit. Conditioning is the song of a conformed society. The sophistication of this lifelong masterpiece being composed throughout our lives, rivals any classical masterpiece from genius the likes of Mozart, Beethoven, etc. And, the more peculiar observation on the lifetime thought masterpiece is that we are the ones who are its audience. Individually we experience our own symphonies, orchestrating frequencies, and rich emotions together in such a fashion that sometimes, we trance out and forget what we are hearing. But what we are hearing is the voice of God. The music of Spirit."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 129 The song of consciousness. Human beings are audience members in the House of Divine Consciousness . Any of us, can interpret the song of consciousness we hear. You can listen to it, and then what you may do is try to translate the music of ‘thoughts’ into verbalized language in order to communicate its message to other humans. And, that is exactly what I am doing right now and you are doing as you read this! We try our best to translate the music we are hearing in our heads, the music of thoughts. So, the next time you hear audible music playing, try to remind yourself that what you are hearing is both the voice of the divine, and your own ability to listen to the song of consciousness. It establishes a sort of sympathetic-affection for the musicians who translate what they hear into the particular song that is playing for your entertainment."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 131 Chapter 8 - Crop Circles O ne of my favorite topics at the moment is the Crop Circle phenomena. As I write this book, approximately 50 or more crop circles will appear somewhere on the earth. The rate at which these artful masterpieces occur is outstanding, yet each year more and more keep popping up. I’m not going to go into the whole hoaxing cover-up simply because I feel that there is enough evidence to suggest this certainly is not the case for each individual crop circle. It is important to consider hoaxes to be a legitimate explanation for a few of these formations. But, as you are about to read, there are just too many unexplainable cases that would give evidence on the crop circles around the world that are not being created by hoaxers. Clearly something phenomenal is occurring in our crop fields. And, the images portrayed through these “art pieces” have a rather unconscious effect on the human psyche. Beautiful Symmetry. Sacred Geometry. Mathematical Perfection. Encoded Imagery. These are just a few phrases that explain the crop circles. Within each individual image, exists hundreds of various levels of interpretation. Most apparent are the esoteric concepts embedded in the images. Ancient symbols are expressed through crop circles. Information is always contained within each picture. Crop circles can be energetically charged as well, with a particular frequency or song. Scientific instruments can measure the frequency and radiation levels being emitted. Often enough the use of instruments such as cameras, cell phones, and various electronic devices can stop functioning as a result of the powerful frequencies coming from the crop circle themselves. People who enter the crop circles occasionally have spontaneous visions, or thoughts, that they would not experience"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 132 regularly. More on this to come later in the chapter. UFO’s are regularly seen around or near recent crop circles. People also report black helicopters that terrorize humans to vacate the CC’s, flying extremely close and annoying the visitors who are trying to appreciate the images. Also, jets are seen to be chasing UFO’s, almost to prevent the UFO and its occupants from communicating with the human race. Who is trying to prevent this? What do they know that we don’t? Perhaps these groups of humans are trying to protect the current Paradigm of Power that the governments and religions today hold in place, controlling the rest of humanity. Our power hungry human minds taint our pure spiritual energy. Without this hunger for power and greed we could collectively live together as one race of humans on planet earth capable of exploring the depths of the cosmos, no longer allowing the ego to control our consciousness. Sacred Geometry As mentioned above, crop circles often contain sacred geometry. What is sacred geometry? “ Sacred geometry can be described as a belief system attributing a religious or cultural value to many of the fundamental forms of space and time. According to this belief system, the basic patterns of existence are perceived as sacred because in contemplating them one is contemplating the origin of all things. By studying the nature of these forms and their relationship to each other one may gain insight into the scientific, philosophical, psychological, aesthetic, and mystical laws of the universe. The term sacred geometry is also used for geometry which is employed in the design of sacred"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 133 architecture or art. The underlying belief is that geometry and mathematical ratios discoverable from geometry also underlie music, cosmology, and other observable features of the natural universe. This belief was held from ancient times through the Renaissance and influenced the construction of temples and churches and the creation of religious art.”- 49 Sacred geometry contains many shapes including: a Triangle, Square, Cube, Pentagram, Hexagram, Heptagram, Octogram, Enneagram, Decagram, Hendecagram, Dodecagram, and so on... these names are the sums of the numbers given to the points within the image. Tri-angle=3 points or angles. The human body itself represents one of these sacred geometries. Humans represent the Pentagram. Da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man” is a depiction of the sacred proportions of the human body and how we represent Penta-number 5. Crop circles usually depict some of the various sacred geometries through their symbolism and imagery. When humans stare at a mandala full of sacred geometry, they have something occur inside of their psyche. Unconsciously recognizing the symmetry in the image, and its relationship to things found in nature and throughout the entire universe, we observe the perfection of creation. So, if staring at an image has this kind effect on us, what kind of effect would sitting inside of a crop circle have on our psyches? Undoubtedly the image itself has a large impact on our minds, but what about the frequency vibrating through the image also? We would have a double dose of impact by sitting inside the actual crop circle, compared to just looking at a picture of a crop circle. The image is one aspect of its power, but the frequency it sings is the other aspect of its power. The visitors to the crop circle will feel an immediate impact of this power, compared to those who just view a"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 134 picture of it. “ Sacred geometry provides the means to see the vestiges of God and its multiplicity of the universal order ”.-50 “ The highest form of pure thought is in Mathematics ”.-Plato -51 “ The mathematical rules of the universe are visible to men in the form of beauty ”-52 Music of the Crop Circles I took the quote you’re about to read from a website that I discovered after typing in the words “crop circle frequency” into the Google God, and he told me I had several websites to choose from in order to learn about it, so I chose the first one: “ By definition, hoaxes are forgeries, and forgeries require originals from which to copy. So what is this 'unknown force' that creates genuine crop circles? One answer may lie with sound. Echoed in all the world's faiths and traditions, Universal matter was created by sound: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God', St. John reminds us. Hopi and Navajo traditions even assert that in ancient times shamans would utter words onto sand and create patterns, a concept not dissimilar to the Hindu mandalas which are said to be expressions of the vibration of God. Consequently, the Eastern faiths- Islam in particular- chose sacred geometry to express the image of God, a technique later used in those hymns to sacred geometry, Gothic cathedrals. Modern science now shows that these geometric rhythms lie at the centre of atomic"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 135 structures. When Andrew Gladzewski carried out research into atomic patterns, plants, crystals and harmonics in music he concluded that atoms are harmonic resonators, proving that physical reality is actually governed by geometric arrays based on sound frequencies . Even that primeval Hindu sound, the OM, from which is derived our modern term 'hum', when sung into a tonoscope produces the very geometric shapes attributed with 'sacredness'. Perhaps the most important of these shapes is the hexagon, upon which the Egyptian matrix named the Flower of Life is based. This series of outwardly-rotating divisions of the circle accommodate the branches of the building blocks of life, the amino acids. This Flower of Life has subsequently manifested as a crop circle. As the expression of number in space, geometry is inextricably linked to music since the laws of the former govern the mathematical intervals that make up the notes in the western music scale- the diatonic ratios- hence why the ancient Egyptians referred to geometry as frozen music.”- 53 I think this is a wonderfu l bit of information that adds to our understanding of what we have already been learning about. Crop circles being linked to sound is absolutely reasonable if utterly everything is sound. The article goes on to say: “ In the February 1992 edition of Science News, Prof. Gerald Hawkins used the principles of Euclidean geometry to prove that four theorems can be derived from the relationships of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 136 elements in crop circles. More significantly, he discovered a fifth theorem from which he could derive the other four. Despite an open challenge, over half a million subscribers have been unable to create such a theorem, which Euclid himself only hinted at twenty-three centuries earlier in his thirteen treatises on mathematics. So it came as a slight surprise when its equilateral version materialized as 160,000 sq. ft. of flattened barley at Litchfield, Hampshire, in 1995. Since Hawkins' Euclidean theorems also produce diatonic ratios, a link exists between crop circles and musical notes, themselves the by-product of the harmonic laws of sound frequency. Soon, crop circles bearing unmistakable associations with sound then began to appear. One contained a curious ratchet feature from which is constructed a musical diagram also dating to the Egyptians, the Lambdoma. Also known as the Pythagorean Table, it defines the exact relationships between musical harmonics and mathematical ratios .” - 53 Hoax? Whoever or whatever is creating these beautiful crop circles on our planet, one thing is for sure, they truly know quite a bit about mathematics, universal ratios, music, and sacred geometry in order to be able to pull off over 10,000 crop circles or more so far, most that are encoded with this understanding within the images themselves. Even if they were hoaxed, which I highly doubt but it’s good to have a healthy skepticism,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 137 these human hoaxers would have to be rather genius to have the ability to create such precise images and then find the time to transfer their ideas into the fields of crop during the midnight hours when nobody could witness them make it. Why the hell would any human spend so much energy, if only to be labeled a hoaxer? They would reap no benefit from all the intensive hard work they put in. And for what motivation does a human have to hoax a crop circle? The only motivation I’ve ever come across is to prove that crop circles are not paranormal phenomena and that they are created by humans. But we see that crop circles have been with us longer than the idea of hoaxing has been popularized. Crop Circles in History Before I started writing this section, I wanted to grab a couple books that I have on Crop Circles: Crop Circles, Gods and their secrets by Robert Boerman, and Crop Circles Signs of Contact by Colin Andrews. I knew both these books contained historical accounts of crop circle experiences, as I had read them months ago and remembered the stories. Indeed I found what I was looking for, almost more so than I expected. Once I read the passage from the first book regarding the historical accounts of crop circles, I began to laugh out loud, because it ties in perfectly with what you have been reading throughout this manuscript. From the book Crop Circles, Gods and their secrets , we read: “There is a report that dates back to 1633. When a Mr. Hart was walking around in the middle of the night in Wiltshire, England he came upon ‘green circles’ with ‘innumerable quantities of pygmies or a miniature folk who danced around and around’. Mr. Hart further proceeded to share with the world that he was continually being ‘pinched’ by these peoples as they produced a"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 138 humming sound.” -54 Bingo-Ringo! Here we have evidence of a story that a man told of an experience he had that took place in 1633. Over 300 years ago a crop circle account was documented through this story. And not only do we have a crop circle, but we also have the ‘little people’ who ‘dance around and around’ and produce a ‘humming sound’ while they continually ‘pinched’ the man who witnessed it. Does this not correspond exactly with what I have been discussing so far regarding the dimensional entities, frequency/music, crop circles, and altered states? Crop Circles = Frequencies = Altered States = Dimensional Entities = Contact. In other words, Crop Circles could be an example of a gateway to other realms. Another historical case described in the book titled, Crop Circles Signs of Contact , we have an account of exactly what I’m trying to highlight in this book. “The first recorded account of an event that has many of the characteristics common to the formation of a crop circle dates from August 8, 1590, and was detailed in a book published in 1686 called The Natural History of Stafford-Shire by Robert Plott. A peasant named Nicolae Lang-Bernhand was walking to his home around midday that day when he noticed some peculiar activity going on in a field by the side of the road. Upon closer investigation, he saw a group of people dancing in a circle in the field. Upon even closer investigation (close enough to see their legs and feet) he saw that some of them had cloven feet. As Lang-Bernhand observed them, the dancers all suddenly rose into the air and disappeared. In"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 139 the field where they had been cavorting appeared a circular indentation, which remained on the ground until the farmer who owned the field plowed it under the following harvest time. According to Plott, many people from the surrounding area visited the crop circle while it existed. No mention is made of what happened to the cloven-foot dancers. Plott also states that powerful whirlwinds rose up during this event, and that one of them was strong enough to pick up the farmer and carry him to a field some distance away.” -55 Again this is a perfect example of not only the crop circle phenomena, but also the UFO encounters, and dancing-singing little people who can appear and disappear into apparently different dimensions. The even more obvious point to me is that these experiences last only minutes, and the only physical evidence they leave behind is an indentation of a crop formation. With such a short amount of time to experience such encounters leads me to conclude that the spontaneous release of psychedelic chemicals in the human brain could have occurred during each of these cases, thus inducing the short lasting alien/UFO encounter. Which, as we have already discussed these naturally occurring molecules can and do produce these very similar experiences. However, I am up for debate between whether or not these encounters themselves produce the secretions of these chemicals in our brain, or the secretions of these chemicals occur naturally/spontaneously leading to an induced alien encounter experienced. The point I am trying to present is that regardless of which came first, the chicken or the egg, or in this case the encounter or the chemical , the two are infinitely connected and we need to observe the relationship involved between them. I can only hope this manuscript will contribute slightly to the already"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 140 growing field of research revolving around these topics. Ages of Astrological Energy This is giving me goose bumps knowing how much this information is all connected! I love being on the brink of a mysterious apocalypse. Apocalypse, after all, means revelation (revealing information) or unveiling the truth. The word apocalypse is synonymous with the Age of Aquarius, which is the transitioning zodiac that we are moving into during this time in Earth History. “At the heart of their secret traditions, the Egyptians and Greek mystery schools knew that a process, which they called the precession of the equinoxes , measured the great cycle, or the great year. They understood that the stars in the night sky are not fixed. Through long observation and meditation upon the heavens, they came to realize that the stars and the constellations were slowly changing place in the sky. Creating the zodiac system to assist them in these huge measurements of time, they used the 12 signs as a giant clock. Through this they began to understand the great cycle. They realized that it took 2,160 years to move through each sign of the zodiac and that it took 25,920 years for the equinoxes to move through all 12 signs. The creation of the great year of nearly 26,000 years gave them a clock that allowed them to measure time.” - 56 The Age of Aquarius is the Age of Information, and thus the apocalypse at the end of the Age of Pisces, over the past 2000 years during Christianity’s reign giving us the symbol for Christ which is the fish, and the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 141 Jewish reign before it during the Age of Aries or the age of the Ram and thus the Jewish use of blowing the Ram’s Horn. We cannot prevent the change of the zodiac occurring through the ages, but we can either flow from sign to sign or we can remain stuck in our old conditioned ways developed during the previous energetic age. This is the reason why so many changes are occurring during this day in age, because the transition is already in effect and we need to be conscious of it!! The internet itself is an informational portal that is revolutionizing the human being’s understanding of the cosmos they live in. We have information at our fingertips, all around the globe. When 20 or more years ago this was only a science fictional concept, but now it is a reality!!! So, you can see part of my reasoning behind writing this book. If I had been born in a different century, I would not have the information available for me to even begin to write this. With so many technological breakthroughs within the last 20-30 years, we also see the coinciding breakthroughs found in the crop circle phenomena. It’s almost as if the more the crop circles appear, the more revolutionary ideas regarding technology appear in our reality. Am I just drawing random conclusions to think that there is an immediate connection with the exponential rate the crop circles keep appearing and the rate at which breakthroughs in technology exponentially manifest through ‘thoughts’ themselves? And, then to add to the transition of the Ages occurring right now, we have brightly lit pointers grabbing our attention to remind and teach us about why everything is happening the way it is, and at such a fast rate. These pointers are the Crop Circles. For more information regarding Astrotheology I recommend watching the videos on www.gnosticmedia.com, Jan Irvin and Andrew Rutajit do a wonderful job of explaining such complicated topics. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 142 Symbolism and Art It is more than obvious that the crop circles are symbols of art. Symbols are directly linked to the origin of Art and Spirituality as we have already covered. It is almost ironic that the first symbols created by humans may have been induced by hallucinogenic plants consumed by a shamanic figure in history. As we read earlier, the visions witnessed by the hallucinating shaman were duplicated on the cave walls and then began the initial use of symbols to represent spirituality, art, and our origins into modern human civilization. Whether or not the first shamans were earth bound hominids or galactic travelers from outer space, the fact remains that they had the first knowledge of using these symbols to express thoughts and concepts. I’m open to the suggestion that Crop Circles are not only being linked to extraterrestrials, psychedelics, music, and sacred geometry, but they are a direct incorporation of the very concepts that started our evolutionary leap into modern humanity and perhaps they are appearing now to remind us of who and what we are, where we came from and where we are going. For it is about time, that the human race has an Apocalypse of our current world in order to wake us up from the destructive reality we are creating on this planet. Perhaps, the things that made us what we are today will help us evolve again as it did in our past."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 143 Chapter 9 - Ancient Monuments A fter reading about crop circles, music, frequency, and the advanced evolution of our species, let’s now take a look at the magnificent ancient monuments constructed thousands of years ago and what the underlining reason would be for these achievements. When we discuss such monuments, we need to learn about the difference between ‘history’ and ‘prehistory’. Prehistory is anything that occurred prior to the use of written language. With no method of leaving historical documentation behind, society has decided that any time period before ‘the use of writing’ consists of ‘prehistory’. A prime example of such a monument that was built during this time span could be ‘Stonehenge’. This is one of the many monuments that I’ll be pointing out throughout this chapter. The other monuments that I’ll mention consist of ‘The Sphinx’, ‘The Pyramids of Giza’, and ‘Easter Island’. Pre-His-Story Again I just wanted to point out the word, prehistory, the very word itself sticks out like a sore thumb, ‘Pre’= prior, ‘His’= Man (typically those in charge who win the wars and write the history books), and ‘Story’= chronicle of events. Within this one word we learn that prehistory, was anything that could have occurred before man began to ‘create’ his own versions of ‘his-story’. Prehistory is considered to take place so long ago that it doesn’t have much impact on us today, but if we are wise we know that everything is connected whether it happened thousands of years ago or yesterday, time is irrelevant. It all effects us today, what happened in our ancient past will remain intertwined with our future forever. So, if we notice the fact that"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 144 some monuments were constructed even prior to the possible use of written language, the people who constructed them had a fundamental understanding of some very intense knowledge. This knowledge included astrological alignments and arrangements, the ability to move extremely heavy objects from miles and miles away to a central location, mathematical precision, sacred geometry and the golden ratio of pi. These are simply a few advanced concepts that went into constructing these monuments. How the hell could someone that was a primitive-hunter gatherer as we are taught in school, be able to conceive such advanced concepts and then turn around and manifest that knowledge into physical monuments that have lasted thousands of years relatively undisturbed???? Can you honestly see how cavemen would be capable of making something like Stonehenge ? We are still unsure exactly when prehistory ended, different regions have different cultures that began to use writing for historical documentation at separate times in the past. For example, Egypt is believed to have ended it’s prehistory approximately around 3200 BC. Funny how thousands of years of evolution can be considered events of a ‘pre-history’ I would consider prehistory to be one of our most important phases of the past, making us what we are today. Stonehenge I’m sure you are familiar with the megalithic monument of Stonehenge. Stonehenge stands on the open downland of Salisbury Plain two miles (three kilometers) west of the town of Amesbury, Wiltshire, in Southern England. Explanations for how Stonehenge was constructed are vast and impenetrable. Consisting of more than 20 megalithic stones weighing several tons each, all coming from various locations spread out on the earth. First of all, how could these heavy stones be"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 145 moved from their original location hundreds of miles away to the location of Stonehenge? Secondly, who is responsible for moving the stones? And thirdly, why would that person or group of people spend so much time, energy, and intensive labor on constructing something that still to this day baffles the humans of the earth who don’t know what its true purpose even is? These are the 3 main questions I’m going to focus on during this section. The question of ‘how’ this monument was constructed remains an enigmatic mystery, however, I will do my best to pull apart this enigma. First of all there are historical accounts of what “could have” happened during the construction phases. One account comes to us from ‘Arthurian Legend’. “According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the rocks of Stonehenge were healing rocks which Giants brought from Africa to Ireland for their healing properties. These rocks were called The Giant's Dance. Aurelius Ambrosias (5th Century), wishing to erect a memorial to the nobles (3000) who had died in battle with the Saxons and were buried at Salisbury, chose (at Merlin's advice) Stonehenge to be their monument. So the King sent Merlin, Uther Pendragon (Arthur's father), and 15,000 knights to Ireland to retrieve the rocks. They slew 7,000 Irish. As the knights tried to move the rocks with ropes and force, they failed. Then Merlin, using \"gear\" and skill, easily dismantled the stones and sent them over to Britain, where Stonehenge was dedicated. Shortly after, Aurelius died and was buried within the Stonehenge monument, or ‘The Giants' Ring of Stonehenge’.” -57 Two important points are revealed in this"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 146 legend: 1. Giants existed in those days and they might have moved the stones from Africa to Ireland. 2. Merlin, a Wizard, used “gear” and skill to levitate the stones from Ireland to England. Well, if we take it at face value and realize this is just a legend, then perhaps we wouldn’t bump into the other documents that coincide with these key points. Namely the Bible. But if we do look at this separate document, what does it tell us in correlation to the Arthurian Legend? Genesis 6:4- In those days and even later, there were giants on the earth who were descendants of human women and the heavenly beings. They were the great heroes and famous men of long ago.- 58 This is not the only account of these Giants in the Bible, they are commonly referred to as Nephilim. It is worth mentioning that hybrid-interbreeding, commonly associated with alien abductions, is made obvious through the connection in the bible when heavenly beings impregnate earthly women. I would love to go into more detail regarding these Nephilim, however, I need to stick to the Stonehenge story at this moment. The point being formed here is that Giants did indeed exist in ancient history according to numerous accounts, but this still does not prove the fact of how the megaliths of Stonehenge were moved there by Giants. We simply have two separate incidents reporting the existence of Giants, and not the fact that they are the ones responsible for the creation of Stonehenge. So, let’s look at the second point revealed in the Arthurian Legend, ‘Merlin’s gear’. If this is an accurate account of how Stonehenge was built then we have a serious form of technology that we are dealing with. Clearly not a primitive tool, such as the hammer, but instead, an advanced form of Levitation Technology. Who was Merlin anyway? Merlin was a Wizard according to legend. And what is a wizard? A wizard is someone who can manifest things in reality using"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 147 directed intent, usually with the use of a magic wand, rod or staff. I can’t be the one who superimposes opinions over the truth regarding how Stonehenge was constructed. I simply have no idea how it was built, it remains a profound mystery. However I do know that, humans have tried many times to recreate the Stonehenge monument to no avail. We apparently cannot copy it because we are missing some form of technology or something that enabled the original builders to construct it. Of course, there is always the theory that Extraterrestrials came down to earth and built this particular monument, but why? Perhaps it is a major clue left behind, that enables humans in modern times to truly question the apparent capabilities of our ancestors. Or the possibility that ET’s came to our planet thousands of years ago, and left behind a giant artifact from their visit, this simply opens our limited minds to such possibilities. If ET’s did exist, and they possibly created us (as numerous accounts claim), then what better way to get the human to contemplate them than through an anomalous monument that lasts through the ages? One last thing I want to discuss about Stonehenge is it’s role, function, or the ‘ why’ it was created in the first place. So far we’ve touched on how and who , could have possibly built Stonehenge, but let’s now ask the question why? The vast number of answers to this question range from: Ancient burial ground, Druid ceremonial/ritual location, UFO landing pad, and Astronomical Calendar that marks, predicts, and observes astronomical and seasonal events such as the Summer and Winter Solstice, Equinox, and Lunar eclipse. Among these various suggestions, the last one mentioned seems to hold popular belief at the moment. Astronomical Calendars, such as the Mayan Long Count Calendar ending on Dec. 21, 2012, prove a great deal of astrological wisdom that our ancestors must had knowledge of, in order to encode this knowledge within"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 148 calendar systems. Therefore, if Stonehenge is supposed to be some form of a astronomical calendar, that would imply that the builders, living during ‘prehistory’ would have had such advanced knowledge of the stars, planets, orbits, and cosmic cycles, in order to put that information into a monument. Whatever way or reason they created it, we must admit the builders of Stonehenge were incredibly intelligent, and anything but primitive. Easter Island Just off the coast of Chile, to the west of South America, exists an island that is as mysterious as Stonehenge and perhaps more remotely hidden, named Easter Island. The wonderful enigma about this island is the ‘statues’ that line the entire coast surrounding it. These statues are of large faces, often connected to a torso. In this section I hope to discover the catalyst or reason behind the creation of these giant face statues. “The large stone statues, or moai, for which Easter Island is world famous were carved during a relatively short and intense burst of creative and productive megalithic activity. 887 monolithic stone statues have been inventoried on the island and in museum collections. Although often identified as \"Easter Island Heads\", the statues actually are heads and complete torsos. Some upright moai, however, have become buried up to their necks by shifting soils. The period of time when the statues were produced remains disputed, with estimates ranging from 1000/1500 CE to 1500/1700 CE. Almost all (95%) moais were carved out of distinctive, compressed, easily-worked volcanic ash or tuff found at a single site"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 149 called Rano Raraku. The Rapanui who carved them had no metal or powered machinery, only stone hand tools - mainly basalt toki. Only a quarter of the statues were installed on the coastal ahu platforms, with nearly half still remaining in Rano Raraku and the rest elsewhere on the island, probably on their way to final locations. Moving the huge statues seems to have been laborious and very slow.” -59 “Some have suggested that Easter Island is the remnant of a lost continent, or the result of an extra-terrestrial influence . -Archaeological evidence, however, indicates discovery of the island by Polynesians at about 400 AD - led, according to legend, by Hotu Matua. Upon their arrival, an impressive and enigmatic culture began to develop. In addition to the statues, the islanders possessed the Rongorongo script; the only written language in Oceania. The island is also home to many petroglyphs (rock carvings), as well as traditional wood carvings, tapa (barkcloth) crafts, tattooing, string figures, dance and music .” - 60 Dance, music, tattooing, petroglyphs, script, and other artistic crafts were exercised during this cultural rise. As we have learned about shamanism, which includes these very same practices, we can conclude that Easter Island is well versed in shamanic knowledge. Maybe this society was taught shamanic knowledge from other worldly beings, or perhaps the people of this society knew how to alter their consciousness in order to have contact with these other beings who would teach the people in return. The result, an evolutionary leap in artistic expression and shamanic knowledge."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 150 I draw these conclusions because I see the connections, however my theories certainly can be disagreed with by anyone. My response to the disagreeing person would be this, what evidence is there to suggest the theories regarding shamanism as a catalyst for evolution on Easter Island, are not accurate ? As you can see from the evidence that we do have, the people of this island did practice certain methods of altering their consciousness, music and dancing are the prime example of this. I’m sure the use of psychoactive plants and fungi were possible other methods used by the indigenous members of the island. Even if the use of psychedelics wasn’t known to these people, music and dancing are immediate examples of altering human consciousness. So, if these humans carved great big stone statues resembling faces and put them around the entire border of the island, perhaps this was an intention directed by the spirits, or gods, of this island, giving these directions or this intention through altered states of consciousness via contact with dimensional entities/spirits. What other explanations exist that would give credence to the creation of these almost ‘godly looking’ statues? Why else would the island members go to such great length to create mysterious statues if not sharing a relationship with the island’s ‘religion’ or ‘spiritual practices’? The Sphinx Egypt is famous for numerous things, including of course it’s great ancient civilization that flourished during 3000-31 BC. Over 5 thousand years ago a civilization so advanced in its knowledge would leave behind a legacy of mysteries encoded in it’s ancient monuments. Monuments such as the Sphinx, the Great Pyramid and the pyramids of Giza. Let us now take a closer examination of the Sphinx. The Sphinx itself is a complete enigma. Not only the image, of a half human/half lion (therianthropy) popular among almost"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 151 all ancient cultures, but also the date of its construction, and whoever is responsible for its mysterious erection, remains a mystery to this day. But, as we have learned about therianthropy in previous chapters, regarding cave art depictions of half-man/half-animal entities, these are possible representations of spirit beings because they do not seem to be actual creatures that exist in ordinary reality. However, they are occasionally encountered during altered states of consciousness, which has been a systematic exercise lasting throughout the ages since the beginning of our modern humanness. From my perspective, the Sphinx is a representation of a spirit or god encountered during an altered state of consciousness. And, if we know anything about ancient Egypt and it’s understanding of sacred plants and herbs, we know that it’s people did use hallucinogenic substances among opiates and stimulants, including: The Blue Water Lily, Opium, Cannabis/Hemp, various snuffs, and other medicinal plants. The Blue Water Lily is most popular among Egypt mythology and art work. “Recent studies have shown Nymphaea caerulea to have psychedelic properties, and may have been used as a sacrament in ancient Egypt and certain ancient South American cultures-(possibly Easter Island). Dosages of 5 to 10 grams of the flowers induces slight stimulation, a shift in thought processes, enhanced visual perception, and mild closed-eye visuals. Nymphaea caerulea is related to, and possesses similar activity as Nelumbo nucifera, the Sacred Lotus.”- 61 Clearly the ancient Egyptians understood shamanic knowledge, and made use of it throughout their civilization. The Sphinx is a direct example of this wisdom and understanding. To be honest with you, I can see no other explanation for why or what reason the builders of this monument decided to create a"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 152 therianthropic image, other than encounters that they experienced during altered states of consciousness. So, with the image of the monument being set aside, let’s find out when we are told it was built. The funny thing about this question is that it’s constantly being debated between Egyptologists and other researchers. Egyptology would like to place the origin of the Sphinx neatly into the era of Egypt’s highest point, during 2500- 2400 BC, however this has yet to be proven. Other researchers including, Graham Hancock and John Anthony West, have suggested the Sphinx is much older than we are currently giving it credit. West is the author of ‘The Mystery of the Sphinx’ , in this book he goes into detail regarding the Sphinx’s possible origins. “On November 10, 1993, the NBC television network broadcast \"The Mystery of the Sphinx,\" introduced thirty million American viewers to the discovery by John Anthony West and Robert Schoch that the Great Sphinx of Giza might be thousands of years older than its assumed date of 2500 BC. Narrated by Charlton Heston, the documentary provides evidence that the ancient Egyptians possessed scientific knowledge unknown to us and carried on the wisdom tradition of an earlier lost civilization.” -62 For more information regarding the possible origins of the Sphinx, I suggest doing a Google search for ‘Mystery of the Sphinx’. Whatever information you happen to stumble upon, the truth remains the same, the sphinx represents a therianthropic being, which is a commonly encountered entity during altered states of consciousness. Therefore, we must connect the dots and assume the creators of the Sphinx had knowledge of altered states of consciousness and left behind their understanding through a mysterious enigmatic monument. It is simply one more piece of evidence to"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 153 add to the theme throughout this book. And, maybe you think I’m being irrational to suppose that the monuments of the Sphinx and Easter Island are connected to altered states of consciousness, however, I may be revealing ‘truth’, so please don’t be quick to dismiss the possibility. To my perspective, shamanic knowledge is inseparable from the construction of these ancient monuments. And whoever is responsible for the origins of the Sphinx, it is possible that they understood shamanism, and wanted to express their understanding through this mysterious monument that has lasted through the ages. The Pyramids of Giza When discussing ancient monuments, it would be utterly impossible to not mention the Pyramids of Giza. In this section we will take a look at the astronomically precise engineering of the Giza necropolis, and the internal construction of the Great Pyramid. The Pyramids at Giza consist of three main pyramids, and other smaller constructions surrounding them. The three main pyramids include: the pyramid of Khafre, the pyramid of Menkaure, and the Great Pyramid aka the pyramid of Khufu. The layout of these pyramids is suggested to be in astronomical alignment to the belt of Orion, somehow incorporating the knowledge of the stars into the monuments themselves. However, even if the pyramids do or don’t have an astronomical connection with the constellation of Orion, they do contain advanced mathematical concepts including the famous pi. When mentioning such concepts, we should understand that the Great Pyramid is in exact alignment to true north, south, east, and west. The builders must have been conscious of the decision to place the base of the Great Pyramid in alignment to the exact directional points. Not only is it in perfect alignment with the directions, it also contains within its design the mathematical concept of pi."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 154 “This is consistent with then-available geometric methods for determining the Golden Ratio phi, which can be derived from other dimensions of the pyramid, such that if phi had been the design objective, then pi automatically follows to 'square the circle'. Given that pre- hellenistic Egyptians did not have a similar geometric way to determine pi as accurately, it is unlikely that it was preferred over phi as a design objective, especially as phi has been found in other pre-hellenistic Egyptian monuments. (Alexander Badawi. Ancient Egyptian Architectural Design. Berkeley: 1965)” - 63 Another very important fact that we must consider here, is that certain mysteries of the pyramid still have yet to be discovered. Within the structure of the Great Pyramid, exists several supposed “air ventilation shafts”, however these shafts have gone unexplored until the 1990’s. Once the technology was available for us to construct a small enough robot capable of traveling through the narrow shafts, which had previously gone untouched, we attached a camera to the robot and received some pictures of a mystery surrounding these “air shafts”. First of all, they are not air shafts, because instead of leading from the internal chambers to the external layer of the pyramid, they lead to a separate “undiscovered vault” locked behind some kind of a gate. Taken from Erich Von Daniken’s book, The Return of the Gods, we read: “The slow journey passed smoothly polished walls; the robot had to surmount small piles of sand and maneuver itself cleverly over fragments which had fallen down from the ‘ceiling’. At last, after 60 meters, came the first surprise: on the floor lay a"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 155 broken-off piece of metal. Shortly afterwards, the great sensation. The robot camera relayed a kind of door or partition, which closed off the whole shaft; on the upper part of the door were two small metal clasps, the left of which was partly broken. Rudolf Gantenbrink steered the robot towards the door, aiming the laser beam at its lower edge. The red beam, 5 millimeters across, disappeared under the edge of the door. This showed that there was space beyond it. At the lower right-hand corner of the door, a portion of stone was missing. The robot camera relayed dark dust there, which had no doubt blown out of this tiny opening in the course of thousands of years. But the robot’s journey had now come to a halt.” -64 Instrument Technology of the Pyramid Clearly there are several mysteries yet to be revealed about the Pyramids of Giza. I just wanted to briefly mention a theory about the purpose of The Great Pyramid. I believe the Great Pyramid is a sort of instrument, resonance device, or frequency amplification generator technology. I have heard and read theories regarding the initiations of pharaohs and other Osirian Mystery School members, and that they would partake of the shamanic use of altered states of consciousness through ingestion of plants. After ingestion, the initiate would then lie in the supposed ‘coffin’ (designed as a resonance device) while entering an altered state of consciousness. The initiate would then begin to use his/her voice to make frequencies vibrate throughout the entire pyramid, eventually rising so strong that the frequencies vibrating the pyramid also vibrate the human"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 156 brain of the initiate, including the pineal gland. The purpose: to send the consciousness of the participator/initiate through the dimensional stargate generated by the secretions of chemicals in their brains, into the higher realms of the gods. The pyramid itself is a structure designed to amplify the thought frequencies and aim them up into the heavens of the infinite cosmos. “The pyramid is the archetypal Egyptian symbol with which we are most familiar. Its four sides represent the four elements of earth, air, fire and water and its apex the fifth element of ether. Being precisely aligned with cardinal points, the pyramids were thought to represent the world's axis and mans' ascent to the skies. The name \"pyramid\" comes from the Greek word \"Pyramis\", meaning wheaten cake, because this is what they resembled to the Greeks. The Egyptian name for them was \"Mer\", meaning a place or instrument of ascension, or a vehicle or chariot. Pyramids were built throughout the dynasties, spanning many hundreds of years, and have taken the \"step\" form, rather like Aztec pyramids, as well as smooth-sided forms. It is believed that some pyramids were surmounted by a capstone, which coalesced and concentrated the energies entering and leaving the pyramid. The most famous of the pyramids is the Great Pyramid at Giza which was a smooth-sided pyramid, finished originally in a smooth white stone - probably alabaster - with a capstone possibly made from a gemstone or coated with sheets of gold. Built to exacting standards inside and out with very precise and specific angles"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 157 and using specific materials placed to exact design. It is not a tomb or a burial chamber, but instead both a symbol and tool of resurrection and regeneration. Its purpose was to bring in white Light energy to take one from one level of consciousness to another. It contained rooms of initiation, and initiates of the Osirian Mystery Schools took tests within different chambers and passageways of the pyramid, with their final test and initiation taking place within the King's chamber, where they experienced \"resurrection\". Not many were advanced enough to be called to that test, and not all who took it passed - in fact some simply physically disappeared! The sarcophagus within that chamber was also used by Pharaohs as a tool of regeneration for their physical bodies. The Great Pyramid stands in close proximity to the Sphinx, and is etherically linked with that structure, which holds the flame of Ascension.” -65 There is a funny thing about why, we are taught in school, the pyramids were built to be a memorial/burial place for the king pharaohs, and that is we have never found sarcophaguses filled with mummies in the pyramids. However, I recently watched an I-max documentary about the discovery of a giant cave, found some distance away from the pyramids in Egypt, filled with royal tombs, sarcophaguses, and well preserved mummies. Scientific DNA testing is taking place currently, to reveal the genetic make-up of these royal mummies. Something of coincidence here, after the discovery/removal of these ancient tombs, the cave began to collapse. And, the timing of this discovery with the current scientific ability to test DNA, seems to"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 158 be nothing but a mystery. The final conclusion, the pyramids clearly were not built, as we are taught in school, to be a burial monument for the royal families. What were these magnificent monuments constructed for? I suspect, that the pyramids were built to be a great spiritual transformational technology, used to initiate humans into the ways of advanced knowledge and universal-cosmic understanding. The physical dimensions, and the harmonic resonance of the pyramids act as energy accelerators, increasing the chances of re- tuning the human consciousness, to pick up on other dimensional frequencies and the ‘spirits’ who inhabit them. Further Research There are so many ancient monuments to describe. However, for further research into ancient civilizations and their monuments I suggest reading, * Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock-who is also the author of the latest shamanic research- * Supernatural: Meeting with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind (I highly recommend this book) . * Message of the Sphinx, is a book written by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval which argues that the creation of the Sphinx and Pyramids can be pushed back as far as 10,500 BC using astronomical data. Other books that I recommend for further reading would be, Erich von Daniken’s work including * Chariots of the Gods and * Return of the Gods , in these books Daniken gives mysterious insight about the various ‘astro- archeological’ evidence regarding extraterrestrial influences on early human culture."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 159 Chapter 10 - Technology (Inner/Outer) W hile I attended college at the Institute of Production and Recording, during 2005-06, I remember writing a report for one of my Computer classes, and the report was about Technology. A very broad topic but I covered it in a fun manner. Technology is truly a fascinating concept to think about, considering our brains are one of the most advanced forms of technology around. The computers that we are creating now function at such fast rates and have incredible capabilities that our ancestors would have enjoyed using them thousands of years ago to make their lives a little bit easier. Global communication makes life easier. Let’s note that the difference in inner and outer technologies are slim because they are representations of the same concept, yin and yang. What makes me different from the computer that I’m typing on? I guess I’m going to have to say I am a spirit/consciousness which controls my body vehicle, where as this computer needs what I am, an operator/consciousness to make it function. So the difference is slim, both my body and this computer need my spirit or consciousness in order to make them function. Without my human consciousness, they are both useless and have no purpose. “Wow, you mean to tell me that my body is the same idea as a computer?” Yes, I mean to tell you that the computer is just a different version of your body. Of course, the computer doesn’t have the same exact functions that the human body does, such as the 5 senses, sexual reproduction, etc, but the computer needs the same thing the human body needs in order to work, this is your consciousness. It’s a very simple concept. In this chapter I want to outline both the inner and outer forms of technology."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 160 Inner Technology As we have already covered some aspects of inner technology during the chapter on the human brain, I suggest we do a short review of what kind of technology we are talking about. Technology, when defined by my computers dictionary, means: 4 .In cultural anthropology- sum of practical knowledge, 3. Machines and Systems, 2. A method of applying technical knowledge, 1. application of tools and methods. -66 When looking at these definitions for the word technology, I am reminded of everything we have covered so far in this book. If, according to Cultural Anthropology, technology is the ‘ Sum of Practical Knowledge’ among a tribe, or village, or civilization, then we can conclude that shamanism which is also considered to be the ‘ sum of practical knowledge ’ or method/practice of acquiring ‘practical knowledge’ is then a form of technology. So, then we notice that the very knowledge that possibly made us what we are today, (i.e. modern art-making-spiritual entities) known as shamanism, is basically one of the very first forms of technology that our ancestors made use of. And, then if we take into consideration the other definitions of the word technology, such as machines and systems, we can ask then, what is a machine and what is a system? A machine is simply a mechanical device. And a system is both: a complex whole formed from related parts, and a set of principles and ideas by which something is organized. Perhaps one form of a Machine, encountered through the medium of consciousness, and through the use of a System, (complex whole organized by related parts, based on ideas and principles, in this case the System of Shamanism ), was the mechanical devices that the initiates often encounter under the influence of this system."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 161 Taken from the book Supernatural: Meeting with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind by Graham Hancock, under the title The baffling of Strassman and Shanon, we read: ‘Dr Rick Strassman, for one, admits to being “baffled and nonplussed” during his DMT research by the- surprising and remarkable consistencies among volunteers’ reports of contact with nonmaterial beings...[in an] “alien” realm...or higher technology room . The highly intelligent beings of this “other” world are interested in the subject, seemingly ready for his or her arrival and wasting no time in “getting to work”...They... communicate with the volunteers, attempting to convey information by gestures, telepathy, or visual images. The purpose of contact was uncertain, but several subjects felt a benevolent attempt on the beings’ part to improve us individually or as a race.’ -67 ‘Another participant in the same four- dose tolerance study was Sara. “This time, I quickly blasted through to the ‘other side,’” she said soon after receiving her third injection: “I was in a void of darkness. Suddenly, beings appeared. They were cloaked, like silhouettes. They were glad to see me. They indicated that they had had contact with me as an individual before. They seemed pleased that we had discovered this technology ... They wanted to learn more about our physical bodies. They told me humans exist on many levels ...” “They told me there were many things they could share with us when we learn"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 162 how to make more extended contact. ”- 68 ‘In due course, Strassman found himself agreeing that there was a problem. “Why do we all have DMT in our brains?” he asked: Why is there a compound... that generates experiences of “alien-contact,” death, space travel, and other extraordinary effects?’ -69 As the other two remaining definitions for the word technology mean, A method of applying technical knowledge, and the application of tools and methods. The method that our ancestors used, was shamanism. And the application of tools is simply the use and knowledge of the plants, fungi and mystical chemicals in our brain, that allow humans to use this technology . If you are following me so far, you can see how incredible and secretive this utterly Invisible form of Technology can be, being hidden from the mass public waking- consciousness, yet penetrating every human being on the planet. Our human brains, and nature’s psychoactive plant species can, and do, give humans access to this Inner Technology . Outer Technology Of course, this computer is a form of ‘outer technology’, and as we will be discussing later in the next chapter UFO’s are also a form of ‘outer technology’. There is an obvious amount of external/outer technology springing up in modern days. If you just walk through an airport you will see all kinds of forms of outer technology, almost duplicating the processes found inside our brains. For example: Cell phones, computers, coffee machines, electronic billboards, departure/arrival screens, escalators, airplanes, baggage machine-belts, etc... Outer Technology completely surrounds us in modern times. I wouldn’t be capable of researching information for this"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 163 book without the technology of the Internet, the computers used by the authors who wrote the books that I use for research, and the automobile transportation technology used to deliver the books to the bookstores where I shop. The idea of outer technology is, as I stated above, ‘almost duplicating the processes found inside our brains.’ Which came first, the inner or the outer technology? The Purpose of Technology So, as you can imagine, technology is one of the most important aspects of what makes us humans. What is the purpose of technology? Well, I have come to the conclusion that technology exists specifically for the purpose of Consciousness/Spirit. Technology is a vehicle for Spirit. Spirit needs some form of technology, inner or outer, to express and experience itself. Without some form of technology, Spirit has no technique, mode, or method, of expressing itself. And, in this case, we must consider all forms of Life, found in nature, and the entire cosmos, to be examples of a technology similar to the human body/brain. Therefore, all plants, trees, animals, humans, and various life forms, can be considered a living form of a mysterious and divine technology. Artificial and Organic However, the technology of ‘Life’ is not Artificial , instead it is Organic. Life is Organic Technology. Computers are Artificial Technology. There is a distinct difference between organic and artificial. Artificial technology is something created by humans in a synthetic manner. Synthetic, meaning made in the imitation of something natural. Organic technology is something that is produced by Nature. Humans are organic entities. However, if we consider the plethora of accounts and theories regarding the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 164 creation of the human being, we learn that we were created in the image/imitation of God, the gods, the ET’s, etc.. Then in a way, humans are both synthetic- made in the imitation of something natural, and organic- taken from the natural DNA of living hominids on planet earth. I never wanted to think of myself as anything but Organic , however when I stumbled upon the possibility that humans were created from the splicing of two different forms of DNA, Ape-Hominid DNA and Extraterrestrial DNA, I realize that there is a very strong possibility that humans are part Organic and part Synthetic. But, we probably don’t want to be conscious of the fact that we are potentially somewhat synthetic, at least our DNA is half synthetic and half organic. If we are conscious of what we are, what our DNA is, where it came from/how it was created, we can better understand the mechanical encounters people have during the shamanic experience. Alien Technology I had recently finished reading the retired Colonel Philip J. Corso’s book, The Day After Roswell . While I was reading it, I highlighted a specific section that seemed connected to the research I was gathering for this book. I just happened to flip open his book to that specific page with the pink highlighted section, referring to some form of ‘alien technology’ recovered after the Roswell UFO crash in 1947. “Suffice it to say that in the few hours the material was at Walker Field in Roswell, more than one officer at the 509 th gingerly slipped this thing over his head and tried to figure out what it did. At first it did nothing. There were no buttons, no switches, no wires, nothing that could even be considered to have been a control panel. So, no one knew how to turn it on or off. Moreover, the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 165 band was not really adjustable, though it had enough elasticity to have been one-size-fits-all for the creatures whose skulls were large enough to accommodate them. However, the reports I read stated, the few officers whose heads were just large enough to have made contact with the full array of conductors got the shocks of their lives. In their descriptions of the headband, these officers reported everything from a low tingling sensation inside their heads to a searing headache and a brief array of either dancing or exploding colors on the insides of their eyelids as they rotated the device around their head and brought the sensors into contact with different parts of their skull. These eyewitness reports suggested to me that the sensors stimulated different parts of the brain while at the same time exchanged information with the brain. Again, using the analogy of an EEG, these devices were a very sophisticated mechanism for translating the electronical impulses inside the creatures’ brains into specific commands.”- 70 To me, this is one of the best examples of an ‘alien technology’ recovered by our military after the Roswell crash that is a direct connection to the technology of shamanism with its altered-states of consciousness. The obvious give away is the ‘low tingling sensation inside their heads’, ‘the brief array of dancing or exploding colors on the inside of their eyelids as they rotated the device around their head and brought the sensors into contact with different parts of the brain’, and at the same time this was an ‘exchange of information to the brain’. This is clearly a prime"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 166 example of the psychedelic experience. However, without the ingestion of a plant/fungi, or through a method of inducing altered states of consciousness such as dancing, chanting, and music, we instead witness a form of a ‘headband device’ that stimulates different parts of the these participator’s brains that indeed, induce the altered-state of consciousness so often associated with alien contact. What are we dealing with here? Could it possibly be some form of outer technology that we ‘ wear’, which enables us to travel through and encounter beings in these various dimensions?"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 167 Chapter 11- UFO’s A s the evening came upon us, we entertained the idea of going for a walk. So, we embarked on the journey, eventually resting upon one of the grassy hills of the local golf course. It was possibly 8-9 pm, the sun had already set in the west. The sky that was above us was filled with a slight layer of fog that appeared to be lit up the color orange, caused by the metropolitan city’s fluorescent lights below. Lying in the grass, on this golf course hill, we were facing the south-east. After a moment of meditation and silence, she asked me, “Do you see that?” My response was a confused, “Yeah”, as we sat on the hill watching this dim light in the shape of a ball/orb dance around in the sky behind the thin layer of fog. It wasn’t moving in a fixed direction, such as the way airplanes move, it looked like it was ‘dancing’ around in the sky, almost putting on a show for the humans that were viewing it, including us. My thoughts raced, “What is that?” “Is it a UFO?” “Is it just a light source coming from the ground?” “Could it be an airplane?” “What was making this light source that happened to be dancing around behind the layer of fog in the sky?” Still my questions have yet to be fully answered. But, if I listen to my intuition , I know that what we witnessed on that night was a spectacular phenomenon that most humans might not consider anything special and they might simply explain away the incident by natural means. But, I keep asking myself, what was that light in the sky that we observed for over half an hour? I know I’m not the only one who has had this kind of experience. UFO sightings are reported on a daily basis by average humans with a very normal psychology . This is not an incident reported by lunatics, it is reported by people of all levels of society on a daily basis."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 168 “The Fiery Chariots” from the Past When we search through history for answers to the riddle of the UFO enigma, we stumble upon numerous accounts of ‘flying vehicles’ and ‘fiery chariots’. I am aware of several accounts found in the Bible regarding UFO’s. A nd, without a doubt, I will give you one of those examples. However, I wanted to start off with a different example from the most ancient detailed account of flying-saucers. This account was taken from one of Alan Watts’ books titled, UFO Quest. “The most ancient detailed account of flying-saucer sightings we have comes from the Royal Annals of the pharaoh Thutmosis III (c. 1504-1450 BC). It comes from a translation of a damaged papyrus made by Prince Boris de Rachewiltz (Vallii, 1966). In the year 22, of the third month of winter, sixth hour of the day... the scribes of the House of Life found it was a circle of fire that was coming in the sky... It had no head, the breath of its mouth had a foul odour. Its body one rod long and one rod wide. It had no voice. Their hearts became confused through it: then they laid themselves on their bellies... they went to the Pharaoh... to report it. His Majesty ordered... has been examined... as to which is written in the papyrus rolls of the House of Life. His Majesty was meditating upon what happened. Now after some days had passed, these things became more numerous in the sky than ever. They shone to the limits of the four supports of the heavens... Powerful was the position of the fire circles. The army of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 169 the Pharaoh looked on with him in their midst. It was after supper. Thereupon, these fire circles ascended higher in the sky towards the south... Here some 3,500 years ago, are all the ingredients of a modern sighting of lights in the sky, both single and in formation. They were circular and very bright. They made no noise and possibly the ‘foul odour’ was the smell of ionized air, which certainly has an unpleasant smell.” -71 Taken from Erich Von Daniken’s book, The Return of the Gods , under the title- Eve and the UFO we read: “One can read about fire and flying chariots during Adam’s times, in the apocryphal text The Life of Adam and Eve. Although the extant version dates from ad 730, it is based on handwritten documents of an unknown age. ‘Eve looked towards the heavens and saw a chariot of lights drawing near, pulled by four gleaming eagles, whose magnificence and beauty no one born of mother’s womb is able to express.’ Ancient Mother Eve the first witness of a UFO? The same Lord who had created Adam and Eve, and from time to time walked at his pleasure in the Garden of Eden, also climbed aboard this UFO: ‘And behold, the Lord of strength mounted upon the chariot; four winds drew it, the Cherubim guided the winds, and the angels of heaven went before...’”- 72 The Book of Ezekiel Now, if we take a quick glance at the Holy Bible"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 170 and its UFO reports, we may be surprised by the amount of information that the average ‘Christian’ never considers regarding these kinds of reports. I, for one, never did when I claimed to be ‘Christian’. In The Book of Ezekiel, we learn about one UFO encounter that is rather blatantly obvious. Try to recognize the noticeable psychedelic-visions in connection to the description of what this human said he saw over 2,000 years ago. To my perspective, it is evident that Ezekiel either practiced shamanism, or was being initiated into shamanism through these visions. Included within the Book of Ezekiel , we find a connection to almost everything we’ve been discussing throughout the previous chapters of this book. For example: Consciousness, Dimensional entities, UFO’s, psychedelic visions, shamanism, eatable sacraments containing scrolls worth of information, sound frequencies, and the presence of the Divine. As you are about to read the beginning of The Book of Ezekiel, keep in mind all of the examples listed above, and see if you can decode this archaic language. Ezekiel 1:4-28, ‘I looked up and saw a windstorm coming from the north. Lighting was flashing from a huge cloud, and the sky around it was glowing. Where the lighting was flashing, something shone like bronze. At the center of the storm I saw what looked like four living creatures in human form, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight, and they had hoofs like those of a bull. They shone like polished bronze. In addition to their four faces and four wings, they each had four human hands, one under each wing. Two wings of each creature were spread out so that the creatures formed a square, with their wing tips touching. When they moved, they moved as a group without"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 171 turning their bodies. Each living creature had four different faces: a human face in front, a lion’s face at the right, a bull’s face at the left, and an eagle’s face at the back. Two wings of each creature were raised so that they touched the tips of the wings of the creatures next to it, and their other two wings were folded against their bodies. Each creature faced all four directions, and so the group could go wherever they wished, without having to turn. Among the creatures there was something that looked like a blazing torch, constantly moving. The fire would blaze up and shoot out flashes of lightning. The creatures themselves darted back and forth with the speed of lightning.’ ‘As I was looking at the four creatures I saw four wheels touching the ground, one beside each of them. All four wheels were alike; each one shone like a precious stone, and each had another wheel intersecting it at right angles, so that the wheels could move in any of the four directions. The rims of the wheels were covered with eyes. Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and if the creatures rose up from the earth, so did the wheels. The creatures went wherever they wished, and the wheels did exactly what the creatures did, because the creatures controlled them. So every time the creatures moved or stopped or rose in the air, the wheels did exactly the same. Above the heads of the creatures there was something that looked like a dome made of dazzling crystal. There under"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 172 the dome stood the creatures each stretching out two wings toward the ones next to it and covering its body with the other two wings. I heard the noise their wings made in flight; it sounded like the roar of the sea, like the noise of a huge army, like the voice of the Almighty God. When they stopped flying, they folded their wings, but there was still a sound coming from above the dome over their heads. Above the dome there was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire, and sitting on the throne was a figure that looked like a human being. The figure seemed to be shining like bronze in the middle of a fire. It shone all over with a bright light that had in it all the colors of the rainbow. This was the dazzling light which shows the presence of the Lord.’- 73 Truly an amazing account, that Ezekiel reported over 2,000 years ago, of some kind of encounter with a ‘divine vision’. Notice the connection of the blazing torch constantly moving amongst the creatures in Ezekiel’s story similar to the flaming sword that turned in all directions amongst the creatures in order to keep humans out of the garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis 3:24. Genesis 3:24, Then at the east side of the garden he put living creatures and a flaming sword which turned in all directions. This was to keep anyone from coming near the tree that gives life.- 74 What could be the possible reason behind these two similarities? Could the Bible be referencing the same technology? Perhaps a UFO that is discovered through altered states of consciousness? If we continue"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 173 to read on, Ezekiel is told to eat of a scroll, that God provides in order for Ezekiel to speak on behalf of the Lord to the people of Israel. Let’s read a few passages of this account. Ezekiel 2:8-10, 3:1-3, ‘“Mortal man, listen to what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like them. Open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you.” I saw a hand reaching out toward me, and it was holding a scroll. The hand unrolled the scroll, and I saw that there was writing on both sides- cries of grief were written there, and wails and groans. God said, “Mortal man, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel.” So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. He said, “Mortal man, eat this scroll that I give you; fill your stomach with it.” I ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey.’ -75 (Psilocybin mushrooms are often preserved in honey and transfer information similar to eating a scroll of knowledge) To my mind, it is a dead giveaway that Ezekiel is given some form of psychedelic substance and is made to eat it, which is in the form of a ‘scroll’, something that ‘contains inform ation’ that ‘transfers’ to the human who digests it. If we replace the word scroll with the word mushroom, we learn that Ezekiel eats a mushroom and learns exactly what the ‘Divine’ wants him to ‘say’ to the people of Israel. This is clearly a shamanic initiation on behalf of Ezekiel. Ezekiel is not the only human in the Bible who has experience with these types of visions, and encounters with angelic creatures and heavenly craft that carry the presence of the Lord. To name a couple others, Moses and Elijah have similar initiations. Matthew,"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 174 Mark, Luke, and Peter had mystical visions of Christ upon the holy mountain. The Bible is full of shamanic knowledge, however, it is encoded within strict dogma and doctrine. One needs to only be aware of the connection between ‘shamanic wisdom’ and ‘divine visions’ in order to decipher the biblical passages. What is a UFO? In this chapter based on UFO’s, I suppose it is relevant to address the question: What exactly is a UFO? And, when we ask this question it opens up a whole can of worms full of other questions. How does a UFO fly? Is a UFO capable of time travel? If they come from a different planet, how long did it take them to arrive at Earth? Do they travel through other dimensions? Can humans duplicate this kind of vehicle? Are the UFO’s capable of cloaking themselves with invisibility? Etc... The list of questions goes on and on, until we are told publicly the truth about these UFO’s the questions will keep being asked. Entire books have been written on the questions above, so in this section I just want to address the question of what is a UFO? When addressing the main question, what is a UFO, we should recognize that these flying air craft are advanced forms of technology, that apparently existed thousands of years ago, as sightings such as the ones listed above detail. So, if these Unidentified Flying Objects aka UFO’s are an advanced form of technology, let’s determine what form of technology it is, Inner or Outer? I’m going to say UFO’s are an Outer form of Technology, as they seem to exist ‘outside’ of our consciousness. However, I could be contradicting myself by assuming that the UFO is only an Outer Technology. For all I know, the technology of the UFO’s could be dependent upon consciousness in order to function. Just as I explained how the computer on which I’m typing this book needs my consciousness in order to function. Therefore, it is possible that UFO’s,"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 175 just like computers, require some form of Inner Technology such as Human/Alien Consciousness in order to function. Then again, UFO’s may be such an advanced form of outer technology that they themselves may include some sort of inner consciousness. I don’t have the answers for you, I can only point out the possibilities, until the truth is revealed. Vehicle of the Divine In almost every ancient text, regarding the creation of earth, man, and civilization, we read about ‘God’s’ or ‘the gods’ fiery chariots, flying crafts, and heavenly vehicle-apparatus. It is obvious to a person that is looking with an open mind, that these are all examples of Unidentified Flying Objects. If these heavenly beings, spirits, angels, or lords, all arrive in some form of a technology related to the UFO, then we begin to put the pieces of the puzzle from ‘History’ together, and, then, we catch a glimpse of the ‘Vehicle’s of the Divine’ used throughout all of the Ages. Literally almost every ancient text has some form of a story related to these ‘divine vehicles’ that fly in the heavens/sky, controlled and driven by some kind of spirit, angel, lord, god, human looking entity, or heavenly beings. What is the point? Our history is full of these UFO accounts, and people seem to be reporting similar incidents exponentially during modern times. Perhaps, we are reaching a point in human history where these beings, in their heavenly craft, make themselves known to humans once again through UFO encounters and divine visions. Who comes in the UFO? If the UFO is a vehicle for the ‘Divine’, who is this Divine entity or group of entities that come in it? In order to answer this question, I must leave a large amount of room for speculation, because the description"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 176 of these beings sort of defies human logic. There are numerous accounts of ‘small beings’, ‘little people’, ‘aliens’, ‘greys’, ‘elves’, ‘fairies’, ‘goblins’, ‘angles’, ‘demons’, ‘insectoids’, ‘reptilians’, ‘humanoids’, ‘nordics’, ‘gods’, ‘extraterrestrials’, and ‘extradimensionals’ that are reported to accompany the encounter of a UFO, or abduction experience. So, you can see, out of the various descriptions regarding the ‘entities’ being reported, they are vast and seemingly different, yet very similar. To my view, perhaps each different name that we give these beings comes from the human participator’s own conditioned mind, and, therefore, two people may be observing the same entity, but the words they use to describe it may be two separate words depending on the kind of experience that the human has. A person who is awakened in the middle of the night, taken from their bed without their permission, and brought into the classic interior room of a UFO by a handful of small entities, may assume that these ‘visitors’ are not friendly and may label them as ‘demons’. However, the person who goes willing with the same entities, may look at them in a completely different light, perhaps considering them to be ‘angels’. It totally depends on the frame of mind and the attitude of the human participant, which determines the word- label given to the entities that are encountered during their experience. The most blatant point I would like to make here is that: Regardless of the word, or name, given to these ‘entities’ to describe who or what they are, the remaining point is that these ‘entities’ can be connected to all the other various ‘entities’ found in mythology, folklore, ancient texts, psychedelic visions, shamanism, and religion.

More and More Sightings I’m going to go out on a limb here to say that the reason for such an upsurge in UFO sightings during"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 177 modern times could be a direct result of the change in frequency that the Earth is experiencing. Thus, the change in the Earth’s frequency has an impact on the frequency that human brains/consciousness vibrates to. This impact may affect the human brain to the point where its glands could begin to naturally secrete psychedelic chemicals and give way to spontaneous UFO sightings, and alien abduction scenarios. If, as we have learned that our human brain’s do indeed release these chemicals into our bloodstream, and that these chemicals are known to induce alien contact experiences, then perhaps this suggestion isn’t too far from the Truth? I can assume that, if this is the case, we will without a doubt be experiencing more and more sightings related to the UFO and the Extraterrestrial phenomena. And then of course there are theories in circulation around the globe that include the possible Shift in Dimensions taking place; theories that claim that the human race is about to ascend to the 4 th dimension. Whatever this may entail, I assume that the changing frequency of the Earth gives people the reason to assume such changes are approaching us so soon. If we ascend to a different Dimension I will be there along for the ride, but I don’t believe full heartedly that this is going to happen for sure... I have a skeptical view about this theory simply because it’s too big of an assumption, and it contains a rather ‘escapism’ mentality. As opposed to looking at the research, and learning as much as we can about the reality we live in, this theory of a shift in dimensions seems a little too much like a waiting game. Instead, we could be using the information currently available to actively create a change in our reality regarding the understanding of dimensional contact with entities, dimensional travel, and human consciousness. We now are in a day of age that we can create a change in our reality simply by becoming aware of things that have remained hidden, encoded, and secretly passed along down through the ages.

"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 179 Chapter 12 - DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) T hey came to this planet, in search of life sustaining elements. When they arrived, they were surprised to find forms of life already beginning to develop and evolve. Amongst these life forms was the ape-hominid, bipedal creature, with the brain capacity for intelligence. They watched, observed, and took note of this creature with potential. With a few adjustments, this creature could become so much more than its natural course of evolution would allow. So, being the scientists that these ‘Watchers’ were, they had an advanced understanding of genetics, DNA, and the ability to influence the life-creating forces. Once the decision was made, their Council approved upon the operation, putting in place a series of requirements to be followed. And so, the ‘ape-like’ creature was taken aboard their ‘craft’, and the genetic experimentations began. Taking the DNA from this earthling creature, and the DNA from their own cosmic-genetic stock, they used their scientific/spiritual knowledge to create one of the first breeds of human. The first Adam was possibly created over 60,000 years ago. The experiment took a while to finally show some prospect, but after creating the first ‘human’, the creators began to teach this man about many things. The creators could have been accessed by the first humans through the medium of altered states of consciousness. And these creators could possibly be the spirits from a different dimension of existence. Terence McKenna came up with notion of a stoned-ape theory- the first hominids who ingested the sacred fungi could have given birth to the origins of human kind, by becoming initiated into the visions encountered during psychedelic voyages and thus led to the creation of cave art and symbolism (the very thing that separates humans"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 180 from animals). A companion was produced together with the creation of the man. This was man’s other half, woman. Man and Woman were fashioned in the image of these ‘Creators’, who were also categorized as man/woman, yin/yang. Many things followed the creation of this intelligent new species, including the direct communication between humans and their designers. Everything humans began to ‘learn’ was taught to them by the ‘Designers’. The communication between these two life forms was consistent throughout the beginning. Then, for some reason, humans lost touch with their creators, or the creators consciously decided to pull back and simply observe their ‘creation’ grow into whatever it was destined to become, intervening only when necessary. This concept of losing touch with the spirit teachers is connected to the emergence of the ‘ego’ and the transfer from the Garden of Eden into Human History. With interaction then taking place on a less frequent basis, and in the shadows of history, the ‘Watchers’ were able to influence the human’s reality without the humans being aw are of it. And after thousands of years of constant modifications, reprogramming, interaction, and influence the humans reached a point where they also were capable of becoming like their ‘Designers’. Humans are now learning and understanding the ways of DNA, genetic engineering, and computer technologies. Could this be the scenario for the creation of the Human race? And, if so, are we destined to repeat history? Will we too, one day, travel to far away galaxies in search of planets capable of sustaining life, and will we produce a species of half human/half whatever bipedal humanoids are already living off of it? Would this ensure a galactic community for humans to communicate/interact with? And, could this be one of the reasons why the ‘designers’ produced humans in the first place? We can never be certain until they make themselves known, and prove to us this is the case and"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 181 that they are our ‘cosmic parents’. Or else, this scenario is just a fancy story, and humans evolved from apes naturally leaving behind zero evidence for this to be the case. Where did we come from? Is our DNA Cosmic? Life’s Building Blocks The building blocks of Life can be found within DNA. Everything, including the information codes for a particular species of life, can be found in this. With a DNA sample, we can turn around and discover who the DNA belongs to. For example, we have reached a point in our technological/scientific understanding that, if we have a DNA sample from a child, we can in turn decode who the parents are, or are not. Our DNA is the very foundation of what makes us individually unique humans. We get half of our genetic material from our mother and the other half from our father. Their two separate DNA codes combine together to create your DNA. But this goes back to the very beginning of our species. Whoever our first ancestors were, we essentially have a portion of their DNA, transferred down the Ages through reproduction. So then you see, all humans are connected by the account that their DNA came from the first ‘Adam and Eve’ characters of humankind’s creation. But, even more exciting than this, is considering the possibility that if the story detailed above is correct, then perhaps humans may have Extraterrestrial DNA without even knowing it. Essentially DNA is the same everywhere in the universe. It is the building blocks of Life not just on planet earth, but on any planet capable of supporting it. Therefore, if the concept of DNA was there from the beginning, the moment of the ‘Big Bang’ let’s say, perhaps this ‘informational package’ coded with the ‘laws that govern life’ was destined to produce an intelligence capable of decoding/reading its message. On that note, let’s take a closer look at DNA and what it exactly is. There is a theory of how DNA spread itself"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 182 through the cosmos like the microscopic spores of the mushroom spread, and that eventually it arrived on a planet capable of sustaining life such as Earth, this theory is called Panspermia . If you can imagine the possibility of tiny microscopic molecules floating through Outer Space, these molecules contain the informational code of Life and they just wait to reproduce in the physiological natural organisms of reality. Informational Storage Package If you were to research DNA for yourself, you would stumble upon how it is a very small (so small it seems invisible to the naked eye) molecule of a double- helix design. Between the two intertwining serpents we find connections being made consisting of 4 particular proteins. I don’t want to go into too much scientific terminology, so I just want to point out what the DNA material consists of in a simple explanation. The only problem with staying simple when referring to such a complex structure as DNA is that it may not get the mysterious credit that it deserves. ‘DNA is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information and DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints, since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells, such as proteins and RNA molecules. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.’ -76"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 183 A nucleic acid ‘blueprint’ that contains the information and genetic instructions for ‘ all known living organisms !’ This little molecule is the most important ingredient in the entire universe, that is capable of manifesting Life as we know it. You really must ponder this with me, because it may seem unfathomable but - it is you, and it is me, and it is the trees outside, and the grass on the ground, the birds flying, the fish swimming, the animals of nature, the plants and fungi, the rainforest, and the planet earth which is completely connected to and engulfed by it. DNA makes every living organism. I know this is something that we don’t consistently ponder, because it is too complicated, however, when we start to learn about this little molecule, we start to learn about the very foundation of existence . Without a doubt in my mind, the informational blueprint of DNA is perfect . And therefore being perfect, its total package is used for something. Every aspect of this ‘blueprint’ must contain parts that contribute to the whole . Working together, these ‘parts’ of DNA must give us the reality that humans have come to understand, this includes our physical body, consciousness, and the world in which we live. 97% of our DNA is considered by the scientific community as ‘ junk DNA’. How can we only think that 3% of our DNA is useful, and the remaining 97% is just JUNK? Perhaps, this mysterious portion of our ‘Biological Blueprint’ is responsible for plugging us into the ‘reality-matrix’ and providing the visions of spirit encounters experienced during altered states of consciousness found amongst shamanic cultures. Stairway to Heaven In this section, I use a reference from Jeremy Narby author of, The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and Origins of Knowledge, which provides a detailed passage of how he stumbled upon the connection between DNA and"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 184 shamanism. In this enticing report, we will read about shamans from all over the world, containing the same information, which they claim they learned through their spiritual shamanic practices. Jeremy Narby tells his story: I picked up a book about a third ayahuasca-using people, entitled (in French) Vision, Knowledge, Power: Shamanism Among the Yagua in the North-East of Peru. In this study by Jean-Pierre Chaumeil (to my mind, one of the most rigorous on the subject), I found a \"celestial serpent\" in a drawing of the universe by a Yagua shaman. Then, a few pages away, another shaman is quoted as saying: \"At the very beginning, before the birth of the earth, this earth here, our most distant ancestors lived on another earth....\" Chaumeil adds that the Yagua consider that all living beings were created by twins, who are \"the two central characters in Yagua cosmogonic thought.\" These correspondences seemed very strange, and I did not know what to make of them. Or rather, I could see an easy way of interpreting them, but it contradicted my understanding of reality: A Western anthropologist like Harner drinks a strong dose of ayahuasca with one people and gains access, in the middle of the twentieth century, to a world that informs the \"mythological\" concepts of other peoples and allows them to communicate with life-creating spirits of cosmic origin possibly linked to DNA. This seemed highly improbable to me, if"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 185 not impossible. Still, I had decided to follow my approach through to its logical conclusion. So I casually penciled in the margin of Chaumeil’s text: \"twins = DNA?\" These indirect and analogical connections between DNA and the hallucinatory and mythological spheres seemed amusing to me, or at most intriguing. Nevertheless, I started thinking that I had perhaps found with DNA the scientific concept on which to focus one eye, while focusing the other on the shamanism of Amazonian ayahuasqueros. About this time, as I continued looking out for new connections between shamanism and DNA, I received a letter from a friend who suggested that shamanism was perhaps \"untranslatable into our logic for lack of corresponding concepts.\" I understood what he meant, and I was trying to see precisely if DNA, without being exactly equivalent, might be the concept that would best translate what ayahuasqueros were talking about. As I browsed over the writings of authorities on mythology, I discovered with surprise that the theme of twin creator beings of celestial origin was extremely common in South America, and indeed throughout the world. The story that the Ashaninca tell about Avíreri and his sister, who created life by transformation, was just one among hundreds of variants on the theme of the \"divine twins.\" Another example is the Aztecs’ plumed serpent, Quetzalcoatl, who symbolizes the \"sacred energy of"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 186 life,\" and his twin brother Tezcatlipoca, both of whom are children of the cosmic serpent Coatlicue. When I read the following passage from Claude Lévi- Strauss’ latest book, I jumped: \"In Aztec, the word coatl means both ‘serpent’ and ‘twin.’ The name Quetzalcoatl can thus be interpreted either as ‘Plumed serpent’ or ‘Magnificent twin.’\" A twin serpent, of cosmic origin, symbolizing the sacred energy of life? Among the Aztecs? I wondered what all these twin beings in the creation myths of indigenous people could possibly mean. I was trying to keep one eye on DNA and the other on shamanism to discover the common ground between the two. I reviewed the correspondences that I had found so far. Ruminating over this mental block, I recalled Carlos Perez Shuma’s challenge: \"Look at the FORM.\" I had looked up DNA in several encyclopedias and had noted in passing that the shape of the double helix was most often described as a ladder, or a twisted rope ladder , or a spiral staircase. It was during the following split second, asking myself whether there were any ladders in shamanism, that the revelation occurred: \"THE LADDERS! The shamans’ ladders, ‘symbols of the profession’ according to Métraux, present in shamanic themes around the world according to Eliade!\" I rushed back to my office and plunged into Mircea Eliade’s book Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy and"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 187 discovered that there were \"countless examples\" of shamanic ladders on all five continents, here a \"spiral ladder,\" there a \"stairway\" or \"braided ropes.\" In Australia, Tibet, Nepal, ancient Egypt, Africa, North and South America, \"the symbolism of the rope, like that of the ladder, necessarily implies communication between sky and earth. It is by means of a rope or a ladder (as, too, by a vine, a bridge, a chain of arnyaw, etc.) that the gods descend to earth and men go up to the sky.\" Eliade even cites an example from the Old Testament, where Jacob dreams of a ladder reaching up to heaven, \"with the angels of God ascending and descending on it.\" According to Eliade, the shamanic ladder is the earliest version of the idea of an axis of the world, which connects the different levels of the cosmos, and is found in numerous creation myths in the form of a tree . -77 The Tree of Knowledge, the Stairway to Heaven, the Serpent Rope, the Main Ingredient for Life, these are all names given to DNA. The title of this book you are reading is, ‘ The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge’, or you could also consider it to be ‘ Shamanism & DNA’ , for the two are interchangeable terms that symbolize the same concept. The reason why I chose to name this book, The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge is because it is a familiar concept to people who are affiliated with Christianity or Judaism, and yet it represents the perfect dichotomy. Forbidden Knowledge? However, this dichotomy is only so to the Christian mentality, because all around the world almost every culture considers this Knowledge to be Sacred, Holy, and True. I must ask, why do Christian"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 188 fundamentalists make such a fuss about Science, (including the science of DNA) when Science is a blatant reality, yet they still choose to ignore it and even consider it to be evil or heretical? What kind of ignorant, close-minded people are these fundamentalists? They’ll ask for your soul, your time, and your money, but they’ll do their best to prevent their sheep from waking up and running out of the cage of dogma . Why? Because these people want to control who gets access to the Stairway to Heaven, and not just let humans learn for themselves that this Stairway is within them. Scientific Conclusion Jeremy Narby goes on to explain to us the scientific evidence that he gathered to reach the conclusion that DNA and Shamanism are indeed connected to one another. And, explains the musical connection to these altered states of consciousness, similar to the frequencies often associated with alien encounters and crop circles. According to the shamans of the entire world, one establishes communication with spirits via music . For the ayahuasqueros, it is almost inconceivable to enter the world of spirits and remain silent. Angelika Gebhart-Sayer discusses the \" visual music \" projected by the spirits in front of the shaman’s eyes: It is made up of three-dimensional images that coalesce into sound and that the shaman imitates by emitting corresponding melodies. I should check whether DNA emits sound or not. It seemed that no one had noticed the possible links between the \"myths\" of \"primitive peoples\" and molecular biology. No one had seen that"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 189 the double helix had symbolized the life principle for thousands of years around the world. On the contrary; everything was upside down. It was said that hallucinations could in no way constitute a source of knowledge, that Indians had found their useful molecules by chance experimentation, and that their \"myths\" were precisely myths, bearing no relationship to the real knowledge discovered in laboratories. My investigation had led me to formulate the following working hypothesis: In their visions, shamans take their consciousness down to the molecular level and gain access to information related to DNA, which they call \"animate essences\" or \"spirits.\" This is where they see double helixes, twisted ladders, and chromosome shapes. This is how shamanic cultures have known for millennia that the vital principle is the same for all living beings and is shaped like two entwined serpents (or a vine, a rope, a ladder ... ). DNA is the source of their astonishing botanical and medicinal knowledge, which can be attained only in defocalized and \"nonrational\" states of consciousness, though its results are empirically verifiable. The myths of these cultures are filled with biological imagery. And the shamans’ metaphoric explanations correspond quite precisely to the descriptions that biologists are starting to provide. Like the axis mundi of shamanic traditions, DNA has the form of a twisted ladder (or a vine ... ); according"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 190 to my hypothesis, DNA was, like the axis mundi, the source of shamanic knowledge and visions. To be sure of this I needed to understand how DNA could transmit visual information. I knew that it emitted photons, which are electromagnetic waves, and I remembered what Carlos Perez Shuma had told me when he compared the spirits to \"radio waves\": \"Once you turn on the radio, you can pick them up. It’s like that with souls; with ayahuasca ... you can see them and hear them.\" So I looked into the literature on photons of biological origin, or \"biophotons.\" In the early 1980s, thanks to the development of a sophisticated measurement device, a team of scientists demonstrated that the cells of all living beings emit photons at a rate of up to approximately 100 units per second and per square centimeter of surface area. They also showed that DNA was the source of this photon emission. During my readings, I learned with astonishment that the wavelength at which DNA emits these photons corresponds exactly to the narrow band of visible light . Yet this did not constitute proof that the light emitted by DNA was what shamans saw in their visions. Furthermore, there was a fundamental aspect of this photon emission that I could not grasp. According to the researchers who measured it, its weakness is such that it corresponds \"to the intensity of a candle at a distance of about 10 kilometers,\" but it has \"a surprisingly high degree of"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 191 coherence, as compared to that of technical fields (laser).\" How could an ultra-weak signal be highly coherent? How could a distant candle be compared to a \"laser\"? I came to understand that in a coherent source of light, the quantity of photons emitted may vary, but the emission intervals remain constant. DNA emits photons with such regularity that researchers compare the phenomenon to an \"ultra-weak laser.\" I could understand that much, but still could not see what it implied for my investigation. I turned to my scientific journalist friend, who explained it immediately: \"A coherent source of light, like a laser, gives the sensation of bright colors, a luminescence, and an impression of holographic depth .\" My friend’s explanation provided me with an essential element. The detailed descriptions of ayahuasca-based hallucinatory experiences invariably mention bright color, and, according to the authors of the dimethyltryptamine study: \"Subjects described the colors as brighter, more intense, and deeply saturated than those seen in normal awareness or dreams: It was the blue of a desert sky, but on another planet. The colors were 10 to 100 times more saturated.\" It was almost too good to be true. DNA’s highly coherent photon emission accounted for the luminescence of hallucinatory images, as well as their three-dimensional, or holographic, aspect. On the basis of this connection, I could"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 192 now conceive of a neurological mechanism for my hypothesis. The molecules of nicotine or dimethyltryptamine, contained in ayahuasca, activate their respective receptors, which set off a cascade of electrochemical reactions inside the neurons, leading to the stimulation of DNA and, more particularly, to its emission of visible waves, which shamans perceive as \"hallucinations.\" There, I thought, is the source of knowledge: DNA, living in water and emitting photons, like an aquatic dragon spitting fire. -77 Everything Jeremy Narby discusses in his book The Cosmic Serpent , provides us with a scientific and spiritual explanations for the shamanic ‘wisdom’ which the shamans themselves receive through their own DNA. The Tree of Knowledge is embedded and encoded in our Genetic Blueprint. The Cosmic Serpent I feel obligated to write a section about the Serpent. This symbol is found in practically every myth, legend, creation story, and religion. So what does the serpent represent? Well, before I explain, we have to recognize that the serpent is a symbol that is associated with a dichotomy as well. After all, the serpent in the story about the Garden of Eden is considered to be full of wisdom, and then it is also considered, by the editors of the Bible, to be evil after it passed on the knowledge that man gained from eating the Forbidden Fruit. The serpent also symbolizes the serpentine-waveform of Kundalini (the healing energy). On top of this symbolism, the serpent clearly represents DNA. In the Gnostic traditions the serpent represents ‘divine wisdom’. Egypt civilization worshiped the serpent,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 193 African cultures do the same. In Asian culture the Dragon is revered as a sacred animal, and the dragon is a serpent with wings (Notice the Caduceus and Quetzalcoatl symbolism). Serpent worship is found all around the planet earth. And, as we’ve covered above, the serpent gives humanity knowledge. If you look up any cultural account regarding snakes and serpents, they will without a doubt include the story of knowledge being passed on to humanity by this symbolic animal. So, as we see, the serpent represents knowledge, but it also represents evil according to the ‘Christian’ view. Why? Well, the thing about Christianity is that they often use sacred/divine symbols and then flip them around to represent the opposite or negative aspect that they want their followers to stay away from. It’s not very funny when this tactic works through mass hypnotic suggestion and brainwashing. People being told that a symbol of wisdom is at the same time a symbol of evil, get contradicting information regarding the truth of what this symbol represents and are then led to believe that wisdom is evil, when in fact the opposite is the truth, lack of wisdom is what true evil is. When someone actually believes or is brainwashed to believe that a person who is affiliated with wisdom / serpents is not ‘ of Christ’, we then have a full view of what hypocrisy lies embedded within the conditioned mentality of that particular individual’s religion. Both God (Divine) and the Serpent (DNA) live within us and throughout all of creation, the two are forever intertwining, just like the spiral staircase leading to heaven . "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 194 Father of Modern Genetics The Nobel Prize-winning father of modern genetics, Francis Crick, discovered the double-helix structure of DNA through the mind-opening method of altered-states of consciousness. Crick, 1916-2004, died at age 88, and is said to have told his fellow scientist that he would often use small doses of LSD, which, was at the time, a legal experimental drug used in psychotherapy to boost the powers of thought. Francis Crick gives credit to this psychoactive compound for taking his consciousness to the molecular level of reality, so as to see the design for the building-blocks of life, DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, or simply DNA. I find it ironic, that the man who discovered this DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, was high on acid himself. LSD, aka ‘acid’, is very similar to the molecular design of neurotransmitter chemicals such as: dimethyltryptamine, and serotonin. Non-coincidentally, Francis Crick was certainly not the first human to encounter the molecular level of DNA through a psychedelic state of consciousness, shamans around the globe have encountered the serpents of DNA through their practices and methods of trance. However, Crick was the first modern ‘scientist’ to use this information to start a whole new field of Genetics. It’s all connected. From birth, to sleep, to awake, to death. It’s all connected to the entire spectrum of consciousness. Altered states of consciousness simply create faster evolutionary cycles through creative development and novelty; this seems to be a fact."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 195 Chapter 13 - The Cosmic Tree I n almost every culture we come across some kind of a story, legend, or myth regarding a Universal Tree, The Tree of Life, Family Tree, The Tree of Knowledge, or The Cosmic Tree. The tree is not only a metaphorical image for Life in the Cosmos; it also represents knowledge, nature, life-sustaining elements, and the motionless age-old wisdom. The Tree can also represent the sacrament, the holy substance, the mushroom. The image on the cover of this book is of a crop circle which indicates a Tree, (the tree of knowledge/life) with roots growing into the ground and (forbidden) fruit among its foliage. The more interesting thing about this crop circle image is that you can spin it upside down and it shows a completely different image, but one with the utmost importance. The upside down viewing of this crop circle provides us with an image of a ‘mushroom’ with its gills beneath the cap connecting to the stem, the spores from the mushroom have dropped and spread ‘mycelium’ in the ground underneath it. Of all the images I could have come across for the cover of this book, I just happened to find the perfect image that links the topics of this book into one symbol. Even more interesting to note is that it is a crop circle , therefore whoever created it (whether it be humans, aliens, orbs, or consciousness) it really doesn’t matter who is responsible. The obvious remains encoded in the image itself, the makers understand how mushrooms, trees, and the Forbidden Fruit are linked and perhaps connected to our first evolutionary leap into modern humanity. Maybe, the crop circle makers are pointing us toward a secret. The information contained in these pages is information that is related to a particular ‘knowledge’, or ‘understanding’. This particular knowledge is"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 196 connected to the Tree of Knowledge and the very dawn of our humanity. Knowledge is something learned through ‘experience’ or ‘study’. It is a ‘transfer’ of specific ‘information’ into the human ‘mind’. Does this not correspond directly to the ‘transfer of information into the consciousness of the shaman/initiate as a result of ingesting the sacrament’, the ‘Forbidden Fruit’ aka the ‘mushroom’ ??? To put things into perspective, I want to use a quote from the movie Men in Black (1997). This quote is from a conversation taking place between agent ‘K’ and initiate agent ‘J’, regarding the truth about the universe: K- “Alright kid here’s the deal. At any given time there are around 1,500 aliens on the planet. Most of them right here in Manhattan. Most of them are decent enough just trying to make a living.” J- “Cab drivers.” K- “Not as many as you’d think. Humans for the most part don’t have a clue. They don’t want or need one either. They’re happy. They think they have a good bead on things.” J- “Why the big secret. People are smart they can handle it.” K- “A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was flat. And fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet. Imagine what you will know tomorrow.” - 78 Mayan Civilization & 2012 The world we live in today is transforming at an"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 197 exceptional rate. Everything around us is changing so quickly that we barely recognize what yesterday looked like. And, to top this acceleration off, we are said to be living in the ‘Final Days’. Everyone is talking about the end of the world , the coming moment when we are finally wiped off this planet. But, what is the source of these assumptions other than Global Warming and the Book of Revelations in the Bible? If you have been paying attention the ‘ End of the World ’ game then perhaps you are familiar already with the Long Count Calendar constructed by the Mayan Civilization in Mesoamerica set with the End Date of December 21, 2012 AD. Who were these Mayans? Where did they come from? What kind of knowledge did they have, and how did they access it, in order to create a cosmic calendar based on the cycles of precession of the equinox? Fortunately we can thank John Major Jenkins and his professional work regarding the Mayan civilization and the end date in 2012. Jenkins is the author of Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, (1998). “ From studies in iconography and ethnobotany, we know the ancient Maya radically altered their perceptions in order to have visions of the underlying nature of reality. They achieved this heightened awareness through the use of hallucinogens collected from sacred plants or the Bufo marines toad. Some powerful hallucinogens, particularly psilocybin mushrooms and dimethyltryptamine (DMT and its derivative 5-MEODMT), can enhance one’s visual acuity, giving one brief access to subtle energy fields not normally visible to the eye. If the Maya cosmonauts gazed into the night sky while in such a state, and evidence I will present later suggest they did, the Galactic Center might have become"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 198 overwhelmingly obvious, a blazing energy-knot in the night sky.” -79 “It is a fact of astronomy that the December solstice sun will be in conjunction with the great bulge of the Galactic Center in the years around A.D. 2012.”- 80 “The use of visionary substances in shamanistic rituals has a long history in Mesoamerica. The archaeological records highlights a period between 600 B.C. and A.D. 100, which corresponds to the development of Maya culture and calendrics, during which visionary substances were used and revered on a large scale. The development of the Long Count calendar took place during this Pre-Classic period, and it just so happens that a vigorous mushroom cult existed in southern Mesoamerica at this time.”- 81 Jenkins wraps things up by showing us how the 2012 End Date provided by the Long Count calendar is linked directly to the sacraments of shamanic use among the Mayan civilization. “Underlying these activities and interests of Maya king-shamans is the role played by mushrooms and other psychoactive substances in the formulation of the Long Count calendar and the Hero Twin myth around 200 B.C.- indeed, in the formulation of Mesoamerican cosmology as a whole. Given that these tools of vision were in use at that time, we should not be too quick to draw limits on what these king- shamans and astronomer-priests could or could not have accomplished. The Long Count calendar-a Galactic"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 199 Cosmology-is the unique result of a shamanistic experiment seemingly conducted in secret, over perhaps three hundred years in the dimly understood Pre-Classic era. The tools of cosmic knowledge used by the ancient visionary cosmologists of Mesoamerica to discover and fine-tune their Galaxy- centered Cosmo vision were the same ones used by seekers of gnosis in other times and places-vision plants. The knowledge encoded in Galactic Long Count calendar, after being lost for centuries, is now reemerging. Apparently, just in time .” -82 Hopefully, this reference will be helpful to make sense of the rumors and gossip surrounding the mystery of the 2012 end date. From my understanding, the Mayan use the metaphor of ‘breathing’ to describe the transition of phases in time. The date of December 21, 2012 is considered to be the still pause corresponding to the galactic alignment during the ‘out-breath’ just before it begins its new phase of breathing-in. We are transitioning from yin to yang. Darkness to the Light. There are a number of possible suggestions of what might occur at the moment this astronomical alignment takes place around the years of 2012. If we find out what the Maya predict is going to happen we discover their altered states of consciousness reflected the future of humanity. Multidimensional understanding of the universe in which we live in, consisting of ‘serpent ropes’, ‘worm holes’, ‘star gates’ that lead to contact with trans-dimensional beings, will open up in the sky and give birth to a humanity that is part of the Cosmic Tree who is finally sprouting its leaves, spreading its wings, and taking its natural form in the womb of the Cosmic Mother, The Galactic Center. "},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 200 Pregnant Mother of the Cosmos The Galactic Center of the Milky Way is thought to be the womb from which our universe was birthed according to Mayan mythology. The universe is considered to be the Mother, with the feminine-energy that gives Birth to Life. The center of the Milky Way is the portal from which this material and non-material universe came from. It is said that when the Mayan king-shamans entered altered states of consciousness and stared into the night sky, they viewed this equatorial space dividing the galaxy into two lobes, left and right, masculine and feminine, yin and yang, science and spirituality, and this was the portal in which spirit was given birth. Not only does information accessible through altered-states of consciousness come through this portal, but also the souls of man are said to pass through this galactic center before birth and after death. The chemical connection between the human brain’s natural psychoactive compounds and the shamanic plants and fungi containing these similar chemicals used by the Pre-Classic Mayan civilization suggest that the end date of 2012 and psychedelics are clearly linked. Perhaps, the birth process in which we ourselves are about to undergo during this transformational process will result in latent abilities in our human DNA capable of perceiving ‘other dimensions’ and ‘dimensional entities’ through the spontaneous and natural cosmic release of psychoactive ingredients found in the human brain and in resonance with the Galactic Center. This is a similar process to human birth. We enter this world through a sacred portal, the mother’s vulva. Which by the way, nearly 85% of human figures represented in pre-historic cave art are female; the worship of the goddess was abundant in ancient times. Before we are born, we are in the mother’s ‘womb’, similar to humanity in the past thousands of years of ‘darkness’. We are experiencing the birth-pains that accompany the birth of a new life. We are in the final stages of birth,"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 201 and once we come through the cosmic portal, we enter a new dimensional mode of perceiving the universe in which we live in. There is nothing to fear about this. Is a baby scared to leave its mother’s womb? How can it be scared of something it has never experienced? We can’t fathom what this birth process will be like because we have never experienced it collectively as a global human race before. I, for one, am thrilled and excited to experience this transformation as it is already on its way and soon will be here entirely. I wanted to use a lyric selection from the song ‘ How can you live in the Northeast?’ by musician Paul Simon. “How can you be a Christian? How can you be a Jew? How can you be a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Hindu? How can you? Weak as the winter sun, we enter life on earth. Names and religion comes just after date of birth .”- 83 Whatever religion or philosophy you cling to, or stamp on your forehead, it doesn’t matter, these things all come after the FACT that you are born a human being living on planet Earth which resides in an ‘Infinite Multi-dimensional Cosmic Organism’ that is constantly evolving and changing . Humans are not meant to be one specific mold. They should let their uniqueness shine with the light from within, and not let themselves become ‘Brainwashed’ by what society and everyone else is conforming to. Be Yourself. Think for Yourself. Find the God Within. Mother Cosmos knows what she is doing, and she understands herself better than we can ever presume, so humans simply need to ‘ let go’ and let the cosmos unfold itself the way it naturally has for billions of years of pregnancy. The new child it gives birth to will undoubtedly be as magnificent as any human mind can imagine. And, we are the humans that are intended to experience this transformation. How blessed are we to reincarnate during the birthing process? Our children"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 202 and their children will be raised in a different kind of universe than the one previously experienced and understood by our parents and their parents. The process has already begun, Mother Earth is screaming from the pains of the birth and we experience this through the change in weather, the hurricanes, earthquakes, storms, and the polar ice-caps melting. Be prepared to experience something humanity has never gone through collectively, the birth of a new kind of human understanding with a solid connection and communication with the Mother Cosmos. We will be infants in the playpen of the universe at first, but we will finally be able to grow into galactic adulthood through this process. The trans-dimensional entities and spirits that have taught our ancestors in the past will once again take on a new spiritual/scientific lesson plan for the human race and will begin to ‘teach’ us in a cosmic school through our DNA and consciousness, in altered states and in our dreams. If we pay close attention, the lessons that we can learn, are priceless and evolutionary. It is all within us, inside our bodies, inside our consciousness, and we are the ones who have access to this potential, latent in our own DNA, our own Divine Encyclopedia. It is just waiting for us to read into it, for us to tap into its mysterious secrets. Can you summon the courage to explore your own consciousness? If so, you are one step ahead of those humans who are in constant fear of the world. Leonardo Da Vinci & Alchemy In this section, I want to highlight the genius of Leonardo Da Vinci, the brilliant Renaissance artist and alchemist. Particularly, I would like to highlight one of Leonardo’s paintings called ‘ The Adoration of the Magi’. This painting is apparently considered to be a ‘Johannite’ piece, ‘Johannite’ meaning worship of John the Baptist as the true Christ figure. Apparently Da Vinci practiced the ‘Johannite religion’ and this painting"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 203 is supposedly a depiction of this. However, I see a blatant connect in this painting to the worship of the Forbidden Fruit/Tree of Knowledge, because John the Baptist is associated with a Tree and is depicted in such a manner in ‘The Adoration of the Magi’. So, apparently the theory is that this background depiction of a ‘Tree’ being worshipped by healthy young glowing people is supposed to represent the worship of John the Baptist, and in the foreground we see the baby Jesus surrounded by ghoulish worshippers. Thus, people assume that Da Vinci is telling us the ‘Tree’ is the true ‘Christ’. And, I suspect that this is exactly what Da Vinci is telling us, however, I disagree with the theory of the Tree representing John the Baptist. Instead, because that connection has no significance other than trading places of the ‘Christ figure’ from one man to another man, I feel Da Vinci had an understanding of the Tree of Knowledge. The alchemical tree. And the worship of this Tree is obvious in the painting of the ‘Magi’. Alchemy is one of the most fascinating forms of understanding the transformational processes found in nature. The use of art to show knowledge and wisdom is the key ingredient in Alchemy. And it is clear that Da Vinci was an excellent artist and alchemist. What purpose would there be in Da Vinci simply trying to convince the world that the true ‘Christ’ was not Jesus but was John? This would be just as pointless and useless as thinking Jesus was the original Christ. If we understand that neither of these men were Christ, but instead they both understood the knowledge of undergoing the alchemical process of becoming the Christ, we can assume that Da Vinci too, had this knowledge and partook of it and expressed his understanding through his alchemical paintings. Shamanism is just another word for Alchemy in my book. Both are not a religion, per say, but they both use the process of spiritual transformation through the knowledge of the psychoactive chemicals. So in other words, Da Vinci was a shaman."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 204 The philosophical alchemical tree, also known as the ‘Sephiroth Tree’, is indebted to the Opus Magnum, meaning ‘The Great Work’. “The Great Work is a term which originated in medieval European alchemy which refers to the successful completion of the transmutation of base matter into gold or the creation of the philosopher's stone. It has subsequently been used as a metaphor for spiritual transformation in the Hermetic tradition.”- 84 In other words, as I understand it, the process of learning how to decalcify the pineal gland through the use of psychedelic plants/fungi in order to stimulate the pineal gland to possibly , naturally secrete the alchemical ‘philosopher’s stone’, (DMT) and thus, giving birth to a new spiritual perspective/insight within the human alchemist/initiate/shaman. Being an alchemist, I’m positive Da Vinci knew when he painted the Tree depicted in ‘The Adoration of the Magi’ that this symbol was a key figure in the alchemical/shamanistic practice. But, because of the time span in which these alchemists lived was one of great power for the Church, they had to hide their wisdom through symbolism and paintings in order to get their knowledge out into the public for all to see, without being executed for the heretical knowledge that it implies. As we have already discussed the brutal force in which the Church’s Inquisition would murder any person with an opposing stance against the Churches doctrines, it is obvious why these alchemists would have went about portraying their knowledge through symbolism and paintings. The word heresy in Greek means ‘choice’, but to the Catholic Church it means ‘the enemy’. “ Hardly any published work of alchemical history was more talked about than the Mute Book (Mutus Liber) which, like a rebus, hides its messages"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 205 in a sequence of 15 plates. The first edition was published in 1677 in La Rochelle.”- 85 The quote above was taken from The Hermetic Museum of Alchemy and Mysticism. In this book, we find wonderful illustrations and paintings from alchemy that teach us about the hidden wisdom the alchemists had gathered. In this particular work, the Mute Book , we see 15 plates that consist of different paintings associated with the alchemical process. In every one of these images lies a hidden process which the spirit goes through during the alchemical transformation. To my perspective, these images are a clear representation of the pineal glands secretion of heavenly spiritual chemicals that are manifested through the central oven, aka-pineal, and the two alchemists, male and female, representing the two hemispheres of the brain working together to create this alchemical experience. The first plate shows a depiction of a ladder in the middle with angels ascending and descending blowing their horns to wake up a human who lies sleeping on the ground below the ladder, all within a border of a plant vine which is in the shape of a portal/tear drop/chemical ingredient. The human is being awakened from his sleeping state of consciousness to the enlightened consciousness of the ‘Christ.’ Following this first plate’s image, we find a series of plates depicting images of the alchemical process, turning one thing into another, always through the process of two beings working together to create a chemical transmutation within the human brain. The final plate depicts the human returning to his body, now with a halo above his head, symbolizing enlightenment/Christ consciousness, being led by two cherubim/angels. This is the Alchemical process of manufacturing the ‘Philosopher’s Stone’, the ‘Dew’, the ‘Manna’ sent from heaven. And without a doubt, Da Vinci understood this process, and thus points us in this direction through his painting of ‘The Adoration of the Magi’ which depicts the Tree of Knowledge being"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 206 worshipped as the central Christ figure. Family Tree of DNA Not only does the Tree represent Knowledge, it also is a clear representation of our Family Tree. As we have touched on DNA and how our parents give birth to us and by doing so create another branch on the Family Tree. This Tree of DNA goes all the way back to our ancient ancestors, those first humans who had the modern double-helix design of DNA passed it down to their children and now we are the result of this growing tree, that is known as the Family Tree of DNA. When we look at a tree, it is not solid or filled with solidity, you may notice, just like in music, the spaces between the branches, leaves, or notes and tones in music, are clearly just as important as the material substance of the tree. This Space within the tree appears to be empty, just like Outer Space , yet it connects the substances that sustain Life in the Universe, such as planets/heavenly bodies. The Tree is the perfect metaphor for Life and Reality. Trees, Wands, & Mushrooms The shape of a tree is so universal, a genuinely phallus shaped object with a bulging head full of foliage. It isn’t very difficult to witness the similarities in the shape of the Tree and the shape of a Mushroom. The two can be used as interchangeable concepts, as we have learned already about the connection between the ‘Tree of Knowledge’ and the ‘Forbidden Fruit’. It should be easy for you to recognize the link between these two natural wisdom teachers. Not only are mushrooms linked to trees in a very symbiotic fashion, these two objects are also divinely linked to the ‘magic wand’. Yes, the infamous wand of the wizards and magicians alike. And, how could we leave out the witches broom"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 207 stick? The broom stick being another obvious representation of a ‘wand’, ‘rod’, or ‘staff’-like object used for ‘magical’ purposes and effective in manifesting things in reality. This often ‘staff-like’ object used by the magicians, wizards, or witches has a very strong implication towards a higher understanding that seems to be connected across various parts of the Earth. Seemingly, this higher understanding is portrayed through the ‘symbolism’ and the ‘practices’ of these magical human figures. The ‘wand’ could be the ‘mushroom’ which comes from ‘The Tree of Life’ because it is, in fact, a life form just like the human species that thrives on planet Earth. Therefore, I am suggesting that altered states of consciousness are common place among magical/mystical practitioners who effectively portrayed their ‘wisdom’ and ‘understanding’ through symbolism. In other words, we are talking about ‘shamanism’!!! Spinal Column Understandably, the shape of a wand, mushroom, or even a tree, is synonymous with the shape of the column of spine found in the human body. Yes, the human spinal column could also very well be the ‘true magician’s wand’. This pillar grows just like a tree from the moment our cell splits into two and our human form begins to take shape in the womb of our mother. And, what kind of ‘mushroom cap’ or ‘flowering foliage’ do we have on top of our spinal column?-The Human Brain, which harbors the ingredients for manifesting reality, including the Pineal Gland. So, you see, in a matter of taking four seemingly separate things: (The Tree, Mushroom, Magic Wand, and Human Spinal Column) we can see how they are all linked together in a symbiotic fashion. To provide more proof of this knowledge, let’s take a look at the work of William Henry, investigative mythologist. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 208 William Henry’s work ‘William Henry has been doing historical and mythological detective work on the suppressed secrets of Jesus and Mary Magdalene for more than 20 years. Now, he goes beyond The Da Vinci Code and Holy Blood, Holy Grail and pierces the veil of mysteries enshrouding this intriguing pair.’ ‘Henry reveals sensational new research he has gleaned from forbidden texts, and discloses teaching deciphered from clues encrypted in religious art and legend. In Mary Magdalene: The Illuminator, journey to the core of the inscrutable Mary Magdalene to discover knowledge of the “ultimate secret”- of the Tower or Ladder to God, also called the Stairway to Heaven.’- 86 In his books, William does an incredible job of laying out the pieces of the puzzle that have been latent and forbidden in the past, which relate to the secret knowledge that is being discussed in my book. This is such a profound and wonderful amount of research that William Henry provides for us. I highly recommend purchasing any of his books and reading them through, to grasp some of the most profound implications that are revealed in every culture, religion and ancient text/art but yet seem to be hidden from the public awareness. While referring to the Sumerian legend about the Anunnaki, William Henry asks the question about the origins of the human race, in the quote found below: ‘Zecharia Sitchin, proposes that in his interpretation of the Sumerian myths, that the Anunnaki came here to mine gold. And they created the human body as a tool, as a worker force to mine this gold for them. But my thinking started"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 209 to change on it, when I realized that the name of the god who performed this genetic manipulation, according to Sumerian myth, his name is Enki. And this god Enki is also considered to be the god of smith-craft and alchemy. And so as I am thinking about this, I’m wondering, now why doesn’t this alchemist, a person who is capable of transmuting base metals, especially iron or lead, into gold, why do they need to come to Earth and create a slave race in order for them to mine that gold for him? Why wouldn’t he just grab a hunk of space rock, and transmute it? So, what I began to think about, and this became sort of the center piece of my research that led me to the whole ‘starwalkers’ idea, is that, in alchemy the idea of lead, and the idea of the impure soul, are interchangeable. And what the alchemist is trying to do, is transmute impure metal, or an impure soul, into a pure soul, which is symbolized by gold. So I began to wonder, and I posed the question, and I still pose it, what if these ancient gods didn’t come here for gold? What if they came here and manipulated the human body, not to mine gold, but to mine souls? What if the human body is some kind of a tool, from the souls perspective, that it uses to return to the heavens, for example. So that the soul can become a ‘starwalker’ once again. And that really opened up a whole lot of questions in my imagination, about just what exactly are the capabilities of this human body? And I began to get away"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 210 from the idea of referring to the human body as body, I refer to it as a plant. When we think of the word plant, like in Detroit where I grew up, a lot of my family members worked at the plant. And what they worked at was a manufacturing facility. And, so what if the human body is a manufacturing facility? What if it is a plant? Well, what is this body capable of manufacturing? As it turns out, all the esoteric traditions they talk about various oils and secretions that the human body is capable of manufacturing, that bring about the enlightenment of that body, or that plant. And that I believe is, those are the inner most secrets that we are talking about. That they don’t want us to know about, is that we’ve been given this incredible plant, that is capable of manufacturing some amazing oils and other products that can bring about our own awakening, and our own enlightenment.’- 87 Humans should understand what it is they are, or else we get into the situation we are in today where people are confused, wars rage, and children are coming into this world wondering what the hell is wrong with all the grown-ups. Wake up humanity and ask yourself these questions: What am I? Who am I? Where am I? How am I? and Why am I? Don’t let the television broadcast these answers into your mind- don’t let someone else think for you. Think For Yourself. Symbiosis Humans have a symbiotic relationship with nature, trees especially. When I was in science class"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 211 during high school, we learned about oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Let us go over the basics here, and learn about human breathing: ‘When we humans breathe, we breathe through our lungs. The air we pull in when we inhale through our nose and our mouth moves into our bronchial tubes, then into our avaoli sacks, and from there into our blood stream. Once in the blood stream the oxygen travels through our bodies. At the same time we are breathing in the oxygen we are exhaling the carbon dioxide. The CO² leaves our bodies when we exhale.’ -88 Trees are the exact opposite of humans in the sense that instead of breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide, their role is reversed and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out, and they breathe out the oxygen that humans need to breathe in, in order to survive. What an amazing relationship humans have with trees. They are like the exact opposite of what we are, if trees represent yin than humans represent yang in this relationship. Humans think they are so smart and they move all over the world, traveling seeing sights and spreading civilization, war, and philosophies. But the trees remain still, in meditation, full of wisdom and life. The trees don’t need to do anything but remain what they are. While humans are constantly trying to figure out what we are, trees have it all figured out. Perhaps we need to focus on the relationships humans share with trees and nature, before it’s too late. Rainforest The rainforest is much like the lungs of the Earth, we must preserve this life sustaining element, and the knowledge collected by the indigenous tribes who live amongst the rainforest. If we would stop destroying"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 212 this beautiful Garden of Eden, perhaps humans could return to a state of Peace and Harmony with Mother Nature. The rainforest provides us with enough oxygen to survive on this planet and for some reason we can’t help but try to kill it for absolutely no long-term reasoning. Simply greed and corruption. If only we knew how dire the situation is. Yet, Western Society is completely entrapped by their illusional and delusional mind-sets. Brainwashed by a box in the middle of the living room, the West fails to give credit to the knowledge that our ancestors possessed and the wisdom of the indigenous cultures that live in harmony with nature. Why? Indigenous Human Understanding To end this chapter, I feel it is very important for me to emphasis the ‘wisdom’ of the indigenous cultures around the world. These humans, who live in harmony with nature, have developed over thousands of years a relationship with the plants, fungi, flowers, trees, grass, and animals of their natural habitat. These are humans, just like you and me, only they have had the privilege of not being brainwashed by a system of corruption. Indigenous humans are some of the most natural forms of the human being that can be found on planet Earth. Their religions, philosophies, wisdom, and knowledge are all said to come from nature herself. The sacred plants that they use for medicinal, spiritual, and psychological purposes have been used for thousands of years and certainly do contain healing properties that Western medicine still has yet to resonate with. Everything, the human being needs, is supplied by the Garden of Eden, the Planet Earth. Why, then, must humans feel the desire to dismiss the wisdom and knowledge gathered by shamanic cultures around the world? I feel that Western humanity is being purposely Distracted by some authoritarian force, who doesn’t want to give us this knowledge that can set us free and"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 213 transform the world and nature of reality that we live in. For, if humans did have an understanding of this secret knowledge, they would no longer depend on the power- force that feeds them the bullshit day in and day out. If humans can survive without government in perfect harmony with Mother Nature, as indigenous cultures do, why then do we feel we need to cling to a decaying model of understanding? Politics are reserved for old men saying “murrmurr murr murr murr, blah blah blah” with no final solution to save the human race. These humans in positions of power are full of shit. Just listen to the crap that spills out of their programmed mouths. I promise that if you were to have two speakers talking to you about reality and life, if one was a shaman and other was a politician, you would notice a distinct difference in tone, meanings, and understanding. Because, of course, as you have already heard any politician spill their shit-filled brain with nonsense, broken promises, and Fear-inducing Lies, the shaman on the other hand will open your mind and show you how to find your soul and it’s deeper connection/relationship to the planet and the cosmos through Love. Use your brain. Which one is more promising?? The Truth, or Lies? Your intuition and your spirit can tell the difference, but can your programmed mentality? I hope so, because after all-there is no Love in Fear, and these are the only two choices we have to decide from. Humans are a representation of Love, we must never forget this."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 215 Chapter 14 - Predictions & Possibilities W e have reached the point in this book where I will provide a few predictions or possibilities for the future. When we predict things we base our predictions on past events and evidence that helps us form the predictable possibilities. When I look into the history of the human race, I can clearly see that we are influenced by our surroundings, our habitat, and our environment. In ancient times, we had a strong influence from Nature and psychoactive plants, which gave birth to spirituality which in turn gave birth to civilization. However, in modern times, humanity seems to be disconnected from this once very powerful influence and relationship to nature and is now influenced by the disease of society, materiality, and industrialization. But, if we are wise, we know that the relationship between humans and nature will never cease to exist because humans are a part of nature-eternally. We may collectively build disease infested cities that contain the darkest of humanities secrets, but we also have built the philosophies, mythologies, and sacred teachings that have been passed down throughout the ages. And it is the latter constructions that define what humans are capable of, not the former. If humans with the help from the Internet and various technological breakthroughs, including the technology of the inner mind, begin to learn collectively the truth about who and what they are, they will never ever be the same again. The Revolution A Revolution is underway and has been since the dawn of humanity, there is no stopping it because the human mind is a mind capable of self-awareness, and therefore self-actualization."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 216 “I think, therefore, I AM.”- 89 This was the philosophy adopted by Rene Descartes in the 17 th century and soon implemented into the Western model of philosophy. Because of this particular concept, humans will always long for the truth. The Revolution we are all participating in is not one that is fought with guns and weapons. No my friends, it is a Revolution fought by the psyche, the consciousness, the spirit. Very simply put, there are two sides against each other in the revolutionary war: On the right-Love-Peace-Wisdom-Truth, and on the left-Fear- War-Power-Control. It’s blatantly obvious; one needs only to open one’s eyes in order to recognize this dichotomy. Which side do you resonate with? There can only be one victor in this revolution, and without a doubt, Love will be the overcoming force that defeats Fear. Fear is very powerful and it feeds of our darkest thoughts, but, my dear fellow humans, the power of the light shining in total darkness will shine brightly forever and illuminate the Truth within each and every one of us. I am reminded of the old Sunday-school song: “This little light of mine, I’m going to let it shine, Let it Shine, Let it Shine, Let it Shine.”- 90 This was the light that was passed on to me, and to you, and to the fellow humans of the planet Earth. We shouldn’t expect the darkness to engulf such a powerful illuminated light within us. Possibilities With the information I’ve presented to you in this book, perhaps we can predict future possibilities regarding the use of this knowledge. “People say that I am a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. I hope someday you’ll join us, and the world will live as one.”- John Lennon Imagine . -91 I, too, am a dreamer when I present these"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 217 theories of possible predictions for the future, but trust me I’m not the only one. Just like John Lennon and the thousands of humans that know something is very wrong on our planet and that something needs to change. Quantum physics proves that everything consists of infinite possibilities , anything can happen and very much could happen. Therefore, please indulge yourself in my prediction theory for the future of humanity. The Prediction Theory Reaching the end date of the Mayan calendar on December 21, 2012, there is the possibility that humans around the globe will undergo a radical shamanic initiation through the spontaneous and mass floods of the most powerful psychedelic substance known to man, possibly being secreted naturally from the human pineal gland as a result of a resonance reached through the frequency increase of the planet Earth. This frequency will provide a resonating vibration for the human consciousness to slip naturally into Alter-states of consciousness in order to pick up other dimensional realms, and the entities that inhabit these dimensions. This will, without a doubt, radically change the human’s perspective of the universe in which they live in. Giving birth to a new human understanding, and possibly a ‘Golden Age’ or the ‘Age of Aquarius’- ‘The Age of Information’ -‘The Age of En light enment’ -‘The Age of Illumination’ or ‘The Age of Truth’. This is not far from being a possibility as we are already witnessing the results of this increase in frequency on our planet and the paralleled exponential rise in ‘alien contact’ and ‘UFO sightings’. We are living in the end times of course, but the end is not truly an end. Instead, it is simply a new beginning. I can predict that more and more seemingly ‘paranormal’ or ‘supernatural’ activity will continue to increase during the following years, and that eventually all humans will have their own personal supernatural experiences to give them their own understanding about"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 218 the universe in which they reside. ITZ Cosmic Sap (Manna) The Mayans say that around 2012 A.D. from the center of our galaxy out of the sky will fall ‘Serpent Ropes’ or ‘Stargates’ that will shower the Earth with a blessed substance named ‘ ITZ’ described as a cosmic sap. SAP is an acronym for sub-atomic-particles. According to the modern Maya of today, ‘ITZ’ is a human body excretion like sweat, tears, or semen and that this (blessed rain) opens a portal during shamanic rituals. This sub-atomic-particle substance named ‘ITZ ’ by the Mayans is also called ‘ Manna’ according to the Egyptians and the Bible. ‘ Manna’ is also synonymous with ‘ mushrooms’, appearing over night like ‘ dew’ of the morning provided by the ‘Divine’ for humans to eat and sustain their spiritual and physical hunger. And, of course, the link between mushrooms and natural human excretions is more than obvious when noticing the relationship between molecular structures of these two similar psychoactive chemicals, DMT and Psilocybin. ‘ ITZ ’ is a term similar to ‘Izapa’, the Mayan culture well versed and familiar with the shamanic use of bufo marine toads which contain 5-MeODMT a powerful hallucinogen. The shamans of the Izapa left behind a cultural understanding through their preserved art work upon stones on how they understood the nature of reality and the use of shamanic knowledge for centuries down the road to pick up on and learn from the past. In Switzerland today, a scientific project is underway named CERN, with an objective of creating a ‘sub-atomic-particle accelerator’, technology capable of proving the ‘ existence of multiple dimensions. ’ As of 2008, this possibility is looking most interesting.

Yes, I think this is a great thing because it could eventually mean the end of ‘countries’, no more ‘nationalism’. The very thing that seems to start wars, ‘Divide and Rule’. With one global tribe of humans collectively living on this planet sharing all the world, there will be no more restrictions put in place by Totalitarian government structures. Understand, that politicians recognize that globalization is happening and their main agenda is to put in place a systematic global New World Order. This is fundamentally based on the concepts of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, World Domination and World Control. We, as a human family, CANNOT let this happen. We cannot let these corrupt people in offices around the world dictate and control every aspect of our understanding. We are the ones who control our own versions of reality. We can create a global community/global tribe without the Totalitarian Government controlling everything. This is very simple and it is based on understanding yourself and the nature of the universe in which you live in . No more, no less. Humans can and very soon could be leaving behind their old dogmas, religions, philosophies, conformities, and government structures for something much better, Universal Peace and Understanding. Think about it, what need is there for an Authoritarian Power or a Systematic Institution put in place-in the shape of a pyramid-with those people at the top knowing the truth and secrets, keeping these from the bottom of the system, the peasants? No longer will we be required to adhere to the governmental policies and institutions in order to live and be free and know the truth about yourself.

The freedom that the USA preaches is one of specified versions of freedom, and ironically enough this does not include the freedom to control your own consciousness . Of course, once you turn 21, the USA allows its citizens to drink alcohol (the drink that makes you act stupidly) and buy cigarettes (the drug with no medicinal benefits), but never un-taxed medicinal plants. Yearly alcohol-related deaths = 85,000 - statistic from Journal of the American Medical Association. Yearly deaths from tobacco = 440,000 - statistic from Centers for Disease Control. Yearly deaths caused by Marijuana = 0 - statistic from U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network. Does this make any sense at all? We allow our citizens to partake in substances that have no medicinal value, but for some reason we condemn the use of natural plants that have zero death-related incidents per year. And the more ridiculous concept is that marijuana actually helps ease the pain and enhance the appetite of cancer, aids, and chemo patients, but our government still has difficulty in allowing this medicine to be legally available. The USA is the most hypocritical country in the world, we hide behind our false versions of freedom and democracy and then turn around and enforce this illusion onto other countries. Think about it. You are born a human being on the planet earth. You are given a body and a brain free from all external stimuli but after the years go by, the innocence of your child-consciousness is raped by the systematic conditioning of the human mind put in place by our schools, religions, nations and societies. This conditioning is NOT who you are. You are instead the source of life, light, and love-infinite consciousness. But, for some reason, we need to be told we are ‘Free’ by authorities that are higher up on the ‘ladder of life’ than we supposedly are. My friends, you have always been free.

Please use your thoughts to manifest a positive reality. The whole concept of the ‘American Dream’, is exactly that, a dream. When you wake up from this dream, you see what it actually is, just an illusion ! Human Imagination & Creativity I have a hope, that one day the human race will wake up from the conditioning process that has been running the course of history for thousands of years, and will learn the truth about the nature of reality and the nature of their own- bodies/consciousness/spirits. We could live life in peace as one human race upon our planet Earth, and we could extend our understanding out into the rest of the universe, perhaps colonizing various planets capable of sustaining life similar to the Earth. This may have been the foundation for our own human origin. The most important key is the Human Imagination. Creativity is the marker that made us what we are today and it will without a doubt be the marker that makes us what we are tomorrow. If we collectively use our imagination to dream up a better universe, than this image will manifest itself in front of our eyes. I believe humans are naturally born pure and innocent and the only thing that brings negativity into our world is our lack of understanding and th e process of conditioning as the children grow into adults. Instead of emphasizing conditioned mentality, we should emphasize the humane aspect of being alive, and then the future would be one that is led by Compassion and Love.

If you have been paying attention, I think it is more than obvious the connection being made between these two corresponding concepts, Christ & Anointed. The anointed human is the human whose third eye has been awakened; the pineal gland has secreted the anointing oil. This anointing oil is the blood of ‘Christ’, the mystical ‘dew’, the ‘manna’ from heaven. Completely and nothing but psychedelic in nature, this anointing oil provides the human consciousness with access to the ‘Stairway to Heaven’ the ‘Dimensional Portals’ the ‘Stargates’ that lead to contact with heavenly beings and limitless knowledge. I suggest that the proclaimed ‘Return of Christ’ is absolutely connected to the mysterious predictions surrounding the Maya’s 2012 end date-revealing the transformation of human consciousness into cosmic explorers, becoming ‘ Christ -like’, finally reaching ‘Christ Consciousness’ and becoming the ‘ Anointed ones’ or the ‘illuminated ones’. This may occur as a result of the astronomical alignment with the center of the galaxy in 2012, or through a rise in the Earth’s base frequency, or through the 100 th monkey syndrome, or through ET contact, or through spontaneous secretions of DMT in the pineal gland, or through breakthrough discoveries in science and spirituality. But, first, we must undergo the radical balancing act including the worst sides of humanity represented by this ‘War on Terror’. Or, as the current President of the USA pronounces it, with his Texan accent, “The War on Terra”. Every single time he pronounces the ‘War on Terra’ he is embedding this mantra into the mass consciousness that there is a ‘War on Earth’, because, Earth is also known as, Terra. This creation of a ‘Fear- Inducing War on the Human Spirit’ must come to an end before we can have the peaceful future that we dream of for tomorrow.

It was past midnight, but they were young, free and willing to see where the road would take them. The destination was a house filled with college-aged humans who were all acting kind of funny... The boys ended up finding out why. After half an hour had gone by, the one boy daring enough to try the sacrament began to notice its side effects, constant laughing and a morphological field of vision. What was this? Whatever was in the sacrament made the boy feel very strange. He kept muttering, “I’m freakin’ out, guys, I’m freakin’ out!” But those humans that surrounded him understood what the boy was experiencing. An initiation was underway. Surrounded by complete strangers, yet somehow, at the same time, these were his brothers and sisters, this was his human race, his species family. Members from this race of earth species were indeed close to the boys heart, everyone he had ever known: His mother, father, sister, family members, friends, acquaintances, and everyone in between; all members of this species. After several hours of heavy contemplation, with the expansion of thought capacity and analytical reasoning followed by mysterious conundrums, the boy then spent time ‘drawing’ images that spontaneously came to mind: mostly swirls, flowing lines that resemble cave art, and alien eyes, which all were insisting to be drawn upon the blank piece of paper, with the black ink-pen held in the boy’s primate grip. Arriving at his mother and father’s house with everyone sound asleep at 6 am, he walked down the stairs noticing the family pictures surrounding"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 226 him. Each picture contained happy, smiling faces of family members. The boy had never sat and contemplated in-depth the reasoning behind these pictures. The faces that he loved so dearly were nothing but a piece of paper behind a frame. The actual love that he felt was not towards a picture, but towards the spirit of these people. His Family, His Love. Everything the boy knew, he knew he had learned or been conditioned to know by a system that was put in place before his birth. But why? Could this boy not be himself without external stimuli telling him what he is? The boy had a radical awakening and began to sob, crying his heart out. His love was so much that it felt like it was going to burst out of his chest and flood the entire basement with his Tears of Love. Thankful for this opportunity. Thankful for his life. The boy, then knew what his purpose on this planet is. With so many years of preparing for this moment while never realizing it, the boy received a download of in formation that filled his philosophical mind with potential for it’s input to go through an alchemical process and become output for others to interpret. His thoughts seemed to be flowing into the top of his head, through his body, his being, and through his soul, coming out in the form of Love & Humility. Everything was at One. All of Humanity was One. One Divine. Oneness. Whatever this sacrament was, he could not have known that this experience would be the result of ingesting it. Only by taking that chance, that curious leap into the unknown, the mysterious, the other side, would the boy have had this initiation into the shamanic ways of life. The boy, now, had been initiated into the profound realms of Mystery and Spirit, and would never be the same again. No person could have told him or showed him anything that would have induced this kind of experience. Only, and literally only would ingesting the sacrament have produced such an experience, a mystical-state of consciousness.’ "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 227 Final Conclusion It’s been four years since that first initiation, and I can never forget the impact it has had on my life. I began reading, studying, researching, and absorbing as much information about what I had experienced and I certainly would not be writing this book if it was not something that I felt was of sincere importance. Whatever happened to me on that night changed my life forever. Prior to undergoing this initiation I was considered to be a practicing ‘Christian’ and a musician. Of course, I am still a musician. This initiation only provided me with proof of the reasoning behind being a musician, the magical aspects involved in creating music. However, I truly began to observe my religion, my world views, my conditioned opinions. These things were not who I was. Whatever label I would apply to myself was nothing but a label. I realized that humans certainly don’t need to profess worship to some hidden deity in order to experience the divine, love and spirit. Of course, each person has certain philosophies that resonate well with them, but I ask you this, who are you really? How can you be something that separates yourself from the rest of humanity? You are still a Human. So whatever title you give yourself, Christian, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, Hindu, Agnostic, Atheist, etc. it is simply a word that describes your programmed thoughts. But your programmed thoughts are not who you truly are. You are infinite consciousness and always have been. When a child is born into this 3 rd Dimension, he/she is no label, no word, no religion, no philosophy, no program. They are pure and innocent representations of the Spirit of Nature. How can we insist on raising our children on what religious concepts we were raised, when we have never questioned why we were in the first place?

Let me ask you this question and you can ponder it in your mind for the next few days. David Icke has said this before, and I will paraphrase him here: “I wonder, what is the difference between parents that raise their children Jewish, parents that raise their children Christian, and parents that raise their children to be Muslim? Absolutely Nothing!! They are all doing exactly the same thing. Conditioning their children with a system that was forced onto them when they were children, and have since then, never questioned their own conditioned frame of reference. Instead of simply letting their children be themselves and show their own uniqueness.”- 92 What could be wrong with humanity that it feels guilty for questioning these towering organizations and institutions (Church/Government) that are nothing more than human constructions that give way to false hope, and a conditioned robotic-mentality? Crop Circles, ETs, UFO’s, Forbidden Fruit, and the truth about humanity’s past, can appear to be startling and somewhat scary , but there is nothing to fear in regards to these mysterious subjects. “ There is nothing to Fear but Fear itself.” -93 The human mind is the one who decides whether or not extraterrestrial life is something to be feared or loved. If you can imagine a telepathic entity that can read your thoughts instantaneously, what good is there in being frightened of this? What this actually tells us is that we are afraid of our own thoughts , and not the entities that could read our thoughts.

As you are aware, I have been writing a book, titled- The Forbidden Fruit and The Tree of Knowledge. It’s a summary of research based upon the naturally occurring psychoactive chemicals found inside our human brains, and the connection that these substances have with the spirit/alien contact phenomena. I’m a huge supporter of your work, and, I use your book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule , as reference in my own research. The first question I would love to ask you, would be about the scientific data gathered so far, through your research, regarding the naturally occurring psychedelic compound-DMT. I have read that this compound can be found in our red-blood cells, also in our pineal gland. Is this true, that this compound can be secreted naturally within the human pineal gland? Rick- DMT is known to be made in red blood cells, brain, lung, and probably adrenal gland. The pineal theory remains only a theory at this point, although I do marshal a lot of circumstantial evidence supporting a pineal source—but no data yet. One of my colleagues with the Cottonwood Research Foundation is working on this now. Blake- As I understand, the pineal gland has a tendency to become calcified over the years. Rick- True. Blake- In my book, I reference several techniques and shamanic practices that have been used for thousands of years, and are still in use today, that activate the pineal gland, thus awaken the third-eye. "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 232 Rick- There are two studies I know of that indicate that meditation stimulates the pineal gland. One is a peer reviewed paper from Australia, I believe, that shows meditation increases melatonin levels, but there are no data suggesting that DMT levels rise. And there is a Taiwanese paper on the Nature (journal) site, not published, which shows MR spectroscopy data indicating pineal activation during meditation—but again, no DMT data goes along with this paper. I know of no other scientific data supporting the theory that the pineal is affected by meditation or shamanic practices. Blake- Would you mind elaborating for me, the pineal gland and it’s calcification/decalcification processes? And am I understanding this process correctly? Does calcification prevent the psychoactive compounds from being secreted in the human brain? Rick- Age is associated with pineal calcification, but when I last looked into this many years ago, it was believed pineal cells do not calcify, but that the calcification takes place in cells that support and nourish the pineal cells around and among the pineal cells. Melatonin levels fall with age, but I do not think, again by what I knew some years ago, that the decrease in melatonin production correlates with the degree of calcification. Melatonin is barely psychoactive, please keep in mind. I don’t know of any process or medication/drug that decalcifies pineal. Blake- The classic tale regarding the garden of Eden, the Forbidden Fruit, and the awakening of the human mind, seems to implant the psychedelic phenomena with the origins of mankind. Rick- The Garden of Eden story is quite complex and not easy to understand. Most don’t know its meaning. The tree Adam and Eve ate from was that of the Knowledge of Good and Evil; not the knowledge of"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 233 Truth and Falsehood. Good and Evil are relative, moral, concepts—e.g., it’s evil (in most circumstances) to steal or lie; it’s good (in most cases) to be generous and kind. Truth and Falsehood are more objective—e.g., the sun is (always) shining; the moon is (never) made of green cheese are two examples of this. In a way, their eating from this tree was a descent from the realm of real clarity to a state of relative clarity; not an ascent or a way for them to approach God-like status. They descended from a higher level of existence, where only truth and falsehood were how all decisions were made, not being aware of good or evil. Good or evil are more in the nature of opinions, and change, having no real permanence. So, they could no longer inhabit the higher planes of existence of the Garden. Blake- Of course, this is one story among many, that include the idea that, psychedelic states of consciousness have been with humans since our origins. This is obvious, if , the pineal gland secretes the ‘Spirit Molecule-DMT’ after 49 days from conception, naturally. And, not only does the infant human experience the altered-states of consciousness, during pregnancy/birth, but also the human body that has ‘logged-off’ or physically died. It’s a perfect example of the alchemical ouroboros. If, we are born into psychedelic consciousness, and we die into psychedelic consciousness, everything in-between would have to be linked to this state of consciousness. Rick- Your use of “if” is apropos. These are all theories I propose in the book; none of these theories have been substantiated nor refuted—no-one has looked at the questions by designing and running research studies to address them. Blake- I have heard, that when we dream at night, the spirit molecule is active, giving us our visions or dreams. "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 234 Rick- There are no data concerning DMT and sleep or DMT and dreams. Jace Callaway has proposed a theory that pineal production of an monoamine oxidase inhibitor might increase endogenous levels of DMT during sleep and dreams. But there are no data regarding this. Blake- Would you mind elaborating for me, the occurrences in which the spirit molecule is naturally released? Example: during birth, death, sleep, and altered-states of consciousness Rick- One published study reported that endogenous DMT, of uncertain origin increased in psychotic patients when their psychosis increased. There are several studies which suggest but not conclusively that DMT levels are generally higher in serious mental illness than in normal controls. In rats, brain levels of DMT rise in response to stress. The other states you mention would be good ones to study regarding DMT levels. Blake- From your own research, can you briefly explain to me the spiritual implications that effected the patients who volunteered for the DMT experiments? Rick- Most of our volunteers were already very experienced in the psychedelic realms. However, for nearly all of them, their high dose DMT sessions set the bar for the psychedelic experience, convinced them even more so of the spiritual nature of reality, and for many of them, this caused them to gradually refine their life’s work and their personal relationships to reflect this deepening of their world views. Blake- Would you mind telling me your thoughts about the contact made with these entities, while during the psychedelic experience? Rick- I entertain a number of theories, which I spell"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 235 out in the book. I’ve not really developed my theories much further in this regard since then. Blake- Lately, I seem to notice, an exponential rise in the so-called ‘alien abduction’ phenomena, along with more and more sightings of UFOs, along with the exponential novelty and complexity of the sacred geometry being laid in our crop fields around the world. As you may be aware, sacred geometry vibrates to certain frequencies that can influence human consciousness, and from what crop circle researchers suggest, lately, frequencies can be detected, coming from genuine crop circles, by using scientific tools to measure the vibrations. Would you care to share your thoughts, on, if you think there is any connection with the wide-spread alien abduction phenomena, UFO sightings, and the crop circle mystery, to the natural release of psychoactive compounds found inside our brains? Rick- I hypothesize consciousness-to-consciousness “being” contact as a model for understanding contact experiences with no stigmata, and with no objective verifiable information (such as an associate testifying to the actual physical absence of the person). If crop circles emanate EMF’s, this would be of interest. EMF’s affect pineal function, but there are no data regarding EMF effects on DMT synthesis in the body. I theorize about an EMF effect on DMT synthesis, but there are no data. Blake- Perhaps the world we have collectively perceived, over the past millennia, will fade away, as a new light is shed on human consciousness and it’s innate potential/ability to access these other vibrational frequencies and the entities that inhabit them, which occur during a psychedelic trance. Rick- Well, this is an interesting idea, and gets to the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 236 heart of the 2012 idea. What exactly do you think the world and humanity will look like at that time? Blake- I touch on this subject towards the end of my book, however, the pages in the book that lead up to these 'theories' present what I feel is connected to the whole 2012 (end date). Namely, as Terence McKenna calls it: The Archaic Revival- The return of shamanic wisdom. This includes, the scientific research that you yourself have been conducting regarding ASC/DMT studies. I highly doubt the 'end of the world' theories, but I do propose the theory of shamanic knowledge (plants, ASC, human brain, spirituality, etc.) becoming a large part of the new human version of reality, although it has always been part of the human version of reality (not so much in Western Civilization), this is beginning to change. Thanks to your research and the research of all psychonauts around the world. I assume, paranormal (shamanic) activities around the globe will only continue to increase during these and coming years, and the possibility that this has a relationship to psychoactive compounds found in the human brain. Thank you Dr Rick Strassman, for your time and incredible studies. I hope to hear more information about such inquiries coming from the Cottonwood Research Foundation. Your breakthrough work has begun to open the eyes of many people around the world. And hopefully, this line of research will begin to pry open the collective third- eye of humanity, taking us into the future beyond 2012 AD."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 237 Interview with Andrew Rutajit (author of ‘The Vestibule’ and co-author of ‘Astrotheology & Shamanism’) and Jan Irvin (co-author of ‘Astrotheology & Shamanism’) Andrew Rutajit- www.was3media.com Jan Irvin- www.gnosticmedia.com Blake- Knowing that you have worked on writing the book ‘ Astrotheology and Shamanism’ with Jan Irvin, and that you also edited the DVD video ‘ Pharmacratic Inquisition’ , along with contributing art-drawings and music, it seems that all these activities, (research, writing, drawing, music, and digital editing) are slight forms of what I guess I would consider neo-shamanic. From my own interpretation, today’s modern neo- shamans, are those individuals who are partaking in these similar activities that help communicate a transformative message to the general public. With access to technology in our homes, the pace at which this information is being passed along seems to exponentially be on the rise. What was it that inspired you to partake in the passing along of neo-shamanic practices? And could you briefly explain your educational background for me? Andrew- I was adopted into a Christian household when I was just 3 days old and one of the stipulations on my adoption was that the adopting family be not only Christian, but Lutheran. So, I was always curious about that. I would ask my parents, “What if I was adopted to a family that wasn’t Christian, then what would I believe?” They would tell me that the woman who gave birth to me made sure I would be Christian before putting me up for adoption. That answer seemed to stop my questions at the time, but I still had many. I literally grew up in a church – my parents were VERY active Christians and I followed along everywhere they went (of course). As I began to think for myself, I started asking the big questions and when the grownups ran out"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 238 of answers that would quiet me down; I knew I was onto something. In college I ate some mushrooms and they blew me away! From there, I added “entheogens” to my religious research and bingo...the truth surfaced. After having the full blown experience while researching religion, I knew without a doubt that I was correct because I had proven it to myself. That’s why I write in my book, “I’ve heard there are two ways of truly finding oneself – Religion and Revelation. However, religion will never be complete within you until you complete it within yourself...that’s a revelation; religion alone lends itself to too much faith.” From, “The Vestibule” by Andrew Rutajit - Minimal research told me that the Native Americans recently fought for their right to ingest a psychedelic cactus in their ceremony. The Mazatec Indians in Mexico use a Sage plant and/or psychedelic mushrooms in ceremony; in the Amazon, Ayahuasca (also called Yage) is consumed as a psychedelic brew made from a combination of plants; in Africa, Datura and Tabermanthe iboga are the sacred plants of choice; In Siberia, the Amanita muscaria mushroom is the local sacrament. This list could go on and on, but the point is that ceremonial ingestion of sacred plants are (and always have been) a worldwide phenomenon, every region seems to have their own sacred plant that will propel the local shaman (or medicine man) into out of body states of consciousness. This is the technique that is practiced behind closed doors, the technique that is left out of the more straightforward and public rituals. This is what Christians are symbolizing at communion when they \"take and eat\" I’m glad I grew up with such a profound understanding of Christianity. I honestly don’t think I would have cared enough to spend so much time and energy researching the occult (or hidden/secret) side of Christianity if I hadn’t invested so much of my youth in understanding the basic story. As someone who has stood on both sides of the fence, I can assure you there is"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 239 a safety net on the other side. Furthermore, eating mushrooms is not a necessarily a prerequisite to understand this “other side” of religious history. The light of truth is all you need. The truth might sting a little at first but as cliché as it sounds, it can set you free as well. As for my formal education, I have a degree in Film...all of my research has taken place in my home and at the library. Jan and I have read more on these topics than the average bear, but neither of us have a degree in shamanism and astrotheology ;o) as if there is one available. Blake- I would like to ask you, Jan, about your introduction to this knowledge. I, myself was consciously introduced to shamanism when I read my first Dr. Timothy Leary book, The Politics of Ecstacy , in 2003. Prior to having read anything like this, I was just getting out of my ‘Christian’ phase and into my adolescent years as a teenage boy who was finding all these new hormones and chemi cals inside my brain a bit hard to deny. I wanted pleasure as much as possible. I longed for ecstatic moments. Most of all, girls were penetrating my thoughts in sensual scenarios, and I loved it. I was getting to the point where I disagreed with all of the Church’s rules, views, laws, and dogma. I needed to find myself amongst the herd of sheep surrounding my Christian days. And so the divine would have it that I encountered my first entheogenic experience, this changed me in a fundamental way and set me on the path of shamanic wisdom. What was it that turned you on to this field of study? And was there any particular moment or experience that led you to write Astrotheology and Shamanism ? Jan- I met and became close friends with Jack Herer. He introduced me to this field of study, as well as several of its scholars, such as Leary, whom I met with Herer back in 1994."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 240 Blake- After reading ‘ Astrotheology and Shamanism’ , an obvious subject being discussed is the use of altered- states of consciousness (ASC), which is also used in shamanism. If you don’t mind, would you elaborate for me, the first experience you ever had with an ASC? Andrew- Taken from my book, “The Vestibule” - At one point in college, I found myself sitting at a friend’s kitchen table, staring at jar of psychedelic mushrooms that had been soaking in honey for several months. The honey itself had taken on the blue pigment and psychedelic properties of the blue-bruised mushrooms floating within. I was a psychedelic novice and proper mushroom dosage was a mystery to me. We were all ingesting this “blue honey” for the first time and none of us had any idea how to judge the potency of this stuff (we all weighed in the neighborhood of 170 lbs, so we all ate the same amount). We filled up the toaster with bread and then proceeded to cover the toast with the psychedelic-laced honey. None of us believed the honey was actually going to be psychedelic; it seemed like more of a novelty than anything. We decided that if we were going to actually do this, we should at least eat some actual mushrooms. So, a few minutes after eating the blue honey, we each ate about four dried grams of mushrooms and some more blue honey on toast to ease the taste of the fungus. After about thirty minutes, as the affects of the mushrooms began, we went back to the kitchen had some more of the honey; in hindsight, it was probably this dose that pushed me over the edge and into the psychedelic abyss. After it was all said and done, I felt as if I had eaten my weight in Psilocybin (and I have never had such an experience since). We all had a lot of energy. As a group of friends, we walked through a huge field, talked and laughed and horsed around. Then, like a piano dropping from the sky and landing on my head, I was hit by the intense sensations of the mushroom. It felt like it took an"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 241 eternity, but I finally found a place to recline. When I found a bed, I remained there for 6 more hours with my eyes wide open as I ebbed and flowed out of body and back again over and over. Movement was not an option. I could see a giant disk above me and it was spinning like a record. It seemed as though this record contained all of my memories and I could pick and choose where to “put the needle on the record,” so to speak. Some of the time, I could pick and choose which memory to review. Other times, memories would surface that I had all but completely forgotten about. Everything surfaced that night, from my earliest memories to events that happened earlier that day. The thoughts in my head were so clear, it would have seemed as though a disembodied voice was guiding me through the entire experience. The next morning, even though I had slept for a couple hours, but I was still partially under the influence. I went outside for some fresh air and to shake the cobwebs and as I stood on the porch, looking at the fresh mushrooms growing with the dew in the field we played in the night before; I was overwhelmed with the sudden realization that I had just spiritually evolved. I realized that I had just taken something that grew in nature and eaten it and that it had altered my consciousness to a point where I had a complete review of my entire life. My life didn’t “flash” before my eyes; this experience took six hours to complete. This was coupled with an extreme sensation of déjà vu that lasted the entire night. I knew that these mushrooms had been on this planet for millions of years, and I was not so naive to think I was the first to have such a profound experience after eating them. I was so shaken by the experience that it took me two years to get to a point to where I wasn't visibly upset when describing what happened that night. I was starting to do the math and realize that such an experience must have found a place in history somewhere. Ironically, I was literally standing on a porch that morning and figuratively speaking, I had reached"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 242 the vestibule. I was standing at the entrance of the great temple of gnosis in pursuit of a link between my previous night’s experience, and religious history itself. By standing on the porch that morning, realizing the historical weight these mushrooms must have, I was standing at the cusp of an endless rabbit hole filled with religious symbolism and secrets guarded with the lives of many men throughout hist ory...that is how this my research began. Just a side note, this was the beginning of my first website back in 1997 and it is still online today with over one million visitors – www.bluehoney.org Blake- Knowing that I was once a ‘claimed’ Christian, (brainwashed by a fire-n-brimstone lecture) and woke up from this question-less behavior, to discover the wonderful world of ancient knowledge and human understanding, leads me to the conclusion that there are people who need help questioning their foundational beliefs. Obviously, authors and lecturers, such as yourself and Andrew, are one of the main voices in our society today that are reaching out to educate and help people question reality and question authority. How did you make the decision to come out into the public and share this information with everyone? Especially knowing the rich history of suppression regarding this wisdom, what final factor convinced you that reaching out to discuss such ‘taboo’ topics was going to be beneficial? Jan- I had been public doing hemp rallies and public speaking engagements since my early 20s. At first it was through a website, long before everyone had a website. One of the largest catalysts that made me go public ‘again’ – being in my 30’s as opposed to my 20s – was the events of 911. Blake- I’m curious about the response you typically have from an audience when giving a lecture about the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 243 sacred entheogens. Have you had anyone reject your information because it is based on drugs? Or has anyone ever given you a hard time, simply because they themselves have never had the psychedelic experience? Is there much positive feedback from the audience? Jan- We’ve only given one public lecture back in 2004. The audience was very positive. We do mostly radio interviews and the like. No, I’ve never had anyone flat reject it who has actually studied it. Certainly people try to criticize the work, but 99.5% of them who do are people who’ve never bothered to actually read it. Blake- I’m highly interested in the contact that can take place during an ASC, with seemingly ‘alien’ entities, spirits, elves, fairies, etc... Personally, I have on numerous times encountered these etheric, seemingly other dimensional beings, and only during altered-states of consciousness. I felt a genuine sense of telepathic communication taking place, as they would show me things and explain to me things that are so beyond the everyday perception of reality. Have you ever had an experience of contact through the psychedelic veil, while in an ASC? If so, how did you handle the encounter? And what theories might you have, regarding what these ‘beings’ are? Andrew- Yes with mushrooms, but never with LSD. My experience with DMT has not produced this phenomenon either...yet. However, a co-worker once called me late one night to tell me about a really weird dream he just had. He knew I was interested in lucid dreams and didn’t know who else to call; thinking everyone else would laugh at him. He went on to describe the Terence McKenna/DMT Elf phenomenon to the letter, yet he had never heard of Terence McKenna or DMT. I blew his mind by interrupting him at the end of his description by asking him if the little creatures he saw in his dream jumped into his chest (I was simply"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 244 repeating what Terence McKenna was saying in Alien Dreamtime, “And I watched these little elf tykes jumping in and out of my chest; they like to do that to reassure you.”). He was beside himself and could not explain away the reason why I knew what happened in his dream. I haven’t had contact with an “other” as you describe. I believe that the other entities we encounter while in these states of consciousness could very well be fractions of our self. Blake- After reading Rick Strassman’s book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, the experience of an alien contact seems to keep popping up again and again. I am fascinated with the alien phenomena and the UFO mystery, so naturally this information was interesting to me. I have had my own personal encounters with what I would call ‘spirits’ or ‘ETs’, some kind of multidimensional entities, as Terence McKenna describes them as, the ‘self- transforming machine elves’. A general sense of telepathic communication takes place during the encounter, and they most typically will only happen when I have put myself into an altered-state of consciousness. I know I’m not crazy, and I’m sure anyone who has had a similar experience is most likely not crazy. The encounters I’ve experienced have never been anything but positive in nature. It seems that contact with the spirit realm is just part of the Human- Experience, particularly revered by our ancient ancestors. Have you personally had similar encounters with entities? And what do you feel about the relationship between the alien abduction scenario and the psychedelic experience? Jan- I’ve encountered and spoken with entities/spirits/gaia etc. many times on various psychoactive substances; and, fortunately, never a single time without them. Do I believe in Aliens and UFOs? No, I don’t. Everything I’ve ever experienced tells me"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 245 these “beings” are inside of us, not outside – that is unless it’s military technology that the government hasn’t shared with the public. Do I believe in the possibility of life on other planets, of course. Do I believe we’re being visited by Icke’s lizard men, of course not. I have friends who will argue against me all day on this, but until I see or experience evidence that shows they’re real, I have to side with Jung and McKenna on this one – that they’re constructs of the mind, NOT real (See the book Flying Saucers by Carl Jung or Angles Aliens and Archetypes by McKenna on audio) – most probably deeper consciousness levels that we’ve not fully tapped into or reflections of our own inner selves, or, as Shulgin may argue – they’re only chemical interactions – though I must add that too much of what I’ve seen seems beyond the possibility of so- called hallucination. Blake- It seems rather synchronistic in the way that new-paradigm writers/artists/musicians keep coming out with material that is helping to wake up humanity, coinciding with the end of the Mayan Long Count Calendar in 2012. In Graham Hancock’s latest work, ‘Supernatural: Meetings with Ancient Teachers of Mankind’, he points out the relationship of humanities origins and its connection to the shamanic wisdom. Then we hear Terence McKenna sharing his ‘stoned ape theory’. And of course the first cave paintings that initiated the human race into art-making, symbol using, spiritual practitioners, which were created by those first ancient shamans, who more than likely entered an altered-state of consciousness. Then, while on their vision quests, they reproduced the images seen in their minds, onto the walls of the caves. And then again, in the story of the Garden of Eden, and the supposed story about the origins of mankind, Adam and Eve partake in the sacred Forbidden Fruit, and then their eyes are opened. Through these initial experiences of Altered-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 246 States of Consciousness, humans apparently became modern symbol-using, spiritual practicing, and technology-using-humanity. Would you care to elaborate on the origins/evolution of modern humanity and its relationship to the shamanic experience? Also could you please comment on the Mayan Calendar and any significance it may have regarding shamanism? (Knowing that the makers of this calendar, also were practicing shamans who ingested the Bufo Marine toad’s magical chemical ingredients) Andrew- Many plants/fungi have been used in ceremony for spiritual purposes throughout the evolution of this planet and this connection continues to this very day. Recently, the usage of these plants has been condemned and the practitioners have been demonized, either being slaughtered (past) or incarcerated (today). This article was built upon notes taken from a two day workshop at the California Institute of Integral Studies in 1995 given by the late Terence McKenna as well as other thoughts and ideas from myself and Terence McKenna. In nature and in our own homes, we can easily see that animals have \"mono-diets\" with very little variation in flavor; this is nature in action. Animals are highly specialized in their choice of foods; a random diet for an animal in nature is a reckless diet. A good strategy for survival in a species is to have a specific and specialized diet, developing enzymes that can handle substances that might otherwise make one ill. So most animals seem to evolve to these very bland, mono- diets...finding what works, and sticking to it. When something happens that drives these animals from their natural habitat, they can choose to either starve to extinction or change their \"palate\" and become more flexible in their diet, trying out previously rejected potential foods from their environment. This could very well be the origin of experimentation with unknown plants."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 247 As the rainforest retreated, (the natural occurrence that drove our animal ancestors away from their natural habitat), our primal ancestors were forced to experiment with new foods. Our remote, canopy living ancestors were fruititarian insectivores, they were forced out of the trees and began exploring the grasslands for food. Now look at us...our palates are wide open and our species enjoys a wide verity of spices and foods, not just from the area where we live, but from all over the world. One food source our primal ancestors would surely have quite literally stumbled upon in the grasslands would have been mushrooms. Many mushrooms growing in grassland areas and on the dung of cattle contain psilocybin. Psilocybin is a major psychoactive alkaloid and it is not found outside of the fungus world. According to McKenna, psilocybin is the best model for human interaction with a psychedelic, other man made psychedelics (LSD and the like) are all in effort to return to or somehow re-invoke the human relationship with psilocybin. Aside from their psychedelic qualities, these mushrooms have other attributes. In lower doses, psilocybin increases visual acuity and edge detection. This has been proven under laboratory settings...see Roland Fisher for more info. Enhanced edge detection would be at a high premium for any animal who had found themselves in a hunter/prey situation. Be it the hunter or the hunted, edge detection (crisp and clear vision) could be the difference between life or death (or dinner vs. no dinner). I can’t think of a situation where blurred vision is a advantage. Animals, who accept something into their diet that increases edge detection, would have a slightly enhanced success in hunting. The better the hunter an animal is, the more nutrition they have for themselves and for their offspring...offspring who are in turn raised eating this psychedelic mushroom. At slightly higher doses, mushrooms containing this psilocybin will cause arousal. Arousal"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 248 not only meaning unable to sleep or restlessness; but sexual arousal as well. So we have a species with plenty of food and plenty of offs pring, thus out breeding the non-mushroom using members of the population. I suggest that whatever it was that kept us in the same mental category as the other animals for so long, was interrupted by the introduction of a particular item to our diet. These mushrooms could very well be responsible for many of the things that make us a human animal: Language, art, poetry, dance, music...all of these things that separate us from other animals, suddenly sprang into existence circa 100,000 years ago. I contend that this mushroom is quite literally the \"missing link\". We humans are the most conscious of all animals, maybe because we are carnivorous. Cows have very little interest in the goings on of the birds or prairie dogs that share the same field with them. Carnivores on the other hand have an acute interest of the behaviors of other animals. The earliest consciousness was not self awareness or self consciousness, but rather how dinner must think. Because if you can think in the manner in which your prey thinks, then you can place yourself ahead of its path and have the upper hand in the hunt. After incorporating the mushroom into our diet, the attention to the behavior patterns of other animals was all that it took to knock over the first domino of evolution. So to sum up, our canopy dwelling ancestors were forced into a grassland environment where Psilocybe mushrooms flourish; where both large and small animals are preying upon one another. And in this new and highly competitive environment, without the largest brain in size or weight, without huge fangs or claws, and long before we had access to the technology of weaponry, we moved to the top of the food chain. This could only happen because, as our species made its adaptive choices, it unintentionally moved further and deeper into the realm of consciousness and mind by"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 249 means of necessity; we out-thought our predators. We learned the patterns of other animals, the growth cycles of the new plant environment, where to find water, and etc. Language was right around the corner. But look at us now...We have abandoned our sacred mushroom - more than just abandoned it, we punish those who possess it. As for 2012, I love the theory and I think McKenna did a beautiful job explaining how the spiral of time may work. I believe this spiral of time is getting tighter and tighter as we get to 2012 but I have no way of predicting the future and can't even make a suggestion as to what things will be like. I feel as though, in the years after 2012, we will look back on these days and remember more trial and error. In other words, because everything is becoming so streamlined and easily accessible, making our dreams and goals a reality may be easier to achieve than ever before."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Forbidden Fruit & The Tree of Knowledge: Opening the Third Eye 251 Bibliography Chapter 1- The Human Brain 1-Quote taken from page 55 of- 7 th edition Psychology: an Introduction by Benjamin B.
