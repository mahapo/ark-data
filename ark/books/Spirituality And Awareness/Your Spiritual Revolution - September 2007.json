It's also an excellent way to increase imagination and intuitive capabilities which are both intimately connected with dreams. This alone should How to Increase Dream R ecall By Craig W ebb"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"02 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 provide strong incentive. First and foremost, you must feel that it will be useful to you, if not extremely valuable. W ithout this intention, motivation will soon disappear . More importantly , the desire acts as a subjective magnet which draws your dreams into memory . Understand that dream recall is an inherent, natural human trait. That is why young children are quite in touch with their dreams, as are many native cultures, some of which even share their drea ms with each other daily and base important l ife actions upon guidance they receive. Dream recall is like a mental muscle; the more you use it, the stronger it becomes. W ithout exercise it may shrink, but it is there if you decide to work it out again. So if your recall is poor , trust that it will come in time, and the trust itself will actually help since expectation is a powerful subjective tool. Before sleep, reread your dreams from the night (or more) before. This allows you to begin to connect with your dream memory , and is also an opportunity to interpret your dreams and spot connections to the day's events. Then, as you go to bed, clearly request (rather than command) yourself to remember any dreams when you awaken in the morning or during the night, especially ones that would be beneficial to you. Also remind yourself that it's a simple, natural process that happens by itself anyway . Y ou can also suggest to yourself to spontaneously awaken when you need to without using an alarm, since any strong external perception such as a loud noise can inhibit recall. This method works well with practice, but you may initially wish to set your alarm for 15 minutes after your suggested wake-up time, just to be safe. Whenever you awaken, keep your eyes closed (or shut them if IT'S IMPOR T ANT T O W ANT IT : FOCUS and A TTENTION: BEDTIME PRACTICE: already open) and remain as motionless as possible. If you moved since waking, return to your earlier body position. Gather as many images, impressions, feelings, or body sensations or waking thoughts as you can. A helpful technique is to think of it like fishing. Gently , cast out your intention to remember a dream, and wait a little to see what comes. As soon as you get anything, no matter how brief or vague they may at first seem, rise and immediately record (or write, draw , paint, etc.) it in a journal or speak into a tape recorder (which you keep bedside). Y ou'll be surprised at how much more you remember as you begin writing/speaking/drawing/painting/etc. Although most people start having success the first week or two, dream recall is a mental muscle which may require some time to get back into shape. T ry to maintain a relaxed and playful attitude of looking forward to your dreams while being willing to let them come all in good time. T rying too hard or being too serious can be limiting factors. Dream recall and motivation tend to come and go naturally in cycles and also depend upon what else is going on in your life, and on how much sleep you get, how much you exercise, etc.. Once you begin a period of focusing on recall, stick with it for at least a few days, because consecutive nights can have an additive ef fect. with a shared interest in dreams is unmatchable for sustained motivation, inspiration and plenty of intriguing surprises and insights.

They are your personal, symbolic newspapers waiting each morning at your intuitive door to be gathered, decoded and integrated into your life. Dreams are the universal language of both the personal and the collective unconscious. Scientific research confirms what people throughout history have always known: answers, ideas, inspiration, and inventions come to each of us in our dreams. They also contain guidance for every facet of living: career , finances, relationships, health, spiritual growth and creativity . Everyone dreams, and when you pay attention to the messages in your daydr eams - as well as your sleep dreams - you begin to inhabit a much lar ger part of your soul. Dreams are really about waking up. Dreams tell you how you r eally feel about something, where you have been, where you are going, and the quickest way to get there. Y our Dreaming Mind reminds you how much lar ger your life is than you consciously know . Have you ever heard the phrase, “That was only a dream”? Perhaps, you were even scolded and told to “S top daydreaming!” These dismissals of your rich inner life separate you from the Source and your Dr eams inner muse. By paying attention to the tales woven during your dreams, you maintain continuity with your total being Dreams are more than stories about your lives. The ever -changing balance between conscious and unconscious activity is the rich and rewarding journey of receiving these dream images and then manifesting this divinely inspired creativity in waking life. When you receive a daydream or sleep dream, the doors to your inner genius and inner muse have been opened. T o fully realize this genius and innate creativity , it is important to take one small action step in waking life to honor your dream's message. When you engage in any form of creative expression, you are listening to your soul's voice, and recognizing that you are indeed an Artist of the Everyday . These soulful whispers can be heard more clearly through daydreams and sleep dreams. Y our Dreaming Mind reveals its treasures in images, thoughts, feelings and creative ur ges just waiting to be gathered along the shoreline of waking consciousness. Some of our daydreams and sleep dreams messages even ask to be transformed into a variety of Self-expressiv e actions. “ By simply exploring the images of our sleeping and waking dr eam states, we can discover a wealth of ideas and inspiration that ar e mor e authentic and powerful because they r eveal our underlying spiritual self.” - T om Cr ockett"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"05 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 These creative outpourings are additiona l ways to interact with your dream and to discover n ew layers of meaning. If you follow your muse, you will be inspired and encouraged to discover unique, varied and personal communications between your dream life and waking life. As mentioned earlier , sometimes these messages defy words and can only be expressed in a drawing, a dance, a poem, a sculpture, a collage or some new invention. Have you “fished” the ocean of your dreams lately for a trophy winning imaginative idea or to unblock creativity? Below is a powerful example of how a daydream and the sleep dream that followed, unleashed my own dream-inspired painting and poem. Over a couple of week's duration, a specific daydr eam interrupted my thoughts with some frequency . This particular daydream's message ur ged me to learn how to paint - specifically with water colors. T o honor my daydream's message, I decided to ask an artist friend for some basic watercolor instruction. As a result, I spent a lovely , soul- nourishing afternoon playing with water , brushes and color . The day after I had my water color painting lesson, I experienced this wonderfully validating sleep dream. The Rose and the Nile I am learning how to paint a rose. I see an image of a huge hand above my head showing me how to move a paintbrush by twisting and turning its wrist and using dif fering amounts of pressure to create red roses. I need to travel up the Nile River , and I see an image of myself on a boat on the Nile. I want to do it in an orderly progression and not backtrack. I ask Ben (my husband) if we can do the rose first, and The Sleep Dr eam then keep going toward the Nile. Note: Upon awakening as I wrote down the dream, I felt a powerful connection to an ancient time and place (which, later proved to be an important commentary on the dream's message). After this dream, I just had to play with the technique shown to me in the dream. Although I had just a little knowledge of watercolor painting, I simply followed my sleep dream's guidance. Using dif ferent types of wrist flicks, hand movements and varying degrees of pressure, I dipped my brush into red paint and watched the color as it danced and spread on the paper creating roses. I added strokes of green, which formed the stems, and then looked at the painting contemplativel y . As the images of these dr eam roses began to dry on the still wet paper , I felt something was missing and that the painting was incomplete. \"Where's the Nile?\" an inner , soulful voice asked. Dipping my brush into some blue paint, I created a ribbon of blue diagonally across the paper . W ith that addition, I could now see and feel the ener gy of the ancient, mysterious Nile. As I sat quietly absorbing the dream images in the painting, I began to feel the presence of my dear Aunt Rose who had passed away many years earlier . I looked deeply into the painting; I felt the quiet power of the flower images. Then Aunt Rose's face emer ged from the paper a smile forming on her lips as she nodded her head in loving approval.

This time, as I sat with the images again, I felt the desire to write a poem. T o discover the poetry within a dream, I used a simple technique that I developed to engage the conscious mind - while simultaneously - allowing the unconscious mind to access the Inner Muse. First, I selected three words that ener getically called to me from the dream: r ose, Nile and ancient. Next, I quickly (and without conscious deliberation) placed a check mark beside one of the words ancient to start the creative flow of the poem. T o complete this poetry writing process, I continued to write (without stopping, or censoring, for a least 5 minutes) with the goal of including the remaining two words r ose and Nile within the body of the poem. The result of this process is the poem shown below: The Rose and the Nile Poem Ancient blood courses thr ough me. I am traveling down the Nile Like my ancestors befor e me. I am an explor er and world traveler Anxious to r econnect with my r oots and history . I r emember times when I was the enslaved And the oppr essor -- Both Moses and Pharaoh.

As I journey Home now , I see the narr ow , yet endless, str etch of water befor e me-- An umbilical cor d connecting me to the Sour ce. Atop this ribbon of blue calm Floats a single, perfect r ed Rose. Indeed, there is a powerful creative and intuitive force that comes through daydreams and sleep dreams.

And this freedom is what we wholly employ in our nocturnal dreams a s we switch our focus from one level of consciousness to another . and not some illusory mirage that we envision every night! Dream 'locations' are a s real as our day to day worlds -with the only dif ference being that in the waking state, our consciousness is focused outwards; and in dreaming states it is focused on various inner dimensions.

Thus let us lay our heads down, and switch from the alpha frequency of day dreaming to the ...and even as our brainwaves slow down to ... we are now probably dreaming! T o the dreaming self, our physical life and home and bed does not exist and only come back into being when we switch our consciousness back to beta in the morning!

Theta brainwaves in non sleep states are those associated with intense creativity , visualization ability , imagination and even issue resolution. In meditation theta is those classic out of bo dy sates where we are disconnected from the physical and experience self as one with Universes, Gods, Maste rs and other higher aspects of self. It is also that state where deep inner work on the deepest layers of our subconscious- is done on current self! Thus let us become aware that dreams encompass all of these and more- freed as we are in deep dream states from the more physical data, disturbances and constra ints! Let us explore some of these dreams now: several dreams, especially those that are a repla y of the day's incidents, are actually serving the useful purpose of Thus what might appear a trivial rehash of the day really serves an important purpose of sorting out those incidents that are done with and those which still retain a 'char ge' and thus have to be further experienced, explored or resolved and are thus saved in our sub conscious minds. At a more complex level the dreaming stat e is W e even experiment and try out in this dimension and based on that experience do we then awake with the 'knowing' of which path we must take! Of course we do not recall this and presume it is a choice we have arrived at consciously at some waking point! This is often why a good night's 'sleep' brings us answers to confusing issues- for we have actually been there, done that! Often this is what makes up dreams, where we see the future- because we have indeed explored certain options and experienced the ef fect we will then choose here and when it happens we view it as a prophecy!

Sometimes we choose not to experience it in physical reality- sometimes the need is felt! More so, dreaming is a form of which occurs naturally every night. This is why the body in theta frequency actually stif fens- because the brain sends a message to the muscles to seize- so that the body does not inadvertently move and get hurt during the time when our main consciousness is traveling far away! Our day to day waking life only makes up a small portion of who we are, and sleep is not as passive a state as we may think it to be! Indeed we live a very active, creative and expanded being ness when we 'sleep'. The when we do not dream, but are connected to source itself. Deep sleep is thus a tool we have created while we play the game of separation so that we may daily revitalize our self with source! There is no memory of this, as it cannot be translated in anyway for the waking mind to recall or decipher -and thus we call it non dream astral traveling , rest and rejuvenation sleep is known for is usually the delt a frequency , sleep!

And thus there are dreams within dreams, each being a 'consciousness' or foc us we exist in, experience and explore simultaneously . Most of the dreams we recall are those closest to our current consciousness, because those are what we can 'translate' most easily!

Indeed Seth a channeled entity (through Jane Roberts) spoke of the future when there will be what he calls those who will... 'at will' with conscious intention and recall...enter into theta states and into the dreams of others to help them at that source level towards issue resolutions and healing. In reverse, sometimes the work we do on self in the waking state is experientially completed in sleep states- for example having understood for giveness- old relationships may come up where you experientially for give the 'other'! Or they may come and hug you to express this for giveness! In dreams can give us a lot of information about our self- deeper material not accessible easily to the conscious mind; and also help us (like any healing process does)- by working at them at source level! Dreams are often our experiences as life form s and in dimensions we have no conscious knowledge of- and thus our There is nothing in current mind that it can possibly use, to decipher the dreams for us to bring back into waking consciousness!

The best it can do is to describe them through the use of which we may interpret. Thus we may dream of people in our lives and certain dramatic events...but they are often symbolic repres entations only! So many times we dream of a special kiss- that often is just our way of translating some contact with a beloved soul and as a kiss is the penultimate 'dream scientist s' - day-to-day terms mind cannot convert such dreams for us to recall ! imagery and symbols ... intimate contact for humans, we translate it as such! Sex too! When ener gies blend with others in dream experiences we sometimes translate it as sex and wonder why we dreamt of sex with x,y ,z!!! Sometimes we 'try' it to choose whether we will go through the physical enactment! Sometimes it is how we get attracted to another human- as we dream about sex with him/her and then that triggers the blueprint... so many variations (pun unintended!) is much written about and there are many books in the market which even tell you what the dif ferent images or symbols mean! However the language of symbols is a very private language, and the same image- for example fire- may mean danger to one person, warmth to another and passion or glory to yet others! These books do sometimes tap into the meanings of the collective consciousness-often called universal archetypes which represent the critical mass of humanity at any given point- but from personal experience i have seen that true dream interpretation requires a very personal interpret! More so what we - as the mind cannot usually bring back a dream experience intact- and then we try and piece it together and wonder why it s seems incongruous!

Y ou may well pick up the pictures of the used and eaten from dinner plates that wedding photographers somehow seem to like clicking....and then those of the reception hall after your guests have left... and as you see... you may well end up with a much distorted view of your wedding! Dreams also take us into what we may call the where we are one with the people and events that make up our world!

I was amazed at a sudden thought of my mind working as a projector , projecting such a complex script as a dream sequence involving so many characters, huge landscapes, twists and turns like that of a movie story and weaving everything together as one coherent dream sequence without any 'editing' or 'revisions' needed! Once I was hearing an audio recording of Deepak Chopra's interview who view this whole thing with little dif ferent perception and immediately it struck me. I used to think of my mind projecting this story , but I did not see my mind as 'me'. So now I have me myself, in my dream as not only the character which is 'me' in the dream but all the other characters, the plot, the locations... everything as ‘me'! So if you are witnessing a dream of you playing volleyball on a beach with your friends, then essentially you are the 'you' who is playing along with ‘yourself' as your friends, you as the sea, you a s the sand of the beach, you as the net, you as the ball as well you are the sounds you hear , you are the sunlight you see, you are ALL THA T IS in that dream including the OBSER VER observing and experiencing that dream! The REALITY as we know is no dif ferent than a DREAM, only it is a waking state dream. I am my physical body , I am my mind, I am the PC on which I am reading this, I am the article, I am the reader and I am the writer and I am the one who is observing and understanding this and saying 'hmmm'! Think of what happens when you 'wake up' in the morning. Y ou suddenly realize all that happened in dreams was only an illusion and so it never actually happened. What if we 'wake up' to 'divine light' again from our so called waking consciousness just to find out that this reality is also an illusion? Nothing actually happened? As we know the 'I' in our dreams never existed, it was just a projection of 'myself' (which is 'higher self' for the 'I' within the dream state). So isn't this 'I' of waking state also an illusion - a projecti on? Isn't this 'I' our limited perception of the omnipresent One Higher Self? W ell, it seems dreams do tell us a lot about 're ality' if we analyze them more deeply . So I recommend writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up in the morning. Keeping a dream journal will go a long way in acting as your 'guide' and 'mirror'. The insights you gain from dreams will assist you in your spiritual evolution. So as I always say , don't just read, do experiment! At least do this for a few days and see what you learn about 'yourself' through your dreams. It is easy said than done. If you waste even few moments after getting up, you might miss a lot of information from your dreams. If you do not recall what the dreams were about, use ‘key words’ method. Think of standard terms like water , fire, tree, railway , car , road, flying or names of your friends/relatives... Y ou might recall related dreams in this way . This needs sincere ef forts..

Currently , many more lightbody activation techniques are being made available. My partner Leigh and I have been blessed in developing one such technique. The Regenetics Method employs specific combinations of sound and intention, which are dif ferentiated aspects of the primary creational (\"torsion\") ener gy of unconditional love, to stimulate the latent potential in DNA designed to facilitate the evolution of human beings into unity consciousness and its corresponding physiology of light. DNA, as Gregg Braden points out in The God Code , is by its very sacredly encoded nature a unifying principle for humanity--one capable of bringing peace and harmony to a planetary population faced with a decision between succumbing to crisis or embracing opportunity . That we can activate DNA to expand our worldview and, in the process, evolve a biology based on unity consciousness is truly a divine gift at this historical crossroads when, to quote Barbara Marx Hubbard, we must \"decide between conscious evolution, or extinction through misuse of our powers.” The Regenetics Method features three integrated DNA activations that collectively establish the \"ener - genetic\" precondition for lightbody unfoldment. The first of these, Potentiation, activates DNA to repattern the body's electromagnetic fields, resetting the human bioener gy blueprint to an \"infinity circuit\" based on the alchemically transformative numbe r 8. DNA has been compared to an antenna connecting humanity to Source whose reception can be clouded by toxicity and trauma. Potentiation activates DNA to begin removing this toxicity and trauma, establishing a clearer connection through harmonic resonance with the unconditional love frequency emanat ing as higher -dimensional spiral standing waves of sound and intention (light) from the Healing Sun at Galactic Center . In other words, Potentiation attunes DNA to the primary torsion ener gy of Source. Leigh and I consider ourselves merely facil itators for the individual's own bio-spiritual unfoldment. W e actually heal (evolve) ourselves. This is an important point that can hardly be overemphasized. As investigative mythologist W illiam Henry reminds us, the \"Healing Sun rises from within us when we place ourselves in balance with its ener gies... By conceiving of these healing ener gies... we can tune into them. What we can conceive we can achieve.\" I would add that we place ourselves in balance with the Healing Sun not by merely looking inside oursel ves but first and foremost by adopting an internal attitude of unconditional love. My illness, which inspired the Regenetics Method, had af finities to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFIDS), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) and fibromyalgia and was precipitated by toxicity and trauma from a series of hepatitis and yellow fever vaccines I received in the spring of 1995. After years of intense suf fering and trying one expensive (and mostly inef fective) therapy after another , my turning point came when I realized that if I could somehow \"reset\" myself at the genetic level, my thirty or so debilitating symptoms would eventually resolve"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"16 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 themselves. I found myself on this path after reading a disturbing book by Leonard Horowitz called Emer ging V iruses . Basing his claims on meticulous research, Dr . Horowitz demonstrates that vaccines are a principle cause of a variety of autoimmune diseases, including AIDS. He further exposes what is in essence covert biowarfare conducted by the medical establishment against a lar gely unsuspecting population in Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse , where a main theme is The specific sounds used to restore genetic integrity derive from the ancient Solfeggio scale. This primordial six-note scale, which was dubiously \"lost\" by the Roman church during the time of Pope Johannes in the 17th Century , was recently rediscovered by Dr . Joseph Puleo as described in Healing Codes . Here it is simply necessary to point out that , which some scholars believe to be the sacred set of six notes employed by the Creator to fashion the world in as many days. Specifically , Potentiation employs the note \"Mi,\" a frequency (528 Hz) that has been used by cutting-edge molecular biologists to repair genetic defects. Having discovered Horowitz and Puleo, I was then fortunate enough to stumble on another book that greatly expanded my awareness of the immense scope of human potential: The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge , by French anthropologist Jeremy Narby . The Cosmic Serpent the use of sound to heal the physical body by restoring it to genetic integrity . all three DNA activations of the Regenetics Method employ the Solfeggio scale is an exploration of DNA from a shamanic perspective that describes how Intrigued (and desperate) enough to delve into this subject, I learned that the power of sound to activate DNA had recently been documented by the Gariaev group in Russia. Dr . Peter Gariaev and his brilliant team of geneticists and linguists proved that According to Gariaev's research, DNA not only assembles proteins but also stores and communic ates data in a decidedly linguistic fashion. His team found that the genetic code in \"junk\" or potential DNA follows, for practical purposes, the same foundational rules as human languages. In order to prove this, the syntax, semantics and grammar of language and DNA were compared. It was discovered that potential DNA's alkaline sequences closely mirror linguistic communication rules. This strongly suggests that the many human languages did not appear randomly , as is commonly believed, but reflect our essentially similar genetics. Supported by Braden's revolutionary discovery that the ancient Hebrew name for Go d is code for DNA based on the latter's chemical composition of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon, Gariaev's findings of fer scientific corroboration that in the beginning was the W ord! Gariaev and his colleagues also studied DNA's uncommon electromagnetic behavior .

Using radio and light waves keyed to human language frequencies to rewrite DNA, as opposed to gene splicing, In this manner metamorphosis was achieved without any of the side ef fects encountered when manipulating isolated genes. The \"random and risky nature of gene splicing has been sadly hidden from the public,\" warns Horowitz. \"W ith gene therapy , researchers cannot definitively predict where on a [chromosome] the modified gene might land, raising a hazardous possibility of inadvertently disrupting other genetic ex-pressions and cellular functions.\" Compare this to the or ganic alteration of genetic ex-pression that can be achieved by simply applying vibration and language (or sound and intention, or wor ds ) to DNA. Gariaev's historical experiment in embryo genesis points to the immense power of what many are calling Spiritual masters worldwide have always insisted that our genetic code can be \"pote ntiated\" through language--thus the healing ef fects of prayer , they also regrew endocrine glands in animals, stimulated regrowth of new adult teeth in humans, and even successfully altered genetic ex-pression. Gariaev's team literally transformed frog embryos into healthy salamander embryos in the laboratory . \"wave-genetics,\" an area which, contrary to current molecular biology dogma and propaganda, has an obviously more primary influence on the origin of species than biochemistry . hypnosis, af firmations, mantras, etc. Happily , Gariaev's research has now scientifically substantiated such phenomena. The more developed the individual healer's consciousness, the less need there is for a mechanical crutch. Reliance on something outside ourselves to heal us, or make us \"whole,\" is at best giving away our power , at worst worshiping a false god. In an article partly inspired by the Reg enetics Method entitled \"Finding the Holy Grail,\" psychologists Barry and Janae W einhold emphatically ar gue this point, writing of what they call the Path of T echnology (as opposed to the Path of Nature), \"W e have nothing against technology per se, and believe that some devices are helpful as 'boosters.' When created by minds connected to heart and spirit, technology can become a useful, but not essential, spiritual tool for enhancing genuinely spiritual living. T echnology lacking connection with heart and spirit becomes just another box from which it is necessary , at some point, to break free.\" When technology transforms into a path, \"it encourages dependency because it implies that people need to rely on a technical intermediary to help them open their own gates of perception. Rather than using primordial tools grounded in nature to empower initiates on their return to Source, the Path of T echnology can end up disempowering people and encouraging spiritual co- dependency .” Astonishingly , Gariaev's research reveals even more far -reaching implications with respect to the unlimited healing power of human genetic consciousness.

These DNA-activated wormholes, whose ener gy signatures are similar to those of Einstein-Rosen bridges found near black holes, are connections between dif ferent areas in the multiverse through which data can be transmitted outside space-time. Grazyna Fosar and Franz Bludorf, authors of an excellent summary of Gariaev's findings entitled V ernetzte Intelligenz (\"Networked Intelligence\"), refer to this data transfe r process as pointing out that it is often experienced as \"intuition\" or \"inspiration.” When hypercommunication occurs, according to Fosar and Bludorf, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed in DNA. They relate how Gariaev irradiated a DNA sample with a laser until a typical wave pattern formed on his monitor . When the DNA sample was extracted, its electromagnetic pattern remained, perfectly intact. Many control experiments established that the pattern still emanated from the absent sample, whose ener gy field apparently remained undisturbed in the holding chamber for up to thirty days, causing light to spiral all by itself following the shape of the physically removed double helix. This nonlocal, light-bending torsion ener gy phenomenon has since become famous as the \"DNA phantom ef fect.\" It is theorized that torsion waves from outside space and time continue to flo w through the activated wormholes even after the DNA is removed. Potential DNA, which regulates transdimensional self-or ganization (epigenetic) functions, magnetizes these nonlocal streams of information to itself and then forwards them to our consciousness. DNA activation, remote or otherwise, is thus explained as an ener -genetic transfer of universal creative consciousness manifesting as torsion waves that stimulate a molecular rearrangement of transposons or hypercommunication, \"jumping DNA\" in potential DNA. In turn, potential DNA shifts the bioener gy fields, which then modify metabolic and replication functions in cells, facilitating healing. enlightenment . This same process of DNA activation that encourages healing, by inviting more torsion light into cells, by definition promotes \"Most people tend to think that the DNA created the [phantom] ener gy field, and that the ener gy field is somehow just a 'shadow' of the DNA,\" writes author and scientific researcher David W ilcock, who proposes a fascinating reinterpretation: \"However , I believe that the wave actually exists be fore the DNA ... [The] only logical explanation is that the phantom ener gy of DNA is actually the creator of DNA.\" Since this etheric or torsion ener gy has been shown to pervade the galaxy , wherever the \"materials that create life exist, the subtle, spiraling pressure currents of this ener gy will arrange the DNA molecule into existence.” Combined with much research of my own, my intuition led me to theorize that the correct combination of sounds, intentionally geared to the body's electromagnetics, could invite an influx of torsion ener gy capable, for instance, of clearing vaccination toxicity and trauma at the genetic level and upgrading the human bioener gy field to higher harmonic functioning. I came to view the electromagnetic fields as an individual's ener -genetic blueprint that not only can be reset like a blown fuse but, in the process, transformed. Leigh and I named this approach to DNA activation the Regenetics Method after Potentiation Electromagnetic Repatterning resolved my chronic illness and we began to develop other DNA activations. The \"fringe benefit\" of Potentiation was that it also promoted enlightenment by initiating lightbody activation. © , all rights reserved.

Dolphins that look like Flipper abound in the warm waters of the Keys. T ropical flowers, palms, the turquoise water and the very quaint houses with their white balconies transport your heart to paradise. Don and I had originally seen dolphins at Seaworld in California, in a pool, jumping through hoops and performing all sort of tricks. I sat in the bleachers, my jaws dropped open, and crying. In disbelief I stared at what we as humans could do to such an intelligent being. For some reason I felt that the orca and the dolphins we saw , were conscious like you and I, and were possibly more capable than we had yet understood. I vowed right then and there to find out. But only in the wild. Since then we have been doing research on dolphins and the higher funct ions of their minds in the wild. W e have traveled to many oceans around the world to find places to meet dolphins on their terms, in the wild. W e have swum with dolphins for hundreds of hours, in Hawaii, Florida, Costa Rica, Mexico, and looked for them in even more places. W e discovered that they have some secrets to teach us. Dolphins have a knack for mind to mind communication. They have been known to heal, to be keenly interested in helping humans in need, (which got them the name “Angels of Co-Creation-P ar t III By Ilona Selke"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"22 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 the Seas” in Grecian legends. Handicapped children have inexplicably overcome some of their challenges after swimming with dolphins, and humans have had relieve of pain after being 'worked on' by dolphins. Because they have such amazing abilities, humans have tried to capture them and make them work, for us. I can understand the need to connect with be ings such as dolphins that are very capable, maybe more capable than humans. But to capture them, stick them in a prison and only feed them if they do the 'right' things, or letting them even go hungry , is not acceptable. Y ou may wonder how dolphins are connected with co-creation. I wrote about this very subject in my book “Journey to the Center of Creation” (1 800- 758 7836, now available in four languages.) W e discovered that dolphins somehow have the ability to read our minds. They are far better at it than most gifted humans. Frank Robson had written a book called “Picutres in a Dolphins Mind” where he told about their ability to be trained simply by projecting the image of what he wanted them to do. If he wanted them to jump high and touch a red ball with their nose, he just visualized that, and they would do it. He didn't reward any behavior with a fish as most trainers would, but rather gave them love and appreciation. I took that lesson into the open oceans. Here I discovered that you need to be careful what you imagine. Many times at the beginning I would send pleas to the dolphins to please come swim with me, with no results. They just stayed at a distance to me. T o be exact they stayed as far away as I kept imagining them to be, so that I had reason to keep sending my plea. Do you get the point? I was swimming but imaging that the dolphins was further away , and I wanted them to come closer . They followed my bidding, by staying at the exactly the distance I imagined. Of course with time I figured out that I needed to"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"23 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 imagine exactly what I wanted, as if it had already happened. From then on I no longer 'longed' for the connection, I simply felt the feeling as if the dolphin was right next to me, or several of them. I imagined what if would feel like to be surrounded by them, to be sonared, to have five of them swim head on to me and then sonar me. Each time I got what I had imagined. I actually just experienced that today . Last year I had worked with a group of adults here in Key W est, getting them to image exactly what they wanted to experience, before getting in the waters. W e just slid into the waters that afternoon and played. From a distance a group of dolphins came to us. They are as interested in us as we might be in them. I had held the image of getting sonared by five dolphins head on. And exactly that happened last year . But not only I got what I had imagined, others did too. I love to see the joy on peoples faces when they see this method work. The trick is that you have to FEEL as if it is really possible, actually as if it is really happening. This year , just after starting on this article for you, I thought, “that was luck, and to do it twice would be unreal. But I made myself imagines t his year again my wish fulfilled. And voila, today it happened again. Normally you can see moms and baby parading by , or you see a pair of males or even a whole group swimming underneath you. But you don't usually have five dolphins poking their head toward you and all five sonar you. That's why I imagined this very image. I wanted to make sure it was a unique event. And today it happened again. Their sonar touched my entire body , and it feels like they see through you. Being with dolphins I learned to see how well the method of “seeing and feeling the future as if it had already happened, as if it was already fulfilled.” This is one of the fundamental laws for co- creation. The universe responds justly , by giving us what we imagine to be real and true in our feeling body . W e can either feel the fulfillment, or stay with the longing. If we keep the longing, we don't get the results. If we generate the feeling and imagination of having what we really want to experience, despite the odds, we will get the result. By simply shifting our attention to feeling what it would feel like to have the wish fulfilled, we move from longing to fulfillment. W e have a great course for this method, called “Living From V ision.” Y ou can practice step by step how to create by utilizing your feeling and visioning skills. This month take ten minutes and prevision your day . Feel what you really want to feel like, what expresses your hearts desire. Additionally if you want to, you can try every morning to imagine a wish fulfilled. Y ou can imagine one wish for a while, or create one for each day . Some wishes are bigger and take some persistence on your end. Some are just small wishes for the day . Y ou will find yourself getting more successful with each wish you manifest. Have a great month, and also do some of last months exercises from last month. How many thing s can you notice, or feel, around you?

An invisible world does exist and our whole life, if we really stop to think abo ut it is based on things we cannot see. More and more we are becoming aware of the fact that our inner world is governed by a non-physical world. Even if you do not believe in God you cannot fail to recognize that there is an order in nature and consequently , there must be a 'Higher Intelligence' which created that order . Initiatic science acknowledges the existence of three worlds: The divine world which is the level of ideas, the psychic world which is the level of thoughts and feelings, and the physical world, the world of forms and materialism. Just as we earthlings have to obey nature's laws, nature obeys the laws of the spirit and it is spirit that commands nature. The material world in which we live is linked to the 'moral' world, which in turn is linked to the far higher world of ideas. Because these moral laws are not written down on paper , some people think that they have the right to do whatever they want, but ignorance is no defense before the law . Even if we do not know of these unwritten moral laws, those who fail to abide by these laws inevitably pay the high price of remorse, suf fering, bitterness, disappointments and sometimes they might even have to pay the price for their folly with money or with their life. More and more we begin to understand that everything in life is connected and related to everything else, so one can never act alone and think it does not concern anyone else. In fact what each one of us thinks and does very much concerns and touches everyone else in some fashion or another , in the short term or the long term. For us to have a contented and joyful life we must recognize and accept three major laws: Universal Laws, Moral Laws and Human Laws. The same laws are at work on all levels of existence for the Universe is one and on every level and at every stage, the same phenomena can be found, although always in dif ferent more subtle forms. Our Earth is a living being, it breathes and grows and change s constantly . It is said that nature has a memory and nothing can ever erase what it has once recorded. Whatever we find on Earth can be found also in water , and whatever is in water exists in air and in all living things. All four elements of nature obey the same l aws with some dif ferences in the way they apply the laws. Some react violently and others rapidly . For instance the human mind is analogous to the element air , and this is expressed in the form of ideas and thoughts. Emotions are analogous to the element water and these can be abysmal, dismal and cumbrous or pure, virtuous and light. Over and above the physical body , the human has subtle bodies namely , etheric, astral, mental, causal, buddhic and atmic. The tragic reality is that most of us are ignorant of our own structure and composition and of the constant interaction that goes on between human beings and the invisible beings in the other regions of the universe. It is this ignorance that is the cause of all of our misfortunes. It is easy to create the future but it is very dif ficult to erase the past. Good always produces good and evil always produces evil. Some people might think that if one is too kind one can get hurt of if one is too generous one gets taken advantage of. This is in reality selfish thinking. The truth is we can never be too kind, too generous, too loving or too considerate towards others. The universe created by God is an immense world bursting with treasures in great abundance. How can we go wrong if we live in abundance following the guidance of the Higher Intelligence that has so marvelously ordered and arranged such a miraculous bounteous beautiful world.

This field consecutively creates, from within itself, all the diverse laws of nature governing life at every level of the manifest universe. The unified field of natural law inside and its diversified expression outside are completely parallel to each other . The laws governing the self-interacting dynamics of the unified field are the eternal non-changing basis of natural law and the ultimate source of the order and harmony that is displayed throughout creation. It is written in ancient scriptures that the laws of nature are imposed upon humanity and cannot be avoided. If these laws are broken, infringed or side stepped, they carry their own penalty within themselves, and this nemesis cannot be avoi ded.

Occasionally a legend or myth springs to the surface, only to be silenced by the more popular W estern waves of cynicism and “rational” scientific thought. The fact that the ener getic transmutation of the human body is at all possi ble is miraculous. The secret knowledge that allows this transformation has been protected by several sacred orders that have closely guarded this information for centuries. T o date, more than 100,000 priests have attained the Rainbow Body using these practices. As we speak, there are literally hundreds of pri ests and masters utilizing these techniques in order to attain supreme realization. Let us expl ore the roots of this long and proud tradition. In the hills of T ibet exists an ancient sect of monks called the Nyingma Dzogchen Buddhist Order . This order began as a teaching of Buddha Shayamuni who was born in 626 B.C.E. In T ibet, Dzogchen is considered to be an advanced secret teaching, which paradoxically , may be easily applied to modern life. The original Dzogchen lineage was transmitted from Dharmakaya Buddha Samantabhadra, to Sambhogakaya Buddha V ajrasattva, to Nirmanakaya Buddha Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni is the founder of the Order . At the age of thirty-five, Shakyamuni attained Buddhahood in Bodhgaya, India and began to teach the Path to Enlightenment (dharma) in this world. For the next forty-seven years the Buddha's teachings flourished and many beings attained enlightenment. At the age of eighty-two, Buddha Shakyamuni passed into nirvana. The Buddha Shakyamuni then manifested in two separate incarnations or emanations. A Master is said to be an emanation when he reincarnates into the world in human form for a specific purpose. In 90 A.B.B. (After Buddha's Birth), eight years after Buddha's Parinirvana, the first emanation of the Buddha, Padmasambhava, came into this world and received the complete teaching from many enlightened masters. As an emanation of the Buddha, Padmasambhava taught the Sacred Dzogchen Khandro Nyingthig to numerous beings in India and China. He also introduced Buddhism throughout T ibet. His main disciple, the Dakini Y eshe T sogyal, also taught the Dzogchen Khandro Nyingthig to many practitioners who achieved the enlightenment of Buddha. After achieving enlightenment, a Master will generally choose disciples to whom he will im part his sacred knowledge. This process involves many years of oral teachings and ener getic transmissions that are designed to prepare many the student for the transformation. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"29 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 These secret teachings are then handed down in the sacred manner from one disciple to another . This creates a lineage by which the ener gy and knowledge is preserved. In the seventeenth century , The Grand Dzogchen Monastery was founded by His Holiness Dzogchen Padma Rigdzin (1625-1697) in the Holy Rudam Canyon in T ibet. This great Master traveled to this area with his three main disciples: T erchen Nyima Drakpa, Ponlop Namkha Osel, and Rabjam Thenpai Gyaltsen. (1) When a Master chooses to impart his ener gy into a disciple, the power transfer is called the paradosis. This transfer allows the student to attain the knowledge, wisdom, and technique of the Master . This technique is ancient and has been employed by nearly every major religion in the world. When Padma Rigdzin helped his students achieve realization, a major part of hi s work was achieved through the power of the paradosis. In this way , the student could acquire the “transmission” and become a living conduit for the power of the teaching. T oday , there are hundreds of living “conduits” who are transmitters of secret knowledge from a hundred dif ferent sects, religions, and mystical orders. This is the way that a true spiritual lineage is propagated. Padma Rigdzin and his disciples taught the Dzogchen Khandro Nyingthig for many years. Thousands of T ibetans came to the Holy Rudam Canyon to receive teachings and practice Dzogchen. More than sixty-four of Padma Rigdzin's disciple s in this area attained Rainbow Body . Because of this, the Rudam Canyon area came to be known as the Holy Dzogchen Area. The monastery , Rudam Or gyen Samten Choling, became known as the Mother Dzogchen Monastery . T oday it is the center of Dzogchen Buddhism. Many generations of the Dzogchen Rudam Or gyen Samten Choling Monastery's V ajra masters continued to care for and preserve the Dzogchen lineage. Over many years, thousands of practitioners attained enlightenment and transformed themselves into light. The Mother Dzogchen Monastery became the center for the development of the V ajrayana Buddhist tradition in T ibet. Gradually , the Dzogchen Monastery grew to include seven hundred branch monasteries wit h tens of thousands of lamas and millions of followers throughout Asia. The Dzogchen Monastery continued to flourish until 1959. This coincided with the Chinese Occupation. The Great Natural Perfection Y ogi Dzogchen Khenpo Choga Rinpoche, is the twenty-fourth holder of the Dzogchen Khandro Nyingthig lineage. W ithin his being flows the ener gy of the original Buddha. In this way , he is a living conduit to the Primordial Life Force of the Buddha. In 1 10 A.B.B., twenty-eight years after Buddha's Parinirvana, the second emanation of the Buddha, Prahevajra (Garab Dorje), came into this world and received teachings directly from Sambhogakaya Buddha V ajrasattva. Prahevajra taught the Dzogchen Nyingthig to various beings for many years in India. His main disciple was Manjushrimitra. Manjushrimitra's main disciple was the Great Dzogchen master Shri Singha, who still lives in an enlightened state in the Holy Dzogchen V alley . Shri Manjushrimitra"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"30 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 Singha studied and practiced the dharma in India with Manjushrimitra and eventually became a great Siddha. From his guru he received the transmission of the six million Dzogchen T antras, the essence of the buddhadharma that enables one to accomplish buddhahood in one lifetime. Shri Singha became the sixth holder of the Dzogchen Nyingthig Lineage. After Manjushrimitra transformed himself into light, Shri Singha summoned his Master forth with a long heartfelt prayer . Suddenly Manjushrimitra reappeared in front of him. He gave Shri Singha a small treasure box containing the essential points of the T antras, Gomnyam Drugpa (The Six Experiences of Dzogchen Meditation). Following his master's instructions, Shri Singha then went to the Rudam Canyon. There, Shri Singha transmitted the Dzogchen teachings to numerous beings from many worlds and purelands. His main disciples were Jnanasutra and V imalamitra. After many years of benefiting beings, Shri Singha transformed into a Rainbow Body and disappeared into the radiant Dharmata. His secret transmission, Dzir Bu Dunpa (The Seven Dzogchen Nails), was passed into the hands of Jnanasutra. (2) Jnanasutra in turn gave the Dzogchen teachi ngs to V imalamitra, who then taught them in T ibet for many years. Hundreds of his followers attained enlightenment of Rainbow Body . His main disciple was T endzin Zangpo, who also taught the Dzogchen teachings to many practitioners. Later , this Dzogchen lineage passed from Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa through to the V ajra masters of the Dzogchen Shri Singha University . T oday , The Great Natural Space Y ogi Dzogchen Khenpo Choga Rinpoche, is the thirty-third holder of the Dzogchen Longchen Nyingthig lineage. (3) The fact that there are two great lineages of Dzogchen points to an ancient heritage that has been passed down for centuries. The history of these lineages is deeply embedded in the “legends” associated with the power of Dzogchen. The Masters of this Great Order are connected with the Original Buddha who later incarnated in two separate emanations. The ener gy from these emanations survives to this day in the being of two men who propagate the ener gy through a thriving spiritual tradition. The next great lineage holder of this great sacred power stems from a profoundly mystical tradition called the Sakya. The history of the Sakya Lineage begins with a race of celestial beings that descended from a part of the Spiritual W orld called the Clear Light heavens. This part of the Spiritual W orld exists as an extension of the Realm of Form. The Spiritual W orld may be divided into four great divisions; Consciousness, Being, Intellect, and Form. Several beings from the Realm of Form took up residence in the mountains of T ibet. They were known as “Lha Rig” which means “The Celestial Race”. After eight generations the “Lha Rig” also became known as the “Khön”, which means 'dispute ' or 'strife', due to a dispute with a Y aksha leader . In 750 Shri Singha"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"31 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 AD, the Khön family became students of Guru Padmasambhava. They received the V ajrakilaya empowerment, and one of the Khön sons received novice monk ordination. He then became one of the first seven monk translators in all of T ibet. For the next thirteen generations, (750-1073), the Khön family was a central pillar of the Nyingma School in T sang Province. In the eleventh century , the head of the Khön family , Sherab T sultrim, decided that it was time for his family to seek the spiritual teachings of India. The younger brother , Konchog Gyalpo, went to India and studied with Drogmi Lotsawa (992-1074). The name Sakya derives from the T ibetan sa- skya which means “white earth”. This is the beginning of the name “Sakya.” The holy family who are the hereditary leaders of this preci ous lineage are known by these three names, “Lha Rig”, “Khön” and “Sakya.” The son of Khön Konchog Gyalpo was Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092-1 158).He was a person of extraordinary skill and spiritual attainment who held all the lineages of Sutra and T antra. At the age of twelve, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo undertook a six month Manjushri retreat during which he had a vision of Manjushri accompanied by two Bodhisattvas. Sachen Kunga Nyingpo received the Lamdre teaching first from Shangton Chobar , and secondly from V irupa in a series of visions that lasted a month. This became known as the close or recent lineage. Sachen had four sons; Kunga Bar , Sonam T semo, Drakpa Gyaltsen, and Palchen Rinpoche. The first died while studying in India. The second son Sonam T semo (1 142-82) became a learned scholar at the early age of sixteen. At the age of forty-one he ascended bodily to Khecara, the divine realm of V ajra Y ogini. He had visions of many deities and also produced many enlightened disciples. Jetsun Dakpa Gyaltsen (1 147-1216), the third son, received lay celibacy vows and showed strong signs of spiritual maturity in his youth. At the age of eleven he gave his first spiritual teaching. The main student of Jetsun Dakpa Gyaltsen was his nephew , the famous Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen (1 182-1251). Sakya Pandita studied Buddhist and non- Buddhist philosophy , tantra, logic, Sanskrit, and astrology . When he was twenty-seven years old, after meeting with the Master Pandita Shakya Shribhadra, he became a fully ordained monk and maintained his vows. His works, including the T reasury of Logic on V alid Cognition and the Discrimination of the Three V ows are famous to the present day . He wrote 1 14 religious treatises. The T reasury of Logic on V alid Cognition was the only text of T ibetan origin ever to have been translated into Sanskrit. In 1244, intrigued by Sakya Pandita's reputation, Godan Khan, grandson of Ghengis Khan, invited Sakya Pandita to Mongolia, where he gave Buddhist teachings. Later , in 1253, after both Sakya Pandita and Godan Khan had passed away , the emperor , Sechen Kublai Khan invited Drogon Chogyal Phagpa, the nephew of Sakya Pandita, to his court. Phagpa invented a new script in which to write the Mongolian language. Kublai Khan was so impressed by Phagpa's performance that he declared Buddhism the state religion of Mongolia and presented him the rule of the three provinces of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"T ibet. Thus, Phagpa was the first person in T ibetan history to gain religious and secular authority over the whole country . It was at this time that the great temple Lhakang Chenmo was completed in Sakya. T o this day it still stands and houses the greatest religious library in T ibet. Phagpa was succeeded by his brother Chagna and altogether the Sakyap as ruled T ibet for more than a hundred years. T ishri Kunglo (1299-1327), eldest of the fifteen grand sons of Sakya Pandita's brother , founded four dynastic Palaces: Zhithog, Rinchen Gang, Lhakhang and Ducho. Only the last of these four great houses survives. In the eighteenth century , at the time of Sakya T rizin W angdu Nyingpo, the Ducho Palace split into two - the Dolma Phodrang and Phuntsok Phodrang. The present heads of these two palaces are His Holiness Sakya T rizin Ngawang Kunga (b. 1945) of the Drolma Palace, and His Eminence Dagchen Rinpoche (b. 1929) of the Phuntsok Palace. His Holiness Sakya T rizin, the head of the Drolma Palace, is the current head of the Sakya tradition. He is the 4lst holder of the Sakya Throne and lives in Dehra Dun, India. His Holiness has two sons and a sister , Jetsunma Chimey Luding, who teaches extensively throughout the world. His Eminence Dagchen Rinpoche founded Sakya Thegchen Choling in Seattle, W ashington. Dagchen Rinpoche 32 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 has one brother , His Eminence Thinley Rinpoche. Dagchen Rinpoche has five sons. The second son, Ananda V ajra Rinpoche, an accomplished lawyer , is currently living in Dharamsala, India. He assists the Dalai Lama with legal and constitutional matters. Succession to the position of Sakya T rizin, head of the Sakya tradition, has been hereditary since the time of Khön Konchog Gyalpo and recently alternates between the two palaces. (4) A third great lineage holder of the secret knowledge of the Rainbow Body lives in Java. His Eminence Prince Ratu Agung Sri Acarya V ajra Kumara Pandji Pandita Pandji Sakti was born in Bandung, Java. He is an incarnate T antric and Mahamudra master in the unbroken lineage of the Indonesian Sakya tradition. From the lineage of his father's Royal Dragon clan, he is a 12th generation direct descendent of the enlightened King Pandji Sakti of Bali, who dissolved his body to light in 1663. H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita is the great grandson to the last Dharma King of Bali, Ratu Agung Made Singaraja, who spent the last half of his life in dark retreat in a cave. Ratu Agung Made Singaraja was known throughout Indonesia as a T antric master and hero in battle His Holiness Sakya T rizin Ngawang K unga His Eminence Dagchen Rinpoche"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"against the Dutch. H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita's mother , Raden Juariah (Princess of Dawn), is a direct descendant of the lineage of Asanga and Nagarjuna, in which all the Dharma kings dissolved their bodies to light. In addition to H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita 's training as a Buddhist Master , he was taught and guided by his grandfather Raden Sasmita Atmadja. His grandfather is a very well known Sufi and Dzogchen master in Java. The great grandfather of Raden Sasmita Atmadja was Syech Abdul Muhyi. He was an enlightened being and a greatly revered Sufi master from Indonesia. On the 9th December 1994, H.E. Prince Ratu Sri Acarya V ajra Kumara Pandji Pandita Pandji Sakti was recognised and coronated as King of the Dharma of the authentic V ajrayana lineage in the mandalas of Manjusri and King Pandji Sakti. This was the first such recognition of a high spiritual teacher in the lineage since the death of his great grandfather in the 19th century . This is an extremely high spiritual honor . H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita was recognised by both the Dragon and T iger lineages as an emanation of Manjusri and Maitreya Buddhas. He has also been recognized as a direct emanation of King Pandji Sakti. This lineage is famous for its teachings on pristine awareness, absolute compassion and healing. Throughout history all of the lndonesian masters are renowned for their healing power . H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita, was a Doctor of T raditional Chinese Medicine and Master of martial arts. The Indonesian V ajrayana lineage is a healing and T antric tradition. This lineage teaches the art of liberation through loving relationships and our relationship with the worId around us. H.E. Prince Ratu Pandji Pandita is the founder of the King Pandji Sakti Sangha V ajrayana Buddhist Society , International. (5) The knowledge and power of the transmission of Rainbow Body technique has a long and complex history . Not only is the power real, it is protected with a fervor that is unlike anything I have ever witnessed. However , the knowledge of the Rainbow Light Body transcends Buddhism. There are a number of the world's great religions that teach about the existence of an immortal light form to which all humans are heir . All the major spiritual traditions of the world demonstrated that enlightenment of spiritual realization is not simply a one-time psychological event. As a process, spiritual realization has progressive phases, or sub-stages, of transformation. V ery real and tangible physical changes occur as a person ascends in consciousness through mystical or transcendent experiences. In the last stage of enlightenment, according to esoteric teachings in various sacred traditions and schools, the human body itself is changed from flesh into light. Through the process of transubstantiation of the flesh, blood, skin, and bone, one actually becomes a being made of light. This Light Body is generally accepted to be an immortal and indestructible Form by all accounts. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, this body is called the “resurrection body” or the “glorified body .” Saint Paul called it the “celestial body” or the “spiritual body .” In Sufism, it is called “the most sacred body” and the “supracelestial body .” In T aoism, it is called the “the diamond body ,” and those few humans who have attained it are called “the Immortals.” In T antrism and various yoga systems it is called “the vajra body” 33 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Gifts Prizes and “the adamantine body .” In ancient Egypt, it was called “the lumi nous being.” Sri Aurobindo, a great Indian teacher and mystic, stated that “divine body” is the ultimate stage of human evolution. He felt that a deathless condition resulting from transubstantiation of the fleshly body could be attained by personal ef fort, meditation, and divine grace. The seeds of this immortal form are said to exist within each of us. The caterpillar contains all the information within its genome necessary for its transformation into a butterfly . In the process, there is a complete transubstantiation of its fleshly body into something totally unlike its birth form. According to the ancients, all humans possess this transformative ability . How does W estern Science perceive this phenomenon? Is there any scientific basis for these miraculous claims? Does physics as we know it support these teachings? 34 YSR SEPTEMBER 2007 www .tybro.com © , all rights reserved Mitchell Earl Gibson MD www .yourspiritualrevolution.or g T o find out mor e, email us: editor@Y ourSpiritualRevolution.org Sponsor ed pr oducts & Services will qualify Pr omote Y our Revolutionary Prizes & Gifts to YSR Readers.

When you were born your perception of these ener gies was limitless. As children you could automatically tuned into the unseen universe around you. As you became an adult, this awareness began to diminish. Y ou feel limited due to your inherent struggle to adjust to harshness of physical existence. It is not a struggle for you to exist etherically The world is truly a melting pot of not only dif ferent types of living beings, but also dif ferent types of ener gy and vibrations. The world around you is changing. Y ou are entering a time now where your previously limited perceptions are expanding toward an evolution in human consciousness. Y our blinders can be removed to reveal a world full of depth that you didn’ t realize was there all along. This is partly due to so much other stimuli in the world that can work against the perception of your etheric en er gy . This is mostly what can cloud your vision. Things such as the electromagnetic radiation emitted from electrical wires, cell phones, television sets and computers. These types of ener gies disrupt the natural cohesive quality of our etheric body and ener gy . Shifting our perceptions to the dynamics of ener gy all around us can be dif ficult but is essentially necessary to become a part of the vibrational world around you. The key is to shift your perception slightly and understand the existence of such ener gies. This allows you to incorporate more ener gy concepts in your daily life. By recognizing that all individuals have a unique ener gy such as, plants and animals, emotions and feelings and thoughts. The words you speak contain their own ener gy frequency . So be careful what you say and think! Because the ener gy will come back to you at some point in the future. By expanding your consciousness this way , you will accept that you are receiving ener gy and vibration throughout your day . Once you view these dynamics, then you can begin to assess how you feel in relationship to these ener gies. Y ou can form greater trust with your instincts and feelings.

So that you can begin to shift your own perceptions, here is an example situation to illustrate a common ener gy dynamic and one that causes a lot of frustration: Let’ s say you are waiting at a red light at a busy intersection. Y ou see a car coming up to the intersection, headed your direction in the lane next to you. The light turns green and you push on your accelerator to proceed across the intersection. The car in the lane beside yours whizzes past you and suddenly cuts you of f in your lane. Several seconds later the car hits its brakes to slow down to turn onto the next street. Y ou are upset and startled. Why did this person just speed up to slow down? The situation occurred quickly and was over the moment the car in front of you turned that corner . Now you continue to drive to your destination. How do you feel? A common response to this question would be angry , mad, frustrated, frantic, and so on. Can you see the ener gy dynamic happening in the above situation? Y ou could say that the behavior of the individual in the other car was rude and or get mad and yell at them. Having emotions about the action of this other person is not a bad response. W e are human and have emotions and frustrations just like everyone else. It’ s important after your initial reaction to take your processing of the situation a step further to look at what's going on ener getically . First, the person in the other car has their own ener gy just like you do. They are traveling at a high rate of speed in a vehicle. Let's just imagine for a moment what happening with this ener gy dynamic as you sit in your car as the force of their ener gy is coming up behind you. Y our etheric self can feel the wave of ener gy moving toward you long before it reaches you. Then the wave arrives as they pull into the lane next you. Not just the momentum of ener gy of that individual but also their thoughts and feelings as well. That person could be late or worried about getting somewhere. All these lower vibrations wave across you as the individual is even with you on the road. As they pass and then move in front of you, the ener gy surrounds you. As a being made of ener gy , you can imagine the reaction you would have to feel such an ener gy force coming at you and surrounding you. This is where our emotions come into play . Our emotions are reactions and can be a counter move to stimuli as you experience it. Often when ener gy comes at us that is forceful and of a lower vibration you often match the vibrational ener gy you are receiving. In order to reach am equilibrium with the \"invading\" ener gy . This is called entrainment. So when the car came forward and cut you of f, your etheric reaction was to emit an emotional ener gy in order to accommodate the new vibration you were receiving.

Y ou do not have to necessarily match the chaotic vibrations of others. Y ou can hold your own vibration in balance and harmony instead of allowing it to get pulled to and fro. This ability will come with practice and a willingness to hold the highest vibrations in the universe – spreading altruism and unconditional love. Apply this same principle to other intera ctions in your life. Understand the ener gy dynamics in your life. They are all around you in every person you interact with. The goal is to fully awakening of your etheric self.. Y ou can also assist others with there own spiritual transitions if you begin to open your heart to understand the ener gy everywhere in your life. As you begin to perceive the ener gy in your life, a dramatic shift can occur . Through this new awareness you gain greater empathy for people through your utilization of these vibrational concepts. When you view the ener gy involved in a particular situation it becomes less and less about \"he said, she said\" or \"me and them\" and more about being one with the collective vibrations of the universe. Y ou can help to remove the judgments from your world by incorporating ener gy and living more vibrationally in the years that follow . © C J Martes, all rights reserved www .cjmartes.com www .yourspiritualrevolution.or g T o qualify you must be an active reader of YSR and you must have filled up your contact details t o receive the prizes.
