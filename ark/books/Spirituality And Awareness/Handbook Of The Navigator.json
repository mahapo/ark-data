The only way to truly understand them is to directly experience them for yourself. This book is not an ordinary bo ok. It is an extraordinary mechanism to recreate within you, the reader, a very special effect. It creates a vibration of sp ecific thought that I call multi- dimensional consciousness. This is achieved by a se ries of thought patterns or what I call realizations. I first discovered this process when I was very young and it has had a powerful effect on my life as I am sure it will on yours."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PREFACE I was about seven years old on a warm summer day. The air was laced with the scent of dry gra ss fields and the hum of buzzing insects in the distance. I was sitting on the steps to my home listening deeply to the melody of sounds and the smells of nature. The harmony of scent and sound ga ve way to great inner peace for me and it still does to this day. This harmony moved my consciousness to a place in my mind I was unfamiliar with but it felt completely natural. I now refer to this place as ‘the in-between’. Within that place I felt something directing me ever-so subtly to walk out into a nearby field that was overgrown with tall dry grass. I found a small path and began to walk towards the center of the field, knowing somehow that it was my destination. I knew there was a small pond in the field, once used for dairy cows. I had ice- skated on it with friends during the winter months but had not returned since the spring. On my way down the path I beca me aware of grasshoppers that were resting on dried blades of grass. Stopping for a moment I looked at one and it seemed to look back at me. I remember a stillness and quietness came over me. I was unaware of anything happening around me as I was drawn into the grasshopper. My eyesight had become clearer and en hanced but it did not seem to completely be my eyesight. I wa s aware of the firm structure and color of the grasshopper with its legs holding the stem of the grass and its mouth moving slowly and then rapidly. Its eyes seemed to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREFACE almost speak to me. I had merged and become one with the grasshopper. Then I suddenly inhaled. I had forgotten to breathe for a moment. During my inward breath I detached my mind from the grasshopper and continued my walk towards the pond in the center of the field. The harmonious sounds of that day again filled my ears as summer’s warmth wrapped around me. There seemed to be nothing but the field and the buzzi ng sounds of nature all around me. I felt a deep sense of peace and calm. I knew somehow that something was about to be revealed to me and it was important to allow myself to experience what was happening. The path widened and gave way to a shimmering golden pond with the sun reflected on its surface. As I walked closer I noticed the smell of the field became blended w ith the scent of water and mud. They became new instruments in the harmony of scent and sound for me that afternoon. The shimmering pond beckoned my young and curious mind. After spotting a large stone outstretched from the embankment into the water, I decided to lie down. Lying down on the stone, facing the water, I began to experience th e sun’s warmth contained in the rock. It embraced me and I openly accepted its warmth."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACE I noticed my reflection in the pond and moved to a better position. The sun and small moving clouds behind my image gave me a sense that I was looking at some one other than myself. Then something moved underneath the surface of the water and caught my eye. As I was peering through the glassy water that was separating my reflection to what was hidden behind it, I noticed an underwater micro world. Hundreds of frog eggs were c linging to the pond’s weeds. A myriad of water insects were spiraling and swimming around. The frog eggs drew me in and I noticed it was as if they were a galaxy of life unto themselves, with new life contained within each majestic orb. Then the summer sunlight penetrated the water in golden beams and separated the shadows of darkness. Once again, I had almost forgotte n to breathe so I took a deep breath inward. I rolled over onto my back and looked up into the blue sky while soaking up the sun's warmth. I became aware of a distant buzz slowly growing louder a nd louder. In fact, it grew so loud it alarmed me. Just before I leapt to my feet, a dragonfly flew within inches of my face. My en tire being was exhilarated with a rush of adrenaline as it quickly sp ed away along with the alarming buzz it seemingly created. Standing, I looked at the field aroun d me. I took a deep breath and felt myself filled with an internal hum. It was a blissful vibration as if the dragonfly’s buzz was now within me but I could not detect exactly from where."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PREFACE It rapidly grew more intense a nd enveloped my entire being. It pulsated through me. At that moment, I became aware of every cell in my body humming in harmony with the others. I then felt compelled to look up into the sky. I watched as the bright blue sky gave way to patches of night sky until the daytime had quickly become night! Suddenly in the middle of that summer day, stars appeared, and much like how I experienced the grasshopper, they seemingly became larger within themselves. I was aware of their presence both visually and internally. The stars were moving through me. I breathed in deeply and they qui ckly faded away into the blue sunny sky. The internal humming faded and I felt a great peace within me. I slowly looked in a circular mo tion all around me taking notice of the pond, the field, the insects, the birds, and the forest trees. I realized that all is one. It was at that very moment that something surfaced within me. It was a memory that seemed to add to my being; a missing piece of who or what I was. I recognized that something had guided me to experience that moment and that I had chosen unknowingly to listen to it. I now liste n to it everyday of my life and have come to call it the Navigator."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PREFACE May the Navigator be awakened within you and may it guide you to what you have been seeki ng your entire life; completion.

You are aware of a sense within you that seemingly directs you as if it were a compass navigating your essence.

An in-between place that defies logic as humanity understands it. Your hidden senses tell you, that what your eyes see, and hands touch, is not all that there is. You look around in a distant way and then you listen deeply, breathe deeply, feel deeply and It is then that you know that there is a veil between you and some other place that holds an understanding to that which you are.

I know the forgotten part of you that yearns for knowledge which will lead to peace and co mpletion. I know what lies within you and what it is trying to help you do. I have been searching for you for so long. All of my life I have been preparing for this moment. The moment we finally meet and I can say to you, at long last, welcom e Navigator. I have so much to share with you. It is time to begin. It is time for you to awaken. THE DESIRE OF THE SEEKER I am about to share with you what the Navigator is. However, I must also tell you that it is not something that is easily described. It is elusive but it holds a prof ound secret that, once realized, will change your life forever. I am going to humbly compare you to a salmon. I want you to think about the journey of a salm on. Now, I know it does not have a consciousness as you do and that it cannot think as you do. The salmon has much to share with you if you will but compare it to your own journey and open yourself to see the truth. Imagine you live in a vast ocean. All of your life, as long as you can remember, you have lived in this great water world, teeming with life. You see, a salmon is born far from the ocean in fresh"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR water rivers. It trav els down into the sea and reaches maturity there only to journey back to its hatching grounds before it dies. You probably remember very li ttle from early childhood. Had you traveled down a river when you were very young most of what you would remember would only be of the world where you grew up. As a salmon, your first memories ar e of this huge ocean. It is a brilliant and beautiful world. There are so many things to experience and places to see. Th is ocean world is so large and filled with so many places to see one could wander for lifetimes and never even consider the possibil ity of anything outside of it. You, of course, are different. All of your life you have lived in th is great ocean of life. When you were younger, you enjoyed life in the ocean and all it had to offer. However, somewhere in the back of your mind you always felt there was something more somehow beyond it. There was a feeling, deep inside of you, that made you restless. It made you think that the world you knew a nd loved was somehow keeping you from discovering a place beyond it all that held an answer to the very essence of your being. This feeling made you yearn for something you could not see with your eyes but believed existed. All of your life this feeling ha s spoken to you, it has made you question the world around you. You ha ve always tried to push this feeling aside, discounting and que stioning any purpose in acting on it. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Still, this feeling always remained within you. Then on a warm day with the sw eet spring current sweeping in from the south, something happened. You were going about your life and everything was normal. Then it was as if something flipped a switch inside of you. Th e strange feeling you had always felt welled up and it was as if everything in your body spoke with a single, undeniable voice. You have a purpose . It was as if some instinctual pa rt, something deep within you, was screaming to be heard. It was greater than any hunger you had ever known. Any thirst or emo tional longing had never compared to this need. This feeling, this instinctual call, does not have a specific name or design. It is not a blueprint or map. A salmon would not have the intellec t to consider these things but even if it did, do you think it woul d understand? At some point a salmon’s instinct tells it to return. If it did have our intellect it would probably try to rationalize wh at it was feeling and why. It would repress this feeling. Have you felt something similar that you have tried to ignore? If so, then you can see how your journey and the journey of this imaginary salmon are beginning to relate. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Being beyond your ability to understand, you tr ied to repress this feeling as well. You are just a simple salmon, how could you have a special purpose? You tried to shake it off but the feeling would not leave you. Nobody else you kne w seemed to fully understand. It was much like the old yearning yo u had always felt but so much stronger. Still, it made no sense. There was no expl anation for it. Worse yet, the questions grew stronger and your longing grew greater. It continued to speak to you. You are more than what you seem. Desperate, you began to try and find answers in those around you. The other fish could not relate to this strange desire that lived within you. Not giving up so easily you began searching the stories of others. They were ancient texts and their truths uncertain, yet they spoke of a pl ace beyond the ocean. These texts spoke of brave souls who journeye d far beyond the confines of the ocean and came back to help others find their way. These stories gave you some comfort and you trie d to use them to quiet your inner gnawing. It did not take long for the rest lessness to return. The feeling inside instinctually fe lt right but it fought against every rational thought you had. Still, the feelin g would not be satisfied. It offered no relief but to hear its cry. Return. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR You can question no more. Your st range instinct fi lls you with an uncertain desire and drives you to seek this unknown place. Against all odds, you begin your journe y of discovery. It begins as all journeys do, with a single step, a simple moment of choice. It is a daunting task, with an uncertain goal. The world is boundless. The chances of finding this hidden place are almost impossible. Everything is set against you finding your way. Still, you feel you cannot help but try, fighting agai nst every rationa l thought that suggests your search is in vain. Think about how amazing it is that a salmon, with very little intelligence at all, will travel from an enormous ocean and find the one river it was born in. Out of al l of the other st reams and rivers pouring into this huge ocean it searches for one specific channel and finds it. It is lucky for the salmon it does not consider the odds of fulfilling its task. Given similar odds most people might not even begin. This is one important lesson you ca n gain from your life as this humble salmon. Despite the refl ection of doubt and uncertainty that we have given it for this story, it chooses to listen to its instinct. It puts effort into an ear nest search. Now, let us continue your journey as a salmon. For a long time you swim through the ocean. For a long time you search trying to follow this all-consuming instinct, going far beyond the place you began."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Then one day you happen to swim upon a small, bubbling cove. Within the cove a current of water pushes from above, plunging you to the floor and filling the li ttle cove with bubbles. Thick, brilliant green moss lines the walls. It is a strangely familiar place, one you had visited many times when you were very young. While our salmon can only see this bubbling cove we can conceive that it is a small waterfall where a stream meets the ocean. It is only perspective. It does not understand something we see as obvious. Now consider that there are ma ny things in your life that you do not understand because you lack a higher perspective. Humbly speaking, one of the reasons I chos e the salmon is that in many ways, we are as small and simple on our journey to awakening as the fish is back to its own source. Keep this idea of perspective in mind as we continue to follow you r life as a salmon back to its source. Weariness sets in and you slide to the floor feeling defeated. It seemed as if you had traveled so far, only to end up back where you began. In anger, part of you immediately wants to get up and swim far away from this cove and redouble your efforts to continue your quest. Another pa rt whispers quietly to lie down, rest and take a breath. This wh isper moves you to feel like letting go, which to you, feels like defeat. You quickly resist this idea until you notice this whispering part is that same old feeling, deep"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR inside, that seemed to urge you down this path so long ago. Exhausted and beaten you give in and accept this quiet feeling and lie down. It is then you notice a strange feeling in the current splashing down from above. Curious, you swim closer. For a moment you feel the water movi ng through the current is somehow different. Then you shake it o ff and quickly decide there is nothing there at all. Yet, it give s you a sense of i nner stillness and after a pause you decide the water is indeed strange and that it must be followed. You take a moment to look back at the great ocean, the world you know. The current will take you beyond the familiar world you can relate to and following it means you will be moving against the flow. Then, without thinking or expecting much, you push to follow it. It is difficult at first as the current pushing against you is strong and nothing like the world you lived in before. It takes a great deal of effort. Every gain you make is threatened by the f ear that if you stopped the current would suddenl y push you right back to where you began. Suddenly a giant shape crashes into the water from above. It is brown with swirling fur and long, shar p spikes that resemble teeth. Unprepared for such an event you pause only to be suddenly pushed back by the stream! F earful of losing ground you push awkwardly as the brown claw smashes into your side. You scream in shock and tighten up as the claw pulls you from the water! Then everything moves in slow motion a nd a feeling of incredible calm"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR surges through your being. It urges you to relax, let go, and surrender. You listen to it as you, very gently, twist your body. Naturally, your body slips out of the claw. As you begin to fall you feel as if the world has stopped. You look around and see the great, silvery stream shining in the sun. Except you are above it! You see it in a way you had never imagined before. It climbs far ahead of you with many other streams branching off and mergi ng into one. Looking back you can also see it winding down into the great ocean where you came from. Your mouth opens in awe as you r ealize it is all connected. The ocean where you began, the stream you have been swimming through and the very place you ar e seeking. This knowledge somehow empowers you and opens your mind as you begin to see a larger picture beyond just your lone search. Your own spiritual journey will also have many obstacles and dangers. The danger for you, as with the salm on, is that you will not make it to your destination. There is a purpose the salmon is trying to fulfill in reaching the source. Your own journey is not so different. Often, in the process of struggling and overcoming the obstacles in your path, you have profound realiz ations and experiences. The salmon was attacked by the bear and lifted from the water. On one hand, you could say its life was in da nger. On the other hand, you"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR could say it released its fear an d overcame the bear. Even more, the experience altered the salmon’s perspective and allowed it to see and realize something it never would have had been able to otherwise. Fear is the mind-kille r. Of all the obstacles through life, it is fear that often poses th e greatest danger. It can prevent you from continuing on your way. Luckily, you are a brave salmon, and surviving the bear only empowers and strengthens you. Your body hits the water and you dr op into a swirling pool, back into the world. There you see other fish and almost instinctively you know; they are like you, they know what you are seeking. Searching you find that many currents lead away from the pools but only one leads to the source. Knowing there are others who are seeking with you gives you a sense of comfort. S till, none seem to know the way and you consider that your search ma y be in vain. As before, it seems when you begin to accept defeat and surrender, your instincts rise to be heard. You have a purpose that is cal ling to you. There are many obstacles on your journey and many dangers that await you. Against the greatest of odds, this purpose must be fulfilled. Determined to fulfill it you sear ch the pool until you find a current that has the strange water that seems to call to you. It is also moving through the strongest curren t crashing down from above."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Thinking, you tell yourself it cannot be right, that you must find an easier path. Another part in you instinctually leaps out and you feel compelled to push up the fiercest stream. Struck with amazement at how long you follow the stream you begin to question the sense in fo llowing such a thing. It seems illogical that you should work so hard to follow something that might not lead anywhere or se rve any reasonable purpose. This is the problem with your in tellect, it allows you to understand but it causes you to question. It causes you to doubt the very instinct within you. Many times yo u cannot even tell if the strange water is real or just a figment of your imagination. It does not look any different, or smell different; in fact, none of your senses seem to suggest there is anything di fferent about it at all! Your instinct does not exist outsid e of you in the phys ical world so your brain tried to explain it by creating something it could understand. In this case it led y ou to believe there was something elusive and different about the water. You were able to accept this and follow it until you realized what it truly was. It is more of a feeling, than anything, which tells you to keep following it. It is your deep, inner instinct, calling and directing you to the source where you began. Even though you recognize it, that does not mean you will not continue to question following it. With every passing moment struggling against the current, you fill with an increasing desire to abandon your chosen route. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Suddenly you push out of the strong current into a large quiet pool, the likes of which you have never seen before. Giant crystals, glistening and shining with brilliant colors protrude from the sides of the pool. Refracted light bounces and plays across everything. The entire pool radiates with a de ep, cool current and an air of mystical beauty. Wonder so fills your entire being that you have trouble breathing and cannot help but choke back te ars of joy. Before, where your heart was troubled with doubt it now beats with renewed spirit and vigor. For a time you pause and much of you longs to remain in this place. It gives you hope and in stills in you a sense of mystery about the world you have never fe lt. This experience, this discovery, fills you with encouragement to keep following your strange instinct despite the lack of any certainty that it will ever lead you to the place you seek. With a purposeful thrust, you continue on your way. Your journey is long. Many times, frustrated, uncerta in and weary, you abandon your search. At these times you live quietly in the calm pools. Each time your memories of the crystal pool, and other amazing discoveries you found along your sear ch, stirs you to continue on your journey. Your strange inner instinct leads you to new places, unique places, different from anyt hing you have seen before. Each discovery pushes you onward with renewed vigor and intensity. In time, you cease questioning where your instinct will take you."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR You learn to trust it, even through the darkest of waters that are devoid of any light. Stranger still, you begin to sense that it is not taking you away into the unknown, but bringing you back to a place you have always known. Whether by chance or some design of fate, when at last you cease questioning it, you push into a de ep, dark pool whose bottom you cannot see. You can feel no curr ent coming from any direction. Fear and shock begin to overwhelm you as you consider that it is a dead-end. You have failed. It is time to give up. You are weary and while you fear defeat and ultimately your death, you accept it. It is then the familiar feeling d eep inside of you stirs slightly. Having learned through your long journe y to trust this feeling, you take a deep breath and release your fears. Then, you quiet your thoughts and listen intentl y, trying to become aware of everything around and within you. It is then this feeling insi de of you grows stronger and you have a s udden urge to look up. All of this time you have been slowly sinking and you are floating near the bottom. You see shining flashes of silver, other salmon, strange and ethereal in appearan ce are there with you. Shining golden globes line the floor and yo u are filled with a feeling of great peace and joy. You have reached the source. It is here that a part of you will die yet another part of you will be reborn."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR Your own journey will not appear the same. It will not be finished in a small pool with other fish and fish eggs lining the riverbed floor. It will be similar in that it is the moment all of your instincts are driving you towards. Attaining that moment will give you peace beyond description. It wi ll give you completion. If you were a salmon, do you think you would feel so very different? BEFORE THE NAVIGATOR CAN BE FOLLOWED, IT MUST BE FOUND The Navigator is like the salmon’s instinct. It can help you find a path among the experiences in your life and will lead, at last, into an awakened state of consciousness. This state will allow you to experience your higher consciousne ss. While you may not realize it now this awakened state is everything you have been searching for, it is completeness. It will not be as simple as finding a stream, but if followed, the Navigator will lead you to awaken into your higher consciousness. You may wonder why I call it an aw akened state of consciousness. Are you not already awake? The truth is, you are in a sleep. Not an ordinary restful nighttime slumbe r, this sleep is very different and far from ordinary.

However, it was not until you stopped and recognized it was something within you that you began to truly follow it. That was the moment of recognition. That is when you realized the feeling was more than a feeling, it was a separate thing. It was the Navigator. To follow the Navigator you must first recognize and acknowledge it exists. Like the strange instinct lead ing through the winding streams, you should follow where the Navigator leads. Much like a compass, the Navigator directs your essence. However, also like a compass, the Navigator can only be a helpfu l guide. It is still up to you to follow it. This is not as easy as it sounds. A compass is a tool you can touch and hold in your hands. In our physical material world, seeing is often believing, which is not how the Navigator works. It is a hidden sense. It tells you there is more to this world than what your eyes see and hands touch.

The path set by the Navigator leads to a revelation that will unveil the truth of your being. THE TRUTH OF YOUR BEING You have known your entire life that you are here to serve a greater purpose. What you do not know is exactly what that purpose is or what the driving forc e behind it is. Yet, ever since you were young, you have been aware of it. Realizing that sense of purpose, feeling it, is the first moment the Navigator makes itself known to you. In its own way your Navigator is trying to reveal to you the nature of your being. How much it reveals to you depends on the choices you make. For the Navigator to be effective we must listen to it, because like any other instinct, we can repress it, ignore it or be strengthened by it. The Navigator provides an ins tinctual sense of the truth. As babies, instinctually we know to su ckle milk from our mother, so too instinctually we know that the Navigator leads to knowledge that will aid in awakening. This instinct alone w ill not lead to awakening. You must refine your ability to understand what the Navigator is saying.

That is right, you have a higher purpose. Although you may have already fe lt this throughout your entire life, it is important to acknowledg e it. As I mentioned earlier, feeling is the first way the Navigator begins to subtly reveal itself. Are you beginning to see the quiet way of the Navigator? Its purpose, its very design, is to help you achieve yours. Your higher purpose ties strongly into what you really are. Beyond who you are right now, the pe rson reading this book, there is another part of you. It is your higher self. It is your higher consciousness. Our higher consciousness is the truest form of what we are. It is the culmination of all of our lives and experiences. I said lives because we are capable of m oving beyond the life we are living now and being reborn into another. Our higher consciousness may contain the memories of a great ma ny lives, or this life may be our first. The higher consciousness is really our soul, which is just another word to describe it. It is our most complete consciousness.

It is very similar with the sa lmon. Its body or biological clock knows, on some level, its life expectancy is running out. Every instinct in its being is fighting one last battle for it to reach its final destination and fulfill its purpose. It is a natural instinctive process for the salmon to return to the place it was born and create new life. We have a similar instinctual urging. While this push is not for us to return to the place of our physical birth and procreate, as is the pur pose of the salmon’s instinct, it is to ensure the survival of a form of life on a different level. It is the Navigator fighting to ensure the survival of our higher consciousness and it has a limited amount of time to do it. The odds are against it as we have poi sons in the air, fatty foods, disease and war. It retains everything forming in our minds, determining how we are going to exist when we leave this planet and how far we will go and what our existence will be.

This need is our Navigator struggling to find a way to help us awaken to our higher consciousness. It is th e survival instinct of our higher consciousness. This process is difficult because we cannot understand the meaning of the message from our higher consciousness with normal human thinking. The way the brain thi nks is too structured and the knowledge of our higher consciou sness is without constructs! At this stage, we receive bits of information and the Navigator helps us find tools and knowledge th at we add to our brain to help it develop and interpret the messa ge of our higher consciousness, which will lead to awakening. This is the purpose of the Navigator and what it is really trying to do. It is trying to find the knowledge, the tools, the equipment or the wiring for what we are building! We are building a receiver to dow nload our higher consciousness into our current consciousness. The Navigator knows what we need and it will tell us, “use this part, do not use that one, and throw this away! This knowledge or technique is good stuff, but this ot her stuff is bad!” The Navigator is trying to help us build a be tter translator so we can receive messages from our higher consciousness.

It helped you choose which path to take and urged you to keep going. In life, it is very similar. It is a guide that tells us what experience, or knowledge, is right for us, and what is not. The difficulty is in knowing what it is really saying. Remember it is like an instinct so it communicates internally. That communication will not be like a voice inside your head yelling, “Hey John! We need to talk!” or , “Hey Mary you better listen up I got something to say!” It will not be a booming voice, calling out your name and commanding you to follow its instructions. What about animals that migrate, how do they know when to migrate and where to go? Do you think if you were a salmon you would hear a salmon voice in you r head telling you what to do? Do animals hear voices that go, ‘Moo, moo’, or, ‘meow, meow, bark, bark, howl’? Do birds hear an internal squawking that tells them when to fly south? No. It will be a quie t inner knowing. This inner knowing does not have a word or a name for it. This knowing is similar to the inner knowing that a pregnant woman might experience when she craves unusual foods for the vitamins or minerals that her body needs. When people experience a fee ling, or a sense of knowing something they might otherwise not know, it is often associated with intuition. Intuition is th e way in which the Navigator manifests itself.

MOVING BEYOND IS LEARNING TO TRUST Imagine an airplane sitting on a runway. For the sake of this analogy, let us say that the ground is our brain. Our whole life we yearn to fly, to know the highest regions that call to us from the bright blue sky. The sky is our higher consciousness. We spend most of our life on the ground, in our head. Even though we like it on the ground, moving on the ground is very different from how we coul d move flying through the air. Because we yearn to fly we know the only way to experience what it is really like to fly is to do it. For us to achieve flight we need to know where we are going and how to get into the air. That is why we have our trusty pilot, the Navigator. The Navigator tells us to sit back, relax, have a pillow and close our eyes. The Navigator tells us to take a deep breath and to not fear leaving the gr ound, which has held us our entire life. Of course, a pilot is no good unless they have a plane to carry us where we want to go. This is why we also have a plane called Intuition. Now we are ready. We have to trust our pilot, the Navigator, and the plane, Intuition, which will take us into the sky. The Navigator uses the vehicle, Intuition, to pick up momentum, a nd it needs a lot of momentum."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE NAVIGATOR The plane engines are powerful but they need quite a bit of runway time and speed running those wheels because the brain will not let us take off so easily, it wants us to believe we cannot ever leave the ground. With Intuition, the Navigator can ge t us there. We can blast down the runway and then when we ha ve enough speed, lift off into the sky, our higher consciousness. In order for the airplane to successfully take off it must first gain lots of speed as it goes down the runway. Only after it has enough speed can it lift into the air, and take flight. Intuition is like the airplane running down the runway and we must use it until eventually it goes beyond the brain and starts to lift off the pavement of just a physical leve l and goes into impossibilities we could never get from rational deduction. Intuition for most people is partia lly the sixth sense and partially logical deduction based on experience. It is bridging two ways of thinking like the plane bridges the ground and the sky by moving between them. If our experience in this physical life does not rationally deduce how we would know something intuitively or in any other way then we know there is something more to it. It is a matter of reaching the point wher e we move beyond just using our brain. The Navigator is trying to help us find that momentum.

They are in conflict because messages from th e higher conscious ness will not fit in our brain. These messages ar e like square pegs that we are trying to force into circular holes. Our brains are very se lective about what we can receive and they naturally reduce th e bountiful amount of info rmation that waits in the higher consciousness. We must go through the process of teaching our brains to think diffe rently. This process will be difficult because when we use our brain, it sets up conduits and structures that dictate the met hods by which we process data. In time, our brain takes these condu its and structures and uses them to filter data automatically without our knowing. We set up the process and it follows our programming. As we awaken, we must learn to relax the structures of the brain and develop a clear consciousness to remove the filte rs and ease this information through. As the constructs of the brain loos en it also refines how clearly the Navigator can be felt. Remember the long journey up the stream? At the very end, you were overwhelmed with terror, when you believed you had simply reached a dead-end.

We can also call this life force, this energy, God. Throughout this book, I will often refer to it as God.

How much longer will you question what lies within? I told you when we began that I had been searching for you for a very long time.

Awakening is a struggle because you must fight against the current. When you were a salmon you set out away from the ocean struggling against the rivers current. It required much more effort than drifting through the ocean. The thoughts, feelings, beliefs and views of the majority of people on this planet create a collective current. It is a collective consciousness. Most of those who have the poten tial within them, who have a Navigator, will never reach awaken ing because of this current.

Awareness bestows strength. Awareness makes it possible to stand against the curr ent and achieve your destiny. People have different purposes in this world. Realize that people are different and no person is of greater value than another. Every part of a greater whole is important. For example, the human body has many different organs all of which serve different functions.

There are different individual parts for different purposes. That is the problem we face now . Everyone is trying to do the same function and we are not contri buting our separate roles. We do not realize people have different purposes. We, you and I, must look at th e purpose of people not from a human perspective but a universal one. All of our experiences in life will be unique. The contribution each of us makes to the world, the lives of those around us, and what we become in life is very different from our overall pur pose and role in relation to the universe as a whole. When we br oaden our perspective and look at it from the very large view of the entire universe the differences between the roles within huma nity becomes very small. To help us understand these differe nces we can use the cells of our own body as a rough analogy. First, le t us divide the people of the world into two hypothetical groups , Red Cells and White Cells. Understand the distinction between these two terms. The world requires both types of people to ma intain its existence. Our own bodies are the same. Both roles are important and essential for this planet’s survival. This planet will not exist w ithout one or the other. Think about what I just said. If at any time during our discussion, you doubt the importance of either role , return to what I just told you. If there is too much of one type and not enough of the other, or vice versa, much as your body wo uld, the planet will slowly die."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL However, one group is much sma ller than the other which makes the balance of their existence more delicate. WHITE CELLS: FOR DEFENSE OF THE WHOLE To understand Red Cells and White Cells look at the relationship that exists on all levels of this world. To understand something very large, look into something that is very small. Things of great magnitude and things of small stature reflect each other. A parallel relationship exists in al l things from macro to micro and micro to macro. Begin to understand the Universe, which is very large, by looking inward, at ourselves, as we are very small. Think of the planet as a single thing. It may be made of many living things but try to imagine the interaction of all life on this planet as it might appear if seen from a great distance. From a distance, the planet looks like a single object. However, if we examine it closely all of the micro life overwhelms our concep t of the Earth as a singular object. Nothing about the planet ha s changed. Our perspective has changed, which dramatically alte rs our concept of the planet. You and I are the same. When you think of your body, you consider it one thing, but if we c ould zoom in, we would see a vast micro universe. Your body is rea lly a collection of micro life and not a single object. The cells in your body are like li ving creatures.

The truth is, there is no single physi cal ‘you’ at all. Our physical selves are a vast grouping of livin g independent orga nisms that are working, more or less, for ‘us’ in a shared relationship. Let us consider the connection be tween our mental self and our physical body. When we are de pressed emotionally, our body’s immune system can weaken in response. When we feel positive and happy, the strength of our imm une system can increase. The consciousness of our being can ha ve an effect on our physical body. Consciousness is a force that affects our body’s inner universe. Our will can affect each cell, in some way. However, not all cells are equally receptive to a person’s will. Some cells are more receptive than others. It is the same on the macro scale of the Earth. The Earth has a similar force that can affect all living things within it.

Two types of cells, red and white blood cells, are primarily found in our blood stream. Red Cells are vital for the mechanics of the body and make up the majority. They are responsible for servicing the body with oxygen and nutrients and repairing wounds. The role of the Red Cell is vital and necessary. But, they are completely unaware of the dangers of viruses and harmful bacteria. White cells understand the dangers of viruses and spend their time seeking them out and opposing thei r destructive nature to the whole of the body. The abilities of a white cell are different from those of a red cell. Although they have some basic similarities, the functions that each type fulfills within the body are dramatically different. White cells can assess a virus before attacking it. They can also summon other white cells to assist with their assault. White cells even seem to possess a kind of memory of past battles with viruses. It is as if they are somehow able to pass on their knowledge and this helps them defend the body against similar viruses. Why is it you never catch the same cold twice? It is as if the knowledge, or essence, of th e white cell passes on so that it may used to aid the whole in the future. Those who possess the Navi gator are the white cells of the planet.

However, because they have a Navigator, they sense, deep in their heart, that there is some purpose, some role,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL which they must fulfill. Perhaps you are beginning to see why it is so important that they fulfill this purpose. In the micro world of the human body, viruses often overcome the body with disease or illness. This will happen in a similar way only on a larger scale if the White Cells of the Earth fail. Let this thought be a small reminder to aggressively seek your awakening. Spiritual people of this plan et serve as White Cells. Those of us who possess a stro ng Navigator often feel an overwhelming sense of duty to serve the ‘Force’. Intuitively we know that there will ultimately be a confrontation between ourselves and something else. Spiritual people have a greater aw areness of the planet’s rhythm, they feel the life of the planet, and they are keen to it. These people are the protectors of the planet, and compose a higher level of sensory for it. Their desire to give and pres erve life with a sense of compassion is very strong. Thes e desires are essential qualities for the vital role of a White Cell. The Force instills these feelings to ensure the greatest chance that they will follow their nature and fulfill their purpose. White Cells protect the planet, and the Red Cells within it, from the invasion of what you could call ‘viruses’. Red Cells are, for the most part, oblivious to the ‘o utside’ from which the invaders come. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL White Cells, through their Navigato r, have a sense of knowing that identifies a virus. Much in th e same way that their Navigator directs them to awakening, thei r higher consciousness can also direct and warn them about viruse s which might harm the whole. These viruses, if not dealt with, can infect the whole of the planet. Planetary viruses can take many form s. They could be the cultural thought of a nation turned to war, widespread plagues, weapons designed to destroy great am ounts of life and many other possibilities. They have similar traits, which make them anti-life, destructive or perhaps aid in the multiplication of a kind of life that eventually leads to death and decay , such as biological warfare. White Cells fight these things so that life will continue and flourish. They are different from doctors or aid workers who also seek to benefit life. White Cells work on multiple levels of reality. They may work in the physical world to protect life but more so, they seek to affect the spiritual. They do this with arcane knowledge that they acquire from White Cells that have come before. When an old White Cell dies, one who has a developed higher consciousness, they pass their experience on to the new White Cells. This helps the new generation to continue the battle and retain the knowledge of others. This process is much like reincarnation.

The role of a White Cell is vital but it can also be very difficult. It is vital because without us the Ea rth and Red Cells are vulnerable.

Because of the need to maintain the balance between the right am ount of Red Cells and White Cells, it is part of the system of things that awakening is difficult. Only the most determined ever make it to any level of awakening. There always exists the danger, however, that not enough White Cells will choose to serve their purpose by awakening, and the planet will be overcome with a ‘virus’ and die. WHITE CELLS ARE NOT CHOSEN, THEY ARE MADE BY CHOICE To really understand what a White Cell is and what it is capable of we will look at how it differs from a Red Cell. The Navigator is the part of the higher consciousne ss that directs a person into a process of awakening. You can think of this higher consciousness as an evolved consciousness of pure energy. It is created and refined over time through cons cious, applied effort. Members of the general human popul ace do not truly have a higher consciousness although everyone has the potential to develop one. This may be difficult to accept but please allow me to continue."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL You need to understand my definition of what a higher consciousness is before you can really consider what I am saying. Humans have a sense of self, but, as science suggests, most people are no more than bio-chemical organic beings. Their level of communication and experiences oc cur only in the brain and are stored in an electrical consciousness. This electrical consciousness is also made of energy but it is temporary. It is only capabl e of moving beyond the physical body after death with reflection and re finement. This separates an electrical body, which everyone has, from a higher consciousness, which a White Cell must develop. The idea that everyone has an elect rical body, but that this body is not the same as a higher consciousness or that White Cells may move on after death while Red Cells may not, may sound shocking. You may think I am suggesting that some people in your life, that you know and love, are without any connection to the Universe or that they will not receive the full experience of life. Before you take such a position, cons ider what I am saying about the role of a White Cell. White Cells are here to serve th e Universe, a greater being, to ensure that the planet continues to grow, evolve and experience. They are here to serve and protect Red Cells and the planet as a whole. Red Cells also serve the Universe, a greater being, by"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL contributing their lives and experiences to it by functioning for the planet.

You cannot measure the quality of life in human terms, whether you live one life or a million, the su m is still only a fraction of a second for the Universe. In the very far future, a ridiculous amount of time in terms of years, we will all return to the Force. To truly understand what I am saying we need to discuss what a higher consciousness is. Although I certainly respect emotions, feelings, intentions, love and pass ion, I feel that these are very complex abilities of the human brai n. These characteristics do not require a higher consciousness to exist within a person. A higher consciousness is born thro ugh a series of revelations. We begin by contemplating our exis tence, the meaning of the self, and eventually have the revelati on that the body is not who we truly are or at least not all that we could be. The next revelation is that perhaps another body exists. This other body is the higher consciousness and just the act of imagining this other body creates the higher consciousness’s existence within you. The act of imagining a higher c onsciousness and reflecting on the nature of a person’s existence is like exercise for a person’s higher consciousness. By reflecting on the inner-dimensions of your"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL body’s energy and higher consciou sness, you make your higher consciousness stronger. This reflection increases the ener gy available for use throughout the body. Energy used for touch, smell, or ta ste takes on a life of its own and collectively becomes alive. It becomes a living c onscious being; separate, but still a part of you. The higher consciousness is a body with many dimensional opportunities but this is the easy part. Once you establish the body of the higher consciousness the ne xt, more difficult, step is to ensure that you satisfy its needs. Just as the physical body requires nutrition and exercise to grow, so the higher consciousness also requires things to grow and mature. To become a true White Cell we must exercise our other body, we must exercise our higher consciousness. A White Cell must seek out aw akening by obtaining knowledge and practicing techniques. You must be dedicated to a path if you expect to awaken. There are se ven different kinds of bodies, the first of which is flesh. This immediate physical body is composed of a person’s bone, blood and all of the matter and organisms that constitute what you would typically think of as your self. The second body is the electrical field within your body. This electrical body makes your eyes blink and your mouth move.

Foods that you eat which contain energy, original ly gathered through photosynthesis from cap tured sunlight, create your electrical body. Your current el ectrical body is the recreation of this basic solar energy. The higher consciousness that we have been talking about is really the third body. As I stated before , most people only have the first two bodies, one that is flesh and one that is more like electricity. With standard religious beliefs, most people do not put forth the effort that is required to create the third body. These beliefs teach that everyone is suddenly born w ith a vessel or consciousness that continues after d eath. It is out of ignorance that they believe they can obtain one wit hout any effort. It is as if they are automatically given one by some kind of Acme energy consciousness, or soul-press, right out of some old cartoon. Ka- boom, here’s your soul, ka- boom, here’s your soul.... everybody gets one! It’s a giant higher cons ciousness factory! No work and no effort involved! This is simply not how the Universe works. An individual must create a higher consciousness. It is not something that everyone is born wit h. There is no way to manifest a higher consciousness without firs t applying effort to the process that is required to create it. This concept directly contradicts what most religions teach."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL I cannot hide the truth for fear of controversy. It is what it is. When a person without a higher co nsciousness dies, their energy returns to the Force. They return to God by merging into the planet’s collective consciousness, lik e a sugar cube thrown into the ocean. For Red Cells, this is neces sary and needed, but it is a bad thing for a White Cell because it means you have not fulfilled your purpose. When this happens to a White Cell it means they have failed to awaken and failed to commit e nough effort to reincarnate. A White Cell must choose to achieve a higher consciousness, or not. Any person is ultimately free to choose to reject what I am saying and to walk away and believe whatever they like. But, as a White Cell, this choice assure s that you will never fu lfill your purpose. The creation of the third body requires effort in the form of active self-reflection. It requires devotion to exercise th e other bodies, to exercise your higher consciousness. The Universe gave us Navigators to ensure that we would have a se nse, a need, to seek it out and find it. It also gives us a choice, it gives ever yone a choice, eith er we want to seek it out or we do not. Be assured, we have free will to choose our path. PLANTING THE SEED OF ETERNITY "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"WAY OF THE WHITE CELL Our third body, much like our brain, ha s a form of intelligence. Its creation comes through work and effort and as you apply yourself and put forth energy, it becomes str onger. It grows stronger by thinking about your body and rea lizing how mechanical your body is. This leaves another presence and that presence makes you more aware of yourself. This awareness grows as your higher consciousness develops through time and effort. This is no different from other living things. A seed planted in the soil needs nurturing to grow. It needs food, water and attention. If given these things, it will slowly push up from the ground, spread its leaves and blossom. Should your eternal energy being, your higher consciousness, be any different? Anything living that grows has stag es of development. The higher consciousness is no different. This process of develo pment is reflected, to varying degrees, in White Cells and Red Cells. Do not think you can simply lump people into two large cate gories. I do so for the sake of simplicity but it is not how the world trul y is. There are degrees. Red Cells, who surround themselves with very spiritual people, can create a higher consciousness, allowing them to reincarnate. You also have very new White Cells and very old ones. I consider many spiritual people I have met in my journeys to be White Cells. They are truly devoted to a ssisting the world and mankind.

Usually they are young and lack the ability to take c ontrol of the direction of their life.

At any stage in your life, when you feel the pull of the Navigator, it is only through an act of will that you set yourself in motion. Many people become fickle, thinki ng that if something goes wrong or does not seem right that it must be a ‘sign’ from the Universe that this is not right.

The world is alive. Our planet, a shining solitary globe floating in inky black space is a living organi sm. Do not be fooled by the simplicity of this. Earth, this organism that we are a part of, is a being that is completely alien to us. Try not to allow yourself to simply gaze over each sentence. I did not just say the planet is alive, meaning that it bears life and life form s populate it. That is obviously true. I mean that the Ea rth is a living organism, a being, floating in space. It is an am azing realization, to fully understand the nature of this being and wh at our connection to it is! Everything is connected.

THE REFLECTION CONNECTION To better illustrate this idea, imagine you are on a tropical island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean completely isolated from any other land. This is not a small isla nd it is huge! It is gigantic! Lush jungle, with towering green trees wrapped in twisting, flowering vines that cover the island . All kinds of foliage fills this jungle, it teems with lif e. Butterflies float and flutter through the air as colorful birds swoop among the trees. Bending down you see red and bl ack ants crawling on the ground and through the foliage. Glan cing up towards the treetops, you notice delicate spider webs hanging in the trees sparkling in the sun. Whenever you examine someth ing closely, there is another form of life existing there, completely unaware of you or the massive island you are on. Curious to see more of the island you find a tree th at towers above all of the others and begin to climb it. You climb until you are high in the air above the canopy of trees. Far below you see a white sandy beach that falls down to the ocean. In the other direction, you can see tall mountain peaks jutting out of the sprawling jungle.

You can see everything from distant mountain peaks barely visible on the horizon to all the micro life"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE moving through the jungle below. You can see everything on a larger and smaller scale. Suddenly you are aware of the micro- verse moving into the macro-verse. You notice a boat floating in the water down on the shore and decide to take a boat ride. You go down to the shore, wade into the clear water, and launch the boat. You crank up the motor and the boat zooms out to sea as you sit back and drink a Piña Colada and look at the island. Smiling you can feel the warm sun light shining down and take it all in. Moving further and further out to sea the island blurs and the details of its features merge. The boat begins moving faster. Speeding along you look back and the island becomes smaller and smaller against an expanding horizon. Now it looks like one large object in the distance, a big stone structure. It looks like one, single thing. If you suddenly zoomed back into th e forest on the island, life in hundreds of forms would surround you, and you could take in all of the details. Zooming back out again, all of the small details merge into a single large structure. The island is one single object, from a certain perspective, but millions of separate things make it up. The Earth is also one single object, from a certain perspective in outer space, but billions of separate individual things make it up. All things in the universe reflect this model."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE Now try to examine the same con cept in another way. Think about if you were to take a syringe and in sert the needle into your arm to draw out blood. First, you insert the needle th en you pull the syringe and fill the chamber with a tiny amount of blood. If a blood cell was intelligent enough to realize what was happening it could float up to the glass of the syringe and say, ‘Where are all the other blood cells?! Where’s Ha rry the white cell?! Where’s Julie the red cell?! Where is ev erybody?!’ Then it would take one look at you and wonder, ‘What the he ll is this one big giant thing with flapping tentacles coming from its body?’ Pushing the syringe the blood cell shoots back into the bloodstream, it goes back into your inner-verse, and it sees all of its friends again. Observing your body, even if these cells were intelligent they would have no way to relate to wh at you are. The concept that you are a conscious, active, aware being with a body and that they are a part of your body is not conceiva ble to them. How could they possibly relate, their whole world is about other blood cells? Their world consists of moving oxyge n and nutrients around your blood stream. Your body and everyt hing about you would appear completely alien to them. When I say the Earth is a living being I mean that it is also conscious. It is aware. It is a being far different than we are and its thoughts so alien to our own way of thinking it is difficult to even consider them thoughts. Yet, it is so. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE MOVING BEYOND THE HUMAN PERSPECTIVE The planet, Earth, and the universe do not have arms or legs, but we should consider them living thi ngs. Why does the planet or the universe need to have arms and legs to be a singular living being? Why does something have to be micro to be living, when it could be absolutely larger than we ar e? Why do we only recognize as living beings those things that are smaller than, or about the same size as, we are? Beings can be microscopic, or absolutely larger than us. Only our concept of what a conscious being is limits our understanding. The planet and the universe are liv ing organisms. They are living beings. When you take a break from read ing this book go walk outside and think about our micro perspective. Walk around and be aware of every level that life operates on. Reflect on how limited human perspectives are. Think about the cells moving inside your body. See the lanes of cars moving down the freeways, carrying cargo to build new structures. Think about seeing those cars from the air, up in a helicopter or an airpla ne. Tiny little blobs moving down long narrow structured streets like veins. See the people inside those vehicles they transmit ideas and information. They carry fuel, and food, which are the nutrients of society. The truth of this is all around you! Let this truth become you. It will set you free. Now we come to the good news and bad news. Presumably, you"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE want to hear the bad news first. The bad news is; the dilemma our imaginary blood cell faced, when trying to comprehend what we are, is similar to the dilemma that we face, when trying to understand how the Earth or the universe can be alive. The struggle is not to simply acknowledg e that there is life within them, which makes them living things, that is easy to accept. The struggle is in trying to comprehend that they are conscious living things and how such a conscious being would think and experience. It is difficult for us to comprehend how things of such magnitude can be conscious. For the sake of simplicity let us na rrow our scope to just the Earth. The Earth is a system so vast and beyond our conception that we simply cannot comprehend it in the same way that we normally comprehend things. Our minds struggle to envision a being that so exceeds our human scale. The good news is that be cause the laws of natu re repeat themselves at all levels we can use our micro to macro examples to help us at least begin to grasp the aspects th at are most relevant to our own lives. In truth, it is possible to tap into the consciousness of the Earth. To understand what this means, we now have to consider what consciousness is. As you read this text, you are conscious. You are having a mental experience while reading these word s and you are aware. What are you aware of? You are certainly aware of the words printed on this page. Perhaps you are aw are of secondary thoughts going"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE through your mind. Maybe you fe el happy or perhaps you are hungry, and if so, you would be aw are of that as well. Are you aware of the sound of birds or traffic or other sounds? If so, then you are aware of the e nvironment around you. I hope that all the other things you are awar e of are in the background now because you should be focused on reading this! Now consider who or what it is that is aware. Where, exactly, is the ‘you’ that is aware? Can you poi nt to the exact place? Is it in, on, or outside of your body that c ontains this awareness that you feel? It can be tricky to talk about consciousne ss. To this day, it continues to boggle the minds of mo st philosophers and scientists. Consciousness is more than ju st the body, the design and purpose of which is to provide us with e xperience. Imagine driving a car. Our eyes see the inside of the car, the road ahead of us, other cars around us, the sky, clouds, and anything else that enters our field of vision. Our ears hear the engi ne of our car, the music playing through the stereo, and words from the person in the passenger seat. Our hands feel the warmth of the sun and the wind as it blows through the car. Our whole body feels the aff ect of inertia on us when we make a turn. The amount of data our body processes is really quite phenomenal. As all of this data is coming in through our sensory organs, our body is doing some amazing things with it. In the end, how ever, the body converts all of this information into electrical energy. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE The reason our body converts sensory da ta into electricity is that, by nature we are an energy being. The body makes experiences possible and there are many levels to them. For example, while we are driving a car we are holding the steering wheel. At the lowest leve l, the nerves that run through our fingers are individually registering the fact that there is something going on. Through a complex process of electro-chemical interactions, they transmit what th ey are each experiencing. The individual experiences of millions of these cells combine to form a series of nerve impulses that travel from our fingers to our arm, to our spine, and ultimately to our brain. Even one of these impulses, which contains only the smallest fr agment of what will become our experience of holding the steering wh eel, is in turn experienced by all of our nerves along the route fr om our fingers to our brain. Our brain receives and processes these impulses. Cells in our brain receive arriving impulses and deci de how to best deal with incoming information. After the brain collects sufficient information, we might actually experience a conscious thought like, “Hey, the steering wheel is hot!” To be perfectly clear, a multitude of individual cells in our bodies receive even the subtlest of experiences. It is because of the experiences of individual micro-life in our bodies that we are able to have experiences. This means your consciousness, who you believe yo u are right now, is really the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE result of all the collected experien ces of the micro-life that makes up your body. They are sharing thei r experiences with you and that has formed your consciousness. You are, in a sense, the collect ive consciousness of millions of micro-organisms and cells. Here the question must be asked: Why does it have to stop there? Is it possible that individual human experiences roll up to higher a nd higher levels to provide experiences for something greater than ourselves? It is possible and it is so. ONE CONSCIOUSNESS, MANY EXPERIENCES Astronauts floating in space agree that when looking down at the planet they can no longer relate to their houses, swimming pools, or to their friends and family. The Earth looks like one living thing, one living being, and the ancien t word for it is Gaia. Gaia is the name for the being of the Eart h. Gaia is a conscious living being and mankind is the nervous system of that being. Lives are the experiences of Gaia. Thought s and emotions are accumulated and form a collective being; a collective consciousness. The total collective thoughts of ev ery conscious thing on this planet form the consciousness of the planet. This is the collective consciousness. Multitudes of frequencies, each un ique to a species, create this"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE consciousness. The collective cons ciousness of human beings is on a different wavelength than say, dogs or monkeys or other organisms. They are like different radio stations. One species is 106.7 while another is 98.5. Every frequency is exclusive to a specific species. Every individua l within a species also has a specific, unique frequency. No two beings on this planet share an identical frequency. Using the above example, if the collective consciousness of all the monkeys on the planet was 106.7 th en we could also say each monkey would have a slight vari ation of that frequency. One monkey might be 106.72 and another 106.78. While I do not intend for the example frequencies to be precise, it is important to note that every single consci ousness vibrates at a unique frequency, never to be duplicated. There are scientists who are moving forward and making progress in understanding and proving this c oncept. They might not be there yet, but their research, and the work of others like them, will someday lead to the discovery of a collective consciousness. In the future, it will just be a commonl y known fact. ‘Oh, of course the planet has a collective consciousness’, any elementary school student will be able to tell you. Biologist Rupert Sheldrake wr ites about the existence and explanation of a collective consci ousness in many of his works. He asserts that collective consciousness only makes sense if there"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE is also such a thing as collective memory: the storage of information as the species grows and evolves. Sheldrake, who is primarily a biol ogist, talks about something that most people may have never cons idered as anything other than elementary. That is; how does a seed grow into a full grown plant? How do embryos develop from fert ilized eggs? At first these sound like very basic, very simple questions. With our vast and magnificent understanding of the univ erse, surely this is something we can easily explain. But biol ogists disagree about how we can explain this seemingly simple phenomenon. Imagine a little acorn planted in the ground. The form and shape of that little acorn, hidden in the ear th, is vastly different from the giant tree it will become, with branches sticking out in every direction, leaves and bark, roots reaching far into the earth. We could say that the acorn contains some kind of genetic program that tells it how to grow and how to form. But, where is this program? If we said this genetic program was within the DNA science, and biologists such as R upert Sheldrake, tell us we would be wrong. DNA codes for protei ns and the micro components which make up proteins. Coding the structure of single, solitary parts that make up organisms, such as proteins, is very different than coding the shape and structure of an entire organism. Sheldrake gives an excellent example when he considers the make-"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE up of the human body. Look at one of your arms. Twist your arm, move your fingers around and examine everything your arm can do. Now look at one of your legs . Bend your leg, move it around and examine everything your leg can do. Both look different, do different things and are in diffe rent places on your body. Yet the building blocks which create your ar ms and legs are the same. On a cellular level, there is no diffe rence, so how did they become different? Why do they appear different and serve different functions? How did that come to be? Sheldrake proposes a theory he ca lls Morphic Resonance. This theory basically states that ther e is a field of energy surrounding and permeating an organism whic h contains, among other things, the form of the organism. He wr ites that each species has its own field, that there are fields within fields, and that these fields have built-in memory, based upon what has happened in the past derived from previous organisms or forms of a similar kind. In other words, each organism on the planet shares fields of similar energy or we could say, a specific frequency just like we discussed earlier. We can see where science is starting to catch up. In his book, A New Science of Life, Sheldrake describes one such incident that he suggests proves th is idea of Morphic Resonance, or as I prefer, collective consciousness. “The best documented of these is the behavior of bluetits, a rather small bird with a blue head, th at is common throughout Britain. Fresh milk is still delivered to the door each morning in Britain. Until about the 1950s, the caps on the milk bottles were made of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE cardboard. In 1921 in Southampto n, a strange phenomenon was observed. When people came out in the morning to get their milk bottles, they found littl e shreds of cardboard all around the bottom of the bottle, and the cream from the top of the bottle had disappeared. Close observation reve aled that this was being done by bluetits, who sat on top of th e bottle, pulled off the cardboard with their beaks, and then drank the cream. Several tragic cases were found in which bluetits were discovered drowned head first in the milk! This incident caused considerable interest; then the event turned up somewhere else in Britain, about 50 miles away, and then somewhere about 100 miles away. Whenever the bluetit phenomenon turned up, it started spreading locally, presumably by imitation. However, bluetits are very home-loving creatures, and they don't normally travel more than four or five miles. Therefore, the dissemination of the behavior over large distances could only be accounted for in terms of an i ndependent discovery of the habit. The bluetit habit was mapped throughout Britain until 1947, by which time it had become more or less universal. The people who did the study came to the conclu sion that it must have been \"invented\" independently at least 50 times. Moreover, the rate of spread of the habit accelerated as time went on. In other parts of Europe where milk bottles are delivered to doorsteps, such as Scandinavia and Holland, the habit also cropped up during the 1930s and spread in a similar mann er. Here is an example of a pattern of behavior which was spread in a way which seemed to"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE speed up with time, and which might provide an example of morphic resonance. But there is still stronger eviden ce for morphic resonance. Because of the German occupation of Ho lland, milk delivery ceased during 1939-40. Milk deliveries did not resume until 1948. Since bluetits usually live only two to three years, there probably were no bluetits alive in 1948 who had been alive when milk was last delivered. Yet when milk deliveries resu med in 1948, the opening of milk bottles by bluetits sprang up rapidl y in quite separate places in Holland and spread extremely rapidl y until, within a year or two, it was once again universal. The behavior spread much more rapidly and cropped up independently much more frequently the second time round than the first time. This example demonstrates the evolutionary spread of a new ha bit which is probably not genetic but rather depends on a kind of co llective memory due to morphic resonance.” I could continue with many other examples, but by now, you should begin to understand the impor tance of this idea. This concept is not something you should just let idly pass by as only an, ‘interesting idea.’ Think about it. Consider that you are not simply an individual, but part of a greater system, a collective being. The collective consciousness affects each of us and those who come after us whether we want it to or not. Your actions and"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE thoughts connect to the whole just as the whole connects to you. What are you contributing to this collective? How will your life affect the thoughts of all of us? Do not believe you are insignificant. Each of your actions and thou ghts pass to the collective consciousness. Each species on this planet has a collective consciousness within its own species, whales, dolphins, lions, beavers, and even human beings in a very complex way. The energy consciousness of each species is constantly moving ar ound the globe and makes up the consciousness, collectivel y, of the planet. It is the consciousness of Gaia. The same way we have billions of living microscopic creatures telling us what is going on so does every living thing do the same for Gaia. We have cells and nerv es, and even a nerve is made out of millions of living molecules. Cells can contract and expand and react to different impulses allowing electrons to have a form of data created by their consciousness es collectively building as other nerves add to that information until it gets to one central processing point, you. We serve the same function for the planet. THAT WHICH CONNECTS, TI ES AND BINDS US ALL TOGETHER We have an energy field that ra diates from our body. We also"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE WORLD IS ALIVE know that plants have it and we know that all objects radiate energy as well. What we have also found, which is amazing, is that there is an energy field that covers the planet even over the deserts and the deepest parts of the ocean. This energy field is a soul or a sense of being, whatever you want to call it. One being, one consciousness, and one soul but made of many individual living things. The Universe is no different, on ly the size and perspective changes. Now imagine you are back on the giant island, except this time you are boarding a spaceship.

This is the edge of the entire universe. You push the spaceships’ turbo thrusters and shoot out beyond the edge of the universe into pure in finity, pure nothing. You look around and there are no planets, no stars, no nothing, it is a void of nothingness. You sit in the back of the spaceship and look through the window back at the universe, you see sparkles everywhere, billions of sparkles; t hose are stars, the suns .

Everything inside of it is matter, as we are matter. God’s soul, prana, the Force, is the energy that intertwines it all. It is what interconnects it, and permeates all things.

This expanding glob has borders and matter inside of it, much like our body. Similarly, our body exists in and moves around in a kind of nothingness. Everything that we consider ourselves to be is contained within the boundary of our expanding body, which has been growing since infancy and began smaller than a microbe within a womb. We have expanded. Just as we expand, so the universe is expanding. All things in the universe are reflections of each other from the very small to the unimaginably enormous. Man exists in the image of God but in a much different way than we ever could expect.

If a"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD question is difficult to answer, does this mean we should not ask it? If a question has yet to be answered does this mean that we should accept that there is no answer? We should not accept this kind of thought. Yet often we do. Many who came before us said ther e were no real answers to the ultimate question because they did not know them. While scientists build devices that allow them to see far beyond what the naked eye allows, we create intern al walls that prevent our minds from doing the same. We do not question what lies within, and we do not encourage our consciousness to develop and evol ve. Others have constructed walls that confine our conscious ness and separate us from the universe and we have accepted them. Yet, I know that the universe gave me a brain with an intellect and free will so that I could ask questions and discover answers. BREAKING DOWN THE WALLS WITHIN Do you want to know how God works and thinks? How would that alter the way you view ever ything in life? Maybe you doubt such a thing as God, even exists. Perhaps in doubting you are questioning, and in the end, you still hope to find an answer. You just cannot yet conceive of or understand what that answer might be. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD If I could know how God works and thinks, it would be an amazing feat don’t you think? Ho w can I dare to suggest that, without the use of highly technica l equipment, I can explain the creation of God? Well, to begin with, I did not accept that I could not know such a thing. To answer the ultimate question we first need to break everything down in a way that it is possible to understand. The difficulty is this: the moment I try to reduce the, ‘nature of everything’ into a simple concise form it loses much of its meaning. Words cannot accurately express some things. Due to the structural way our brains work it is difficult to comprehend those things not limited by the physical or structural laws of matter; things that are dimensional or energetic in nature. Infinity is one such concept. Time without limit, or existence wi thout time, is a notion that is almost inconceivable to our way of thinking. We understand what the word means and we can get an idea of the concept but beyond that we cannot grasp it. The difficu lty is that time is so ingrained in measuring every aspect of our lives that most people cannot conceive existing outside of it. This is why the answer to the question that seems unanswerable may leave you with mixed feelings. Part of you may be amazed at what I am about to present, but at the same time, you may lack total satisfaction because you sense"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD another part eludes you. Th e answer may seem somehow incomplete. You do not have to a ccept this feeling of missing the total picture. However, you do need to accept that there are limitations to what the huma n brain can conceive. Understanding has levels. To be aware of and really get what I am about to tell you, on different levels, will take tim e and reflection. Some knowledge also requires more of an energy or dimensional consciousness to understand and experience what it is. The creation of God is that kind of knowledge. To understand it, I mean really know it, to the point that you experience it, requir es consciousness. I know that by reading this, and beginning to grasp it, you will have enough of the picture that it will change you. There is no turning back now. By reading on you will be fully committed. Are you ready? BEFORE THE BIG BANG In the beginning, there was abso lute nothingness, pure black, pure infinite space. There was no dust or planets, no stars or gaseous forms, no light at all, not even particles or atoms. There was nothing. Absolute, infinite nothin gness stretched forever. The void was complete. No matter existed at all. Because there was nothing, there was one other ‘thing’ and that was an opposing force, there has to be. That othe r thing was a vacuum, which is the vacuum of space."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD Imagine the vacuum of space to be, quite literally, a kind of pressure. It has an intense and pow erful pull. For example, if you take the hose from a vacuum clean er and then press it against the palm of your hand you can feel its suction pulling on you. There is a draw or some kind of a pull, and that pull is a pressure. Of course, in this example a mach ine is generating suction, which is quite different from what we are talking about. However, the feeling of how it pulls on you shoul d give you an idea to work with. In the beginning, because there was nothing, it would be like sucking all the air out of a Ziploc bag. It crumples and begins to fold in on itself. Of course, this image is very limited because you picture a small plastic Ziploc bag that has edges, which does not completely work for what we are trying to visualize so you have to take that example and move way beyond that. It may be easier to picture blowin g a Ziploc bag full of air first, which would be like an expanding universe with energy moving into it. Now contrast that imag e by, once again, picturing all of the air being pulled out. The bag woul d flatten and begin to crumple, collapse inward, and finally implode. You see, because the void is so big and so heavy it creates a vacu um out of itself, it is pulling on itself. That is the ha rdest part to explain to someone. If you can get past that and envision an infinite space with enormous pressure, you have an idea of the beginning."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD Let us take another quick example. If you were to teleport, which means to instantaneously disappear and then reappear, in the middle of space at the beginning of time, or the beginning of anything, the second you appeared y ou would have been torn into a billion pieces infinitely smaller than molecules. It would have sucked you apart. It would have exploded you beyond even nano-particles. Do you understand? It is because the pressu re was so intense. You need to imagine that kind of force and power. It is incredible to conceive. The nothing and the vacuum acted against each other and created enormous tension. These two elements resembled opposing forces pressing against one another, bu t no matter existed, so the only evidence of this tension was th e creation of an energy. This tension-force was an energy, of sort s, and was the only property of infinity. It was not a thing. It was not matter and had no kind of physical form. It permeated the infinite void. As you visualize this tension, you could say it was a kind of friction but more intense and even beyond friction, imagine the friction between these two infinite forces creating an equally"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD infinite source of energy by the ve ry act of tension between them! It was all of this ‘pulling’ that created a kind of energy, which we will just call free electrons only because it needs a name. This tension, this intense friction, created billions of free electrons forever and ever and ever! Try to imagine oceans of entire universes making this path, like red smoke, thicker than water, and you will get an idea of it. Of cour se, because you or I cannot see it with our eyes, because it is so fine, absolutely beyond even microscopic, beyond molecular, it is almost impossible for us to conceive how much of it there wa s! It was so intensely FULL because that was all that existed! For infinity, all that existed was this energy created by the pull of the universe. We have been talking about the beginning of things, but this is misleading because without matte r time cannot exist. The universe, as we are imagining it now, existed before matter so there would be no time. The begi nning is before God existed in this dimension, before anything existed. Although it may sound strange, what eventually happened in this infinite nothing was simply ‘something’. Something happened because somethi ng must always happen. It is a numbers game. Consider another numbers game, the lottery. If you played the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD lottery, do you think you would win this week? You would probably say no. What if you played once a week for the rest of your life, do you think you could win before you died? Again, you would answer probably not. Thes e questions are easy to answer because the odds of winning the lottery are so overwhelmingly against any partic ular individual. Now imagine that you are an immortal who will live forever, and you have a desire to play the lottery every day of your never- ending existence. You have nothing el se to do with eternity, right? Now can you expect to win? Absolutely, you would have to. Eventually you would win because even if the odds were one in eighteen million you could play for eighteen million days. One of those days during your eternal li fe, you would hit the jackpot. The infinite void is much the same. In the infinite void before the uni verse, eventually, something is going to happen. The key to unde rstanding that ‘something’ must happen is to understand that the absence of time makes ‘something’ happening not a pr obability, but an undeniable certainty. This is providing all the proper circumstances are in place and in this partic ular case, they were. THE SPARK OF CREATION To understand the ‘something’ that happened; imagine that we have a super-powerful microscope. With this instrument, we can"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD closely examine what things looke d like before anything happened. If we were to zoom in and exam ine all of those free electrons I spoke of earlier we could see what w ould look like little flat square flakes that dimly glow red. If you have ever eaten ice cream, us ually mint, with little chocolate chip flakes that is what these flakes resemble. Remember, they were not actually made of anything yet. They were like particles of energy, not matter. They were everywhere, billions and billions of them forever. They would vibrate gently back and forth in a uniform direction and move so slow ly, that even if we could see them, we could not measure their movement. Eventually what happened in this moment of ‘something’ is a single shimmering red flake collid ed with another and created something like the shape of the lett er ‘T’. They connect with one being the top of the ‘T’ and the other forming the center. After colliding with each other th ese two, now entwined, flakes stopped shimmering and began to ro tate in the opposite direction from all the other flakes. This generated a different kind of electrical current and, once activate d, it began to grow. It begins with just the two flakes but as it slowly vibrated ag ainst everything else, it grew, the way a tiny snowba ll will grow when rolling down a steep hill. It gathered and accu mulated other flakes and began to create an electrical pulse. This reaction creates a different kind of electron, a different kind of pu lse of energy that resembles electricity. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD This electricity, unhindered by any other force acting on it, became a living thing. As electricity, as energy, nothing could affect it, not the tension or friction, nothing. The void was still there which meant the pull of the universe was still creating tension, which created the red flake energy. This new growing el ectrical pulse consumed, in a sense, the red flake energy, which stretched throughout the void forever. It had no mind, no consciousness, or any purpose at that point but it wa s suddenly growing and alive. Like something in a womb, it was infinitely small, but contained a spark of creation, a spark that eventually became you and became all other forms of matter as it grew to become absolutely enormous in comparison to its beginning. Let us use our Ziploc bag again to help us imagine this in a structured way. While not entire ly accurate, it help s our brain be able to grab hold of the concept and work with it. Imagine taking an empty Ziploc bag and rubbing the two sides together. Do you know what happens when you do this? You create static electricity. One side of the bag represents the nothingness of the void. The other side is the vacuum. When we rub the two sides togeth er, there is friction, which is a kind of energy and represents ou r red flakes. Now at some moment, this friction begins to cr eate static electricity, a kind of energy. Like our new energy even the static of the Zi ploc is totally separate from the bag, does not fill it, does not influence it, yet is all around it and generated by th e friction created by those two initial elements."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD While this energy was infinitely smaller than matter, its growth was still measurable, which means a form of time existed. Although this form of time was so different from how we understand it now, for the sake of creating a timeline we can understand, we will make use of the word. Over vast amounts of time, this mass became more complex and used as fuel these red shimmering flakes of energy. It continued to attach, multiply, and expand itself, becoming increasingly complicated as its energy rose in vibration, until it became a form of living energy. It grew more complex, drawing together atom- like structures, and creating different energy forms. These structures spiraled around othe r electron-like structures, their movements becoming more complex, until they created the very first foundation, or building blocks, of what would become matter. At first, these were very faint le vels of matter-like material. They were more energy than physical material, and they had very complex forms but were still contained in this enormous thing, this cloud or gaseous organism of energy. From the nothing, something was bo rn, it grew, a nd eventually it became intelligent.

I"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD will try to explain it in a way that ex presses the overall idea of it. Numbers can explain the universe. They are the galactic code of the whole universe. Numbers are a completely separate language. This galactic code is composed of mathemati cal patterns that all things follow in the universe. Now putting that aside for a moment we can understand the patterns of things in terms of their rhythm, which can be translated into numbers. In other words, everything that has a rhythm has a number. The rhythm creates a pattern, which also has a number. The pattern is like a beat. Just as we can count out a beat, we can assign numbers to patterns. We can understand th e rhythms of things by looking at the numeric equivalent of those rhyt hms. That is about as simple as I can make it, without losing the essence of what it is. It might be easier if you imagine an electron going from point A to point B. It is constantly going in a motion, and it makes a fast beat or rhythm. It goes back and forth, point A to point B, thump and thump, in a rhythm. Let us say you could count it out to 13 beats a second, not to be precise because th e timing is not as important as the number. The rhythm, 13 beats a second bouncing back and forth between point A and point B, creates a number due to its pattern. Every pattern has a numbe r. Every pattern is a pattern because it is repetitious, and if it is repetitious, that means it is calculable. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD Numbers and patterns create the galactic code. They are the language of the universe. If everything has a pattern and if we could know all the variables acting on an object then, according to Chaos Theory, it would be possible to predict any pattern. Ev en the splashes of running water can be broken down into repetitious patterns. Because water keeps its pattern we can calculate how it is going to hit or fall. We could bounce a ball and while there may be a million variables acting on it, if we could know all of those variables, then the ball would follow the same pattern and become completely predictable. That is a pretty startling and am azing thing if you think about it. The universe, or this energy, God if you will, started to become aware of itself, its pattern. Coll ectively something came together. You see everything in the univers e not only works in individual patterns but also as a collective pattern. Everything has a process that it contributes to, like a giant collective database. All of these little electrons, all these little things, had to accumulate to some pattern. They naturally sought out a purpose, it is evolution. It is natural within the laws of physics to create refined patterns, which in turn creates intelligence. Let us look at this a different way and assume that complete chaos did exist. If it did exist, there would be no patterns. Everything would just be an infinite number of ever changing and truly unpredictable variables. If there were no patterns, there could be"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD no variations of those patterns, a nd that means there would be no growth. Evolution requir es patterns to refine and create variations from existing, stable ones. Be cause there was repetition and patterns, there could arise variatio ns of those patterns. It could grow, evolve, and refine itself. Ho wever, that requires a consistent system from which to spring. This energy, God, began to create variations of its pattern, which lead to the formation of its intelligence. Over an unimaginably long period, God became intelligent as energy, as a giant form of prana. This energy was not uniform, is not uniform, and there are levels to it, many levels! We notate degrees of energy as levels of dimensions, which are completely separate realities. For example, we refer to different levels of energy as the 3rd dimension or the 4th dimension. However, there are thousands of dimensions not just four or five. Imagine thousands of dimensions! GOD EVOLVING THROUGH DIMENSIONS Dimensions are the result of God creating variations of its own pattern. As it creates variations of its own pattern, it moves its energy into other spaces creating new dimensi ons.

These other dimensions are things we can become aware of and experience using our energy bodies. We have to be able to learn to shift our consciousness to their frequency. Here is an easy way to understand how dimensions work. Imagine you are standing by a highway. You are not doing anything, except looking at the road directly in front of you. At this moment, you are at the lowest frequency of energy. Now while you are staring straight ahead with your sight fixed, a car drives past at 20 M.P.H. Are you going to be able to see very much of what was going on in th e car? No. You have no idea what the driver looks like or wh at anyone in the car is doing. While you are staring straight at the middle of the road, zoom, the car passes in a blur. Then another car zips by even faster at 50 M.P.H., and you would be lucky to even know what the interior color of the car was. Then as you are still standing on the side of the road at the lowest frequenc y of energy another car goes by at 75 M.P.H and you can barely make out details about th e car itself! Then one more car swooshes by ev en faster at 100 M.P.H., which from your perspective would be a blur. Each car passes at different speeds but each would be completely outside of your ability to clearly distinguish what may be occurring inside of each car. Now imagine you jump into a car, accelerate to 50 M.P.H., and catch up to the car that passed you doing 20 M.P.H. You are no longer at the lowest frequency of energy. You are moving at a"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD much faster rate than you were before but can you see inside of that car now? No, you pass it to o quickly because now you are moving at a faster speed. Can you see inside the car that is going 75 M.P.H? No, it is still traveling too fast for you to stay with it. This is how dimensions work. Dimensions are energy, vibration, or tonal. Now if your car is doing 50 M.P.H and another car merges onto the highway, pulls up next to you and it is doing 50 M. P.H, could you look over and see inside? Sure, you could. You c ould look over and see the driver fixing their hair, you could watc h the passenger smacking their gum and throwing things at people in the backseat and everything going on inside the car. You are tr aveling at the same frequency. Everything around you right now, wh at you are sitting on, the book in your hand, you can experience b ecause it is moving at the same rate or frequency as you. It is all the same dimension. Different dimensions exist within the energy being, God, as higher and lower frequencies. As it created different things like molecules, electrons, different im pulses, they all condensed into different forms of energy, at differe nt speeds or rhythms of energy. Eventually it got down to a current that electrons would instantly solidify to become gases, much like water forming from condensation. Like raindrops th at are so small but as they accumulate, they become heavy, they become water. Think of it as"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD energy. The energy came to a point wh ere it started to solidify and it became different kinds of gases, which were incoherent with one another. Imagine an old wall clock, the kind with hands that move around in a circle. This clock will help illustrate a timeline in the creation of our universe. In the beginning both hands pointed straight up to 12, that is when God emerged in this dimension as a form of complex energy. Once the clock ticks to the next mi nute that is when this giant gas cloud of energy ignited triggering an unbelievable explosion. Now imagine this explosion, beyond the size of 2,000 suns simultaneously going super nova. That is the Big Bang. The explosion is beyond enormous filling galaxies beyond galaxies of space with its energy. After this explosion, we could sa y time has passed and the hand of the clock now ticks to five after. At this time, this energy, which has flooded the universe, changed from a super complex pure form of energy into a form of denser, less complex energy. After the initial explosion, th e high frequency energy began cooling and lowering in vibrati on. This denser energy then continued to slow and morphed and changed into progressively more dense forms of matter. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD With each tick of the clock down fr om the twelve towards the six, or halfway through the hour, the energy that filled the universe morphed and became a denser energy as everything slowed down. This is only the progression of energy in our newly formed dimension, which is the universe we exist in now. When the Big Bang happened energy from a higher dimension was sucked down into this one. However, those higher variations of energy are still there and continue to exist with in their appropriate dimension. When a new dimension is created energy from one dimension pushes into a new space, changing the pattern of th at energy and creating another dimension. The highest dimension is the frequency of God. THE BIRTH OF THE UNIVERSE This brings us back to the be ginning of the universe when the energy that filled the universe ig nited. However large you might be able to conceive an explosio n it would probabl y be like saying that a flea sneezing was powerful and then compare that to 30 volcanoes erupting at the same time. When it got to that point, between the energy and the molecule-like structures condensing the way they did, it created a super fusion explosion. As soon as this energy was released it was sucked out from the higher dimensions and instantly glued together certain"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE CREATION OF GOD ones that were attracted like magne ts to specific other ones and quickly solidified creating matter. Matter solidified very quickly and that is when the explosion separated it all into a million infinitive directions. This first explosion would beco me the basis for the eventual formation of all matter in this universe as it scattered in all directions. This would eventually evolve, over vast spans of time, into what we now know as planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, and everything in the universe. That was the creation of God, in this dimension. That was the creation of matter and the universe as we experience it. I say it was the creation of G od in this dimension because, as I have said, God exists in multiple dimensions. It is a multi- dimensional being. This reality, our universe, is just one dimension. It is to say your finger is just a part of your whole body. This dimension is just a part, a finger, of God. If you coul d teleport to a ny location in the universe, no matter how far, you woul d still be in this dimension. Distance has no bearing on dimension because, no matter the distance, any location would sti ll have the same frequency of energy.

This true self, our true consciousness, the part of us that is timeless, eternal and stores the collective memories of all our past lives is our hyper-dimensional consciousness. Let us take a moment and closely look at what this term means. ‘Dimensional’ means that this consciousness operates on a different frequency than our imme diate waking consciousness. We must go through the process of rais ing our tonal and frequency to connect to it. ‘Hyper’ implies th at we are not talking about a minor shift in dimensional frequency; it is super fast, a very high frequency of energy, which is very cl ose to the tonal of the Force. ‘Consciousness’ says that it has an awareness all its own. That means it exists at a super high-vibration, dimensional place. The tonal of the Force, the very source of everything, exists at the highest dimensional frequency.

Even the idea of everyt hing involved in creat ing this simple book would be far beyond this tiny little in sect’s ability to conceive! It is no different for us to attempt to conceive the mind of God. It is a difficult thing for us to do. Afte r all, we have only just begun to explore our solar system. Huma ns have only reached the moon, which is hardly a step compared to the size of the universe. The scale of the being that we are trying to consider renders it inconceivable to us. Forget the ant trying to conceive a human, think about it trying to visualize a planet or even a solar system. This barely approaches the scale of us trying to understa nd the mind of the Universe and the workings of God. Even descri bing the physical nature of such a being is extremely difficult. Describing the thoughts of that being borders on impossible. To illustrate the scale of this creature, imagine that you are standing on a beach. Now bend down and pick up a single grain of sand, that single grain will represen t our solar system. The entire solar system is inside of that single grain of sand!

Now, we can discuss the truth of how God thinks but it is a bit tricky. THE MIND OF GOD Our brains tell our hearts to pump and keep our livers, kidneys and other organs functioning by se nding out signals or sensory impulses. Most of us are complete ly unaware of our bodies as they function on this level. Think about it, when was the last time you had to sit there and think, ‘Okay heart keep beating and stomach don’t stop digesting that snack I just ate and oops, I haven’t told my liver to function in 20 minutes, that’s going to hurt.’ We do not have to do that because our brain automatically tells our body how to function through something like low-radiati on or electrical impulses. The only time we might become awar e of how our body is functioning is when we have a problem, like a stomachache. We can become aware of our body and master all kinds of functions. There are yogis who can control their bodies in amazing ways. These individuals have tapped into their deep inner consciousness. They are utilizin g an inner-verse, a different dimension of their body. As we ponder the different levels on which our bodies function, many que stions form. If our bodies"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE function without our direct awaren ess then does the Universe have a similar mechanism? Solar radiation manipulates, to some degree, our species. You see, all the stars in the universe are like the neo-synapses of the brain. Our brain releases sparks of info rmation, or data, that moves across the expanses of our brain to other parts or points that reciprocate. Just as our neo-synapses perform this function for our brain, all the stars in the universe do the same through light. The stars emit solar radiation in m illions of frequencies, which are constantly hitting the planet and everything in it. Like a giant orchestra playing its rhythm upon a small ball. All these different pitches and frequencies constantly affect us. Because we and every creature on this planet are electrical beings, we are receptive to this manipulation. It affects our societies as if they were giant organisms moving on the planet. So God, or the Force, is comm unicating through th e stars, through solar radiation, in much the way our brain communicates with our body. It happens without us realiz ing that the el ectrons in our brain are manipulating other electrons. In this process, God communicates using solar radiation as our brains use impulse radiation. God communicates with different planets, solar systems, and galaxi es in the same way our brains communicate with our separate organs. Just as all of our body’s organs are different and serve speci al functions, so these ‘organs’"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE within the body of God are also very different and serve special functions. That is one way God thinks or communicates to its body, the Universe. It uses solar radiation. We must also understand that God is more like an organism than a thing with intent. It does not ne cessarily have a distinct plan for the Earth and certainly, it does no t have a specific plan for each individual. God is aware of us in the way that we are aware of our hand or our thumb. We are protective of our body, we use it, but we do not directly think about all the individual organi sms inside of it. We simply see it as a thing to use. If something happens to our body, we react, if it is in danger we feel the alarm that is emanating from millions of cells saying, ‘Hey, help us!’ God might have a similar reaction if the planet was in da nger. Our collective consciousness would reach out, God would feel a tiny pinprick in say the palm of the Universe, and it might go to metaphorically scratch it. We cannot easily identify, on our le vel of existence, the kind of awareness that God has. Right now, we are not aware of our kidneys or our liver but they are functioning. There is no awareness unless we feel pain, unless we feel death. In this same"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE way, God is not aware of every mi nute detail but it is aware of great imbalances. Because we are a part of God if something were to happen to the human race, we would collectively reach out and catch, in a sense, God’s attention. That attention would manifest and focus on us through the Force in the same way our consciousness focuses on an area of our body that reports havi ng trouble. Our true essence is the energy being that resides in our physical body. God is energy, and its body, its flesh and blood, is the planets and the stars. God’s soul, the Force, intertwine s with its body in the same way that our minds intertwine with our bodies. If we examine life on our planet, we can see signs of how this consciousness manifests. There are clues of its awareness and subtle manipulations created from its attention. Let us look at some insects for practical examples of this intelligence. Insects have amazing social systems to relay information. One ant will run into another one, they will touch antennae, exchange data, and keep moving. Do ants collectively make progress as individuals die? Ants probably make no visible progress collectively on the scale of a few generations. However, ants will become much smarter collectively over the course of millions of years. Is this a result of the ants sharing information or is there some other way that they change and become smarter collectively?"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE THE AWARENESS BEHIND REALITY Consider the researched and documented case of the Owl Butterfly. The Owl Butterfly lives in rainforests, from Mexico to Brazil. Birds are the natural predators of the Owl Butterfly. The predators of these birds are owls th at live in the same rainforests as the birds and the Owl Butterfly. Like all owls, these owls have ve ry distinctive colored markings around their eyes unique to their species, and birds recognize their predator, the owl, by these distinct ive markings. When a bird sees the eye of an owl, its brain registers that it is in danger and it should fly away. Now these birds prey on a very specific butterfly, aptly named the Owl Butterfly. This butterfly is a main meal for these birds. Somehow, this butterfly, which as far as we are concerned has below zero intelligence, has a wing pattern, which is identical to the color and pattern of the owl’s eyes. When the butterfly extends its wings, it reveals the pattern matching the owl’s eyes. The bird recognizes the pattern, on the butterf ly’s wing, as the eye of its feared predator, panics and leaves. If the bird spies the butterfly, but does not recognize the pattern on the butterfly's wing, then it has a tasty treat. This maintains an amazing balance in the butterfly population and in the ecosystem as a whole. Are we to believe that this is pure coincidence?

In human evolution, we think of an ape-man slowly becoming erect and over time becoming smarter and more adept. Our evolution allowed us to shape our reality by creating tools and technology. Did the butterfly follow the same evolutionary path? Did its intelligence increase over ti me? Did it knowingly shape its reality by matching its markings to an owl? No way. Did the butterfly, at any point, understand the distinguishing mark of a specific owl? Was it ev er knowingly conscious of it or possess the ability to willfully modify its own wing pattern? It could not know what specific patte rn on a particular kind of owl would do the trick. The butterfly possesses no means of deducing that kind of information. Th e random mutation that powers evolution cannot explain what happened. Something was at work that was mo re intricate than evolution.

Simply put, th e theory states that there could have been hundreds of kinds of butterflies and over thousands of years they were reduced to the most successful species.

It is like the difference between our body functioning automa tically and willful, conscious intervention. Something wanted a progression of life and collected all this environmental data to make a willful intervention. This something knew that the bird fed on the butte rfly and that the owl was the bird’s natural predator. It also knew that it needed the Owl Butterfly to pollinate fruit trees. The Owl Butterfly would get pollen on its back and travel am ong the trees pollinating them because the butterfly was attr acted to the flowers. It also knew that when the fruits of these trees were pollinated it needed this specific bird, which was inclined to eat these seeds, to eat and digest them and then spread them around so they would get planted and grow elsewhere. It kne w it needed this bird but it had to weigh things out. It needed a ba lance. It needed to control the birds, the owls and the butterflies so it created this natural ecosystem. Humans certainly did not do that. We had no part in creating that system. This is where the elusive answer to the problem is.

An intelligence intervened to ensure the balance a nd survival of this ecosystem. This intelligence was the Gaia consciousness, the consciousness of the planet, working on an amazingly complex level. Nothing other than a consciousness could have been so specific. The only other option would be divine intervention. That would be a direct intervention by the Force subtly influencing reality. However, if our planet, Gaia, has a consciousness and can influence physical reality then the Universe is certainly capable of a similar intervention. The case of the Owl Butterfly is one of many which show that the For ce is constantly here and demonstrates how the Force works on very subtle levels. The example of the Owl Butterfly shows that Gaia, which is a very complex living organism, and ultimately the Universe, have a level of self-awareness and demonstrates how this awareness manifests itself in our reality. This or similar interventions are the Force trying to preserve the existence and growth of life. It must do this in subtle and delicate ways. Everything in the Universe is struggling to survive.

This is the kind of secret that in order to find an answer, a person has to travel thousands of miles, crawl up the side of the highest peak of a brutal, snow-covered, wind-swept mountain range to find a half- starved blind yogi. Although we are not going to go through all of that, we will ask the question and search for its answer. That is right, what is the meaning of life? Everybody asks this question almost without fail. I could write the meaning of life on the back of a fortune cookie but the explanation of the answer could take years to unravel and see the truth of it. The meaning of life is to experience. We are energy beings in physical bodies in this dimension to experience what we could not as pure energy. As energy we do not have nasal glands so we cannot smell, we do not have ear drums so we cannot hear, we cannot see because we have no eyes, we cannot taste because we have no taste buds and we cannot touch! As an energy being, this whole universe of matter does not exist. This dimension is like a smorgasbord of experiences. For an energy being, our world is like being a seven year old at Disneyland!"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE It is a magical wonderland! We can experience things with this body that are new, exciting and unexpected! Our bodies transform and interpret data, or experiences, into energy so they can become part of our consciousness. This is what I mean when I say the meaning of life is to experience. It is to experience th e sun on our faces, it is to feel the moisture of wet dewy grass on our to es, it is to feel the wind in our hair, and it is to hear birds sing. It is to kiss, to hug and it is to roll around in the dirt and tast e the dust in our mouths! It is to laugh! The meaning of life is to experien ce and do all of the things that we cannot do as energy beings. Existing as an energy being is not a bad thing, but it is so very different from this existence. This existence is to be imagined, to be tasted, to be enlivened. To not experience or to suppress another from experiencing is one of the few truly great universal wrongs. Everything that is living has a natura l desire to live. Even animals far below human intelligence do not just run off cliffs. Everything has a sense of life. Everything wants to live because infused in everything is the Force, and its energy tells us to live. This same energy functions to protect the planet, the solar system, the galaxy, the universe and ultimately the consciousness of God. We are also infused with energy, which we have been talking"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE about. While we cannot experi ence this dimension with our energy bodies, we can share our experiences and pass them on through our energy. Look at how our experiences ar e created and transformed. Everything we see, smell, touch, ta ste, or hear is converted into electricity. Every experience in li fe arrives to our being in the form of electrical impulses. Ev ery experience that we receive happens because the cells of our bodies share copies of their experiences by sending electrical impulses on to the brain and eventually surrender their existence for our experience. While ‘we’ the being will live for many y ears to come the cells within our inner-universe, our body, will die and be replaced constantly throughout our life. Now pause for a moment and l ook around the room. Maybe you are resting comfortably in a soft ch air, or a leather couch, or at a hard table drinking coffee. Reach out with your hand and feel the things that are around you. Perhaps you feel the softness of the chair or a smooth cup that is warm from the drink it contains. To have this simple experience of touch, tiny electrical signals are fired through your nervous system and the brain registers them. However, ‘you’ did not actually have that experience.

"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"UNVEILING THE UNIVERSAL PURPOSE What will be a very brief moment of your total life will be a lifetime for all of the micro life that makes up your physical body.

When we look back on these collected experiences, like data stored on a computer chip, we recall a ll of them as energy. Because every experience we have is conve rted from our nervous system into energy, it is also stored and recalled as energy from our electrical bodies. This is why modern science does not know where memories are stored in the br ain. It is known that chemical releases signal memories being tr iggered but it is not known where they come from. They are stored as energy sepa rate from the physical brain. When most people die this energy, their stored consciousness and the totality of who they are, is absorbed into the collective consciousness of the Earth. Much like the cells of our body, when they die and their electrical e ssence contributes to you, so do beings on this planet contribute to the Earth’s consciousness.

A human lifetime seems like a very long period for us but for the Earth it is only a brief moment. The scale of an experience is relative to the perspective that one takes wh en viewing the experience. Relationships between things on large and small scales reflect each other. A process that occurs on a very micro level can often be seen occurring in a similar way on a very macro level. We will live our lives, from a few moments to a hundred years, only to give up our existence a nd memories to the planet. The planet, which is just a tiny mi crobe compared to the universe, will live for billions of years and then surrender its entire experience, its consciousness, to the solar system. It will pass its experiences on by surrendering its c onsciousness. The planet is part of a larger system that will contribute to a greater being, just as the individual cells in our bodies do for us. In time, even the solar system will gi ve all of its data to our galaxy, and the galaxies will give their da ta to the universe, which is the body of God.

Without the sensation of every touch, or smell, every taste and sound, we would experience nothing. All of these th ings make it what it is. Even if the existence of our entire universe is but the shortest moment for God, it is a moment of invaluable importance, of immeasurable possibility. Ev erything within that moment, no matter the size, contributes to that. What is more beautiful or precious than that? Yet, it is all so fragile. We have many obstacles in life. There are many risks and dangers along the way. The Universe faces its own dangers. The purpose of White Cells is to protect and pr eserve life. If the Force is all that there is and it pushes everything to live and grow then what is the reason for white cells?

With this done, we must also seek out a reason for why there is a Darkside. Understand that there is a positive force of energy, which is what we are a part of, and there is an opposing force, which is the origin of our concept of evil.

As with many of the things I discuss, if you cannot recognize and acknowledge something, you can do nothing with it, or in this case, against it. The nature of anti-matter is as su btle and elusive as the workings of the Force, so we must analyze what it is and what it is not. It is important not to mix morality or ethics with the workings of the Darkside. Stealing a car, for example, might be immoral and unethical, which are rules created and determined by a society, but it is not a truly evil act. What is evil is the suppression or killing of life. If one were to kidnap a person and suppress them by locking them in a room and deprive them of th e sensations of new things or experiences, that is the Darkside. That is evil. To abuse someone and fill them with fear of living life, of going out and experiencing all that life has to offer, is evil. To kill life is wrong.

The Darkside is a reaction, an opposing force. Anything that promotes life also attracts the Darkside, which will oppose its growth. Both the forces of God and the Darkside exist everywhere. The relationship of the Darkside and God is like oil and vinegar. We can look at oil and vinegar in a still bottle and they will be separate with one fl oating on top of the other. When we shake that bottle, it will look like one pinkish fluid. The two fluids are still separate but they are so tiny that we cannot tell by casually looking.

As the Earth changes and evolves and life grow s and becomes more intelligent, the interest of the Darkside grows. As humanity develops the Earth an d the Force grows stronger with us, the Darkside will continue to accumulate and attempt to find points that it can crack into, to somehow eradicate or spoil this process.

By creating satellites and moving our intelligence off the planet, we are extending the reach of the planetary organism that is Gaia. The planet is expanding by using its collective resources to evolve. It has its own way of creating its sensory and it uses mankind as a part of that sensory. This is a normal process. Think about what we have disc ussed about using our body to collect data and experiences for our energy consciousness. Look at your arm and think about what it does. It reaches out beyond the boundary of your main torso and touches the world around you. It collects data. Do you recall our discussion about how not all beings need arms and legs to be alive? The planet does not have arms to reach out so it will use us to create spacecraft, satellites and all kinds of other techno logies to move beyond its own boundaries and touch the universe around it.

That is the ultimate goal of enlightenment after all, to align oneself with th e Force. If you deny the existence of the Darkside then you do not accept the Force. If you do not accept the Force, you will never awaken. Many have fallen into this trap. WHEN NON-DUALITY BECOMES NEUTRALITY A growing number of people seek wh at they perceive to be a more direct spiritual path. Many of these people adopt a misinterpretation of the concep t of oneness or non-duality. Oneness or non-duality means that there is no duality; the Force and the Darkside are really one thing. There are many different variations and interpre tations of this philos ophy but for the sake of this argument, I will simply state part of this belief is that the ultimate nature of everything is happening just as it should.

Adopting this, one can be led to acce pt that they are no longer truly responsible for their choices and th at everything is happening as it should. While parts of this philosophy hold great truth, the danger is that it can lead you into a state of non-act ion. It puts your consciousness in a loop. The helpless belief that your choices will not affect your journey to awakening subdues your natural urge to grow your consciousness. If a person adopts this as ultimate truth, one question always seems to arise, what does it matter what choice I make? An immature non-dualist point of vi ew could look at the Force and the Darkside and reduce them to mere concepts and part of the illusion. The universe is unfolding as it should, so why bother making a choice when everything is working perfectly as is?

It will also lessen your opportunity to tap into the force, which will deny you entrance into any level of enlight enment and ensure you will never fulfill your higher purpose. In this dimension, everything has an opposite; one aspect cannot exist without the other. Therefore, they must both exist to define the greater whole; light cannot exist without darkness or good cannot exist without evil and life defines death. Reflect ba ck on our discussion about the creation of the Universe and the varying dimensions of God.

Remember that God grows and evol ves by creating variations of its own energy. The higher dimension where God moved its energy from is still there. There are ev en higher dimensions beyond that.

They will never awaken to higher dimensions where only the Force exists. Do you see the trap? They must accept them both because in this belief the Darkside is essential for God to exist. The fact is that as long as a person holds this kind of misinterpretation of non-dualistic belief they will never know the Force because they will have turned away from it. It is true that in this Universe when God entered this dimension, there was a reaction and that reacti on was anti-matter. To suggest that the Force cannot exist apart from anti-matter is to become blind to the struggle that is life. All life could cease. The Darkside could wipe out all life in this Universe and end this grand experience of which we are all a part. Life and our planet are very preci ous because they are fragile.

The Darkside could destroy all life in the Univ erse and this part of God would die with it. Do you not see the preciousness of this? However very real the dangers to the Universe might be, we remain free to choose to be oblivious , or to help the Universe. God is curious and wants to experience everything. It cannot do this if we are tightly bound to its will and forced to serve it. Such structure and control is a trait of the Darkside not the Force.

When we read about some of the great enlightened masters of the past, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, we note similar traits. Compassion, devotion and an overwhelming sens e that these people were more than human; these beings were the fingertips of God. In the beginning, were they so very di fferent than we are now? You already know what the difference was. They made a choice. They surrendered to that choice absolutely and unconditionally. They chose the Force and raised th eir consciousness to its tonal. The Force accepted them and worked through them to shape reality and change the course of this world. When someone looks at the Universe and accepts both the Force and anti-matter they have declared their neutrality.

The second option is to convince as much life as possible to accept destruction as inev itable, to get them to stand on the sidelines of the battle and do nothing.

We can begin the journey of expanding our consciousness and we may experience deep relaxation or feelings of bliss but we can never enter levels of true enlightenment. When we refuse to embrace the Force this ensures that we will never awaken and se rve the purpose of a White Cell. By choosing to act neither for th e Force nor for the Darkside, we cannot experience the many higher vi brations that ex ist within God and we will have made the success of the Darkside more possible. Through time, the Darkside has tu rned many White Cells away from the path of awakening so that they lose their way and cannot fulfill their purpose. It may seem simple, very black and white, but anyone who holds to a non-dualistic belief ensures that awakening is impossible.

Ironically, these methods reflect all of my teachings. It parallels them. The point is that the quicksa nd is a living thing in one aspect. It probably has living organisms in it. It has a degree of intention. Cons ider it the most basic kind of intelligence. What is intelligence anyway, but a vast array of reactions and non- reactions based upon actions.

"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN Always remember, do not discount a thing because of its perceived size. At this moment, you may vi ew yourself as a relatively small thing, but you hold near limitless potential. To awaken we must understand wh at we are as spiritual beings, how we evolve, and grow. WHAT IS A SPIRITUAL BEING? To begin to understand what we are as spiritual beings, let us re- examine our physical beings. As we have discussed, the human body is a robot of sorts with the energy being controlling it. Try not to let your relationship to your body get in the way of seeing the truth of this. While our design is soft, organic flesh, the process involved in working the body is similar to how we control other tools we have made. From the time we are born into this world, we spend great amounts of time and energy training our bodies to respond to our will. After a time, the body respond s almost perfectly as we desire it to. This is why the idea that the center of our being resides within a dimensional consciousness that exists apart from our body is often such a challenging concept. This idea is so challenging it requires us to put forth effort to truly understand that we are energy be ings. As energy beings, we experience the physical world as energy that the body translates. The energy being registers physical sensations and experiences as"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN electrical signals received from nerves. Without the body, an energy being would be very limited in its ability to experience and grow. An energy being cannot make noise, at least not as we know it, because as energy it does not have vocal cords. Nor would it have lungs to propel sound, or eyes to see as we see, or eardrums to hear as we do. To explore this dime nsion we connected our energy bodies to our current bodies. Th e brain became the driver’s seat, much like the one we would sit in to control a car. Once we have a physical body, as energy beings, we can explore and experience this dimension in ways not otherwise possible. Your hands and other parts of your body collect data, translate these experiences into energy, an d send it along to your brain. Once the brain receives this energy, it translates the data, which creates the experience. This pro cess is necessary for your energy being to be able to experience this dimension. In fact, because science can observe th is whole process of converting experiences into electricity or energy you should find it easier to acknowledge and realize the truth of what you are. Your being is conscious, living energy. Physical evidence of the ener gy body exists and a number of different sources document it. The first of these is Russian engineer Semyan Kirlian who di scovered that living tissue emits electromagnetic force fields that show up on photosensitive paper."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN The process of photographing and r ecording this is called Kirlian photography. Using his photographic technique, a l eaf with a portion of it cut out still shows the outline of its missing part. Even though it is not there, physically, the photograph shows an outline as if it was. This prompts suggestions that Kirlian photography reveals the energy body. Kirlian photographs show energy emanating from the body. A picture of a hand, for example, depicts the fingers illuminated by energy. If two people touch fingert ips, the energy appears to fight until both people accept the presence of the other. Another interesting case involves people who have amputated feet and legs. These people frequently report intense pain originating from phantom limbs. When a person places their hand on the area of pain, where the missing limb w ould be, and massages it as if there was a hand or limb there the pain stops. At the point of death the human body inexplicably loses several ounces of weight. Studies ha ve also shown that when photographed with light sensitive film, for an amount of nanoseconds, less than a second, a large illumination expands from the body and disappears upon death. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN These examples all point toward the conclusion that a separate body or being composed of energy inhabits the physical human body. Why energy? Energy is one propert y that is common to all life. Much of the energy on Earth comes from the sun in the form of light. This light travels from the sun through space as photons and collides with the Earth. Plants convert photons into energy through photosynthesis. This energy becomes fruits, edible grains, leaves, or other forms of plant life. At the heart of all of this life is energy. The key to the true nature of a spiritual being is not in energy alone, as that exists in all life universally. The key is in the transformation of it. Energy, acc ording to physics, cannot be destroyed, only changed into different forms. Life on Earth, in its many forms, contains energy from the sun. Energy animates all human life and some consid er this energy a soul. Really it is just an electrical body of sorts, for everyone to experience life. Now, if a soul is energy, and an electrical body is energy, then what is the difference? What creates the distinction that marks a white cell and a spiritual being? We live, love, cry, dream, desire and go through all of the wonderful th ings that life has to offer. However, these shared experiences are not enough to create a dimensional consciousness or soul. "},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN The difference between a soul a nd an electrical energy body, which everyone has, is that the soul is a developed dimensional body. The soul is manifesting, or vibra ting, at a higher frequency than our physical bodies and thoughts. All energy separates into different patterns, rhyt hms, and frequencies. Because the soul is energy, it can change its pattern or frequency through refinement. It can be developed and transforme d. Are you beginning to see the larger picture and true nature of what a spiritual being is? A spiritual being is a developed consciousness of pure, eternal energy exploring this dimension of physical matter. EVOLUTION OF A SOUL The essence of our being, our soul , is purely energy and when the body dies it is the soul that can carry on our existence. For how long this might be possible is unknowable, but scientists have speculated about the possibility of maintaining consciousness in the form of energy after the body has died. If our soul holds together after death, we can join with a new body and remain in this dimension. Reincarnation is the proc ess of having our soul move from one life and becoming reborn into another after death. I believe that upon death we do not have to immediatel y reincarnate. If we are strong enough, we can exist for any amount of time outside of the body as"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN a being of pure energy. The essen tial element of this process is that we must have a highly developed energy body. Why should a soul go through th is process rather than just experience it as a pure energy being? Our souls are trying to evolve and m ove to a higher consciousness. To do this we need to collect da ta. Our soul takes information, smells, sights, and sounds, everything it cannot get as energy, and learns from it. The soul grows in this way, by taking data from the body, life after life. One of the most powerful ways to experience is through emotion. Emotion is largely biochemical reactions created by the body. As energy beings, we would completely miss the things we hold so dear: love, passion, or hope. Ev en things like fear can be wonderful to feel, it helps us to know courage! As energy beings, we would never know emotion, the way we experience it now. Each life presents the soul with new experiences. This is how the soul hopes to advance its consciousness, by evolving life after life to arrive at a more perfect understanding of reality. To really understand where the soul hopes to ultimately go, first we will look at where the soul has come from. The universe is the body of God and we know that we exist within that body. God experiences through this dimension and its awareness moves"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN throughout it. Now relate this to our bodies. Every electron returns collected data to our brai n, which adds to our collective consciousness. Our soul performs a similar function for the collective conscious ness of God. Our journeys through this dimension, in the form of many lifetimes, collect experiences, which eventually return to the consciousness of God. As we experience we begin to vi brate, which is the frequency of our energy body, at a frequency that is closer to the vibration of God. We become the imagination of God, much like the electrons of the brain, collecting data from a remote part of our physical body then adding to our consciousness by reporting its data. This data is collected, interpreted and eventually becomes an experience. We are the electrons to God. The reality of this process is much more complicated than this explanation but in some ways as simple. All souls have come from the creat ion of God or th e creation of the Universe. This includes anything that has a soul, from life scattered throughout the entire universe, and is not limited to human beings. Life on Earth began from sunlight, from the photosynthesis of energy. Plants and trees gathered energy and transferred it to other life as they consumed them. This includes human beings, which became a part of the biologi cal life of the planet. "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN Our thoughts and emotions were like that of a dog or cat. They consisted of biochemical reactions in the brain of varying complexities. These reactions gave us feelings and emotions that we mimicked from others when we were young. We developed and formed social re lationships with others but this does not mean we had a soul. We had energy that moved through our bodies that performed all of th e things required for survival but that energy was not developed. Then one day we began to ponder this energy, and formed the concept of a soul. We starte d to experience and understand ourselves as something other than a creature completely concerned with existing. As we reflected on our inner-dimen sion, the idea of what a soul really was began to emerge. If, in this life, we attain awareness, if we understand life from a higher perspective, and realize our nature as an ener gy being then we have begun the creation of a soul. When we die this energy, because we have inwardly reflected upon it, lets us exist outside of our body. Thinking about our energy being is like building a muscle. Thought and reflection exercises it, flexes it and makes it grow stronger. Once detached from the physical body, which is truly possible only at death, the energy be ing instinctually searches for another vessel. The ener gy being reacts to death with an instinct to continue its existence. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"A SOUL WITHIN It will seek out another body as quickly as possible because, as anything in life, it wants to live. Before we die we must learn all we can, to maintain our soul. Simply knowing what a soul is does not mean you will know how to control it. Information alone is not enough. How long did it take you to learn how to walk? Have you ever seen an adult show a baby how th ey walk and then watch as the baby tries to mimic it? How of ten do you see the baby slap itself on the forehead after the adult gives them the example, exclaiming, ‘Oh, I get it! How simple.’ and th en proceeds to run quickly after the adult? You never see that because it is not that easy. Do you think maintaining and c ontrolling your soul is any different? Think about how long it takes someone to learn how to drive a car. Do you see people just jump in a car, turn the key and zip off down the road obeying all traffic laws thei r very first time? No. It takes time and effort to learn how to drive and likewise developing a soul takes time and dedication. If we have put effort, thought and energy into developing our spiritual self for thirty years before we die then certainly, we should not have any reason to be concerned about th e survival of our soul.

The design of our bodies allows them to contain energy, by reflect ing on and being aware of energy in the world around us, we are consuming energy. Once our body consumes and stores the energy, it then controls it to do what it wants. Imagine if we had to consciously manipulate the energy in our bodies to perform all of the functi ons that it executes without our direct interaction or knowledge. This would be an extremely difficult task! Our design is phe nomenal in its automation! Now think about if we did start to exercise control over our energy. If we can control this energy w ithout thinking about it, we can certainly start taking our mind, which is energy, and design a structure of energy and train it to exist beyond the physical body. The ultimate goal of training our soul to exist after our body dies is to continue our existence beyond the death of our physical body. We do not have to accep t the idea that everyone has one life to experience. We estimate the unive rse to be about fifteen billion years old.

There is a progression and evolutio n of our soul if we choose to reflect upon it and engage in that process. YOU DECIDE THE DESTINY OF YOUR SOUL When we die, we recollect the totality of our true self, so we become aware of all of our past li ves. This in return expands our consciousness.

By progressing from life to life we can gain a much greater variety of experiences than if we lived a single life forever. Imagine the impact of living one life as a man and the next as a woman. That one change would create an incredibly different experience. It gives you an experience that you c ould never have had in a single life, even if you lived for hundreds of years. Consider how large the world is and how many different people are living a life dramatically differe nt from your own. There is no substitute for experience and each life offers much that you will never truly know, or feel, unless you live it. Only by making a conscious effort can we develop our souls so that they might continue forw ard upon the death of our physical bodies. Unfortunately, we are often afraid to fully accept this because we fear the responsibility and the po wer placed in our hands. We control the destiny of our soul.

Although it might seem like a big jum p, the physical reality is that we have already died. Depe nding on how old you are physically, you may have died multiple times. You are not the same body that you were before. In fact, the person you used to be does not even exist. According to science your body, cell for cell, has died and been replaced about every 5 years, gi ve or take a few years. Every cell in your brain, everything in your eye, everything is replaced every five years. We might not see it all at once bu t one day we will look in the mirror and say, ‘I don't look anything like I used to’. Look at an old picture! All of us go from be ing very small baby structures to this big gigantic adult body and ou r mass and structure of energy changes dramatically.

When you feel spiritual, your consciousness moves at a higher fr equency. That is why you feel different when you are being spiritual . Most people are simply not aware of exactly why they feel diffe rent. It is the vibration of our consciousness shifting. Belief will raise our tonal and will make us more aware of and open to the possibilities of our bein g. As our tonal rises, we are able to perceive more, which confirms our belief, which secures our tonal speed and maintains it. It is a self-feeding process but to initiate this process we must first believe, or at least be open to the possibility, and be aware. Without an open mind our energy or tonal moves at a lower vibration because how, and what, we think affects the tonal of our consciousness. At a lower tonal we are oblivious to the higher dimensions.

Do not accept blind faith; I never have. I have always questioned everything and strongly encourage you to do the sa me. This is why I feel so strongly in delivering a solid, lo gical explanation of how the Universe works and giving others the tools to have their own experiences. When a person has experiences, it will be up to them to interpret those experiences on the intelle ctual grounding of this book or some other foundation. In the end, I have little doubt their experiences will validate that what I am saying is true. True faith is acquired through e xperience and understanding. A person might not believe in entities and that is fine, but does that person allow for the possibility that an entity might exist? We can look at it like an elementary school science project. Our hypothesis is that a being made pur ely of some form of energy, but self-aware and conscious, could exis t. Then we begin to test that hypothesis, first by examining possible ways an entity might work, exist and experience. At this point in the proce ss, belief is optional.

Because people, in general, are so educated now the intellect makes the consciousness more grounde d. This can work against us as we attempt to explore things that many consider irrational because we are telling our brains to tune out frequencies of reality that we do not believe are possibl e. Our brains obediently block out these other dimensions or frequencies of energy. By being open enough to accept the possibility of the Force, by trying to experience it, by trying to sense it, by trying to feel the Force, we open ourselves to a high er vibration, which means that we will experience more. This is why an atheist or someone who does not allow the belief of certain things is likely to ne ver experience something paranormal or dimensional, where as a non-athe ist or spiritual person could. It is because a person's energy, at a different frequency, directly affects what their awareness allows.

THE GOVERNOR Now, clever people will probably try to tell themselves that they can force themselves to believe. It is not that easy. If we could force ourselves to believe, there would be no reason for the Navigator. Inside we will always doubt things. The ‘governor’ is something inside our brain, which resists our attempts to change our fundame ntal ideas about reality. It is like a control mechanism or f ilter. It holds us here, at this dimensional frequency. There have been devices placed within cars called governors that limit the car’s maximum speed. We have a similar mechanism in our brains. Our bodies and brains are products of this dimension, this frequency, and are wired to perceive and interact only in th is dimension. The governor acts to limit our experience to this frequency and filter out all other dimensions from our awareness. Think of when we talked about cars on a freeway to understand dimensions. The governor is set to limit the speed of your vehicle. It wants to keep you at the speed of this dimension, which could be 10 M.P.H. Meanwhile, all of these cars or other dimensions are zipping by you at 20, 50, 100 M.P.H and you will never be aware of what is going on inside of them .

As we begin to understand and rea lize the truth of the governor, we can train our awareness to allo w us to perceive different frequencies. When we accept new concepts about the nature of reality, it changes the governor so that it be gins to let us experience new frequencies. There are also many techniques and ways of slipping past or fooling the governor. These are back doors, which are useful in allowing us to experien ce things before we have fully realized them. There are too ma ny ways and the details are too long for this book to cover. For now, it is important to simply note that such possibilities exist. Many ritual-based philosophies, like Magick, work on this principle. The governor is powerful because it is a part of our brain and is th e very thing that controls how we think! To directly confront it is foolish. We can stare at a wall for days and try to convince ourselves it is not solid or that our body is not a ll that we are and we will still never truly believe it. The first step in breaking the governor down is to acknowledge that it exists. By doing this, we identify the governor and our mind is more able to slip past it.

This is especially true for highly educated people, who are common in our information driven society. The challenge with education is that the more a person sets boundaries for what they believe to be true, the more rigid that person becomes in their way of thinking. When a person accumulates la rge amounts of knowledge they become fixed in their thinking. Changing a person’s belief toward something that appears to them to be irrational is a difficult thing to do. People often look for shortcuts to ease the process of altering the governor to achieve a dimensional state. There might be tools and maybe a few tricks to make this process a little easier, but in the end there are no shortcuts. Unfortunately, some supposed ‘short cuts’ also carry great risks for the mind and body of the person who chooses to follow them. Specifically, I am talking about th e use of consciousness altering drugs or psychedelics. These drugs draw people who have a spiritual nature because the experience that they provide can feel dimensional and therefore familiar. These experiences can give them a glimpse past their governor but there is a great danger in using any type of drug. Drugs often derail the seeker and permanently crystallize their consciou sness.

By understanding sp irits, entities, energy, and the paranormal and by taking these concepts in small stages we can begin to feel more of the Force. This becomes the catalyst of something more intens e as we progress spiritually in time. By using drugs, even if we see things, it does not mean that we will fully digest and understand them. When the drugs wear off our governor is still there, active and able as ever. True awakening or dimensiona l consciousness cannot be an instantaneous event. If we are not prepared for an experience, the governor will find a way to explain, dismiss or block it out. It is up to the individual to personally ta ke the steps required to achieve a permanent understanding.

That key only opens one door, no matter how differently the experience manifests itself. A true spiritual experi ence begins to show you the nature of all the many doors of the mind and flowers beyond that one experience. It takes energy and effort to mani pulate a person’s governor so that they can have true spiritual experiences on their own. To progress on a spiritual level realize that we are spiritual beings and then decide how far along the path you wish to go. To reach enlightenment we must bridge the familiar physical dimension with the higher dimens ions that we are striving to understand. This process requires time. It could take weeks, months, years, or even lifetimes . We must reflect on this knowledge until our soul is developed and our mind is ready to become a higher frequency.

We exist within a being, Gaia, and the body of God, which is the universe. The greater being of God is a multi- dimensional state filled with universes, and this universe is only a part of that being.

Because they were dependent on people, they were also sensitive to the concerns and fears of those people. People ofte n fear things that they do not understand. When people were creating these theologies, they did not understand paranormal abilities. Th e reason that these ridiculous beliefs about paranormal abilities ex ist today is that people still do not understand what paranormal abiliti es are, how natural they are, and for that reason, people are stil l afraid.

There have been many accounts where mothers will wake up in the middle of the night and feel there is something wrong with their child. They brush it off only to hear later that their ch ild was in a traumatic event like a car wreck. For business decisions someone coul d use their heightened sensory to tell if a deal was suspicious or if everyone was being honest. The sixth sense would clue you in to any kind of trouble. Even choosing a mate would become easier because you could feel so much more about what that person is really like. The common decision of knowing who to walk up to and even ask out on a date would change as you would sense much more about that person without even speaking to them ! This is how early man communicated to begin with and it is an ability we can easily re- tap into now. If social use of the sixth sense became commonplace our whole world would shift dramatically. The level of deception and taking advantage of others would vanish as people became better able to read intentions with crystal clarity. Think about the simple task of going to a used car salesman.

Howeve r, if the car salesman also used the sixth sense you could also empathize with their need to make a living and a fair deal woul d be a certainty. How we relate as individuals an d as nations would be vastly different. Compassion and unders tanding would rule because our feelings, thoughts and intentions would be open for the world to know. There would be no faking it as the sixth sense reaches internally to the true nature of a person. Our ability to work together as a unified species woul d be truly inspiring without the levels of fear and mistru st we fight with now. Life took a very interesting tu rn when our species lost the connection to the sixth sense. Had we remained connected, the quality of our world would be very different indeed. The rate of this planet’s evoluti on decreased rapidly when we lost our sense that connected us to everything. Consider how different things would be even if women ruled the world rather than men. Women, in general, display much higher levels of intuition and psychic ability. As a result, those with hi gher levels of intuition are more gentle, understanding and compa ssionate. Our world would be much more peaceful had they taken leadership. We can only work with the information we have available. This is why men only tend to deal with the world of the fi ve senses and lack the ability to feel the connectivity a woman does. In the end, there is no sense in pointless regret, we must not dwel l on where our society could or would have been.

Activating the sixth sens e within your brain and learning how to unite its abilities w ith the mind will allow you to experience the universe in its full potential. You must not overlook the sixth sense any longer. Its scope reaches far beyond paranormal abilities or spiritual awakening into every aspect and experience of life. It connects them all. I can explain and teach psychic abi lities but you must also seek this knowledge to understand it. Remember all of the incredible leaps and bounds that humanity has made. As a race, we are still adolescents. What do we really know? Less than 90 years ago, we were using horses and buggies. Reflect back on this and thousands of other oddities in our history. Do you think we really have a solid grasp of what the human brain is capable? Do you believe we ha ve even begun to understand the nature of our reality? We know very little and have not even begun. How can we remain ignorant to our paranormal reality? Try as we may through quests, reli gion and all that comes within, the mystery evades us at each turn. Within us, something says we are more than we seem. Despite this feeling, so many of us continue to deny it. Why? Is it so hard to believe?

Yes, a part of us might shy away at the childlike simplicity of this. Ye t, we do not have to look back far in history to see the truth of what I am saying. There are glimpses of these old, powerful teachers recorded in our past. Glimpses of beings who changed the course of the world for a greater good. History records only the ones who stood out, but there have been many. Call them masters or enlightened beings, they have many names but their purposes are simila r. Every culture from every period records fragments of stories. These beings were sent to the world, at their time, to stand out. They were sent to make the fabric or the matrix of the spiritual element of our reality stronger. The matrix of spiritual energy vi brates on a higher tonal and is created by the collective consci ousness of human beings. Our collective intelligence needed to be seeded and made a little stronger so it would not be weak ened by a virus wiping out white cells, making the body of Gaia vulnerable.

This is how they have managed to get the planet where it is. The human race should have been wiped out already seven, eight, nine times. We are beginning to discove r this through ar chaeology. In fact, there have been times when the human race has almost been completely wiped out but some how it survived and we do not know how. How did we do it, our human race? If we think about it, can human beings run faster than most animals? No. Do we have claw s and teeth to defend ourselves? No. Do we have any great advant age of scent or hearing? The answer is still no. Maybe psychically, we had an advantage, but that is my point. Something intervened, to allow us to make it to this point. The Universe has always sent be ings to assist the world. Try not to make a complete fairy tale out of this. It is not as if one being comes down and makes the whole world shine and hum with incredible light. It does not work th at way. It is about subtleness. It is about the Force working powerfully through our level of reality and then slipping out. It is helping through a steady guided progression without the world ev er being fully aware of the intervention.

It must be slow and flexible with a fluidic grace. The Universe, much like our body system when it senses an illness or an infection, calls upon its white cells. Where do white cells come from ? Our body creates them. How do those white cells know what a virus is from what is not? How is it that a white cell can fight a cold, die, and yet win the battle because the other white cells remember a specific virus so it can never come back again? Even when a white cell dies, a part of it lives. For a human white cell, memories and essence are stored in their dimensional consciousness. Our white cells have chosen to serve our body just as we must choose to serve the Force. We can tell what is a ‘virus’ from what is not by utilizing a higher sensory, our sixth sense. The Darkside changes and evolves just as the Force evolves and grows over hundreds of thousands of years. The Darkside knows what has been going on. As life on this planet swells, it reacts and pushes us back. It wants to prevent life. This is the best we have done so fa r. You may have to simply trust me on that.

It has become a problem for the Universe to send white cells to th e Earth to inhabit a body. Yet, they must arrive to do the work, and fulfill their necessary role. We have gotten so far now, more than any other time in history. Another hundred years and we will easily be pollinating the Moon, Mars and beyond! We will be spreading life throughout the Universe. The Darkside prevents powerful white cells from inhabiting a body on Earth. It destroys them by preventing them from emerging, by even being born. It blocks them on an energy level. There have been immense conflicts, or excha nges of energy, to stop white cells from arriving on this planet. The reality of this ongoing conflict is complicated. The explanation I am about to offer is intentionally simple. Understand that this ex planation only examines the basics of a conflict that determines the fate of this planet. There is an amount of God in the universe and there is an amount of the Darkside in the universe. In this dimension, the Darkside has a very strong hold. In some cases, it is more powerful than the Force in this dimension. This is not true for all dimensions, rest assured. Remember that there are higher dimensions where only the Force is present. "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"MIGRATION OF THE SLEEPER In order to prevent the Darkside from blocking White Cells the Universe began delivering them to this world in a state that acted much like a stealth mode. Because consciousness is a vibration, the Darkside easily detects any high frequency consciousness that moves into this dimension. For it to avoid detection and de struction by the Darkside, a hyper- dimensional consciousness, which is near the tonal of the Force, must enter this dimension as a consciousness with a low tonal. When a white cell moves into this dimension it cannot take its accumulated knowledge, lest the Dark side detect it. It would easily sense a white cell moving into this dimension, like a glowing neon fish swimming through the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean. This is why white cells must leave their higher consciousness behind. They must become a lower tonal to enter this world. This is why th e Sleeper is necessary. A white cell cannot enter this worl d with the awareness of what they are. It has to be this way. The game, that we must win, is to not only move into this dimension undetected, but also to awaken, and then reach enlightenment.

I could go into detail but most w ould not understand the main point. If I keep the concepts simple, everyone can understand the goal. We do not remember everything that we are because we could not. We must struggle through the process of awakening because that is the only way it can happen. We had to fall asleep so that we could silently pass to this dimension, in to this world. We have to wake in a world that may seem like a dream, because a part of us feels strongly that there is more. And there is. Although we had to fall asleep to ar rive here safely, our destiny is not to remain asleep. We are not meant to be here only to experience, that is why we struggle against this veil we feel has been placed over our sight. Remember, even though our purpose is to awaken, there is no guarantee that it will happen. We must choose to actively seek awakening and time is not on our side. The only guarantee we have in life is that we will have a physical death. Each person has a limited amount of time to experience this amazing and beautiful world. We have an opportunity to awaken and move beyond the limits of this reality if we so choose and earnestly apply ourselves to this path. If we choose this path, we have a diminishing amount of time to awaken.

I am not a gambler, therefore I have taken the stance that there is never enough time. I have devoted my life to the immediate path of awakening and resolving any an d all barriers of resistance in order to help others awaken. There is a purpose for your awaken ing and I believe it can and will occur – if you apply yourself. The best way to achieve this is to have as broad an understanding of the paranormal as possible and develop the sixth sense. This knowledge will help you approach and interpret that which you currently cannot even recognize. I often suggest that people should reflect on their own path. Reflect on how long it took to intellectually get to where you ar e now. What was it that opened the door to this hidden path for you? When was the moment you realized there was something mo re beyond this physical life? What did it mean to you at that moment? How much more do you want to know? Everything that you have read in this book will advance you years beyond what you could discover on your own. I design everything that I create to accelerate your aw akening. Why am I doing this?

The sixth sense is the crucial i ngredient and the missing link to awakening. We can meditate and study books about how we are not our physical bodies. We can learn about energies beyond what our eyes can see. We only ac quire true understanding of the paranormal through experience. We need to see auras, visible halo-like light radiating from peopl e. We need to step out from our bodies and move around.

Once someone enters into awareness, it is difficult to imagine life without it. There are a variety of ways to create an awakened awareness and open psychic sensory but it is not a simple conversation. One cannot do without the staple activity of proper meditation.

This technique differs from met hods of meditation that focus only on the body and the brain. Through this practice, a person gains relaxation, stress relief, improved concentration, a greater sense of well-being and a host of other phys ical, and mental, benefits. However, traditional meditation fails to provide the final step that bridges the brain with the dimensi onal mind. This final step is our direct connection to life, the Univer se, God and who we truly are! It is why most people begin to medi tate and it is the last thing most meditation methods offer. RE-IGNITING THE SIXTH SENSE Almost all forms of meditation, from traditional techniques to modern meditation technology, ne glect the sixth sense. As we have discussed, the sixth sense is vital. You cannot completely awaken without it. My system of meditation activates and heightens the sixth sense and connects you to your dimensional consciousness. When that happens you will find everything you are looking for but pr obably never expected to find. You will feel utterly complete.

Once the sixth sense is active, one can achieve amazing things. For now, do not be concerned with those amazing things. In the early stages of development, it is important not to focus on psychic parlor tricks and paranormal abilities. Direct your attention toward using the sixth sense as a tool of communicat ion. I will explain why later. All other paranormal matters are simple byproducts of achieving your inner awakening. Trust me , once you apply even a little effort things will change very quickly. Through the meditation system I created, you can reawaken the region of the brain in which the si xth sense resides. In so doing you can reconnect with the Universe and experience it with your modern mind. The Universe is capable of intellectual processes far beyond our understanding. How and when it chooses to manipulate life is not a simple process for us to understand. It manifests itself through our reality in subtle ways but also through a different perception of time. An incredibly long period of time for us is a very short period for the planet or the Universe. "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION Evolution is the manifestation of the will of the Universe. Remember our discussion about the ow l, the bird and the butte rfly? That relationship is the will of the Force working in this dimension. If the Force functions on so many subtle levels, we should ask ourselves, what else does it influence? Since evolution is the will of th e Universe then evolution has not mistakenly forgotten the sixth sense. Evolution awaits the re-emergence of this sense within humanity so that humans might re-unite themselves with the Force. Do you think the human race is ready? Are you ready? THE PURPOSE OF TRUE MEDITATION Typically, most forms of meditatio n are practiced by sitting, with the eyes closed. We shut off our sight. We do not move, so we are not really touching anything other than what we are sitting on. During meditation, we attempt to shut off all of our five senses. Because our bodies are designed to collect data they will automatically try to continue gathering information through any available sensory. If the body cannot get anything from our standard five, it will try to push the sixth sense forward. This process is the basis for mo st meditation methods. The chances of activating the sixth sense in this way are incredibly remote. It is based on a shameful lack of understanding. This is why other methods discourage development of the very"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION sense they are unknowingly trying to bring forward. They are simply unaware of the process. Shut off your senses, sit long enough, and hope that the sixth sense, or ‘spiritual awareness’, will spark. This is how other systems expect you to awaken. It is a prescription for frustration a nd ultimately failure. For me this is like playing the lottery. Using other systems, every time you sit down to meditate there is a one in a million chance your sixth sense might just randomly step forward. For most people, when this happens it triggers an amazing, profound and truly paranormal experience. Of course, there is one problem. Once it happens and you have the experience, how do you get back ther e? You stumbled across it in the first place by blind luck! Before I explain why it would be important to go back there, or even seek paranormal experiences, let me restate that you should not concern yourself with paranorma l events or abilities, in the very beginning. Rather, concentrate on the sixth sense as a tool of communication. One is sure to ask what the sixth sense needs to communicate. Every sense we have interprets data from this dimension into experiences. They translate experiences and communicate them to us. We are on a spiritual path seeking our higher consciousnesses and God. How will we find and understand these things? Will our higher consciousness suddenly appear before us in a flash"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION of light and just say, “Oh, there you are. Hi, my name is Charlie. Say we need to talk, there are a lot of things about us you don’t know and have forgotten.” It is an absurd thought. What about God? When the moment arrives for us to connect with the Universe, do we expect the clouds to part, a giant face appearing in the sky, saying, “Oh, there you are. Hi, my name is, well, God. Say we need to talk, there are a lot of things about us you don’t know and have forgotten.” Then we get to sit, stare up at the clouds, and chat with God as if it were just our next-door neighbor? Equally absurd! If we did not have words, how would we communicate? What if there was no written language? We would still have feelings. Emotion is the closest th ing to frequency or vibration that we can communicate to the Univer se with. We can look at a dog and know what it is without saying ‘ dog’ in our head. If we look at a dog and we look at a spoon, we know through internal feelings or sensations, they are different things. It is very subtle but it is like a separate physical sensation. It is not just that they look different but they also feel different. I do not mean they feel different by touch, I mean internally we regist er a different sensation when we compare the two. Our sixth sense delivers that data to us. It is the sensory that is closes t to what we are looking for - a frequency or energy. The more we can learn and understand its"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION language the more we can transl ate and find our awakening. Using the sixth sense we can interpret and communicate, without words, the language of the Force. More than understanding the Forc e, if you wish to accomplish psychic or spiritual feat s you must also think without words. If, for example, you want to do someth ing extraordinary, like float an apple across a room using your mind, how do you think you will do that? Do you think you will just tell the apple, “Hey apple! I command you to float across the room !”? No. Floating an object through the air may seem like an ex treme example but it illustrates how amazing a true spiritual breakthrough can be when you achieve it. Without words, you can do it. Notice I said without word s, not without thought. This is something that is easy to say but difficult to do. As an example, read what I am about to explain and then try it, before you continue reading. First, look around where you are right now and take in every detail. Once you have done that, take a deep breath in and exhale. This last pa rt is going to be really easy. Close your eyes and have total non-thought. Just have complete silence in your brain. Do not a llow pictures or songs to flicker through your head. You control your brain so just shut it down and do not think about anything at all. Sit that way for about a minute before opening your eyes and continuing to read. "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION After doing this for about a minute you will probably notice, your brain is chattering away, despite any attempts to quiet it. It is busy trying to analyze everything and communicate what it is experiencing. I call this the Ba bbler. Our brains run their own show whether we want them to or not. We should not need our brains to explain this very simple experience for us. We should be able to sit quietly and enjoy a moment of silence without thinking at all! It is not a difficult task, so what is there to think about ? See how long you can sit and not have words in your head. Songs or sounds count. You will want to have total and complete silence. It is extremely difficult to do. The brain always, always, always comes up with something to think about. If you do not let it think in word s chances are it will start flashing images or pictures to distract you. Here is another quick example. Do the same thing you did before, close your eyes and take a deep br eath. This time take your right hand and slightly pinch your left fo rearm, which is the bit of your arm just above your wrist. It onl y needs to be a light pinch, only enough to feel it, and should not be painful. Focus on the physical feeling of the pinch. Do not think about anything. Pay attention to the physical sensation created by having your skin pinched slightly. "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION Sit and focus for about the same amount of time, which should have been almost a minute. After you try, open your eyes and k eep reading. If you did it, you probably noticed it was a lot easier to do without thinking than just sitting, trying to maintain silence. Our sixth sense is severely limite d when we do not have control of our brains. Our brains always babble, and unless we quiet them, we will never be able to understand the language of the Universe. The language of the Universe is beyond everyday language. The last example was to show you a quick way to cheat your way into not having any words in your head. Not having any words in your head is only part of it. It does not mean you will not have thought. A big part of what you gain, using my meditation method, is learning to think differently. Most people believe that when they are meditating they are trying to perfect complete and total non-th ought. There must be absolute silence they think. The people who teach or sell these meditations systems believe this too. This is what all of those ancient yogis talk about, right? Wrong. When those ancient yogis said you must have non-thought, they meant non-words. They meant we must learn to think differently, using a process without words, not without thought. We still want to think, but in a way so alien to normal thought, we might as well call it something completely different."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION It is more of a way to think in energy. I understood this early in my childhood, so my meditation syst em focuses on the sixth sense as a means to think beyond the limitations of language and structural thinking. As you work with meditation, the way you experience life becomes clearer. Over time, you begin to see life with qualities of energy and vibration. Beyond simply seeing, soon you will begin to understand that there is somethi ng beyond it all. As you continue to apply the techniques, you will f eel the presence of the Universe all around you. This is not as abst ract as it sounds . It becomes a very clear, very real experience. Often you first observe it in nature and general life. When you hear music, birds, or a friend's voice, it is as if these sounds are beautiful music, playing in your head, singing through your being. As your sixth sense becomes more active, it enhances your other senses and increases your awareness. This sounds simple but it change s every moment of your life. Everything you experience becomes fuller, richer. Imagine doing something you enjoy, like taking a walk through a local park. You feel a warm breeze on your cheek and hear echoes of laughter in the distance. Th e sun is shining and you capture"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION something in the experience that gi ves you a sense of peace. It is a simple moment but a pleasurable one. Now think, what would it be like if I said that simple experience, without the increased awareness of the sixth sense, is like watching it on television? While you may not realize it, the experience, in comparison, is flat, detached, and not as real as it can be. FUELING YOUR DIMENSIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS Practicing meditation and activatin g the sixth sense enhances our connection to everything. You be come aware that the energy of the Universe is within all things. There is a difference between understanding this princi ple and being able to experience it. Your meditations also tune you to a better frequency. Life becomes more rewarding and fulfilling. You understand life more deeply and become one with it. This happens because of the second thing my meditation technique does. It raises your consciousness and tonal by gathering prana into you. Awakening and experiencing multi-dimensional consciousness requires fuel. t requires prana. Prana is the all-pervading vital energy of the Universe. It is the energy th at makes up everything and is everywhere. I sometimes refer to it as prana rather than energy. This distinction makes it clear th at I am talking about an all- pervading vital energy, not a form of electricity. "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION Prana is important because everything needs an exchange of energy. A car does not run with out gasoline, a tree does not grow without water and fire does not burn wi thout air. Everything in our universe requires an exchange of energy. Our soul, our consciousness, our dimensional bein g is composed of and feeds on prana. When I talk about raising tonal, or shifting consciousness to a higher vibration, that requires fuel, it requires prana. We cannot achieve anything psychic or spiritual w ithout prana. People, often called psychics, wh o display paranormal abilities, will say they feel drained after performing paranormal feats. It is very tiring. These acts ta ke a certain kind of fuel and that is prana. We must have fuel to raise the vibration of consciousness, shift into other dimensions and ultimately to awaken. We cannot awaken without gas to get there. My meditation technique shows so meone how to draw in this energy intensely. It is too detailed to discuss now, as it would take up another book just to explain how it works. If you are not using my system, I strongly urge you to look into it. We draw prana to us by being awar e of it. By simply meditating, using a system designed to do it properly; we can collect and consume prana. "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION Prana is the fuel that will drive us to awakening. It is the breath of life connecting our dimensional cons ciousness to our present one. When we consume enough, we can do amazing paranormal things, things that I probably should not write down. These paranormal feats are achieved when our cons ciousness is at the proper tonal and one is able to understand them. This is why I frequently urge the pursuit of paranormal abilities. The drive to achieve them will activate the sixth sense, which will enable a bridge to the dimensional consciousness and ultimately accelerate awakening. It is all connected. The process of awakening requires two primary ingredients, first we must maintain a state of c onsciousness that uses our sixth sense, and second we need prana. Both aspects are the core of my meditation technique. One must also have the right intent and understanding. This book will help with that understanding.

It will correct a common misunderstanding about the sixth sens e and mystical experiences. It is not enough to go out and do an y old meditation, as there are so many different kinds. Many people who dedicate their whole lives to meditation have only mastered their brain and body, never even beginning to bridge into the spir itual. Most have never found the missing link. "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"MULTI-DIMENSIONAL MEDITATION This is one of the reasons why so many people get frustrated with meditation. We have ignored the importance of the sixth sense and the pursuit of metaphysical experien ces. If only they had a key to activate their sixth sense, they would see the payoff for their time spent meditating! Spending time meditating without de veloping the sixth sense is like building a space shuttle in your front yard and only thinking it is a picnic table. Can you imagine if someone came over and said, ‘You know what you could do with this...’ and then showed you how to fire up the engines and blast off into space! Meditating without a system to ac tivate the sixth sense is like a nice, calm, relaxing picnic table. You have no idea what you can really do with it. BEYOND THE BRAIN When I mention the space shuttle, it may lead many people to wonder about meditation technology. Tools that promise awakening or spiritual improve ment, light and sound machines, binaural technology, or anything that simulates the physical processes that occur during meditation can be worthwhile in the beginning.

There are many other be neficial physical responses to meditation, which we will not disc uss here. Available meditation technology is only effective for tr iggering some of the physical responses from the body. Beyond that, their use is limited. Until we direct our consciousness to awaken, we will be dependent upon our five mundane senses to interpret experiences. The reason most people find it difficu lt to direct the consciousness toward awakening is that they have no idea what that is. It is true that we know we are looking for something. If we only had, at least, an idea of what it is, we would probably find it a lot faster! When we use technology we may feel less st ress, improved memory and other benefits, gained from the physical responses to meditation, all of which are good. How will we move beyond that and into something more? No matter how stimulated our brains become we must have a direction to discover what we are looking for. Technology can only stimulate or ai d our five senses because it works on a physical level. By itself, any technology cannot gi ve us that final missing piece that will lead to awak ening.

It just cannot do it by itself. The brain holds us back from being dimensionally open and having spiritual experiences. Our first challenge then, is to ove rcome the barriers within our own brain. Once we do this, we must al so master a specific state of mind, a fluidic consciousness. Th at is what prevents us from affecting the Matrix or the collective grid of reality and that is what I help people with. It is not a thing, it is not a sentence, and it is not a word. It is a place of ex isting and a means of operating from that place. Think about what I just said. It is a place of existi ng and a means of operating from that place. It is a place of consciousness and it is dimensional. All of the miracles from Buddha to Milarepa originate from this place, this state of mind, this consciousne ss. My meditation will help you discover this along with many othe r things. It will bind body, brain and soul together. It wi ll allow you to harmonize and allow your dimensional consciousness to work through you. To make that bridge, and I ca nnot stress this enough, you must have energy or prana and gaini ng prana requires awareness. If you are not aware of prana, how can you ever get it?

If you are not thinking about it or it is not pa rt of your awareness you simply drink it and swallow it and it does not occur to you that there is a flavor, unless it is strong. You cr eate a certain sensitivity, to find what you are looking for. Meditation will give you that sensitivity. My meditation system will magnify that sensitivity far beyond normal as it heightens the sixth sense. It teaches you to notice subtle things. It allows you to dist ill these very fine sensations. It allows you to collect energy, there by raising your vibration. My system disciplines your brain, so th at it can properly bridge to your dimensional mind. If you do not discipline the brain, it quickly takes control again, even after a profound realization. Anyone who has ever tried any kind of meditation knows this and everybody forgets this. For that reason one must be consiste nt with their practice. Consistent meditation will also make you feel very positive and very happy. People tell me the best moments th ey experience and the best days of their lives are when they are meditating regularly and they are immersed in life, not trapped in some isolated monastery.

Really, it is the cells that are burning, not you. The information is going from the affected cells to a higher place. The cells are sharing this information with you. The cell understands the information, the organism knows the information, and it gives you a carbon copy of it. We are all cells giving to the consciousness of the planet.

You must shift your present consci ousness into higher vibrations. It must match the vibration of your dimensional consciousness. Your dimensional consciousness is who you really are.

We are more than they were. The av erage education and maturity of a fifth grader could be comparable to the maturity of someone twice their age a thousand years ago. We are living in a much highe r evolutionary state. The human body is creating and forging a true soul, not just a vision. Our concept of the soul has evolved through churches, religions, and philosophies. Now we desire to create a true soul.
