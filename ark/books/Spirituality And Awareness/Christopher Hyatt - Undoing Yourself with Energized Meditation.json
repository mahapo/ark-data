Nonetheless, as all students of history know, Christianity has been the bloodiest and most destructive religion in the long career of fanaticism on this planet; although Liberals and Rationalists keep reminding us of that tragic record of the Religion of Love, few of them have cared to observe or remember the data on warfare collected by Harvard sociologist, Prof. Pitrim Sorokin. In Social and Cultural Dynamics, and other works, Sorokin documents beyond all doubt that democratic nations have been involved in more imperialistic wars, and have fought them with greater ferocity, than any other kinds of governments, from the dawn of civilization to the present. Oriental despotisms, absolute monarchies, even modern fascist and communist nations have all had heinous records of tyranny and general human oppression, but collectively they have been much less aggressive and war-like than the democracies, from ancient Athens to modern America. The blood-thirsty nature of Christianity and Democracy — which is obvious, psychologically, if one listens even for a few minutes to a typical speech by Rev. Jerry Falwell or his good friend Ronald Reagan — is, of course, based on arrogance, megalomania and a deep- rooted sense of total moral superiority to all non-Christian and non-Democratic peoples. But beyond that, the violent nature of Christian/Democratic countries is rooted in the singular delusion shared by both the Religion of Love and the Politics of Liberty. This iii"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"iv    Robert Anton Wilson delusion is the belief that human beings are born with some sort of metaphysical \"free will\" which makes them unique in the animal kingdom and only slightly less exalted than the gods themselves. The \"free will\" fantasy is not a minor error, like thinking it is Tuesday when actually it is Wednesday. It is not even to be compared to a major intellectual blunder of the ordinary sort, like Marx's notion that once a totalitarian \"worker's state\" was created, it would then quickly and magically \"wither away.\" It is even more nefarious and pernicious than the medieval lunacy that imagined witches everywhere and burned over 10,000,000 women at the stake on the basis of hysteria, superstition and the kind of hearsay and rumor that no modern court would permit to be entered as evidence. The \"free will\" delusion is much more serious than any of that. It is the kind of radical 180-degree reversal of reality that, once it enters a person's mind, guarantees that they will be incapable of understanding anything happening around them; they might as well be deaf, dumb, blind and wearing signs warning the world, \"ULTIMATE DESTINA- TION: THE MADHOUSE.\" I do not speak flippantly, nor do I mean to be understood as writing satire or polemic. The facts of modern biology and psychology have demonstrated clearly and conclusively that 99 percent of the human race is in a robotic or zombi-like state 99.99999 percent of the time. This does not refer to \"other people.\" It refers to YOU AND ME. As the Firesign Theatre used to say, We're all Bozos on this bus. The best that can be said of any of us, usually, is that we have occasional moments of lucidity, but that can be said of any schizophrenic patient. EAST, WEST AND THE MIDDLE In the Orient, which has its own idiocies and superstitions, there has always been a singular sanity about the \"free will\" myth: virtually without exception, all the great Oriental philosophers have recognized that donkeys, grass-hoppers, dolphins, toads, humming- birds, dogs, chickens, tigers, sharks, gophers, spiders, chimpanzees, cobras, cows, lice, squid, deer, and humans are equally important, equally unimportant, equally empty, equally expressive of the \"World Soul\" or \"Life Force.\" Buddhism, Vedanta and Taoism also recognize that each of these clever animals just mentioned, including"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson     v the humans, have about equally as much \"free will\" as flowers, shrubs, rocks and viruses, and that the human delusion of being separate from and superior to the rest of the natural order is a kind of narcissistic self-hypnosis. Awakening from that egotistic trance is the major goal of every Oriental system of psychology. Opposing this Oriental recognition of, and submission to, the order of things as they are, and yet opposing also the Christian and Democratic delusions of \"free will\" and \"individual responsibility,\" there is the hidden tradition of Sufism in Islam and Hermeticism in Europe. This \"occult\" teaching recognizes that, although domesticated primates (humans) are born as mechanical as the wild primates (such as chimpanzees), there are techniques by which we can become less mechanical and approximate in daily and yearly increments toward freedom and responsibility. These \"spiritual\" (neurological) techniques of Un-doing and re- robotizing oneself are, of course, of no interest in the Orient, where it is accepted that we are born robots and will die robots; and they are of even less interest in the Christian-Democratic cultures which assume that we are already free and responsible and do not have to work and work HARD to achieve even a small beginning of non- mechanical consciousness and non-robotic behavior. The Orient forgives easily, because it does not expect robots to do anything else but what was programmed into them by the accidents of heredity and environment. The Christian and Democratic nations are so bloody-minded because they can forgive nothing, blaming every man and woman for whatever imprinted or conditioned behavior is locally Taboo. (This is why Nietzsche called Christianity \"the Religion of Revenge\" and Joyce described the Christian God as a Hanging Judge.) The Sufic and Hermetic traditions are almost Oriental in forgiving robots for being robots, but are far from sentimental about it. As one Sufi poet said: The fool neither forgives nor forgets; The half-enlightened forgive and forget; The Sufi forgives but does not forget. That is, Sufism and other Hermetic traditions recognize that robots will behave like robots, and does not \"blame\" them, but it also does not forget, for a moment or even a nanosecond, that we are living in a robotic world — \"an armed madhouse\" in the metaphor of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"poet Allen Ginsberg. Those of this tradition know that when a man spouts Christian and Democratic verbalisms that does not mean he will act with brotherly love at all, at all; he will go on acting like a badly-wired robot in most cases. Sufism is only the largest of several Near Eastern and European \"mystic\" movements which recognize the robotry of ordinary humanity but, unlike the Orient, attempt to Un-do and de-robotize those who have a dawning apprehension of their mechanical state and sincerely want to become less mechanical, as far as that is possible. I am not writing a recruiting manual for Sufism (which is doing quite well without my advertisements): I am merely using the Sufi school as one example of the tradition to which this marvelous book, UNDOING YOURSELF, belongs. Most readers, if they have encountered such ideas at all, probably identify them with Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, two of the most talented expositors of a school of neo-Sufism which they peddled under the brand name of \"Esoteric Christianity.\" The present book also owes a great deal to Aleister Crowley, who belonged to this tradition but sold his own brand of it under the label of Gnostic Magick. There is also a strong influence here of the bio-psychology of Wilhelm Reich; but all this tracing of \"sources\" is ultimately trivial. The importance of Christopher Hyatt's work is what you can get out of it and that depends entirely on what you put into it. IT WORKS, IF YOU WORK In my travels, I often encounter people who somehow have gotten the wild idea that I am the Head of the Illuminati (actually, I am at most a toe-nail) and who want me to explain the Secrets of High Magick to them. (Although it is hard to restrain my sense of humor at such times, I usually resist the temptation to tell them they can achieve Total Illumination by singing \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" in pig Latin while standing on their heads.) The questions I am asked most often, by those who can ask something more specific than \"What is The Secret?\" are almost always about Crowley's doctrine of the True Will. People tell me, most earnestly, that they have read ten or twenty or more of Crowley's books, and have read them many times, and still do not understand what \"True Will\" means. Robert Anton Wilson vi"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson    vii As Gurdjieff would say, \"What does this question signify? It signifies that these people are walking in their sleep and only dreaming they are awake. That is what this question signifies.\" There is only one possible reason why people can read Crowley at length and not understand what True Will means. That reason seems incredible at first sight, but it is the only reason that can explain this astounding scotoma. The reason many readers of Crowley do not understand True Will is that these earnest students have never performed any of the exercizes that Crowley provides for those who sincerely want to de-robotize themselves and experience what is meant by True Will. Shortly after my manual of de-mechanization exercizes, Prometheus Rising, was published, I was at a Cosmic Con with, among others, E.J. Gold of the Fake Sufi School. He told me that nobody would do any of the exercizes in my book, but I would still get lots of letters from people saying the book had \"liberated\" them. Since I sometimes think Sufis and even Fake Sufis are perhaps overly skeptical about humanity in its present evolutionary stage, I have made a point of asking people, when they praise that book in my presence, how many of the exercizes they've done. Most people look faintly abashed and admit they have only done a \"few\" of the exercizes (which probably means they haven't done any). However, some people claim to have done all or most of the exercizes, and these people generally look so delighted about the matter that I tend to believe them. I therefore conclude that the Sufi and Gurdjieff traditions are wrong in saying that 999 out of 1000 will never work on the techniques of liberation. Actually, it appears to be only around 987 out of 1000 who prefer to talk about the work rather than doing it. At least 13 out of every 1000 will actually do the exercizes. I have decided that one of the reasons that most readers of self- liberation books never even make the effort to liberate themselves is that reading the books is actually a kind of superstitious \"magick ritual,\" which they think will have an effect with no other effort on their parts. The same sort of superstition leads others to think that peeking at the answers in the back of the book of logical puzzles is as beneficial as solving the puzzles for themselves; and there is even a text out now with the answers to Zen koans, as if the answers, and not the process of arriving at them, were the meaning of Zen. Aside from such \"symbolic magick\" (as distinguished from real"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"magick ritual, which is a type of Brain Change experiment), the main reason people prefer to read neurological exercizes rather than doing the exercizes is the dread and sheer horror which the word \"work\" invokes in most people. Some great teachers, especially Gurdjieff and Crowley, have literally frightened away thousands of would-be students by insisting on the necessity of HARD WORK (as I also frightened a lot of readers by using those words several times in this essay.) Of course, there is a quite legitimate reason why the word \"work\" has such horrible conditioned associations for most people in the modern world. That reason is that most \"work\" in this age is stupid, monotonous, brain-rotting, irritating, usually pointless and basically consists of the agonizing process of being slowly bored to death over a period of about 40 to 45 years of drudgery; Marx was quite right in calling it \"wage slavery.\" Most people know this, but are afraid to admit it, because to dislike \"work\" is regarded as a symptom of Communism or some other dreadful mental illness. I recently heard a politician admit on BBC that the reason English workers are so notoriously \"lazy\" is that their jobs are so unspeakably sub-human and dull. \"If I had to do that kind of work, I would call in sick as often as possible and goof off at every chance,\" he said flatly. Alas, I had tuned in late and never did catch this chap's name, which is a terrible misfortune for me, since I suspect he is the only Honest Politician in the world. It is this universal but repressed hatred of \"work\" that causes almost everybody to despise and persecute the unemployed. Almost everybody envies the folks of the dole (on Welfare, as you say in The States) because almost everybody secretly wishes they could escape their own jobs and live without working. It has taken me decades to understand this, because I am part of that very fortunate minority who work at jobs we actually enjoy. (It is hard to make me stop working, as my wife will assure you.) The minority who actually loves its work seems to be made up chiefly of the writers, dancers, actors and other artists, most scientists above the technician-troll level, computer freaks, and the righteous dope- dealers of California. Everybody else wishes they had the courage to go on the dole, but is ashamed of the stigma attached to being a non-worker, and resolves the tension by being as nasty as possible to the unemployed on every possible occasion. Robert Anton Wilson viii"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson ix HEY! CATCH THIS! A SECRET OF THE ILLUMINATI REVEALED! Here I want to let you in on a real Secret of the Illuminati, one that has never been published before. The so-called \"work\" involved in Brain Change is not like ordinary \"work\" at all. It is more like the creative ecstasy of the artist and scientist, once you really get involved in doing it. Most people are afraid of it only because they think \"work\" must be a curse and can't imagine that \"work\" can be fun. So it is best not to think of Energized Meditation as \"work\" at all, at least as you have experienced \"work\" in most of the world today. It might be better and more accurate to consider the EM exercizes as \"play\" than as \"work.\" Of course, play has its own rigours, and you do have to put energy into it to become a winner rather than a perpetual loser, but it is still entirely unlike the wage slavery that most people call \"work.\" In fact, to be blunt about it, it is more like sex-play than any other kind of play because it definitely unleashes energies that have erotic as well as therapeutic side-effects. You are a dunce if you avoid it just because you think anything that needs effort must be \"work\" in the sense that people in factories and offices are suffering from the curse of \"work\" in our society. Think of it more in terms of your favorite sport or recreation— fishing or bird-watching or softball or whatever you do with passion and just for the excitement of it. If that kind of thing should not be called \"play,\" then I do not know what \"play\" means. So when I wrote \"Hard Work,\" I was just trying to jar you into actually paying attention for once. I really should have said, for accuracy, Hard Play. The second part of this Secret of the Illuminati is what I have called elsewhere Wilson's 23rd Law. (Wilson's First Law, of course, is \"Certitude belongs exclusively to those who only own one encyclo- pedia.\" Wilson's Second Law is the Snafu Principle described in ILLUMINATUS: \"Communication is only possible between equals.\" All of Wilson's Laws will be published when the world is ready for the staggering revelations contained therein.) Wilson's 23rd Law is Do it every day"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"This is the most profound of all the Secrets of the Illuminati and I have often been warned that Terrible Consequences will ensue if I reveal it prematurely, but—what the hell, these are parlous times, friend, and this primitive planet needs all the Light that can be unleashed on its dark, superstitious mind. Let me repeat, since I am sure you didn't get it the first time: Do it every day! Have you ever wondered why Einstein became such a great physicist? It was because he loved the equations and concepts of mathematical physics so much that he \"worked\" on them—or played and tinkered with them—every day. That's why Otto von Klemper became such a great conductor: he loved Beethoven and Mozart and that crowd so much that he practised his music every day. It's why Babe Ruth became such a great ball-player: he loved the game so deeply that he was playing or rehearsing every day. This rule also explains, incidentally, how people destroy themselves. Do you want to become a suicide (it's the fashionable thing in some circles, after all)? Practise being depressed, worried and resentful every day, and don't let anybody distract you with Energized Meditation or any other mind-change system. Do you want to land in jail on an assault and battery charge? Practise getting damned bloody angry every day. If you want to become paranoid, look carefully every day for evidence of treachery and duplicity around you. If your ambition is to die young, do the depression-worry- resentment system every day but center in especially on visualizing and worrying about every imaginable illness that might possibly inflict itself upon you. (On the other hand, if you want to live as long as George Burns, \"work hard\" every day at being as cheerful and optimistic as he is.) Almost anything is possible if you DO IT EVERY DAY Of course, this rule does not guarantee 100 percent results. Playing Chopin on the piano every day for 4 or 5 decades does not mean you will become as good as Van Cliburn; it merely means that you eventually will be a better piano player than anybody in your home state. Worrying every day does not absolutely guarantee a clinical depression or an early death, but after only a few years it does Robert Anton Wilson x"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson    xi ensure you will be one of the three or four most miserable people in your neighborhood. Writing a sonnet every day for twenty years may not necessarily make you Shakespeare or Mrs. Browning, but it will make you the best poet for an area of about forty to fifty miles, probably. Doing Energized Meditation or similar exercizes does not mean you will be a Perfectly Enlightened Being or a Guru in a few years, just that you will be a great deal happier and a hell of a lot more perceptive, creative and \"intuitive\" than most people you'll meet in an average city. There is a story that Bobbie Fisher, the chess champion, was once in a room with other chess masters when the conversation turned to the latest nuclear accident and the effects of the resultant fall-out. Fisher listened impatiently for a few minutes and then exclaimed irritably, \"What the hell does that have to do with chess?\" While I am not urging that you imitate that degree of monomania or obsession, there is a significant lesson in this tale. The reason Fisher became a champion is that he cared so much about chess that he did not even have to nag himself or remind himself to do it every bloody day. WARNING! THREATS TO THE PRIMATE EGO ARE COMING! Unfortunately—while the Energized Meditation system is fun, and erotic, and makes you \"smarter\" (in the sense of more aware of detail and complexity), and even jolts you out of total mammalian reflex behavior into something approximating in slow but definite increments toward that mystic \"free will\" Christians claim you were given at birth, and I recommend it heartily—I must admit that there are pages coming up shortly in this book that will probably make you extremely uncomfortable. Dr. Hyatt is a rude, insulting and deliberately annoying writer. He does not soothe or pacify the reader with the Christian and Democratic mythology of our society by pretending that we are all free and rational people here. He insists on reminding us, every few pages, in the most blunt language possible, that most of us most of the time are conditioned chimpanzees in a cage."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xii    Robert Anton Wilson Don't let it worry you too much. The situation is this: there are mechanical systems operating throughout the domesticated primate (human) organism, each on different levels. For instance, as Bucky Fuller liked to say, you never sit down and ask how many hairs you should sprout on your head and body in the next week: that is one of the thousands of biological programs that operate entirely on mechanical circuitry. Except in various systems of yoga, you do not have much control over your breathing, either: that is also an auto-pilot. The digestive-excretive circuits also operate with a minimum of conscious attention or strategy, except when you need to find a public toilet and the bars are all closed. (Make a list of ten more programs that keep you alive and functioning, over which you have never had any conscious control. Be one of the 13 readers out of a thousand who actually do it before reading on.) The reason that mystics and certain other psychologists are always \"attacking\" the ego is that the ego is the one mechanical circuit that suffers chronically from the illusion that it is non-mechanical and \"free.\" The ego and its delusions must be undermined—either attacked openly and bluntly, as in the Gurdjieff system and this book, or subverted more subtly and slowly, as in certain other systems— before any real progress can be made toward \"liberation,\" \"enlighten- ment,\" \"finding IT,\" discovering the \"True Will\" in Crowley's sense, or whatever is your favorite term for becoming less robotic and more aware—less the computer and more the programmer of the computer— less the conditioned rat in the Behaviorist's maze and more the Beyond-Human that the Sufic-Hermetic traditions and Neitzsche have predicted. The main reason you shouldn't be afraid of this attack on your precious little ego is that the ego is infinitely resourceful and finds ways to sneak back into its habitual mechanical trance no matter how many times you think you have Awakened once and for all. This is another Secret of the Illuminati and explains the great humility and the keen sense of humor of all the genuine Mages. In other words, if you think it is scary to lose your precious primate ego abruptly and forever, don't worry about that; it is no more likely than becoming the world's greatest Rock star tomorrow morning. The only real way to get loose from mechanical ego trips is to learn"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson    xiii several ego-transcending games and then for twenty or forty years or longer DO THEM EVERY DAY Before you put that much effort and time into it, you need not worry that your wonderful, precious and totally marvelous Ego will go away suddenly, it will merely get transformed a bit, \"enlarged\" in perspective and \"reduced\" in conceit (a little), freed from some of its more idiotic habits, and it will even pretend to go away at times, but it will always come back and usually at the most embarrassing times. It's easier to assassinate the President of the United States than to kill your own ego. 500 micrograms of pure Sandoz LSD will \"destroy\" the ego more totally than any of the EM exercizes in this book—atom bomb it out of existence, as it were. The results even in that case, as all old acid-heads will assure you, are, however spectacular, always temporary. As Dr. John Lilly wrote in Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer, after a heavy trip on genuine laboratory Acid, For a time, the self then feels free, cleaned out. The strength gained can be immense; the energy freed is double . . . Humor appears in abundance, good humor... Beauty is enhanced, the bodily appearance becomes youthful . . . These positive effects can last as long as two to four weeks before reassertion of the old programs takes place. We are the products of mechanical genetic programs, mechanical imprints and mechanical conditioning, just like the other animals. The progress to post-animal, non-mechanical and trans-ego freedom is often rapidly accelerated for a period, or several periods, of sudden flash-like Awakenings and post-human perspectives, and I personally suspect that is happening increasingly under the stress of our age of terrorism and accelerated evolutionary change, but the ultimate result of a true transcendence of robot consciousness is approached in slow increments over years and decades. (Total \"freedom\" from mechanism on all circuits seems impossible to me, in my current level of ignorance. I don't think the organism would survive if most of it did not remain a smooth-running and unconscious machine.) E.J. Gold of the Fake Sufi School, mentioned earlier, has a saying to the effect that the attempt to achieve total Transcendence of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xiv    Robert Anton Wilson mechanical ego programs is as absurd as \"sticking toothpicks between your eyelids to be sure you never go to sleep for a moment.\" There seem to be genuine biological reasons why we need to spend about one third of our lives asleep and a large part of the other two-thirds half-entranced by mechanical conditioned processes. The purpose of all schools of liberation is to wake up fully often enough to have some perspective outside the sleeping and conditioned ego states. WHAT \"IS\" ALL THIS? The great Dublin scientist and philosopher, de Selby, once took an empty jam jar and filled it with all the small cruddy items he could find around the house. The fuzz that accumulates on carpets, the dust on book shelves, bent paperclips, broken staples, the grunge from bathtub rings, grotty kitchen encrustations, nameless shards of forgotten plaster statues long broken, archaeological excavations from the cellar, miscellaneous delvings in the rubbish bin, torn covers of match books scrawled with inscrutable phone numbers, even belly-button lint, all went in. This was a labour of some weeks, and when it was finished even de Selby himself could not remember or classify the total contents of the jar. He then selected a statistical universe of 123 Dubliners and 246 visitors form England or the Continent just off the Dun Laoghaire ferry and asked each to guess what the jar contained. 77.6 percent of the sample answered at once, \"Oh, I know, it is \" and then made some wild guess. (The most common guess, given by 54.3 percent, was that it \"was\" the stuff mixed into the curry sauce in Pakistani restaurants. Others commonly said it \"was\" uranium ore, wood cement and tree bark.) Of the 22.4 percent who did not guess what it \"was,\" 83.5 percent immediately asked the directions to Clontarf Castle and presumably did not want to guess because they were in hurry to catch the evening Musical show. De Selby concluded that most Europeans, at this stage of evolution, believe that everything and anything can meaningfully be described in a simple proposition in the form, \"This is a thingamajig.\" I believe, on the basis of experience, that similar results would be found in an American sample of the same size. We are still haunted"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson xv by the ghost of Aristotle, the bloke who first tried to describe and explain the whole universe in permutations of sentences having the form, This is a Y, All Z are Y, Some Y are X, therefore some Z are X. Most people, and especially most politicians and clergymen, remain firmly convinced that anything and everything can be meaningfully discussed in that Aristotelian manner—or as Ernest Fenollosa once said, Western culture thinks that \"A ring-tailed baboon is not a Constitutional Assembly\" is one of the two types of meaningful statements (the other being \"The U.S. Congress and U.K. Parliament are Constitutional Assemblies.\") From the point of view of current science, c. 1980-87, there appear to be two things wrong with this Aristotelian mind-set. In the first place, scientific models are not expressed in this metaphor of identity (A is a B) but in the functional language of relationships (When A moves an increment of x in any dimension, B will move an increment of y in some other dimension.) The latter type of functional statement allows for scientific predictions, which can be partially verified or totally refuted by experience and experiment; the former, Aristotelian type of is-ness statement leads only to verbal argument. The second objection to Aristotelian A is a B statements is that they appear totally contradicted by neurology and experiments with instruments. Neurologically, we never know what A \"is,\" but what it appears to our senses and brain. The senses pick up some (not all) the signals of the space-time event and the brain edits and orchestrates these signals into some familiar Gestalt. (This seems to be how de Selby's subjects edited and orchestrated a jar full of junk into Pakistani sauce or uranium ore.) Instrumentally, the same editing goes on. An instrument does not tell us what A \"is\" but what class of signals from A that particular instrument can measure.

To speak accurately, we should never say \"This 'is' an A,\" but, rather, \"This seems to fit the category of A in my system of glossing or in this instrument's reality-tunnel.\" Does this sound like pedantry or unnecessary hair-splitting?

Most of the guilt and \"chronic low-grade emergency\" (as Fritz Perls called it) which keeps you from realizing your full potential can usually be traced to some sentence having the form \"I am a B\" in which B equals roughly \"no-good shit.\" That sentence got conditioned into you when you were very young and you may not think it consciously any more, or you may well think it and even say it aloud frequently, but if you feel basically unhappy with your life some such sentence exists somewhere in your brain. Even is-ness sentences that seem factual contain dangers due to the mechanical-conditioned level of most human consciousness on this planet at this time. \"He is a homosexual\" may appear a safe remark when heard in a Group Encounter session, or at a San Francisco cocktail party, but in the Bible Belt, \"homosexual\" contains the conditioned association of \"sinner\" and particularly nefarious \"sinner\" at that, and it is not unknown for violence or even murder to result from this is-ness sentence, just as \"Jew\" seems to be a neutral label for one of three major religions of the West but in Nazi Germany signified somebody subject to arrest, slave labor and eventual execution. I read recently in a science-fiction fan magazine, \"The Irish really are disgusting.\" Leaving aside my own mechanical prejudices (as a person of partially Irish genetic structure who lives by preference in Ireland) the most fascinating thing about this is-ness statement seems to me that it occurred in a publication where one would never see such semantically isomorphic statements as \"The Jews really are sub-human\" or \"Women really are inferior to men.\" To quote Mr. G. again, \"What does this signify? It signifies that most people are walking in their sleep and dreaming they are awake.\" That is, certain historically infamous types of racial or sexual stereotypes have become unfashionable and virtually Taboo in \"educated\" circles, but the mechanical conditioned reactions"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Robert Anton Wilson     xvii underlying such stereotypes still exist, the machine is still asleep, in Gurdjieff's terms, so people who would not stereotype Jews see nothing inconsistent in stereotyping the Irish or the Poles or some other group. In a mechanical or primitive stage of evolution, this cannot be considered surprising. What does still surprise me (occasionally) is that people who can see this mechanical level of functioning in others can remain blissfully oblivious of the same mechanisms in themselves. One way to understand Energized Meditation, and simultaneously grasp the significance of what I have just been saying about Aristotelian habits, is to apply mathematical subscripts to significant nouns in the manner urged by the semanticist, Alfred Korzybski. For instance, the Nazi mentality consists of something like Now this is obviously false to sensory-sensual space-time experience. In sensory-sensual space-time experience—or what we ordinarily call \"reality\" if we haven't been ruined by philosophy courses—every Jew we meet is a specific event in the space-time continuum. The first may be a poet, the second an actress, the third a grocer, etc. if we place this group in the gloss of category-by-occupation. Put them in the category of good looks, and the first may seem as handsome as Paul Newman, the second as unhandsome as Edward G. Robinson, the third as cute as Barbra Streisand, etc. Put them in any other grid, and differences still emerge, just as there are no two leaves on an oak tree that are exactly the same in all respects. Don't go back to sleep yet; hang in there a moment. We are not preaching a sermon on \"tolerance\" like a 1950s Hollywood movie. We are just using anti-semitism as an example of a mechanical mental set that illuminates many, many other mechanical mental sets that you are going to have to recognize in yourself if Energized Meditation is to do you any good. For instance, at the beginning, for the shock effect, I said some critical things about Christianity and Democracy. If you drew the conclusion that I dislike all aspects of Christian and Democratic society, you had a mechanical \"is\" somewhere in your evaluations.

(That's why one Zen Master always gave the answer \"Attention!\" when he was asked what Zen \"is.\") We started from that unChristian and unDemocratic premise and we have worked our way back to it by a circuitous route, but now perhaps we can see more clearly what this mechanical A=B hypnosis does to us. We have been using examples of difference between elements of the \"same\" group, but no element remains unchanged in time.

If you are more than 20 years old, just think of how absurd it would be to claim that the You of 1986 \"really is\" the You of 1966 ... Think about this seriously. It would be a damned good idea, right now, to make a list of ten important changes that have occurred in \"You\" since 1966 and ten changes since 1976. Is it too much trouble to get a paper and pen?

But somehow meditation is more popular to-day and I fancy practised by more people than ever before in the world's history. My contention is that this is largely due to the psychedelic movement initiated by Aldous Huxley's Doors of Perception and the fantastically pioneering work of Timothy Leary. Posterity, I am certain will have a finer appreciation of what he has contributed to this world than we have today. Meditation is meditation. But there are innumerable techniques for achieving the proper results. One of the most dynamic that has appeared in recent years is not Transcendental Meditation by the grinning-giggling Monkey faced guru, though perhaps this is the most popular, but the so-called chaotic meditation of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. This is the one that really comes nearest to the vital and powerful method described by our author Christopher S. Hyatt. Without equivocation, it can truthfully be stated that this method is by far and away about the best method I have encountered in all my years in both psychotherapy and in the occult world. As Alan Watts pointed out a long time ago, most Western psychotherapy is fundamentally metaphysical—that is it is essentially conceptual and verbal. Whereas Eastern \"psychotherapy\" is more realistically and somatically oriented - viz Yoga in all its facets and branches.

(An unusual and unexpected dichotomy that was first indicated by Alan Watts.) Christopher Hyatt's work is the closest technique to this model. The author has been, amongst many other things, a classical psychologist, a practitioner of Reichian therapy, and a 20 year student of the occult. From years of clinical experience he has distilled the essence of his experience in a most astute and shocking manner. In a fantastically penetrating, humorous and insightful fashion he has also distilled the essential factor in Zen meditative techniques. The result is a meditative system that is wholly unlike any other. Even the design of the book and the way it is presented suggests the purpose of the Great Work. As such it can be altogether recommended to those who have tried all other systems of meditation and found them wanting; their failure can be compensated for and overcome by the use of this extraordinary dynamic approach. I recommend it enthusiastically and without any reservation whatsoever. In fact I am excited and exhilarated by its discovery. It should prove to be the answer to the frustration felt by the thousands and more who have tried the other systems and failed. However, I do warn the reader, if you don't really want to change, don't take this book seriously.

Hyatt, Ph.D. and Baron Peter von Gundlach It has been four years since Undoing Yourself was released and approximately two years since the first edition was sold out. The book was not reissued until now because I was in a moral dilemma concerning the message contained in this work. It is suggestive as well, that agents in both Israel and Germany requested copies of this book for possible translation. However, after further reading, both withdrew their requests. This also contributed to my hesitance to re-publish the work. Many dear friends and associates made suggestions as to what I should do regarding the criticisms levelled at this book. I listened to all that was said and waited until the right moment, which is now, to answer both the attacks and the compliments. The primary attack came from the intellectual community. This of course is to be expected. Their attitude was one of abhorrence that such a work could be published at all. Specifically, they felt that the book was \"disgusting\" irrelevant and down right \"stupid.\" What they found disgusting, was the \"irrelevant\" pictures, the \"provocative and hostile\" writing style and the \"stupid\" content. Some of these critics simply felt pity, since they assumed the author was \"justly\" uneducated. Others were shocked at the revelation that the author held three advanced degrees and was finishing a fourth. Some suggested that the meditation technique (\"which might be the xxiii"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xxiv    Hyatt and von Gundlach only thing of value\") be published by itself and the rest buried somewhere out of smell and sight. I pondered this and said no! . I then asked myself what was so terrible about this book? The answer I found was that it attacked the channelization process of the biological imperative, (those of nesting, digesting and congesting, or to say it more correctly, housing, eating, and making babies) and that it exposed the hypocrisy that exists between what the intellect says and what the body does. That is, it challenged the so-called idealism, the hypocritical screen, between ideas and actions, but more importantly it elevated biology over culture. As the title of this book implies Undoing Yourself With Energized Meditation and Other Devices is a workbook of emancipation and not a collection of ideas to be perused by smug dilettantes. These critics, who profit from the system they endorse, protect and maintain, which even they admit feeds on the surpluses of social inequities, are simultaneously condemning it in lecture and writing as they blissfully enjoy its fruits. These are the most vociferous assailants of this book. Why? The answer is simple. This is a book on psycho-social-biology, (or more correctly a spiritual-biology) something which most intellectuals and people in general find abhorrent, for this topic exposes the schizoid foundations of their reality set. Yes, this book is really a disguised text on the fundamental motivation of human existence on this planet. In other words, this book is about the bio-survival of the species and its most observable result—the genetic-class struggle. This book is about power and freedom, something which we all desire, and the lies and \"stories\" which preempt and hoard the truth about how to use this bio-spiritual imperative successfully, profitably and \"decently\". How is this deception accomplished? And more importantly by WHO? THE MALADAPTIVE FALLACY The What and The Who of it! The maladaptive fallacy is based on the assumption that man's nature is inherently flawed. What does this mean? Miss Man aged Man has decided through aeons of self-reflection that what the observer observes (man) is in fact — \"No-Dam-Good.\" This is the indictment — the moral accusation. The followers of this verdict believe that"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Hyatt and von Gundlach     xxv the proof of this is man's own behavior, i.e., wars, dis-obedience to God, class struggle, and an array of similar stupidities. On the other hand, the small voice of his defense whispers that man has also co-operated with the evolutionary imperative for his enlightened self-interest. Some examples are charity, medicine, science, heroism, etc. Which ever tunnel reality they choose to focus on, both are inappropriate since it has been assumed that man is a completed product. What both sides do not see is that mankind is nothing but the result of the trial and error (also known as trial and success) factor of a great bio-spiritual experiment. The problem lies in the fact that \"trial and error\" is the culture that is regarded as more sacrosant than the biology which forms its base. The Relatives of Man The last one hundred years has brought us the theory of relativity — ironically interpreted and used as an absolute. Relativity theory may have done wonders for physics and the other sciences, but it has been mis-used almost everywhere else. People invoke Einstein, the absolute authority, as a defense for their most stupid and ignorant theories and mis-representations of facts. Their logic, if you can call it that goes something like this. \"I invoke the theory of relativity, by the authority of Einstein, to prove that my authority, (and ideas) are as equally valid as anyone else's.\" Most of them never heard of testing their theories in the lab. This sort of non-sense, takes the place of learning and effort. The fortunate thing about this process, however, is that it is a reflection of the rebellion against blind authority, that is authority for authority's sake. Unfortunately, the rebels often justify the need for \"more\" irrational authority, since their—opinions often lack the stuff of which planets are made—they simply want to be the boss. Einstein, I believe would be absolutely appalled by the mis-use of his ideas found in both the soft sciences and the occult. All opinions are not equal. All tunnel realities are not equal, for equality would obviate the necessity for our diversity. Ideas must be left in the form of working hypotheses open to argument, the approximation of the truth found by the process of experimentation. Man must be left free to conduct his experiments unhampered by the mere conventions of culture.

While the present author is also guilty of clap-trap, he does take immense pride in the fact, that on occasion, he is aware of his right hand pulling the wool over his left eye. DEATH HAS BEEN CONQUERED! NOW WHAT? (Sir! In what newspaper did you read that?) (Hey! I didn't read it — I thought it! Aren't Thoughts Reality?) (Answer! It depends on who is doing the thinking and how much ability they have to make it real.) FUTANT-MUTANTS LIKE IDEAS THAT WORK! When death is conquered then what? Why do I ask this question at this point of the discourse? The answer! Most of the clap-trap surrounds our own sense of impermenance. We explain ourselves away, with words of Karma, reincarnation, etc., which for the life of me, (this life that is) the time would better be spent in the laboratory of life seeking results. In other words let God worry about His experiments, and you worry about your own! Theories about what God is doing and why, are nothing but an ointment heated by the frustration of our helplessness in accepting our present fate — FRUSTRATION & DEATH! A solution to this struggle is simply to locate your part of the drama and fulfill it. That is find your true will and follow it to the end. Struggle is the crux of life. However, do not despair at this word, for it is through this almost never-ending parade of frustration, that the true Man emerges as Hero. While some of you may not think so, cessation from struggle is death. The Buddha said, \"if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.\" Did he say that? Why do you think man is always facing a new problem? Man is a problem-solver, this is his life's blood, his holiness if you would. No other animal is in an almost continuous state of dissatisfaction, no matter how much and how great his accomplishments. There will be no final rest from this process, no Utopia, thank God, for then it would be over once and for all. Challenge is always on the horizon, and it is built into our DNA, or biology.

For example, is the idea of tunnel reality, a tunnel reality, or is it a meta-tunnel reality, etc. Labelling something or a process does not always free one from its effects. We are all on the front lines of life and death. Take it very seriously because it is happening right now in front of and in you. But do not forget to laugh, lest you miss the point. THE SPECIFICS Let us begin with nesting (housing). In all instances, a place to live, a shelter is a biological essential, be it a mansion, cave, tree, or a space on the ground. A shelter requires a site. Space or location for the shelter necessitates territory. Thus, the biological essential, shelter, requires territory. As space begins with the body, its extension symbolized by shelter and territory, is an expansion of the body boundary. Hence tactileness; our perceptions of heat and cold, wet and dry, privacy and exposure or, in other words, pain and pleasure. The skin is the psycho-physical barrier between our personal and public selves. The skin, if you would, is the sensate membrane of how we know who, what and where we are, and what we are doing. The body, the skin, represents both our individuality which we cherish, and at the same time our vulnerability which we abhor. Thus public exposure regardless of form is always a threat, be it spatial or psychological. In other words, we are always scared of each other. As long as our biology demands our survival, our primary mode of operation is fear. However, we are deliberately made unaware of this, or told that our anxieties are abnormal. In fact our anxieties are the most normal things about us and are the fuel and engine from which society and culture are built. We have been told to reject our biology, particularly by those who demand more territory for their own biological safety. (\"Paranoia will destroy ya.\") Society is structured in order to implement and exploit the product of the \"maladaptive fallacy.\" The maladaptive fallacy is the assumption that man is flawed and evil. In order to correct our \"pathology\" we have military, police, psychologists, sociologists, university professors, physicians, priests, politicians and their ilk whose \"soul\" purpose is to mold us into productive agents for their employment, allowing us to accumulate possessions which will be re-distributed through acts of violence and war."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"xxviii Hyatt and von Gundlach In other words the \"original sin\" is nothing but the \"original lie\". Taking the byte from the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge at the suggestion of the Serpent of the DNA, was a window of opportunity offered to mankind to accept his true nature — that of the experimenter. That this has been historically mis-represented as anathema to spirituality was the first great lie and subversion of our Godly or true purpose of existence. It precipitated our expulsion from our natal territory, the Garden of Eden — our biology. In other words, what has been called the lowly in us is actually the exalted. Our territoriality or our biology is not the cause of our misery, it is the rejection and denial of it which therefore results in its perverted and dangerous expression. The founding fathers of America, an \"occult group\", was deeply aware of this and tried to make allowances for our most primary and basic genetic tendencies. What has been labelled our animal nature is in reality the image of God in which we were created. Our natural desire for terror—Tory has brought about not only wars through its perversion, but has brought about every major and minor convenience; medical and technological breakthroughs from penicillin to spaceships. These discoveries are designed to help us improve our nesting, digesting and congesting. Anxiety then is a normal and biological necessity. Anxiety is always related to territory (our location in space-time.) It is of more than passing interest to note that the population of mental institutions is lowest from the transitions of peace to war and of war to peace. That is, anxiety which is based on territory, results in less mental disturbance during territorial shifts. Institutionalization arises during periods of non-territorial shifts or more correctly during territorial-anxietal stasis. The desire and concern for territory is a primary and functional biological need hard wired into the neuro-genetic system. The channelization of this need, i.e. how it is expressed, is the function of culture, which is nothing more than biology's interaction with geography thus forming a bio-culture feedback loop which feeds on and digests itself. Thus, the primacy of HOW (culture) is substituted for the primacy of WHAT and WHY (territory and biologic-motivation). Therefore our measure of worth is based on the value, size, and location of our monuments, edifices and estates, and rituals (such as weddings, funerals, and confirmations) which we can identify as our personal territory or genetic mandate. This is our zone of safety,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Hyatt and von Gundlach xxix which is only natural and proper. What is not natural and proper is that we are told that we should feel guilty for this desire, thus forcing us to become as schizoid as our mentors. Wars therefore are not a result of territoriality, but a cause of dis-placed motivation. Instead of territoriality being our great despair, it is in fact our great hope. The reader may ask, then, why do we find a book of psycho- social biology on bookshelves which are labelled occult or meditation? The answer is simple. Occult means hidden. Something which is hidden, once exposed, is no longer occult. Like lifting up a rock. What was under the rock was occult, until someone had the courage or curiosity to pick it up. What is still occult for most of us is the neuro-biological connection. Our neuro-biology is our absolute. How we channel this neuro-biology is our relativism. Thus the \"occult\" is that biology and anatomy is destiny, in that order. That is to say, WHAT we do is determined, HOW we do it is relative. We all are born, we all eat, groom, sleep, have sex, require shelter, etc. How we do this determines our class in the structure of society, which is based on presently unalterable biological imperatives. In conclusion of this section the biological is the absolute and the cultural is the relative. We have been taught this fundamental truth in reverse, bacteria is for culture, rather than culture is for bacteria. We revere the cultural and loath the biological. This is both a denial of \"God\" and the source of our potential destruction. Part II DIGESTING When we think of digestion the first thing that comes to mind is the consumption of food, i.e. that which feeds and nourishes us. Consumption takes place before digestion and is involved with an entire cycle of influence and effluence (consumption, digestion, and elimination). Digestion in and of itself is a key, for it tells us that the things of value are automatically taken out by the bodily process and the \"offal\" is eliminated. This natural model must then take the place of our cultural process of consumption, digestion and elimination for its purpose is not to eliminate the unnecessary but to sell it. A story told to us about a study in animal husbandry may help to make the point clearer. Swine were placed in three tiers of cages,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xxx Hyatt and von Gundlach where the pigs in the top cage were fed fresh food, the pigs in the lower cages ate the postdigested excretions of their upper neighbors. The ones that increased their weight most for the volume of substance consumed were those in the middle cages. The conclusions were that those on the top ate well but did not gain as much weight as the ones in the middle. The ones on the bottom faired the worst, though all survived. This provides an interesting model for our cultural \"imperative.\" The middle class takes the refined elements of the wealthy, i.e. products — consumes and over-eats, then distorts and destroys the idea which created the product, and feeds the result (offal) to the lower classes, while at the same time deploring their lowly condition. In other words, ideas and risk create products which are consumed by the middle class in their attempt to mimic the higher classes. This process of vulgarization is paid for by the lower class, which is eternally maintained by the middle classes cult of conformity. The lower classes, the final consumer on the food chain, are also the criminals from which the middle class primarily demands to be protected by the existing machinery of suppression. In other words, the criminal class, (excluding \"white collar criminals\") consisting primarily of the lower classes and minorities, is both created and used by the other classes as justification to protect their perverted and excessive expectations. Again it is important to remember that it is not our biology which is to blame, but rather the lie surrounding it. It is of great interest to note that in Europe there is conscious recognition of the class struggle. In America we insulate ourselves from this dynamic. We shake our head yes to the pain and misery of the less fortunate, while we feather our nests with more and more symbols which serve to reassure us that we have elevated ourselves. The lower classes, like the pigs on the lowest tier, consume what is discarded. Finally, in America the struggle is not really between the lower classes and the upper classes, for they are too far apart. The struggle here is between the middle classes and the lower classes."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Hyatt and von Gundlach    xxxi Part III THE REPRODUCTION BIAS — CONGESTION The Tree of Life as the Genetic Chain The Neuro-Politics of Obsolescence The reproduction bias simply means that the majority of our time and resources is spent on re-assuring the survival of the species. These are called reproduction strategies. The important point is that, while reproduction is in itself absolute, the strategies are relative, and thus open to change. The bias part of the phrase relates to the absolutizing of the relative, a process which the class struggle not only creates but demands. That is we require consumers, upwardly mobile ones, as well as the lower classes who consume the left-over by-product \"offal\" of the reproduction bias. Reproduction is the model of perpetual obsolescence and replace- ment. It is also a form of imagined personal immortality. Reproduction, however, in its grossest sense is entirely impersonal. There is nothing new or unique about having offspring (DNA coils). What is unique in terms of our experience is the territoriality engendered by having offspring. That is they are a part of our body, yet no human invented DNA, nor did any human create the sperm and egg which combined to create a new replacement. In this sense our territorial imperative serves to create a bond. Like everything in the world we too are obsolete, nothing is built to last forever. We are trapped in the model of renewal which we apply to most every facet of our existence. This structures our hierarchy of priorities. Consequently we incorporate aspects of impermanence into the products we build and into the lives we lead. On the other hand we also have the paradox of surrounding ourselves with non- functional objects which represent our wish for permanence such as statues, icons, tomb stones, antique furniture, etc. We do not accept our finiteness with humility. Our daily attitudes towards most relationships and objects are as if we might last forever. The consequence of this is wasteful redundancy in every aspect of our lives, be it economic or psychic. We work all of our lives to re- produce labor saving devices. This play on the words \"labor\" and \"reproduction\" is no accident. The child or baby, as we begin to \"humanize\" our discussion, is an exercise in labor of both male and female. The pain of labor in"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"xxxii    Hyatt and von Gundlach western culture is no accident either. Pain and struggle stimulates a sense of ownership. When we struggle for something we feel we own it. The division of labor between male and female in regards to off-spring production and rearing in and of itself creates a dynamic of conflict between the now new mother and father. By mystifying the entire birth process we provide an elevated meaning which it neither requires nor deserves. This is the process of \"absolutizing the relative and relativizing the absolute.\" The agenda of reproduction for the female is bio-survival security, a guaranteed sanctuary (nest) and a source of income, assured by the male authorities. This agenda is being modified by the new awareness of the women's liberation movement. The emerging matriarchy is attempting to address this issue from a healthier perspective. It suggests the promising beginnings of human liberation, again not from our biology, but from our distortions of it. Its principle slogan being, \"that society, i.e. the patriarchy, no longer owns my body.\" Unfortunately, the consensual cultural program is not impressed, nor has it been significantly altered by this new paradigm. The male justification for the patriarchy is due to the unconscious recognition of his biological expendability as can be easily observed in other species. This attitude of male redundancy prevents women from risking death in most cultures by fighting wars. Women then are protected in many other ways as well, not because they are better, or loved, but because they are believed as essential for the nurturance of the offspring (the new consumer). An obvious example can be demonstrated by society's attitude toward rape victims. The woman is frequently seen as the culprit. The paradox of both protecting the female, as the potential matrix of birth and the degrading attitudes expressed by the patriarchy is a consequence of the subtle view that all humans of the middle and lower classes are chattel, i.e. consumers (part of the food chain). Though democracy offers the illusion of individual participation or effect on the whole, in reality it presents an environment of economic and psychic serfdom. A good mantram upon awakening is to repeat three times, \"Serfs Up.\" P.S. \"And don't forget the bored.\" To return to the main point, any new male or representative of society for that matter can take the place of the genetic father after fertilization. The female's love for the male must be transferred to the developing baby. After birth, the male is primarily unnecessary except as a facilitator of goods and services. This is a cultural fact and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Hyatt and von Gundlach    xxxiii not a biological one. In other words there is nothing wrong with a love shift, what is disturbing is that we are not informed of the natural processes of birth, death and life in general. Biology again has been exploited to serve certain cultural distortions — \"Trials and Errors.\" From the male point of view, the biological reward for reproduction is a pat on the back for having virile sperm and the identification with his genetic offspring. Again the process is personalized beyond the point of necessity simply to satisfy the pride of possession. Time is spent in identifying those physical and character qualities of the offspring which resemble those of the parents. Identifying common genetic characteristics of the infant is done more for the re- assurance of the male, for he can never really know if the child is his in fact. This provides an edge for the female in any future negotiations with her husband. Possession is 9 tenths of the law. Thus the offspring is viewed by both the parents and the courts as belonging to the female. Judicial preference for child custody by the mother is proof of the matter. Will not any set of teats do for nurturing the child, just as will not any sperm do for the fertilization of the egg? The answer is both yes and no. Arguments can be had for either side of the issue. However, in the long run it does not matter. What is of importance is the child, for it assures the continuation of the race and a specific set of selfish genes. Again, biological necessity cannot be blamed for how any particular culture channelizes this force. What can be blamed is elevating the relativism of culture over the absolutism of biology. Which is really more sacred? SOLUTIONS The major premise in this paper is that biology is primary to culture, and that the problems assumed to be caused by biology are a result of biology's distortion by culture. The first general solution is the daily remembering that culture is relative. The second is that territoriality is not destructive in itself and contributes directly to the evolutionary process. Thus any attempt to modify territoriality by governmental intervention as in communism, is destructive to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The U.S. constitution and the Bill of Rights is a biological and spiritual document. Additionally the hypocrisy created by the non-gnostic Christian, non-Sufi"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxxiv    Hyatt and von Gundlach Moslem and non Kabbalistic Jewish paradigms are also destructive to the growth and evolution of the species. Original sin is the original lie. Nothing more, nothing less. Leaving the general to focus on the particular we offer some creative and interesting solutions to counter the mal-adaptive fallacy. Specifically, to deal with space and housing we present the idea of the Shalhome which is a shelter that can be built for between $5.00 and $20.00 a square foot. This is housing both beautiful and functional which can be constructed using the most simple tools and requiring little or no skill. How does this shelter deal with the idea of nesting? Being made of concrete and steel it requires little up-keep and maintenance. Since the Shalhome is available to more people there would be less hostile struggle over territory. Why are banks, planning committees, and husbands and wives opposed to alternative housing? Culture and habit have dictated zoning and sub-division restrictions which have imposed on us human packaging systems in the form of \"boxes.\" A home does not have to be a box, yet the absolutizing of the relative, creates the illusion that boxes and homes are co-extensive. This means when we say shelter, home, etc., we automatically \"see\" boxes. The Shalhome is circular, thus many would not accept it as a home, since box is equal to home. The word is not the object, nor is necessity the form (i.e. necessity is shelter, the form is the box). Having built-in furniture, there is no burden (re-decoration syndrome) to replace obsolete and no longer fashionable appointments. Following the design format the form of the structure makes it indistinguishable in terms of class identification. The only differences are size, contents and location. The Shalhome can function as an energy conversion matrix which can employ a broader range of options for heating and cooling. Inexpensive, functional and beautiful shelter encourages pride of ownership which decreases crime. Community participation is an important part in its creation. In other words everyone can have their own territory and shelter for a minimal cost. Instead of homes which cost 65$ plus a square foot, we have a home for no-more than $20.00 a square foot and frequently less. While we are completely aware that this example does not solve all the distortions of the territorial instinct, we do believe that it offers an option to those who do not want to spend the rest of their lives working as serfs for the bankers and real estate speculators. The true ideal of democracy is not practiced anywhere in the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Hyatt and von Gundlach     xxxv world today . As it is practiced, it is divorced from its roots, the intelligence and spirit of the people. Most of us have little or no knowledge of the candidates that represent us. This is reflected by apathy at the polls. We appear to be willing to pay the price to have others make our critical decisions for us. In a bi-partisan political system the choices are indistinguishable, both in the poverty of new ideas and the similarity of the professional leader complex. The excessive costs of surrogate management are due to an imperfect mechanism of monitoring and controlling the politician's conflict between his/her desire for personal aggrandizement and public duty. To compound the flaws, politicians as our representatives, frequently band together in special interest groups, promoting objectives and agendas which are contrary to the best interests of the people. Election and re-election both imply compromises to the point where no-one is served except those who can wield the most money. In other words politics should not be an occupation, since the present qualifications for the position are simply one's ability to manipulate and influence the voters. This is like licensing a doctor because his wife is beautiful. An interesting alternative to the present form of social management is RANDOM representation. That is through a national lottery, where every citizen is eligible for office. This of course would change the emphasis in our educational processes since we would now have a vested interest in training our citizens to be socially responsible and functional. The emphasis in education would then shift from a competitive social conforming value system to a co-operative motivated value system. Everyone would then have an equal chance of being \"President\". The liberal arts, social sciences and civics would then become as important or more so than vocational skills and the hard sciences. Inter-active dynamics and the human potential movement would be a necessity, rather than a simple step-child of an educational system based on social conformity (imprisonment of the student) as well as the now dead industrial revolution (mis- management of territory and resources). It would reflect favorably in our daily and civic social interactions. For example at election lottery time winners will have \"won\" the privilege to participate in helping govern and harmonize the society. Of these, another group will be randomly selected through the lottery thus filling all positions until the last three winners would"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"xxxvi    Hyatt and von Gundlach form the federal triumvirate. This will decrease the probability of mis-management on any level during any particular term of office, since the level above would be immediately answerable to the level below. The elimination of tenure would reduce the possibility of malfeasance, bribery, and the formation of special interest groups, since no-one would know from one term to the next who would be in power. The harshest punishments of society would be reserved for any government official convicted of taking bribes or misusing power for personal purposes. Conclusion We often marvel at the lack of rhyme or reason in the planning for tomorrow. As Gurdjieff has stated — is there life on earth? Or are we just food for the moon? We do not believe that it matters which is correct. What matters is that we reverse the process of cultural absolutism, which holds us prisoners of yesterday and therefore tomorrow. We believe that it is time to view our biology as our destiny, and not the happenstantial regurgitations of housewives and laboring husbands, blindly slaving to produce their replacement cogs in the machine. We believe it is time that we begin to act like the gods we were created to be. \"Know ye not that ye are Gods.\" We hope we have let no-one off the hook and that everyone will find both something to love and something to hate. Hence this Law is for All! Finally, if someone asks you how come you are reading such trash, simply tell them that this book is about the nervous system — and when did that become trash? Nor, do not be fooled by the suggestions made in this book, they will not solve your problems, just replace the present ones with something new and hopefully more advanced. If someone asks you for a second time why an intelligent person such as you, is reading such un-evolved junk, just tell them that you are studying for your finals in spiritual-biology. That will assure them that you and the authors are both to be taken seriously.

As you become more astute in achieving deep relaxation, you will realize that you can have complete control of your life through the ability to reprogram your mind. However, to accomplish this you must first learn to reduce all un—necessary tension and stress. It is safe (and most of us do play it that way) to say that the majority of our problems arise from the lack of consciousness of our programming and the belief that we are more or less helpless in changing our condi- tion. The problem we now face is that of becoming conscious of our programming, and developing the willingness to change those things which our robot holds so dear. Existence itself (up to now) is dependent upon the conflict be- tween two opposing forces. Psycho- logical studies have proven that tension is produced by happy experiences as well as depressing ones. Tension is a fact of life — and not necessarily an unfortunate fact either. Stresses and strains are not only an integral part of life, but they often appear as life itself. But to bring about the change in consciousness necessary to achieve self programming, we must use some powerful techniques to reduce tension. A still mind is needed for re-programming. This is a result of Meditation, though this may not have been the intent of the meditator. Keep in mind your goal, together with the reasons for it: to free the body from the snares of the Mind, and to make the Mind a Slave to the Unconditioned Will. Meditation is as old as time itself, but the needs of each new generation differ from those of the — preceding one ~ requiring a re-definition of purpose and the re-formulation of technique."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"50 Undoing Yourself Energized Meditation is such an adaptation developed by combining Eastern and Western information. Over 20 years have been spent in practice and research to develop a method which would benefit those who seek the goal of \"Brain Change Willed.\" EM is a sensory-tonic (muscular) technique which takes into account the fact that tension is thought, and thought is tension. Every thought has its neuro-sensate-muscular equivalent. Conversely every tension can be converted into a thought. Every twitch and sensation conveys a thought or a meaning."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself     51 A STILL MIND IS NECESSARY? It has been suggested from the beginning of meditative practices that the Mind is the final obstacle to Enlightenment. (This is not to imply that the Mind is Evil, or some sort of destructive force. It does imply however that the Mind once set on a program is self-propelling and difficult to alter. For further information see Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson, particularly the section which discusses the idea of \"What the Thinker Thinks — The Prover Proves\".) The mind's major by-product, thought, must be harnessed so that in the end \"Mind\" itself can be reee—programmed, not just of content but of the \"way\" it operates as well. It follows that to destroy all unnecessary tension frees the Mind from its programmed thoughts. This in turn will make the task of EGO-MIND re-programming (transcendence) easier. In order to clear the mind of thought, each sensate-muscle group must be cleared of tension, or at least the tension must be reduced. The technical aspects of this idea are overwhelming. While meditation reduces tension, tension also reduces the result of meditation. For this reason concentration on a mantra can never be achieved to complete satisfaction. This is one of the major problems to which Energized Meditation addresses itself. Mantra focus is necessary in the beginning and intermediate stages of meditation, but in order to actually become the Mindless One, the Deathless One, all tension-thought-image structures must finally disappear. True merging with the Universal Programmer (Leary's Higher Circuits) only occurs when Your lower circuits are \"clear\" and lack domination. What most of us call I — You — Ego are sets and webs of interactive and interwoven tensions.

Constant mental chattering or thought creates tensions. When you are thinking your voice box moves ever so slightly as thoughts are flowing through your mind. In addition, the jaw moves slightly, as well as the tongue and the eyes. In fact, as stated before there is a fine state of tension when we are thinking. So to achieve true Mindlessness, we first must become aware of the facial, throat, and neck tension which are associated with thinking. EXPERIMENT I Sit or lie down in a quite place and allow yourself to \"think\" about anything. Notice how and where your thinking is experienced. Notice what motions and tensions exist in your face-neck-throat area. After you have completed this, \"think\" about something unpleasant and notice if there is any difference. Now try \"thinking\" about something pleasant and make the same notations. Once you are thoroughly aware of this, attempt the following: EXPERIMENT II Lie down and do not move. Just breathe normally with your eyes closed. Now become aware and describe out loud for 15 minutes every sensation and muscle twitch in your body. Become aware that tension exists all around and within you."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"54      Undoing Yourself These two experiments should be tried three times over a week to help you verify that tension is thought — thought is tension. This will require 45 minutes — 15 minutes for each trial. If you do not experience the voice box — facial sensation, or if you are not aware of anything during experiment II, double the time. METHOD I Step 1. Sit or lie down. Make Faces ~ Stretch all the muscles in the face. Open your mouth as wide as you can, move the jaw from side to side. At the same time open your eyes as wide as you can. Move your eyes up and down and from side to side. This will begin to destroy tension, thereby destroying uncontrolled and extraneous thoughts generated by this area. Make many different faces. Do this for about 2-3 minutes. (A word of caution: While in the end these exercizes are meant to reduce and eliminate certain thought patterns, some might find an increase of new thoughts from previously \"Hidden\" places of the mind. If this is the case don't be concerned, since this will be a fine way to perform \"mental house cleaning.\") Step II. Hum and Chatter — Hum from the depths of your voice box. Use OM or just MMMM. Do this for 1-2 minutes. Now using your tongue, chatter — DA DA — BA BA BA. Stick out your jaw as far as you can and continue humming and chattering. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Step III. Shoulders to Ears — Pull your shoulders up as if you were trying to reach your ears. When they start feeling tired, drop them as low as you can. Repeat this 3 times in 2-3 minute intervals. Step IV. Nose Breathing — With your mouth closed take in a deep breath inflating your chest and pulling your stomach up. Be sure to pull the belly in. Hold for a 7 count and then just let the chest fall and the belly relax. Repeat this 10-20 times. Be sure to allow an additional 7 count to elapse before your next inhalation. Step V. Turn Head — Now bring your attention to your head and turn it from side to side as far as you can. Repeat for 2-3 minutes."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself 55 Step VI. Leg Stretch — Lying down on your back, hold your legs about 4 inches off the ground and stretch outward. Hold this as long as you can then let them drop. Repeat this 2-3 times. Step VII. Quick Breath — With your mouth slightly open breathe rapidly, sighing as you exhale. Do this for 2-3 minutes. Now lie down and sense and feel your body, for about 10 minutes. Note every sensation you feel. Now assume a meditative position of your choice making sure that: (1) Your eye lids are not tightly closed, but simply relaxed. (2) That your jaw is relaxed and not tense. Make sure of this by trying to stick out your tongue; if you have to lower your jaw, it was too tightly held. Check your forehead making sure it is not wrinkled. Once you are relaxed, either concentrate on your mantra or point of focus. For those students who do not have a mantra or point, we suggest Dr. Regardie's Mantram tape or simply OOOOO- OOOMMMMMMM. For students who wish or require specific images or points of focus, please feel free to contact us. (3) Finally make sure your throat is not blocked by holding your head in the wrong position. Make sure it is straight. In order to reduce thoughts, keep the eyes relaxed and still, with your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Do not move the larynx and again be sure that your jaw is relaxed. Meditate before eating, or wait for 2-3 hours after eating a heavy meal.

But so strongly entrenched was the teaching of Aris- totle that most of us today, completely without our awareness, are still affected by his premises. So rigid is the mental process that not until recent decades has his dogma been subjected to serious questioning. Even a slight examin- ation of his premises will indicate the fallacy of the reasoning that for so many centuries has influenced scientific and philosophical thought — and indirectly the thinking processes of the man in the street. This has also contributed to the reality in which we have been living, since beliefs do create our reality. Aristotle considered philosophy to be the discovery of certain self-evident, unchanging first principles that form the basis of all knowledge. Yet today the Quantum Physicists declare that the very act of observing what we consider to be reality is sufficient to change it. Even as we see or think or touch what is \"outside\" we organize \"reality.\" The observer is such a vital part of the observed that we may never know anything but an alchemy, a Union of \"out there\" and ourselves.

Above and behind them was a flickering fire and as men passed by the prisoners observed only the shadows cast against the wall; they refused to believe that reality was anything different from the shadows. Most of us are like prisoners in a mythical cave prisoners shackled by Cave Logic: what mankind has always believed is true because it appears to be true. And by Cave Logic: what we think we see is reality because it looks real.

It is advisable to spend considerable time — several minutes [Ha!] on each object — to make you aware of how conditioned you — and — not me — are about everything in our lives. Look out the window and ask yourself as your eyes rest on each object, what is the truth about this tree, lawn, people walking on the street, or whatever your glance rests on? Mentally strip the objects to the facts that you perceive. Even your perception of what you believe to be facts concerning it or them is likely to be distorted -nevertheless your efforts to confine your conclusions to the apparent facts concerning it will help you to increase your awareness of how distorted are all our perceptions concerning everything in our lives.

The Limited Supply and mortal philosophy is so deeply ingrained that conscious acts of re-programming are absolutely essential. Keep in mind that the very fact of the mortality concept is limiting. What could be more basic to the idea of limitation than a limited number of years to live? The artificial and arbitrary standards of evaluation which have been placed on you by the Establishment — the term of service with a company, marriage, your status in the community, your financial statement, etc. But in an Unlimited Life of Limitless Supply such standards of evaluation are utterly non-sensical. If life never ends there is no end point for evaluation and judgment. As sta-$$-ndards change so will the mind and visa versa. There will be nothing to fight for because even if accumulation is your personal goal, your time will be infinite. All pressure will be removed. Those who still desire ultimate power will have less clout with which to influence you because you will be independent of them. Scare tactics based on death and restriction become useless once the limited supply philosophy becomes obso- lete.

If we are to survive, the first necessity is to change both our attitudes and our perceptions. As Gary Zukau points out in the Dancing Wu Li Masters, atoms are \"Hypothetical entities constructed to make experimental observations intelligible.\" Yet for so long have we dealt with the idea of an atom that we completely forget it is simply that — an idea. And even when we deal with the idea of an atom we are in reality dealing with something which is largely non-existent. An atom consists of a complex arrangement of electrons revolving around a nucleus composed of protons — positively charged particles, and neutrons —uncharged particles."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"102     Undoing Yourself It has been said that if the nucleus of an atom were the size of a pea which had been placed on the 50 yard line of a sports stadium, the rest of its parts, the electrons, would be spinning at the top of the grandstand. This gives you an idea of the amount of empty space within the electron shell forming the perimeter of the atom. This being the case, turn your attention to your body. Now decide if the opinions which you may previously have held about it have validity. Your body is composed of atoms — for scientists still use the term in describing material objects. Therefore your body consists of mostly empty space. It is a collection of whirling atomic particles, temporarily held in place for the lifetime of the body. And yet the British physicist, Sir Arthur Eddington says, \"the stuff of the world is mind stuff,\" because as the modern physicist continues his search he finds not matter in stasis, but vital energy. \"The material universe begins to look like a fantastic cosmic interplay of energy and consciousness.\" Already Physics is speculating that mind can and will move matter and shape it into other forms. Dr. William A. Tiller, Professor of Material Science and Engineering at Stanford states, \"A biological transformation to another sensory system appears to be taking place in humanity at this time.\" More and more scientists are beginning to give validity to the hypothesis of the metaphysicists.

If you still question the exponential change that is now occurring everywhere (except in your head) take a brief glance backwards in time to the beginning of this century. And though the automobile had been developed in the last half of the 19th century the country as a whole was not on wheels until about the time of World War I. Leonardo as early as 1514 sketched a parachute and discussed the aerodynamic factors involved. But it was not until 1903 that the Wright Brothers were credited with making the first successful powered airplane flight. The airplane was a minor factor in WWI but it remained for Charles Lindbergh to pioneer the way for transoceanic flights in 1927. Then in 1969 the United States landed two (maybe more) astronauts on the Moon. The possibility of such a feat had previously been limited to the imagination of writers of science- fiction; (a nice phrase for stark raving psychotics). Jules Verne wrote From the Earth to the Moon in 1865. H.G. Wells published The War of the Worlds in 1898 and The First Man on the Moon in 1901. Edison invented the electric light bulb in 1879 but as late as WWII many rural areas were still without electricity. A moment's reflection over the above figures, relating them to the thousands of millenia which preceded them in the history of the planet will give one a clue as to the speed with which Nature is suddenly accelerating her plans for the evolution of the race.

There is One God and His Name is (substitute Hive-Label). If there is only One God then there is no choice, no option, no selection of reality. There is only Submission or Heresy. The word Islam means 'submission'. The basic posture of Christianity is kneeling. Thy will be done. Monotheism therefore does no harm to hive-oriented terrestrials (Stages 10,11, and 12) who eagerly seek to lay-off responsibility on some Big Boss. [Note: I disagree with Dr. Leary's notion of no-harm.] Monotheism does profound mischief to those who are evolving to post-hive stages of reality.

[Note: substitute 'brains' and All is still All.] The discovery of Self is frightening because the novitiate possessor of the Automobile Body and the Automobile Brain must accept all the power that the hive religious attributed to the jealous Jehovah. The First Commandment of all Monotheism is: I am the Lord, thy God: Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. All monotheisms are vengeful, aggressive, expansionist, intolerant... It is the duty of a monotheist to destroy any compet- itive heresy. Concepts such as devil, hell, guilt, eternal damnation, sin, evil are fabrications by the hive to insure loyalty to Hive Central. All these doctrines are precisely designed to intimidate and crush individualism...

DEATH AND STUPIDITY THE HISTORY OF MONOMANIA There are two enemies which mankind may not recover from. Number one is Stupidity: I place this before the second, death, since the amelioration of stupidity is necessary before death can be conquered. The DNA GODDESSES have us scheduled for a bright future. However, their scheduling is based on the law of discomfort. This law states that man usually does not embark on dangerous and difficult ventures unless he is motivated. Thus the wo/man of the hour, the consort of DNAs, are those who know how to use discomfort to discover great truths. Discomfort is simply the emergence of a new Goddess. It is birth of a new center which in time will become a periphery."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  121 AIDS Motivation is frequently pain, misery and fear. It is the Dukkha from which we all try to escape. AIDS is an example. This epidemic that could destroy us all has motivated Man to spend money, time and effort on research. It may even create a sense of world unity. Some, like the fundamentalists, believe that AIDS is a curse or punishment: however, it may turn out to be something like a reward. Their view is singular and based on the ideations of monotheism—the one law)—a one brain function psycho-philos- ophy of cave dwellers. Research on AIDS may help us see through the genetic window which may lead to immortality, the enemy of heaven/hell theorists. POT LUCK DNAs are designed to maintain status quo until the time is right for change. This relates to the notion of monotheism and Poly-Brain-Theism, the serving of the various Neuro-Gods. This happens by pot luck. Pot luck occurs when apparently orderly systems proceed normally until they reach a critical point and become chaotic. A switch from brain focus 'A' to brain focus 'B'. In other words when we have taken a God to an extreme, chaos begins. At that point another Goddess emerges. Chaos does not mean randomness in the normal sense of the word. What it means is that linear equations (monotheisms) are no longer operative and predictions based on them temporarily collapse. After a period of time of observing these \"random\" events, a new principle emerges. (Note: this idea is not similar to the 100th Monkey model which has now been discredited.) Some scientists have used notions of \"initial sensitivity\" as a model to understand types of pot luck. In other words, a minor or even an unnoticed event in the beginning of an activity may show up near the end as a gigantic discrepancy.

A country by any other name is a choice between serfdoms. Each bible is simply a slave's survival manual—a HOW TO book! WHERE LIVES THE STRAIGHT LINE LURKS THE CURVES One purpose of chaos, paradox, nonsense, and absurdity is to set itself against the linear world. These are not meant to take the place of linear knowledge or functions, but to act as a point of focus calling our attention and awareness to the something(s) which the linear model has missed, thus breathing new life into the predictable. Further, our non-linear models help us to see old facts in new and exciting ways. If there is a summum bonum it lies in reformulation and utility in the service of tolerating more of the unknown. The function of Monotheism is to control the anxiety created by the unknown. Monotheism is a form of glue which attempts to hold an expanding world together. However, to view these models as truths eternal leads to the possibility of destruction now facing us. For example, Veblen thought that it was easier for society to regress than advance. For Veblen, this regression might lead back to a society characterized by smallness, cooperation, peacefulness, and hard work, rather than the industrialized barbarism which he felt existed in his time (1857-1929). Many new-agers, agriculturalists, and religionists might favor this. I do not. Ogburn felt that doctrine always lagged behind innovation. This idea may lead to pocket societies within a larger society. This is particularly true if knowledge and information are acceler- ating, as many believe. This is not entirely pessimistic, particu- larly if we all learn to let other people live in their own dogmas without having to reform them with violence.

Dreams are one way, sensory deprivation another. A technique I employ with individuals working with restricted CMs is to temporarily deprive them of the use of one of their senses. This is especially useful with individuals who have correlated certain emotions with specific ritualized and feared behaviors. These individuals have been taught that emotions and thoughts are the same as behavior. They are from a neurologic point of view, but not from an external result point of view. In other words I can have an anxiety attack as a result of my thoughts and beliefs, but in fact the situation out there usually has many more options, than \"my\" restricted definition of it. In other words there is a sense of independence that we can create from our tacit assumptions which have created a false isomorphism between the inside and outside. I use a method called flip/flop which entails moving from emotion to thought to action and back again in an almost random fashion. An important assumption underlying our polytheistic method is that feelings of inadequacy are signs that a person is still alive and has the potential to create a larger and more enjoyable CM. These feelings are not negative, but simply statements that the world is unpredictable, and will always remain so. Like the monotheism of religion or Hitler we can try to force a limited CM on the worlds in order to reduce our sense of uneasiness. However the result of this is obvious. Us 0, Lawyers 46.

FACT OR FICTION? AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? The essence of this story was revealed to me in 1965 by an elderly woman (from the South) who claimed to be an adept of an ancient secret order which was somehow linked with the Golden Dawn. I worked with her for approximately 9 months at which time she disappeared. Her personal handmade Tarot deck had a White Lion on the Strength Card which made a very strong impression on me. She told me that the symbol of the White Lion had major significance for me as well as for the future of mankind. What follows is a present day offering of that information. The Order of the White Lion (OWL) was said to be due to emerge prior to 2005. However, it will establish its roots some- time in the late 1980's and early 90's as an offshoot of the Original Order of the Knights Templar. The acronym OWL is no simple coincidence: it relates to Horus, the Hawk Headed God of the emerging Aeon, which was transmitted to Crowley in 1904. 1 The Order of the White Lion has nothing to do with any rock group which uses the name to represent itself or its music. In fact the Heads of the Order (if they existed) would be horrified at this possibility, as the Order doesn't concern itself with the fantasies of Instant Breast. (The Instant Breast represents a 60's fantasy, first created by Dr. Spock. It concerns itself with instant gratification as well as with no competition, no frustration or struggle for life. It evolved into notions of mystical equality where all individual differences would be summed and a golden mean established. Further this concept—best represented by early communism, and still embraced in the Christian West—is being abandoned elsewhere. However, it is important to remember that Instant Breast was a counter proposal to male authoritarianism, but Instant Breast is still a symbol of the Patriarchy. 159"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"160    Undoing Yourself As many know, the Knights Templar were involved with the Saracen fraternity of the Hashish-Takers. One of the original purposes of the Knights (before the Inquisition when the Powerful Church wrenched them away from the service of the 'Lady' and coerced them to fight for the Church), was to aid and uphold the feminine goddess, which included the practice of a secret form of Tantra. This spiritual quest was degraded by the Church's attempt to remove the power of the Goddess by making her the mother of God, and relegating her to a secondary position. The idea of reducing the female to insignificance can be seen in this quote by a silversmith in Acts 19:26-27 \"...this man Paul has persuaded and converted a great number of people with his argument that gods made by hand are not gods at all. This threatens not only to discredit our trade, but also to reduce the sanctuary of the great goddess Diana to unimportance. It could end up by taking away all the prestige of a goddess venerated all over Asia, yes, and everywhere in the civilized world.\" The romantic tales of Lancelot, Parsifal, Galahad, etc. also enhanced the image of the helpless female which held great masculine appeal and does so even today, particularly in the South. The greatest danger to a budding Goddess is always a gentleman. (See Note 1 below.) The Christian movement was instrumental in projecting all these negative qualities on the female. She became the scapegoat for the male's inability to integrate and cope with his own darkness. (See Note 2 below.) In the Christian world, darkness takes away from the image of God, rather than \"adding\" to it, and as such, its existence must be accounted for by division and isolation. The Lion was often a symbol of the sun god for the Greeks and the Romans, however, in other places it was associated with images of the Great Goddess, such as Astarte, Cybele, Ishtar and Hathor all of whom rode or drove lions and often appeared in the form of a lioness or lion-headed female. Her many names have been associated with both Power and the practice of Tantra. (Look at the Strength Card in the Tarot. Why does it appear that a female is controlling the Jaws of the Lion?)"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  161 The Goddesses of the Lion were law givers, creators of cities, the mothers of both the Gods and men, the fierce destroyers of obsolete civilizations and the human race. It has been noted that in a conversation with Ra, She replied to his request to stop slaying mankind by saying, \"when I slay men my heart rejoices.\" However, through Her grace man was also allowed to learn about the nature of the Gods. (See Note 3 Below). The West borrowed her power and force and of course attributed it to such images as King Richard, the Lion Hearted, King Arthur and many others. The symbol of White must not be associated with ideas of Christian purity and virginity. White has nothing to do with such infantile and hysterical fantasies. The best I can make of the idea of White is that it represents an idea which is difficult to convey by words and concepts. White light is undifferentiated. It is the origin, as the Tree of Life intimates of the completely unknowable qualities of Nuit, manifested in Kether, the first point of reference which man can even begin to cope with. The development of OWL as a living Order would emerge after the major thrust of the feminist movement \"failed\". The original movement was to be the basis of the re-emergence of the feminine as a powerful force in the universe, however it was deeply contaminated by the influence of the Male Gods, no doubt a contributory factor in its failure. First the psychology of the patriarchal identification of the feminine has to be altered. This means that the feminine can not find its true roots by imitating western patriarchal consciousness. As many will note, what woman wanted she didn't get. The stone tablets of Moses cracked just enough to encircle her in the charms and trappings of the paternal system. The Order of the White Lion's purpose will be to help usher in the New Aeon by establishing a group of leaders and supporters who will help the Goddess emerge in totally unexpected ways. The Order will establish fellowships of older males and females (brothers and sisters) which will practice the ancient arts. More importantly it will be involved in training younger females as Scientists, Inventors, Artists, who through their creative 161 Undoing Yourself"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"162    Undoing Yourself genius would help replace the arthritic patriarchy as painlessly as nature will allow. These new women would come from all classes. They will have an exceptional IQ. The purpose of the Order will be to save as many of them and their children as possible from being absorbed into the reproduction bias, wild man-hating, and the patriarchal prison of glitter and 'YUP-STATUS-SEEKERS'. Their training will encompass \"mind/body\" (which we are now seeing in early form, as \"hard-body\") and MIND SHAPING which the mad Dr. Hyatt is busily developing. (See the section on Devotional Sexuality as one simple example). Those that are the most able will be trained in ancient and modern thinking, science and art. They will be taught to respect and revere their own sexuality without the image of being demanding harpies. Training will be vigorous and only the best suited for the task will complete the entire course. The above myth of such an Order is an ancient one. However, it is only now in the latter part of the 20th century that women have enough apparent freedom to undertake such a difficult and profound journey. (See Note 4 Below.) Of course much UNDOING will be necessary to prepare the new Goddess, and much of it will be done by middle age and older males, and by those females who have had more experience with the patriarchal deceits, lies and paraphernalia. Some of these males may be considered \"failures\" themselves, but this is how they will utilize what they learned about the true nature of the system. The elitist female myth is exploited in numerous James Bond stories where superior women are both adversaries and helpers of Bond. In time they submit to his superior male powers and fall from their throne. In other words, it was the female's dedication and devotional quality which was exploited and which caused her to fall and become the slave of man. This is intentional since this is the quality that the patriarchy most fears about women. Why might this be? One of the great threats to any patriarchal system occurs when competency and power are joined with commitment and loyalty. With these \"virtues\" alone empires have toppled."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  163 Ian Fleming was no fool however, as he did have the vision which brought to consciousness the strength and power of the female life force. The Order of the White Lion will have more in mind than to simply return to a Matriarchal view of the Universe. Its goal is the transcendence of the sex differences as we know them. The secret meaning behind this can not yet be revealed, except in the form presented in the Tantric section of this book. To my knowledge, the Order has not made an overt appear- ance. Nor do I know of any organizations with the financial base and Will to bring such an Order into existence. However, I have met more males in recent years who have indirectly and unconsciously supported such a notion, although it has been somewhat plebeian and ignoble and frequently filled with saccharin male hysteria (Christian Ideals and denial mixing with Pagan Lust) and cliches. Here again, most of these males, while trying to help the Goddess re-emerge, are terrified of the depths of her Psyche and spend a good deal of time suppressing its manifestations. Some of these types have sought me out. However, once I treat them to the dark side of their own image they promptly cast me in the role of devil and continue on in their hysterical ways. From time to time a few try to hold on, but their fear prevents them from doing any real work. In addition to working with the Feminine Force, the Order is to work with rejected children in a way never before heard of on this planet. Rather than helping them live boring and hum-drum lives they will be taught to live superior lives. Again, to my knowledge, this has not yet been done or even advertised. Once the Order has planted its seed it will disappear, as it will be of no further use. This will happen sometime between 2090 and 2150. This entire scenario is not based on the assumption that the Western World will not experience numerous and great upheavals.

What transcendence means is nothing more than focusing on our alien qualities, while de-focusing on our earthly qualities. The way that this has been taught has been both foolish and destructive. The secret of Transcendence is not negation nor is it affirmation. It is simply an act of P O W E R Concentration without placing a moral value on what is transcended. Re-stated simply, it doesn't matter whether you transcend eating habits, sexual habits, drug habits, clothes habits, or simply the way you open a door. What matters is that you transcend and by repetitive acts of transcendence, consciousness becomes transformed. You can see why indulgence as a hedonic notion, and abstinence as a Christian notion, and compulsions as a Psychological notion, have no place in Transcendence, except as Technique. Additionally, transcendence has nothing to do with secret messages from the Psyche, secret orders, drug related experiences etc. It has to do with WORK. Everything else is simply information, the lowest form of knowledge. Without transcendence permeating the Ego and the Psyche, very little will be accomplished. In other words, it is time to stop talking about Gods, messages, channels, etc. and time to act like the Gods/Goddesses we are. It is time to stop waiting and wondering and it is time to start acting and doing. The proof that we are aliens is very simple. There is nothing like us upon the planet earth. Nothing at all. We are the definers of what we can be. This is the difference. Nothing else can change itself, at will, into something different. We can even transcend death and stupidity if we identify these as desires and put our efforts into it. Only transcendence can lead to more transcendence.

What if the Order as revealed to me is only fiction and the whim of an old woman's mind? There is no way to answer the question of legitimacy. The Catholic Church had a nightmare and made it come true. So, does that prove the legitimacy of the Catholic nightmare? I do not think so. What it does prove is that validity can not be proven by simple existence over time. Nor can it be denied. What we do know is that if the potential is there and if enough power and force is placed behind that potential then almost anything can come true. This method has little or nothing to do with our primitive notions of morality, belief or faith. What it does prove is that power works. ENOUGH ON THIS FANTASY NOTES Note 1: The idea of slaying the Dragon, to rescue the distressed maiden has great psychological import. (The dragon/serpent is an allegory for the Kundalini Force. However, the notion of slaying versus controlling is purely Christian.) An important meaning here is that males can only enter the mysteries of the Goddess once they have faced, conquered and integrated the power of their own beast. This is why the Knights were preoccupied with loyalty and betrayal. Their image, which was often portrayed as kind and holy was frequently tarnished by deception, lust and greed. In other words, they both required and made the image of the helpless female as a device to rescue themselves from their own feminine attributes. Note 2: Image making is always interesting, as it requires rejecting certain qualities, while emphasizing others. Males have the awful tendency of projecting all traits and tendencies which are regarded as inferior or negative onto females as a result of the sex-differentiated socialization process engendered by the Patriarchal system. 165 Undoing Yourself"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"166    Undoing Yourself Note 3: The image of the Goddess as both the nurturing Mother and the destroyer of her own children is disturbing to the Christian \"Mind\", but long recognized as an essential Wisdom in the East.

Note 4: As the reader will observe the OWL is not a Christian Order, nor was the Golden Dawn. One attribute among many others of the Golden Dawn which gives the whole thing away is the equality between male and female adepts. However, the practice of tantra was never directly mentioned, although there are numerous sex-negative references. This is due to the fact that the original teachings fell into the hands of the Christians as well into other hands who disguised its real meaning to protect it from the jealous and dangerous Church. The new Golden Dawn which is now emerging no longer has to disguise its real purposes or its association with the Knights Templar and other Tantric groups. To this day I am amazed by how many people believe that the Golden Dawn is a Christian Order, and that Dr. Regardie supported the Christian value system. I am even more amazed that individuals think that I support the idea of Christianity in any form. I still have a few disciples who are deluding themselves by interpreting what I say as being a form of Christian mysticism. The reverse of this is also true: many people believe that the Golden Dawn is an offshoot of Satanism and that Dr. Regardie and I are Satanists. The Golden Dawn developed from the Rosicrucian Order— mystics who called themselves Knights of the Rosy Cross— who borrowed the symbols and colors of earlier pagan groups, mystical Jews, Egyptians and Hindus. These were later trans- formed into Christian symbols. (Remember the symbol was White with a Red Cross.) During the Crusades the Christians adopted the symbol and said that it was representative of \"innocence and blood\" when in fact it was the emblem of the \"Assassins\" (a mispronunciation of the Saracen brotherhood of hashishim, the \"hashish-takers\") the forerunner of the Knights Templar."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten WESTERN SEXUAL MAGICK AND THE CREATION OF THE MAGICKAL CHILD Note: The methods presented below were created by Dr. Regardie and myself over many years of thought and experiment.

This notion has been frequently \"justified\" through blaming Eve and the Serpent for the fall of man. Those familiar with Tantra and Kundalini will automatically associate these Judaic-Christian \"devils\" with the practice of these ancient arts.

This book presents one of the most powerful methods of releasing Kundalini through the Practice of Tantra. It uses the Tarot, The Symbols of the Tree of Life, Bio-energetic technique, and Chakra meditation to help aspirants obtain the pure essence of both Magick (Power) and Mysticism (Love). Note: Magick and Mysticism, or Power and Love, is again a false dichotomy created by the Christian ethos. Christian philos- ophy assumes that power (ACTIVITY) is evil, while Love (PASSIVITY) is good. This slavish philosophy of turning man into a sheep is similarly identified by its emphasis on pleading as a form of worship, as compared to the practice of Magick which is dynamic and active. The Goddess religions do not recognize such childish cutting off of power from love. Instead the Goddess religions recognize that each concept is deeply tied to its apparent opposite.

It was from my work with the Tree of Life and Sexual Magick that this system was evolved and so I have a special place in my heart Chakra for this model. However, if you find this model difficult or cumbersome, feel free to use the Eastern model for meditation and association. Better yet, use both. The Tree of Life formula: Kether is the Point, or Crown. Chokmah is the Father Principle. Connecting the two is a straight line, which metaphorically cannot encompass space. Adding Binah, the Great Productive Mother, a Triangle is created which metaphorically encompasses space. Within space normal matter and spiritual matter can be generated. Thus in Tantra, each act always includes the Emanating force of Kether, the Crown of the Tree of Life. Therefore in the practice of Western Tantra, a God-form is always included, bringing the participants to Three. Relationships which include the Third Principle are powerful, when compared with Relationships which only include the Principle of two. As we descend the Tree from Kether, the point, to Chokmah the Father, we find that Binah (the Great Mother Principle) is the Third point. Thus we see one reason why Tantra is frequently associated with the Goddess principle. However, in practice, the new energy which is brought into the relationship is Kether. This is the point of energy which is forgotten or never employed in normal sexual intercourse. Thus Tantric intercourse is always symbolized by WHITE LIGHT. I want to emphasize again that WHITE LIGHT has nothing to do with Christian morality. While Kether is the first Sephiroth, for reference sake we will say that when practicing Tantra we must include Kether as the third symbolic participant in the act. This is so because normally God-Forms are left out of western sexual practices. Undoing Yourself 169"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"170    Undoing Yourself The practice of Western Tantra brings the energy up from Malkuth to Kether. As we develop our practice, we bring Kether back down to Malkuth, then finally equa-liberating both in Tiphareth. Adepts will recognize this ancient formula. Occult Eugenics concerns the creation of the Magickal Child. Creating Magickal Children is rarely practiced, normally being left to Fate or Chance. If we truly wish to change the world as well as ourselves then we must deliberately create the Magickal Child instead of waiting. The implication here is that Man has the power to create Messiahs. Noting the Tree again, the Son of the Parents, Chokmah and Binah, when filled with the power of Kether is Tiphareth. The daughter is Malkuth. Of course this is symbolic. In addition to the forces previously mentioned the powers of the other Sephiroth must be generated to create the desired effects. Tiphareth is often associated with the Heart Chakra. Malkuth is the Bride of Kether manifested in the world, and when an Adept is in the correct posture Malkuth is associated with Muladhara. Her purity is the result of Chokmah and Binah combining with Kether. Thus Malkuth is in Kether, and Kether is in Malkuth, but different in kind. (It is no coincidence that the Path between Kether (the Crown) and Tiphareth the heart is \"guarded\" by the High Priestess. The practice of Occult Eugenics whether for the purpose of creating a living physical entity, or for the purpose of creating a spiritual God-form, mixes the energies of Kether and Malkuth. We bring the force up, and we bring the force down, mixing at the point of Tiphareth, the center of the Tree of Life, the Heart. The correct practice of western Tantra assures that the God-forms we create will act according to the power and essence used to generate the form. Using the Tarot symbols to define the desired force you wish to create is described in detail in Secrets of Western Tantra (New Falcon Publications, 1989)."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  171 FUNDAMENTAL MOVEMENTS PRELIMINARY EXERCISES For the practice of Tantra it does little good to have common orgasms. The movements below are preliminary to any form of Tantric practice, although the simplest forms of pre-Tantric Intercourse may be practiced at the same time. Once these movements have had their effect, certain bio-psychological events take place which increase the depth and breadth of orgasm elevating it to its highest pre-Tantric intensity. These movements have been designed to help you shake off the negative associations created toward your sexuality by \"civilization\". You can use them as you see fit. However, if you wish to gain all their benefits you should proceed to the practice of Tantric Intercourse. (See Secrets of Western Tantra, New Falcon Publications, 1989.) SECTION ONE Remove your clothes, or wear loose fitting clothing. Lie down on a very soft surface in a cool room. If your room is too warm turn up the air conditioning slightly, or turn on a fan. Coolness is very important. Take a big stretch. Move your arms to your side and take a deep breath. Hold your breath, while doing a slow, controlled sit up. Let the breath go and flop. Repeat the breath, sit up and flop two or three times. Stretch again. Get in the \"breathing position\". This means that you are to lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet solidly on the floor or bed about a foot from your rear end. Your knees should be about 18 inches apart. Your arms should be at your side. Now begin to breath through your mouth. Make sure your mouth is held loosely open, about 1 inch. Inhale to a slow count of three, then exhale to a slow count of three. We will call this \"deep breathing\". The inhalation should be full but NOT forced. Start inhaling from your lower belly. The belly should begin to expand first, followed by the chest. 171 Undoing Yourself"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"172    Undoing Yourself When the inhalation reaches its highest point, JUST LET GO saying \"AH\", allow the chest and belly to collapse/contract on their own. Make no voluntary movements as you breathe. If you sense tension leave it alone. Allow what happens to just happen. Remember, allow a slow count of three while inhaling and begin exhaling by saying \"AH\". You should set a tinier for 10 minutes. When it goes off, just sense and feel your body, for another 5 minutes or so. Verbalize only what you sense and feel. Make no interpretations at this time. Now you will begin to combine deep breathing with other movements. As you do the following exercises you may at times notice that your breathing becomes erratic or even that you are holding your breath. Do not allow this to continue. It is essential that you continue deep breathing throughout the exercise unless specifically instructed otherwise. Begin deep breathing for at least five minutes. Continue deep breathing, but now on the inhale open your eyes as wide as you can and on the exhale close your eyes as tight as you can. Utilize just the section of your head from the eyes up. Do not move your jaw or change the position of your body. Do this for about 5 minutes. After you have done this, continue deep breathing but this time lift your head while inhaling and let it flop on the exhalation. (Be sure to have something soft to catch your head). Some people get nauseous during this phase, so have an empty stomach or a pot handy. Set your timer for 3 minutes. After you feel comfortable you may increase the timer to 10 minutes. When this phase is completed become completely aware of your sensations and feelings for five minutes or so. Be sure to verbalize what is going on. Again no interpretations please. Next, begin deep breathing again; on the inhalation push your lower jaw out as far as you can. On the exhalation let it relax. Keep this up for 3-5 minutes. Allow any automatic grimace to develop. Become aware of any heat that develops."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  173 Relax for a moment or two. Begin deep breathing again. On the inhalation push your lower jaw out as for as possible as before, but this time growl on the exhalation. The growl should be as full and deep as possible. Begin to become aware of the origin of your growl. Do not do this exercise for more than one minute. When finished relax for a moment or two. If you are not already in bed, please do so now. I want you to put the two exercises together along with a few other movements. On the inhalation stick your jaw out as far as you can and at the same time raise your arms slowly behind you. At the same time begin lifting your head toward your chest and growl, leaving your arms behind your head. When you are almost finished growling and your chin almost touches your chest, clench your fists and fling your arms forward hitting the bed. Let go with a giant yell as your arms hit the bed. Be sure to let your head fall back on the bed. Repeat this procedure six times. It is very important to relax now. Give yourself a break. I would suggest at least ten minutes of just plain sensing and feeling. You may now stop for this session or continue on with Section two. SECTION TWO Begin by lying down and sensing and feeling your body. Do this for at least five minutes. Ten minutes is better. Now begin deep breathing as described previously. Five minutes of breathing will do. Raise your hands straight up in the air over your chest. Inhale, then stretch the left arm and relax the right arm as you exhale. Then inhale, stretch the right arm and relax the left arm as you exhale. Continue alternating arms. Reach for the sky as you say \"AH\" with every attempt. REACH up as high as you can, as if your greatest desire was just out of reach. To help you get the feeling of this movement you might say the name of a person who you would like to make contact with. Sometimes \"Maamee\""},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"174    Undoing Yourself or \"Dadee\" can create the desired feeling. Learning how to YEARN is very important to later work in the area of Tantra and Devotional prayer. (See my article on Active Prayer in Healing Energy, Prayer and Relaxation by Israel Regardie, New Falcon Publications, 1989). Keep this exercise up until your arms begin to get tired. Now just let go into a feeling of exhaustion and peace. I can't emphasize the importance of yearning, both in releasing repressions and to help you learn devotional sexuality. To help you further with learning how to yearn, repeat the above movement except this time reach up with both arms at the same time on the exhalation and relax both on the inhalation repeating either the name of a significant other or a Divine name See The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic (New Falcon Publications, 1991) for Divine names. Repeat this movement until your arms become very tired. Be sure to reach as high as you can. Now treat yourself to some special food such as ice cream, cake or popcorn. SECTION THREE I must warn the reader at this point that these movements are designed to open up areas of consciousness loaded with psycho- spiritual energies. Proceed slowly. Do not lust after results. This is a good time to discuss journals. If you are serious about your personal work a special journal should be on hand to record the results of your work. This might include feelings, thoughts, dreams, divinations etc. which have occurred after you have begun your practices. This record will be essential if you desire to go further in your Tantric practices. Lie down and begin deep breathing for 20 minutes. Begin by opening and closing the eyes as described above in section one for another five minutes. Relax, sense and feel your body for ten minutes. Now I want you to breath backwards. This means on the inhalation pull your belly in and pull your chest up making the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  175 sound of a wheeze. (This should sound similar to someone who has a very bad chest cold.) Hold the breath for one or two seconds and let your chest collapse. Relax for one minute and repeat the backwards breath 5 times. Relax again and repeat 5 times. Do 6 more sets. You can raise the breathing movements to 10 times as well as increasing the sets to 10 when you become comfortable with this movement. Relax and treat yourself to some goodie. SECTION FOUR Begin deep breathing for 15 minutes. Then as you continue breathing, on the inhalation slowly tilt your pelvis toward your face. On the exhalation let it DROP. Repeat this for 15 minutes. Do not tilt any part of your body except your pelvis. Now slowly bring your knees together on the inhalation and let them fall open on the exhalation. Continue this for 10 minutes. If your legs, or for that matter anything else, begin to quiver or shake, just allow this to happen. (And by the way, congratulations.) Now rest for at least 10 minutes sensing and feeling your body. begin breathing again, this time with your legs flat on the bed. On the inhalation lift up your right leg and on the exhalation strike the bed as hard as you can with it. Now do this with the left leg. Alternate legs for 5 minutes. If the circumstances allow, give out a loud shout as your leg strikes the bed. Now relax. Sense and feel your body for at least 15 minutes. IMPORTANT NOTES Begin with the movements in Section One and work your way through each section to Section Four. Do not begin from Section four and work your way up. Sections one and two can be practiced together. Section three and four should not be practiced together until you feel comfortable with the results of section one and two. Start a journal and use a tape recorder during your sessions. No session should be longer than one hour."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"176    Undoing Yourself If you have medical problems consult your doctor before undertaking the movements. You will be shaky for at least ten minutes after your sessions. Do not drive or operate dangerous equipment. After six months of practice you can try a GRAND session of four hours using all the movements in the described sequence. After a year of practice you can begin to mix up the movements when it suits your needs.

THE USE OF THESE EXERCISES AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF SEX ENERGY The purpose of these sexual practices is to intensify AND control energy and then move that energy according to your true will. RULES FOR USE The creation of Power is the purpose behind what follows. If you have Christian notions that power is evil, or if you believe that Sex Magick is evil then these techniques are not for you. Power is the force of the Universe. The Goddess creates and destroys. Simple? Undoing Yourself 176"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  177 There are many \"occultists\" who are preoccupied with White and Black Magick. There is no such division except when it is based on the philosophy of Christianity or similar slave philosophies. No matter what a person calls his personal practices, be it prayer or magick, its purpose is to gain Power to serve self-defined ends. This is not evil! Good and Evil relate to psycho-physical realities of pain and pleasure, power and powerlessness and nothing more. Power is a neutral concept. What you use it for and how you interpret its use is up to you. If you even begin to use the words of Black and White, Good and Evil you have lowered yourself and have entered the world of fear and trembling. Good and Evil are self-serving concepts which are required when the ego is under tension or attack. In the beginning and in the end there is simply POWER followed by Discipline. The purpose of these rules is to increase the probability that you will be successful at the work. They contain no \"moral\" injunctions or sanctions. The purpose of these movements is to intensify bio-spiritual energies; learning how to tolerate great energy and then how to move that energy according to your desire. Once you have accomplished this you then can call upon this power at will and direct it to your highest ends. It is important to remember that during these practices you are stimulating various body organs and brain centers. We are in fact doing something real. So-called sexual/emotive energy is the essence of all deep change and power. This energy may be used for dream work, insights, healing or whatever you choose. This is left completely up to you. While practicing what follows do not moralize on your activities. Do not discuss your work with outsiders as it will drain your energy and in the end simply confuse and inhibit the practice. Remember the motto of the New Era is DOIT. 1. You may begin sexual work as soon as you have learned the first set of exercises described in section one above."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"178    Undoing Yourself 2. No sexual intercourse or genital contact, is allowed during the practice of these preliminaries. 3. Sexual intercourse is allowed once all of the preliminaries have been accomplished. This will take six months. 4. If you decide you wish to practice these Tantric movements, choose a partner who will not romanticize the process. 5. If the partner is a wife or husband, or steady partner be sure to separate the practice from your normal sexual activity with that person by at least two days. 6. These sexual movements should be practiced no more than once a week. 7. During these sessions only masturbation or oral stimulation is allowed. Begin with the Banishing Ritual in the area in which you will be working. Practice the Middle Pillar for 20 minutes with your partner. Hold hands or make sure that your bodies are touching. (Instructions for the Banishing ritual and the Middle Pillar can be found in Golden Dawn Tape Series I, New Falcon Publications, 1992. Meditate on the heart chakra for 10 minutes.

The female lies on the bed in the breathing position described above. She begins to breath as described above, gently tilting her pelvis forward on the inhalation, toward her head. Be sure the \"AH\" sound is made with every exhalation and the pelvis is dropped. After ten minutes of intense breathing, she stops the pelvis tilt and, while continuing deep breathing, her partner begins to stimulate her genital area with his hands, a vibrator, or his mouth. Timing and control are very important. The major part"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  179 of the stimulation must occur with the exhalation. The rhythmic breathing must be kept up through the entire session. When the female is about to reach orgasm her task is to switch her attention away from whatever it was on, to Muladhara (see below). When orgasm is reached her focus must be on this chakra. The idea is to allow the energy of the genitals to move to Muladhara at the time of orgasm. If she is capable of more than one orgasm per session or if it takes her less than 15 minutes to reach orgasm another practice session is desirable. However, the entire practice session should not last for more than 30 minutes. When it is the male's turn to breath, everything is done the same way, except that he should be kept from reaching orgasm for at least 25 minutes. This assumes that he can not have multiple orgasms of equal intensities. If he can have two orgasms of more or less equal power, this is permitted. Once these practices have been performed for the 1st center (see descriptions of the centers below) and for at least 1 month, you may begin to focus the energy to the next Chakra, (Svadhisthana, the 2nd region), and so on. Each Chakra should be worked 2-4 times per month. If this is not possible extend the six month program out far enough to accomplish this goal. When all Chakras have been properly worked for one month you may begin the next set of movements which include intercourse as described in Secrets of Western Tantra, New Falcon Publications, 1989.

I believe this person was Mahatma Ghandi—or was it Elvis? I once said that if Reason, Common Sense and Logic 2 were the \"Parents\" of man then Mankind would not exist. Now before the reader gets the idea that I am a born depressive let me assure him or her that I do enjoy myself. However, after many years of self work and research I find it best to look the situation straight in the eye—and it is bleak. I have heard every explanation devised to deal with the void, but I find the one which works best is an hour or so of forced depression. This makes the rest of the day free for other things. I will often meditate on the most hideous things, such as flesh falling off my skin, or someone being tortured or a loved one dying. Once I even used a scene from a movie where people were being killed by the thousands. Joan of Arc is a particularly useful image. During the last war (i.e., the media event called Desert Storm) I used the nightly news for material. In fact the news is a wonderful source of depressing and hideous images. In addition, the 1992 U.S. elections provided me with a diversion, although, I must say it was no challenge to my ability to concentrate and meditate. 1 Depression is sometimes a potent sign from the \"psyche\" foretelling that a major change is needed or one is about to occur. In other words, depression can be like pregnancy. 2 I believe I said this to emphasize the point that words like Desire, Instinct and the Will to Power are more fundamental than Reason etc. and are deserving of the deepest respect. 181"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"182    Undoing Yourself Alcohol has also lost its potential to threaten my single mind(less)ness. No matter how much I drink and how much of my mind I lose, I still seem able to focus. While things can always get worse, horror serves the function of a distraction as well as building a strong stomach. Awful feelings, however, provide the opportunity for being cheerful. To be cheerful in spite of disease and discomfort was one of the lessons of the Buddha. In this sense I may also be thought of as a pessimist. A pessimist is someone who relieves his excess energy by controlled suffering. Now remember I said controlled suffering. Set some time aside each day for controlled suffering. By controlled suffering and concentrated depression one not only conserves energy when one is weak but one becomes more cheerful. SOME EXAMPLES Perform your energized meditation exercises. Get into your favorite meditative posture and begin to concentrate on your heart Chakra or on Ajna. Watch all the images pass through your mind. When you have achieved true tranquillity, now imagine that you are in a graveyard. Pick up a shovel and dig up a coffin. Open it up and observe yourself inside. See the worms eating your flesh, watch as your flesh falls off. Create images of all the mistakes and errors you made in you life time. Berate yourself over and over again. Do all of this without losing your tranquillity or your concentration. After you have succeeded at this task repeat the first steps. Once you are completely tranquil begin to create images of your enemies humiliating and degrading you. Imagine them torturing you. Image every hideous thing possible. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated. The next task is to image yourself doing awful things to others. For some this is more difficult than the first two meditations. Next image yourself having the greatest pleasures and joys this world can offer you. Be sure to remain tranquil and concentrated.

MEDITATION: THE JOYFUL Ultimately we know the spirit of a man by the way he defines the Numinous. To say this differently: we know the strength of a man by the way he lives his life in relation to God. These assertions rest on the assumption that the Numinous—the unknown—(Gods)—is a primary need, not simply for protection, or for other utilitarian needs, nor simply for \"meaning\", but for the \"feeling of life\" itself. Without the Numi- nous, \"the wild card\", life loses all its beauty and excitement. If everything in the Universe could be known or controlled man would no longer exist as we know him. Thus, to know the nature of a man we simply must ask how he defines both the Numinous and himself and how he lives in relationship to these definitions. Thus, the God(s) of every culture—like the God(s) of every man—is a sign of its strength or weakness. In this meditation we examine three types of Gods. The God of the Christian, the \"Gods of Africa\" and a God of the early Greeks—Dionysus. We will use a series of seven point scales to give us our results.

When you have completed your ratings write a short paragraph describing the relationship between man and his God(s). Finally, and most importantly, create your own God (vision of the Numinous) and rate Him or Her. Also rate how this God \"sees\" you. This method will provide you with a map of how a culture or a man perceives himself in relation to the Numinous. It will also allow you to make predictions about how a man or a culture will change over time. MEDITATION: GOD IS IN RECOVERY On the llth of February, 1993 I had a dream where Gurdjieff, Crowley, Nietzsche, one unidentified person and myself were off to visit God. He lived on the fifth floor of a seven story building. We climbed the first three flights and the staircase ended. There hung a long rusty chain which we each climbed. When we reached the fifth floor there was God. He was a mess. His hair was uncombed. His clothes were wrinkled. Next to Him was His beautiful Daughter who wore a crown. I started talking to Him and He told me to lower my voice as I would disturb His tenants. He had rented out the sixth floor of His building to a bar and a pool hall as He needed the money. End of Dream. Without going into any lengthy analysis, the image of God is changing not only for me but for \"society\" at large. He is disheveled and so is Western civilization. The solutions to our joint dishevel have been numerous. Some are: Kill God—destroy the world Go back to the old image—destroy the new baby Gods. Ignore the issue (the yuppie syndrome). Adopt someone else's God. The Numinous is not a real issue. Materialism, rationalism, and science. The State is God."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"186    Undoing Yourself Blame—Satan, evil, etc. (This usually means other Gods.) Personality worship (rock stars and the like). Drug out. I have adopted each of these \"solutions\" at one time or another. None of them have been satisfying or fulfilling. My dream, however, points to another direction. God's recovery will come through his Daughter. This not only means something new, but a repair of something old. What might this new aspect be? The Western God IHVH was vengeful. His Son Jesus was forgiving, even of His Father. Both have failed. The Daughter, I believe, stands for the body of man which includes feeling and mind. God and His Daughter are not either/or, but both mind and body. One is not rejected for the sake of the other. Understanding religions or Gods—like the example given in the Joyful Meditation—rests on the rejection of \"something\" and the inordinate \"acceptance\" of something else. It is an exercise of exclusion. As an exercise, list what is rejected and what is worshipped for the following. Christianity Judaism Islam Buddhism Hinduism Dionysus X? God has worn out a facet—the image is broken, yet we humans still have a need for the Numinous. (Before the feminists and the wicca types get carried away with the image in my dream—let me say that the Numinous is a much greater issue than male or female images.) The broken image of God is not a new one. Throughout the history of continents and nations a new image arose of the Numinous which attracted the spirit of those whose old image had worn out. Buddha is an excellent example and so is the Jesus myth. Yet change in itself doesn't imply improvement. Some might argue (and I am one of them) that Dionysus is superior in many ways to both Jesus and Buddha. Yet, Dionysus went"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  187 underground and was mildly incorporated in the Jesus mythos. When we look at the image of Jesus we see a denouncement of this world for another. The new image of God and His Daughter accepts and rejoices in this world as well as the \"Other.\" In this sense inclusion and exclusion is the method. MEDITATION: OVERWHELM YOURSELF WITH POSSIBILITIES THEN COLLAPSE THEN SIMPLIFY Don't get lost in minor factors which obliterate the major factors. All great discoveries \"ignore\". As a rule they \"ignore\" because to some extent they are ignorant. They also ignore because they are aware that certain specific issues can blind one to the major issues. The so-called Law of Gravity is simply one example. There are numerous variables which are involved but the simple ones Newton used allowed him to account for much of what he observed. If he got lost in minor details he might have missed the boat. THE NEW LAW IS: STAY SIMPLE—STAY LEANi This Law—Stay simple, Stay lean—is the basic law of science and \"should\" be the basic law of life. Stay simple, Stay lean has nothing whatsoever to do with dogmatism. It means—don't complicate something until facts force you to do so. Facts in this case includes your own needs. If you are doing an experiment and find something unexpected, do not ignore the unexpected nor throw away old data or the theory used to come up with the experiment. What you do is hypothesize something new and begin to test it in your laboratory.

I have employed magickal ritual, along with a process of brutal self-psychoanalysation, in an attempt to exhume or reveal my \"true\" selves (whomever they might be), and to peel back the masks of my personality as well as remove the armour which defends whatever might reside inside. I intend to crack my shell of self-concept which, I suspect, was imposed upon me partially for my own protection by the King's horses and Men (disguised as educational institutions, parental instruction, religious commandments, social mores, TV, law, and particularly, my own attachment to these cultures). Sometimes, when my shell begins to crack, I feel like I'm going insane, losing my ground, 189"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"190    Undoing Yourself hurling headfirst into Chapel Perilous. I'm afraid that if I cast off my shell in its entirety, I'll disappear; so I hold back. The aforementioned source asked: Do you think Mr. Dumpty was his shell and nothing more? Well, I had always thought of it that way. Yet according to Nature's reality and logic, an eggshell functions as a protector of an egg, the embryonic container of seed-life, that in-definable stuff of potentia which may grow-up to be a ducky, or an eagle, or a serpent, as the DNA desires. When the lifeform has evolved to the point where its chances for survival are decent, the shell cracks. So what's the tragedy? And why do the King's horses and men want to put the shell back together again? Do they want to stifle the life form and keep it from emerging? Are they concerned for its safety? Are they in conspiracy against the new creature, afraid of its power? The eggshell cracks, the force of the serpent slithers forth, and I persist to be my own sledgehammer. BREAK THE SHELL AND YOU'LL FIND MAGICK The revelation of the lifeforce or spark of Chaos which resides beneath the shell of the personality or ego is at the key to living in sync with Universe and co-creating reality to your specifications and will (hereafter referred to as the magickal life). The poet and writer Sherwood Anderson figuratively described the creative human's condition as a pregnant woman inside a suit of armour. When we recognize our eggshells and notice the weight of our armour, we can choose to crawl from or re-form our shells, we can choose to remove our breastplates and go naked (a Zen-like state of No-Thingness) for a while before re-structuring our entire suit; we can choose to give birth to new aspects of ourselves. The shell of our external reality can be cracked and re-formed as well, though the one usually changes simultaneously with the other as any given reality, save perhaps pure mathematics, is transactional; the perceiver plus the perceived result in the artform defined as The World As We Know It. \"We are all greater artists than we realize,\" the linguist/philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, recognizing that an individual's reality is filtered by the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  191 belief systems inherited from societal and familial cultures. The words you think with affect the world you live in. As we realize that we are our own greatest \"works\" of art as well as the co-artists of the world in which we reside, and exercise our talents, we give ourselves residence in the world of magic, happily juggling our self concepts along with our realities. So the preliminary task for any brain change artist is to get rid of his or her armour /shell/linguistic filter and get acquainted with the life underneath. William Blake knew what he was talking about when he wrote, \"I must create my own system, or be enslaved by another's.\" Whose system are you plugged into? In the beginning the shell might be cracked only during times of extreme emotion or during ritualistic practices, when our consciousness is purposely altered—the King's horses and men are really quite competent, the shell resilient, and the armour tenacious. However, with perseverance and time, the shell wears thin, the armour corrodes, and we no longer practice magick, but live magickally, happily splashing in the river of Tao. By the way, the goddess who serendipitously tipped Humpty off the wall goes by the name of Eris. WHO IS THIS EGG-CRACKER NAMED ERIS? The goddess Eris (or Discordia) is the midwife of Chaos, the bringer of creative destruction. For those aspiring to the magickal life, she will be a most helpful handmaiden, a necessary preliminary, an archetype whose invokation is necessary if a New Order be wrought. Let me introduce you to her. She is not revered for her manners, nor her beauty or grace, and as far as I know, there are no temples or statues or odes in her honor (although she is notably present as the tornado which blew Dorothy out of Kansas). Eris is a messenger of the Crone, in that she serves the crone's destructive wisdom, yet she is as not as dark or old or wise as Hecate, but frenzied, flirtatious, quick to anger, mischievous, and \"devil may care.\" Eris is a trickster, a willful reprobate who gets her kicks by shaking things up and stirring the soup. She is the catalytic force of Mary Poppins, the charming nanny who confused the emotionally dead"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"192    Undoing Yourself Mr. Banks enough that he threw off the myopic fetters of the bureaucracy he had enslaved himself to and opened to the love of his family for the first time. She was also the driving force of Timothy Leary, who popularized LSD, a substance which prompted millions to re-examine the belief systems which were handed down pat by the previous generation. Eris is an anthromorphization of the Tower Card in the Tarot, the I-Ching hexagram #23: Splitting Apart, and as the Book of Changes tells us, \"Splitting Apart means Decay.\" But Decaying matter makes fertile compost, and Eris, as evolutionary impetus, brings the sorrows of \"letting go\" as well as the joys of creative opportunity. She's about High Risk—a force which aids in the transgression of our limits, boundaries, and restrictions. The Upholders of the Status Quo or Dominant Culture in Vogue (currently referred to by many as the Patriarchal Entity) condemn Eris as a trouble maker, for she is a goddess of active rebellion. She is the driving force of heresy—spiritual, political, and social—taking pleasure in disrupting the cultural patterns that have outlived their ability to provide real experience and enthusiastically rejecting the formalistic or robotic life which stale cultures often produce. Eris assists evolution, and as she draws her lifeforce from the eternal progression of contraries—worrying not about moral goods and evils—she works day and night to cure stasis of its stiffness. Yet while the hard-headed conservative might wage war against the idea that change is the only constant, the modern brain change technician works to plug into the Prima Potentia of Chaos, playing and flirting with HIr maid-of-honor Eris, taking sweetsour pleasure in the perpetual creation and destruction of perceived reality, death and rebirth. Eris comes disguised as crisis, but in crisis is opportunity. It is no coincidence that the Chinese symbols for the idea of crisis or identical to those for opportunity. The symbols are translated literally as \"crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind.\" Hail Eris! or as Marshall McLuhan put it, \"BLESS culture shock as dislocation of Mind.\" Eris induces culture shock, dislocating the mind and forcing us to discover new meaning!

The force of the universe is free and amoral, and like any energy, it may be harnessed for evolution or regression, depending on the will of SHe who knows how to find and use it. It is easy to see why the Status Quo Police (as worshippers of the One and Only Reality) fear and hate the friends of Eris, and are on the march to anathematize the magickians, witches, shamen, avant garde artists, film-makers, scientists, and computer programmers—those who play in multiple realities—as sinners, criminals, reprobates, and children of the devil. Dion Fortune defines evil as \"that which is moving in the opposite direction to evolution (and) as the principle of inertia which binds the 'good' the principle of creative movement.\" In a Ideological universe, a universe which is going somewhere, the only evil is stagnancy. DISOBEDIENCE IS THE GREATEST TABOO Eris is famous for indirectly causing the Trojan War. Myth has it that having been intentionally overlooked when the invitations were sent for the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (discord is not a favorite during wedding vows), she disobeyed and crashed the party anyway. Spitefully, she rolled the famous Apple of Discord across the dance floor. The Apple, as the legend goes, was marked \"For the Fairest\" and was claimed by Athene, Aphrodite, and Hera. Since only one of the three could be THE fairest, Paris was called to judge the first beauty contest. Aphrodite won by bribing him with the most beautiful woman in the world, who just happened to be Helen of Troy and the \"possession\" (as women were in those barbaric days) of another man. So the Trojan War began. That Eris's apple-rolling, rather than the lust and desire of Paris, is blamed for the War, seems a tad unfair to me—a plot, more likely, to tarnish the name of the midwife of Chaos. Perhaps it is fitting to make an analogy with a story of another Chaotic midwife, Eve. In the Judeo-Christian tradition it was Eve who abruptly destroyed the Status Quo, the reality, of Eden. Like Eris, Eve rebelled against the gods (Elohim is plural) by her willful and fateful act of disobedience. Her eating of the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"194    Undoing Yourself infamous apple indirectly caused the exile of herself and her boyfriend Adam from the Garden. The direct cause of exile was the wrath of the gods who didn't want competition from the likes of their creation. So here we are, out of the safe cultivated, harmonious and static, and into the wild, changing, dangerous, and discordant. However, the Wild World Beyond the Garden is THE place where the party is happening, nonstop. Like Joe Campbell said in his conversation with Bill Moyers, \"When Eve said yes to the serpent, she said yes to the adventure of life.\" It is interesting to note that Apples play an important role in the stories of both Eris and Eve. Is it only coincidental that an apple when cut horizontally reveals the five-pointed star or pentacle (try it yourself)—a symbol feared by the patriarchal systems then and now? Coincidentally, this article is being written on a Macintosh, an Apple computer, which has been programmed to say \"Hail Eris!\" as an alert signal. Many theorists see the myth of The Fall as representative of WoMan's evolutionary move from innocence (blind faith, obedience, and dependence) and toward experience (conscious- ness, the ability to self-reflect, will to change and create change); thus interpreted, \"falling\" was a very fortunate move, a rite of passage, an opportunity to come into our own. Similarly, Humpty's \"great\" fall, can be read \"great\" meaning \"terrible\" or \"great\" meaning \"supreme\", \"fortuitous\", or \"wonderful\". And even though War is never pleasant, the battle of Troy was the catalyst for much change and progress (not to mention a fertile sea of archetype and myth from which artist and poets of past and present might fish from). As pulleys of the rope of time and change, reality makers and brain change technicians can't afford to waste time quibbling as to what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong.\" To eat beef in India is sin; to eat beef in Texas makes you a real man!

The magickian aims to change self, consciousness, and/or peripheral reality in accord with will. Through magickal practice and ritual the magickian aims to cultivate the consciousness necessary to manifest such change. Most occult practices presume a sympathetic model of the planet or universe—a web of life, if you like. The idea that the basic energies can be manipulated is based on the realization that from a certain dimension or when in a more \"sensitive\" state of perception all things are interconnected—the paradoxical idea that we are One, yet Many. While in the reality-tunnel of our \"normal\" state of consciousness, we believe ourselves as autonomic, individual, and un-connected to the whole. But it is not far-fetched to entertain the concept that we are as yet unable to perceive 'higher' levels of existence. Take a model world called Flatland. Flatland is two- dimensional and populated by squares who know left and right, back and forth (width and length), but have never experienced the three-dimensional attribute of up and down (height), and therefore cannot fathom to understand up and down. Dr. Carl Sagan tells an amusing fiction set in Flatland which illustrates some possible problems we might face when questioning so- called extra-dimensional or divine communication. Paraphrased, the story goes: One lovely day a three-dimensional creature is flying above Flatland when he sees a congenial looking square enter a house. The 3-D creature decides to say hello, but the Flatlander cannot see the 3-D creature who is hovering above his house and hears the voice coming from within himself. He questions his sanity. The 3-D creature is irritated at being called a figment of imagination and decides to fly beneath the square and kick him into this alternative dimension called UP. The Flatlander floats in UP for a ecstatic while before dropping back into his own 2- Dimensional world. He tries to explain to his friends that he had"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"196    Undoing Yourself ventured into some \"mystic\" dimension called UP. Of course, the fellow Flatlanders, having no such experience, pat the poor deranged fellow on the back and suggest a visit to the local psychiatrist. You get the picture. VACATIONING IN ALTERNITY When you alter your reality through ritual, sex, drugs, sensory deprivation, or what you will, \"normal\" reality ceases to be and we can access a seemingly \"mystic\" dimension, whether it be a dimension of the mind or an actual dimension of space—an \"alternity\" to use the term coined by Dr. John Lilly to describe such states. Magickians and Shamans of yore knew that too much time spent in the mundane world and \"normal\" consciousness would cause them to \"forget\" alternity and thus sabotage the success of their magick, whether it be healing, precognition, or controlling weather. They knew that the common world view of individual separateness worked as a wall to block the underlying magickal sympathetic reality while bombarding them with doubt, interference, reactionary thinking, and criticism. That is why they took care to break routine now and then incorporating such acts fasting in the desert, strange rites, ingestion of drugs, vision quests, prolonged sexual abstinence and/or activity, and sometimes even masochism, into their lifestyles. Harvard psychologist William James believed altered states of consciousness are the key to magical powers, the key to becoming the artist of our own lives. Altered states lets us put off the cloak of culture and tune into the primary self where the future rests ripe for manipulation, if you will. Dr. James said, \"Actualities seem to float in a wider sea of possibilities from out of which they were chosen.\" Who has done the choosing, you, your mom, your government, your teacher? Who will do the choosing in the future? Magickal reality pre-supposes the existence of a free-for-all power source—that \"divine\" energy which has its center everywhere and circumference nowhere—variously called the Archetypal World, the lifeforce, Void, Atman, Tao, Anima Mundi, Spirit, Chaos, God, etc. This is the stuff from which magick, inspiration and genius stems. It is the thread which"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  197 connects us to the ancient mind, the Great Memory, the Akashic Records, or the Aboriginal Dreamtime, holding the potential of future as well as the tapestry of the past. It is the force which, upon amalgamation and application of conscious will, allows us to speak the language of our primal ancestors: animals, insects, plants, algaes, stones, rivers, and, earlier still, the stars, and, perhaps even to communicate with our future selves. Shakespeare, the enigmatic playwright ( or corporation of playwrights as the controversy goes), is (are) said to be linked to the secret societies which flourished during the Renaissance period. Many agree that Shakespeare hid occult knowledge within his (their) plays, and while studying him in graduate school, I attended to culling any occult material I could. I found a lot, but most relevant to this article is the comedy \"As You Like It\" which, to me, confirms the \"magickal\" idea that commu- nication with Gaia, or the Big Mind of Universe, is achieved by shucking off the mask of culture. In the play Touchstone, the Archetypal Wise Fool, tells us that when he is \"exempt from the public haunt he might find tongues in trees, books in running brooks, sermons in stones and good in everything.\" It has now been confirmed that Magick is an evolutionary Science We hold the information of the Universe within our DNA and it only makes sense to me that we should be capable of accessing this information by turning on the yet un-tapped circuits of our neural system. That humans have evolved to a point where they must take responsibility for further evolution of the species— intentional evolution—is a controversial, but fascinating, concept which has interested scientists, intellectuals, and mystics as varied as Gurdjieff, Aldous Huxley, George Bernard Shaw, Jean Houston, John Lilly, and Aleister Crowley. The film Altered States depicts the protagonist, a scientist very loosely modeled on Dr. John Lilly, traveling backwards through his genetic memory as he experiments with sensory deprivation tanks combined with neuro-active chemicals. He devolves into apeman, and further into an amorphous blob of pulsating energy—pure chaos. Where the film exaggerated real experiments by showing the protagonist actually change into an"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"198    Undoing Yourself ape (and eat the flesh of live animals at the zoo), the point it makes is relevant. Real-life experiments conducted by Dr. Lilly suggested that it was possible to \"visit\" our selves in various states of evolution, but of course physical transformation did not occur. It was the mind which took a ride on a genetic elevator of sorts, allowing re-cognition and realization of the primeval consciousness and/or cosmic consciousness. The point is that we can access the Self beneath the programming and choose to change our minds/ realities, become the meta-programmers of our brains rather than the puppets of the culture we were bread in by applying the magickal formula: Will + Imagination + Altered States. The inter-connected model of the universe or web of life is no longer the limited to those of a mystical/magickal mindset, but is also a model chosen by many internationally recognized physicists as it works in accord with the scientific system of Quantum Inseparability Principle. Bell' s Theorem puts forth the concept of non-locality, which notes that on a sub-atomic level every particle is connected to every other particle. The idea of information being able to \"travel\" faster than light or \"information without transportation\" would certainly explain the concept of synchronicity, magickal coincidence, and telepathy. Dr. David Bohm speculates that the universe might not only prove to be non-local, but holographic as well. This model fits perfectly with the age-old idea that WoMan, along with everything else in the world, is a microcosm of the whole, containing all the informa- tion of the whole—past, present, and future. \"As above, so below\" says the Emerald Tablet of the Hermes Trimegestis, while Carl Sagan tells us that \"the very matter that makes us up was generated by long ago in red giant stars.\" We, along with the blade of grass and the fierce tiger, are literally the children of stars. As within, so without. One needs only to plug into Source to know it, to play it, to create with it, to become alike to the very god/desses we have for so long projected onto the images we worship. SUMMONING ERIS FOR FUN AND MAGICK Mystics, Magickians, and brain-change technicians alike employ ritual to invoke the archetypal mind (which is simply the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  199 art of tuning into those \"cosmic\" signals we normally edit) and to expose and make accessible our power source—the potential energy of Chaos. We enter a \"non-local\" state where our definitions of reality, our masks of personality, temporarily fall away. Who we believe we are at any given moment is always fiction, for we are another thing a moment later; or as W.B. Yeats implied we cannot \"know the dancer from the dance.\" Eris aids in dissolving the protective circle of self-concept by scrambling our programs, confusing us, and ferrying us into the space of No-Form, the lap of Chaos: Hence, we find ourselves in reach of magickal power, in a state of trance, ready to dance a new reality for ourselves. As William Burroughs astutely commented, \"escape routes open in times of chaos.\" Emptied of prior definition and highly impressionable, we use whatever means or rituals we choose to change the station to a reality more in accord with our will, or create a wholly new one. Brain-change technicians are meta-programmers who dance through dozens of virtual realities. We re-program ourselves, clothing ourselves with new belief systems or realities as creatively and as often AS WE WILL. (As I see it, the more often we change, the faster we evolve.) As we commit ourselves to a practice of magickal cruci- fictions, moving through processes of dis-identification and re- definition of our perceived selves and realities, our normal reality changes to a magickal reality, and we soon re-cognize that we are no-thing, everything, and something. The WoMan who practices the art of reality shaping understands what Hassan I Sabbah meant when he said that \"Nothing is true, everything is permissible.\" Formal ritual performed in this Concept-Free state, whether Crowley-style invokations or a Catholic Exorcism, has a high success rate, evoking or invoking what spirits, angels, demons, gods, or goddesses, in the form and style you expect, and as you will. Plugged into the source of your power—the Chaotic Pool of Potentia—you may wish to employ your concentrated will and imagination, thereby utilizing this force to \"charge\" your magickal tools, talismans, and amulets, or to project your desire into the Cornucopian Womb of the Universe.

The Will is very effective when applied in the dimension of potential (Chaos), more so, I think, than when applied to the denser astral or physical planes, where it is can be refracted by opposing wills or sabotaged by your own re-actionary mental processes. Your magick will work, so be certain that you want that which you will. Also, it helps to have some sort of symbol of your desire at hand to concentrate upon or verbalize—a word or mental image will do—so you won't need to regain \"normal\" consciousness in order to remember the purpose of your ritual. Formal invokations should be memorized. HOW SHALL I INVOKE THEE? MANY AND JOYFUL ARE THE WAYS. There are thousands of ways to invoke Eris. You might devote yourself to meditation on the TOWER card, or better yet, draw or paint your own. It helps to get out of your head where all your programs, as well as the potential re-actions to your current programs and future programs exist. Forget the mind; get into your body. Prior to practicing brain-change rituals, prepare yourself and your space by breaking apart \"normal\" reality. Perform a frenzied Erisian dance, whirling like a crazy dervish until you don't know which way is which, stand on your head for an hour, indulge in extended sexual practice or tantra (prolonged sexual activity is perhaps the simplest and most pleasurable way to alter consciousness), or have sex with an unusual person under unusual circumstances. Throw yourself into an extreme emotional state (terror, devotion, or anger), drum until you become the beat, give your ear to dissonant music, or stare at a cubist painting until you understand it. Hold your breath or try Kriya Yoga techniques. Laugh for the sake of laughter and nothing else (listen to the song \"I Love to Laugh\" on the Mary Poppins soundtrack for a couple of hours). Talk gibberish or practice Socratic dialectic with yourself. Invoking Eris in your daily life will take some of the tedium out of mundane tasks and greatly speed up your passage into a magickal multiple FUN reality. A good way to start is to break habits and replace them with new ones, then break the new habits"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  201 and replace them, and so on. Or, walk in a different way, talk to strangers, act \"out of character\" (tell your friends you're performing an experiment), wear clothing which is not your style, explore new routes to work, eat exotic foods, eat on the floor, eat without utensils, write with the hand you don't write with, try to believe in ideas you abhor (except during elections), make love to someone who is not your \"type\". Really. Sex with \"unattractive\" partners is said to have been a favored method of self-concept disintegration for at least one notorious brain-change expert. When pleasure is combined with repulsion, two contrary values are married, your judgment is dissolved, and you are lifted beyond duality into oneness. As you give your former \"static\" reality various Erisian jolts, continuously question your beliefs about the world, your ideas of yourself, your goals and desires. Be brutally \"honest\" and beg your friends to do the same. Find out where you are and why; you can search your \"soul\" more effectively than any therapist. What is important is that you recognize the foundations, scaffolds, and walls of your \"normal\" reality; and demolish them and build anew. To maintain residence in magickal reality keep turning the channel again and again and again. If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards! Evolve! As we become expert brain-change technicians and enter the realm of magick, synchronicities become common occurrences and wishes come true so frequently that one refrains from wishing carelessly. Things just fall into place. We no longer have to put aside time specifically for such practices; instead, we live magickally. Eris provides the necessary dis-orientation and dis- illusionment, both in our rituals and our everyday lives, so we may cast off the shells which separate our essential spark, in all its marvelous and ancient luminosity, from that of everything else in the universe.

I think if you trace the papers back far enough you will find that one of the first owners was called Jehovah. The earthlings had an interesting habit of dividing up owner- ship through wars and then marking their territory on little pieces of paper. The inhabitants of each territory thought they were superior to their neighbors. They conducted primitive genetic practices. The conquered regions were used as experimental breeding grounds. When they ran out of new frontiers and artificially attempted to stabilize the planet, there were four fundamental classes, the Intelligent and Powerful the Status Quos, the Poor and the Criminal. When they invented space travel, the Powerful and the Criminals left, the Poor died, and the ownership of the planet passed to the Status Quo. They in turn reinvented the same four classes and the ownership is again up for grabs.

SCENE TWO The Dawning of popular Western Metaphysics (Or the History of Metaphor) is best expressed by the story of the Tree of Knowledge, when the undifferentiated blissful world of the Garden of Eden was suddenly split into two. Adam and Eve's act of disobedience bore from a womb of peace, a world divided in two, a world where the Master now hated the object on which He craved to bestow His Love. Rejecting God's Love, man became a debtor who couldn't repay the loan, and his future was mortgaged to pay the interest. The primal set of opposites, good and evil, sprang from disobedience, the well-spring of God's greatest gift, man's vaulted free will. But it is the very use of this \"gift\" which inescapably gives birth to shame, guilt, original sin and planetary bankruptcy. \"Intention transforms an Accident into a Crime.\" God gave man free will. God put the tree in the garden and God told man not to touch it. If, as Genesis says, God wished only to bestow his love on Man, what kind of God would set up such a lawyer's trap? Expelled from paradise into a world of struggle and misery, forever cursed for his primal choice, man blindly accepted the verdict and obligation. From the idyllic world free from pain, man found himself in the world of Becoming, of differences and similarities, of epistemology, and of language, a tool which could cut in two directions at once. The ancient Hawaiian's have a proverb which says, \"In language is life and death.\" From the simple myth of Eden with which almost every child is familiar, sprang a world view which, in its extreme, is represented by television evangelism. God is a landlord—indeed a slumlord—but always a Lord. Man is an ungrateful, rebellious slave who can never pay his debt, except possibly by complete obedience, casting his mind and nature into the \"caring\" hands of his frustrated creator."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  205 SCENE THREE Philosophy has \"enjoyed\" centuries of speculating on the fruits of the Primal Disobedience—The emergence of the Opposites. Some of these have been Nature/Nurture, Free Will/ Determinism, Skepticism/Faith Good/Evil, Being/Becoming, Whole/Part, Real/Apparent, Mind/Body Physical/Spiritual, Man/God and other meta-morsels. Any intelligent human being could simply re-create the entire history of human existence by plotting the Opposites, both as independent grids and as interactive forces. In fact we could \"diagnose\" or mirror an individual and an entire culture by simply understanding which position on each scale a group worships and idolizes. For example, the Chinese believe in fate, Americans believe in free will. It Is Amazing How Something Can Evolve From Nothing Opposites have served as an epistemological training ground for metaphysicians who could demonstrate their superiority by turning an apple into an orange. Of course, only those divinely ordained to understand the \"true\" meaning of these terms could participate in the sport. The rest stood in awe and worshipped those who had the ability to understand and apply logic to the dark and mysterious world(s) of Being and Becoming. In fact, today we call these, Gyrations and Viewpoints, all of which of course hold equal value. In today's New Age if something has \"substance\", it is suspected of evil. The problem of opposites lies in the inadequate information gained from the Tree of Knowledge. (See the story of the man in the room above.) When man learned about good and evil he did not learn how empty words are like a container that can be filled with various liquids. Like a child who receives an airplane for a present, and is so delighted and overwhelmed by the joy of the wheels, he never learns that the plane could also fly. The utter emptiness of words gave man an opportunity to fill them with whatever he wished, while at the same time believing the words had substance and existed independent from his own creative efforts. The Opposites have served as a primitive model of classifying, ordering and \"understanding\" the universe. The problem lies in"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"206    Undoing Yourself the fact that Opposites do not exist apart from the mind (or, each other). Anything \"understood\" by Opposites can equally and probably better be understood in terms of scales such as, so much of X or Y. The process of thinking in Opposites create an illusion of Opposition, a world of Conflict, which in fact may not exist independent of our beliefs. In other words, the notion of opposites is not a \"Natural Law\", but simply a primitive survival device with many inter- esting and dangerous uses. If we carefully examine our history we will find that man has torn himself apart with his belief in the REALITY and NECESSITY of Either/Ors. For the man in the street, the philosophies of opposites, particularly Good and Evil, have served as a torture chamber, a crucifix made from metaphor. Thrust into a world which views him as the property of Gods and States and overwhelmed by an un-repayable debt, the metaphysics of slavery and the facts of pain, pleasure and death; bolstered by science, whose theories have become the whores of the state, man is now informed that he is ill. The proof of this is his refusal to submit completely. The world debt is due to his saying \"no\" to total slavery. He will not obey. We are at War, and man is the enemy; the question is: Who is on the other side? Original sin is now ALSO translated into sickness, calling for a new and scientific priest craft. Man is sick, addicted, lame, and dangerous, needing constant protection and supervision by the state, insurance companies, and a never-ending parade of caring, licensed professionals. We are told over and over again that man's illness and addictions are costing US billions. Man, the slave/resource, is causing US trouble, he is interfering with OUR Plans. Man's debt has now increased a billion-fold. Those who question the \"plans\" or the sanity of the metaphors in play, are diagnosed as morally unfit or mentally ill. SCENE FOUR Evil emerges as a metaphor which refers to those who refuse to accept the Plan—the prevailing Garden of Eden—created by God so She may bestow Her Love and Grace. If man refuses he must be force-fed."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  207 What makes the notion of Evil and Good work is the belief that the words have substance independent of the workings of man's own mind and his uncanny need and ability to create FINAL CAUSES. All that is required for metaphysics to function, to perform its magic, is any unanswered question which can be associated with fear and pain. What makes a leader is someone who claims that he can fill the void. THE NEXT SCENE While most humans will agree that slavery is evil—that the ownership of one human by another is immoral—few humans will equate slavery with enforced education, welfare, health, and the idea of a perfect orderly universe. Slavery is usually associated with power over others and with the ability to enforce one's will on another without the fear of retaliation. Within the \"right\" of ownership and debt there is a hidden mystery, a metaphysics, a knowledge only available to those with the power to create and enforce their metaphysics. Whenever a new group achieves power, they also inherit the metaphysics, and magically, the ability to use it. However, an interesting twist has taken place in the entire slave/master paradigm. Enforced education, welfare, health, are for our own good and it is our duty to submit to the treatment This is immediately followed by the platitude that all these laws are necessary for the smooth functioning of society, which, of course, we all observe daily. Without someone to run the show we would have chaos and disorder. This is followed by a SMILE, and the statement that \"things could be worse.\" Modern slavery is not simply a \"Thou Shalt Not,\" but numerous \"Thou Shalts.\" Many liberated humans even believe that it is the obligation of the Masters to care for their Slaves. Of course, what is different is the title-word \"citizen\" and that today's sophisticated redistribution of power shows no blood during family hour TV. We can begin to scent the meaning of evil. It smells of change, contradiction, uncertainties. It is the lack of stability, becoming; the opposite of order, being, peace, the good. Here the confusion coincides with physiology. We have mixed the whole"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"208    Undoing Yourself thing up. We have confused the physiology of comfort, the cognition of stability, beliefs as truth, predictable futures, statistics—with the idea of a Morality. In other words, while chaos, disorder, change and destruction are integral and necessary elements of life on this heavy G planet, we abhor its realization and worse yet, its Existence. This requires the postulation of its opposite as an Ideal, a heaven juxtaposed against earth. A God who loathes his Creation. From this has evolved a need to group act, to over-control and \"normalize.\" We are simply No-Good Shits—by Definition. From this we have created the Idea of the one God, separated from his creation by Evil. The new slavery, unlike the old, not only guarantees that the slave will be punished if he transgresses, but also guarantees stability, order, health and education—by decree. The new slave must let God (State) bestow care and supervision onto her, in order to ensure the continuing \"safe\" functioning of the person as resource. If the person refuses, denies the right of the Master and his Plan, the person is Evil. It is important to remember (the story of Job stresses this), Evil cannot be a characteristic of the Master, only the Slave. When the slave gets smart she reverses the process. Mind and Will are exchanged for a guaranteed future. But even a modern slave cannot tolerate the complete awareness of the exchange. Acknowledging his cowardice and slave mentality would offend his \"pride.\" To cover up the trade, we require more fictions and ideologies. We now search for the enemy of stability, as if it had a face, an identity, other than life itself. And our search for those who cause the discomfort is directed at the rebels: those who dare to question—or have to question—the cage of stability. The rebel, the one who sought and tamed new frontiers, once revered as hero and mystic, is now turned into the sociopath. This transformation from hero to devil is partially a result of the stability demanded by those who come after him (the middle class) to live off the fruits of his courage and struggle, the mass which comes to fill the world carved by those who thrived on nature's unpredictable chaotic qualities. Once the frontier is \"tamed\" Status Quo moves in and demands order. A place where"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Undoing  Yourself  209 they can build their nests and ensure the betterment of their genetic coils. Morality is in fact an invention for the Middle Class. It creates a notion of order and justice in the world. The truly Powerful do not require these fictions and the Poor...well, they know better. What of the rebel now? If lucky, he became wealthy and powerful, and with that, mobile, able to keep out of reach of those who require tranquillity and predictability in order to breed. If unlucky, he is forcibly exiled, jailed or murdered. However, this is not the end of the story, for Nature \"knows\" that it cannot survive without the rebel. She is born again and again, and when born into stability, taming is difficult. The child is incorrigible, delinquent, hyperactive, requiring Ritalin, psychotherapy, special education. If lucky, the child escapes with the deep scars of guilt, shame and self-hatred, but at least having a chance to find its own frontier. If unlucky, the child is tortured, jailed, or suffers from never-ending despair. When there is no frontier for the rebel, the soul of a society begins to suffer. Some, like Wilhelm Reich, contend that the culture can itself be diseased. He referred to this as the Emotional Plague. In the end he was proven correct, not simply by the culture, but by individuals who embodied the repressed counterparts of an ideal. According to Jungian tradition the manifestation or experience of evil results from the repression of both the personal and the collective shadow, sometimes resulting in physical manifes- tations such as Hitler, regarded in this age as the Epitome of Evil. However, what is the cause of this repression but the Ideal itself? In face of this intimation, why still worship the Ideal? As Nietzsche so beautifully put it, the ideal of truth posited by the Christian world, was the value which overturned it. Can we say that our fear and denial of instability or disorder (which in my view is the result of a lack of belief in ourselves as anything but a slave race), be perceived as more devastating than chaos and instability itself? The attempt to destroy evil, in and of itself, is an attempt to destroy life. Accepting that disobedience was the first evil, it follows that any attempt to destroy dis-obedience is an attempt to destroy life.

Perhaps, if we wish to understand what a \"civilized Christian society\" means by Evil, we should dilate on Hitler's aspirations. He saw himself on a Messianic mission to purify and help his definition of perfected man evolve and rule the world. He saw himself and his followers as the Masters and the rest of the world as slaves. He was willing to do anything to see his vision fulfilled, including Usurping the Power of Mass Murder from God (see the Flood). And remember, Usurping itself is a Great Sin. He performed his willful acts openly and told the world what his intentions were. He brought to consciousness a picture of mass evil (something which everyone else was doing, but behind more-or-less closed doors). Was his Sin any different when compared to Stalin, Mao, Alexander, Ghengis Khan, the Chris- tian and Islamic inquisitions, and the hundreds of other cultures, civilizations and religions which have thought of themselves as Chosen, on a Mission, superior and willing to murder for the Ideal? Could we say then, that his evil was simply losing, or was it the \"more important\" fact that he employed violence? If so, what of the American Indian and other races and cultures destroyed by the Christian notion of a pure white race. And what of the Blacks in America?

What is the psychological effect on the slave of the following two statements? 1) We will execute anyone who disobeys. 2) We will execute anyone who is evil. As Nietzsche has shown, evil is an intention serving a purpose. It allows one group to justify its will to power over another, just as it has been used to intimidate most men. REBELS AND DEVILS The rebel with a cause is the person who risks the label of evil when she attempts to remove, or go beyond, the categories of limitation currently believed. Just like the notion of the four minute mile, which somehow became eternally defined as an Absolute, the rebel with a cause challenges arbitrary definitions, commandments and rules, which are believed to be Absolute. Some of these are death, gravity, limitations of the body and intelligence. What we do and how we feel is a function of believing in fictitious limitations which have no basis except in belief. Good and Evil—and Opposites in general—are primitive devices used by our minds to order the universe, and in my view, create an atmosphere of conflict which might not otherwise exist. The meaning and truth ascribed to the various pairs of opposites—including such famous arguments as Nature/ Nurture—are a function of Who has the Power to create Definitions and, thereby, Offenders. If the human mind requires \"evil\" in order to function, let it be death, stupidity, gravity and disease.

In this ground-breaking book, Dr. Hyatt has provided powerful tools and powerful ideas to Undo Yourself. My task is only to fill in the nooks and crannies, as it were, to butter the toast. If I were a Freudian therapist, I would say he has painted a power- ful picture of the damage done to all of us by our own self-punitive superego. The superego is that part of ourselves which demands that we live by rules, not by choice. It is the part of ourselves that loads us down with guilt, with shame, with the rigidity of personality and body which prevents us from living in the moment with joy. Dr. Hyatt has painted the picture of that inner cop and provided exercises you can use by yourself to liberate some of the rigidity of the body. My task is to add some exercises you can use to liberate the rigidity in your personality. But, before I begin, I would like to give you a view of both how an over powerful and self-punitive superego may operate in your life and what your life can be like once the inner beast is tamed. Every child is born in joy. I don't mean the joy of the parents; I mean the joy of the child. Newborn children can tell the difference between their mother's voice and that of other females. By one week of age, an infant shows distress if the mother's face and the voice he hears are different. By ten weeks of age, infants are responsive to the mother's moods of joy, anger, and distress. By three months of age the infant shows a smiling response to the appearance of the mother's face. By nine months of age a toddler can tell when its emotional state is different from that of someone else. When a child starts to walk, usually at 10 to 12 months of age, we can see the child's determination to master its world. During the next year the child will acquire a vocabulary, and by age two will be talk- ing in two-word sentences. It is from about age two to three that we see the most remarkable period in a child's development and one that will have lasting effects. This is the period that uninformed parents often call \"the terrible twos,\" but which developmental psychologists call the period of individuation (Mahler) or the period of self-system 260"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    261 development (Fairbairn, Stern). This is also the period when the superego—the internal policeman, begins its development. It is the period where it is decided whether the child's inborn sense of joy will develop, expand, and become pervasive or whether the child will become locked into internal contradictions and a sense of burden, evil or inadequacy. Have you ever meet someone who seems to just enjoy life? Someone who has a seemingly boundless sense of adventure and excitement even when doing mundane tasks? Someone who has no need of drugs to alter his mind because he enjoys his mind too much to want to alter it? If so, then you have meet someone whose parents did not regard the \"terrible twos\" as a contest of wills between their choice and their child's choice. Then you have met someone whose parents regarded their child as a person deserving of the utmost respect. Then you have met someone whose parents neither controlled nor indulged. Then you have met someone who does not need any undoing. But, for the rest of us—and that is near to all of us—we need to undo ourselves, and that means to slay the savage superego. So, as Dr. Hyatt has pointed the way in this book and has provided you with a number of exercises to undo (that is free) yourself, so I would like now to provide a number of exercises in action and thought to undo yourself. EXERCISE 1 Go into a restaurant and find two items on the menu that you are in the mood for (for example, an egg salad sandwich and a hamburger). Order both of them and eat part of each. Alternate eating each of them and quit one or both as soon as you are no longer in the mood for that food. You can do the same with liquids (for example, tea and coffee). EXERCISE 2 Call up some \"friend\" whose company you, in fact, do not enjoy that much, someone who is not in fact fun for you to be with. Tell that person that you have decided not to see him or her any more. Gutsy? You bet. But undoing yourself means to have the courage to do that which gives you pleasure and not do those things which are only duty or habit."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"262    Undoing Yourself EXERCISE 3 Take any one pattern and change it. The pattern can be the way you comb your hair, the type of clothes you wear, the makeup you use or don't use, the places you go or don't go, the type of movie, book or TV show you watch, etc. Yes, you might be doing something that is not enjoyable; but the idea is flexibility. By doing something that is different, you are able to test whether you still don't like it (as opposed to when you first made the decision). Our likes and dislikes change with time and with experience. What you may have disliked at one time may now be something that you enjoy—except that you never discover that because you never try it. EXERCISE 3-A Do exercise 3 with the same pattern many times. Don't stop at making the change just one time. Initially it is likely that your super- ego will punish you for disobeying the internal law. It will put you in mental jail. But just keep doing it until your internal cop shuts up. When you can do it at will with no self-recrimination and no guilt, then you can see if, in fact, you are not rather enjoying it. EXERCISE 3-B Take another pattern and do exercises 3-A and 3-B again. The more times you do this with more set patterns, the more you will free yourself. EXERCISE 4 Find any building (preferably one with at least 10 floors) and ride up and down the elevator. Each time someone gets in, start a conver- sation. A good icebreaker is, \"How has your day been going so far?\" If the person does not respond, then just go on talking about your own day. The idea is to be able to destroy the beast that says \"don't talk to strangers\" and \"mind your own business.\" EXERCISE 5 Do exercise 4 with people in line at a supermarket check out stand or in a movie line. In the supermarket you can talk about the items in the other person's shopping basket and at the movie you can talk about the movie you are waiting to see or about other movies. There"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    263 is, however, one forbidden topic: that is, to talk about children. That is too easy. Challenge yourself. Undo that punishing superego. EXERCISE 6 Change your church habit. If you go every Sunday, then don't go for several weeks. If you usually attend a particular church, go to another one. If you never go to church, go to a different church each week for several weeks. EXERCISE 7 If you have a sexual partner, change your sexual behavior. If you always initiate or always wait for the other, do the opposite. By the way, the idea here is not to cause trouble; it is to undo yourself, not the other person. Before I bring up exercise 8, I need to add another pointer. When doing any of these exercises (and in doing them with any particular thing or way), there are two good indicators that you are on the right path. One indicator is guilt, shame, or disapproval. The other is anxiety. Guilt, shame, and disapproval all arise from the superego. When you \"break an internal law,\" you usually feel some form of guilt, shame or disapproval. If something is easy to do, it usually means that you are not breaking one of your internal law. Like eating cherry rather than chocolate ice cream, it is only a preference. You could do the one as easily as the other. Throughout this book Dr. Hyatt's has been pointing out how many things are stuffed into us by our parents, our teachers, or our society and how little importance these things really have. To make this more clear, let me introduce a topic I always use with my therapy patients. It is the difference between the necessary and the happenstantial (i.e., arbitrary-nonessential). Something is necessary when it is required for a civilized society. Things like don't steal, don't physically injure, don't play loud music late at night that can disturb your neighbor; these things are necessary for a civilized society. Most everything else is happenstantial. Do I really mean that, for example, not having an extra-marital affair is merely happenstantial? Yes, I do. I have never seen an instance where"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"264    Undoing Yourself it is beneficial in our society, but there have been societies where it is expected and causes no problems. Do I mean having sex on your front lawn is merely happenstantial? Yes, I do. Most all of what we do is happenstantial. It is a custom (or even a law) in our society; but it does not have to be. What about things that are personally harmful like the use of some drugs, or excess alcohol, or being overweight, or smoking, or a num- ber of other self-hurtful activities? Where do they fall? *** Here we come to two tricky issues. One is the idea that you are self-owned. The other is that the law is an ass with a monopoly on use of guns to enforce their ownership of you. *** I would not advocate any activity that is self-hurtful. But I would also say that it needs to be a choice, not a compulsion. It is better to live a shorter life with pleasure than to live a longer life with misery. You are the owner of your own life and body and while your choices may affect others (as for example you might embarrass your children by your weight or your smoking or whatever) still, in the last analysis, you own yourself and what you do with your own life and body is ultimately an issue of self-ownership. Usually we do things that are self-hurtful because these things fill some internal need. These needs can be and often are, expressions of the superego and thus are things to be undone. But that doesn't mean that they must be from the superego. Many times we are unable to do something because we lack the will power, which is to say that we lack sufficient ego strength re- garding something. These \"things\" can be deep within our personality but still be attacked by use of the exercises Dr. Hyatt has presented in this book; they can also be attacked by the help of a professional or through techniques such as weight-loss or stop-smoking systems. As before, we have a valuable clue to when something which is self-hurtful needs to be undone. If you don't like it in yourself, if you feel ashamed about it, if you consider that you are less of a person for it, then you are at war. Then you need either to change the thing of which you disapprove or accept it. A life lived in guilt, in self-loathing or self-disdain is a wasted life. Undo the damage and get on with the joy of living."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    265 That brings us to the ass with a gun, the law. Most law is immoral and thus destructive. Most law should be repealed (\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will.\") But the fact is, the law exists and policemen are trained assassins. We follow the law not because it is right or because it results in proper behavior, but because the penalty for ignoring it is too severe. To give a number, 95% of all law deals with the happenstantial, not the nec- essary. But being murdered by a policeman or kidnapped and held for the ransom of time (i.e., being put in jail) is too great a price to pay. The issue in undoing yourself is to recognize that you are follow- ing the law not because it is right, but because you don't want to be shot or kidnapped for not following it. In short, law is violence, not morality. We have a final small issue. I mentioned that you know you are on the right track when you feel guilt (shame, disapproval) or when you feel anxiety. Why anxiety? Well, imagine that you are thinking of doing something which you know is wrong (by your own moral sys- tem). Would you be surprised that the thought makes you nervous or anxious? No. When we are about to violate our own moral system, our own internal policeman, we feel anxiety. That is simply the way human beings are built. Anxiety is a signal of internal conflict. If you like pasta and you have pasta for dinner, you don't have any anxiety about the meal. If you think snails (escargot) are disgusting and you are being asked to eat snails, you feel anxiety about whether you can do it. EXERCISE 8 Since we just mentioned food, that is exercise 8. Go to a restaurant and order and eat some food that you think you hate. Even if you only eat one bite, it is a start. You can always repeat the exercise at some time in the future and eat two bites. At least you will learn that it will not kill you to eat that food. You can also (exercise 1) order two foods: one that you like and one that you hate and alternate bites. *** Now, two hard ones. If you can get by these two you will really be on your way to liberation."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"266    Undoing Yourself EXERCISE 9 After a light dinner or lunch, go into the bathroom and gag your- self. Many people find gagging to be totally unacceptable. But it is neither illegal nor dangerous. It is just that abominable superego holding up its own book of laws. If God only needed 10, humans seem to need ten thousand. To gag, simply put two fingers into your mouth and press on the back of the tongue or touch the back of the throat. The idea is to let the food come back so if you are closing your throat to prevent it or making a \"ugh\" like sound at the gag then work to simply leave the throat open so that the food in fact comes back up. It doesn't taste all that good, but it sure doesn't hurt anything. EXERCISE 10 Get a large piece of paper (newspaper will serve). Take a shit. Take the shit out of the toilet and make a sculpture with the turds. Let it dry. Disgusting? Why? Simply because you have been taught from the earliest days that shit is dirty. It is not. It is that over-inflated superego that is giving you a kick in the ass (so to speak) and preventing you from any contact with the product of your digestive system. Of course don't eat it and be sure to wash your hands afterwards. Well, now, if you have gotten this far and actually done all the exercises you are a long way toward undoing yourself. From here on it is both easy and more challenging. But I also have to add a note of caution at this point. The superego is one powerful SOB. Like a rogue cop, it will do anything, even to the extent of destroying you and thus itself, in order to enforce its laws. It needs to be brought down, but it also has to be respected for its power. Feelings of shame, disgust, embarrassment, and guilt are its prime weapons. But fear is its ulti- mate weapon. Anxiety, at a tolerable level, is a sign of progress—it is a sign that you are challenging that nasty beast—but if the anxiety is debilitating or preventing you from living the good life that you deserve, then back off. Let the superego win the contest. There will be another day and another challenge. Give yourself permission to let that irrational law (superego) stand for now with the secure knowl-"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    267 edge that in the end it will be your Will, not your forced actions (your superego), that will be victorious. EXERCISE 11 You have already tried a new food. Now let's go at that shopping habit—or the lack of a shopping habit. Adjust this exercise for your budget. If you are a shopper, don't buy anything (except food and medicine and the like) for a period of one month or until you notice a strong impulse to shop. See how long you can go without buying anything. Last year's clothes will still be usable this year. If you really really really think that this will cause you trouble at work (\"Oh, look she or he is wearing last year's styles!\") then buy as little as is possible (and I mean it—don't use style as an excuse; it must be truly needed to not cause stares or gossip at work). If you are not a shopper, then go out and get or do something that you absolutely regard as a luxury (budget considered). EXERCISE 12 As you do this exercise, see how nervous, edgy, apprehensive you become. If you can do either or both parts of this exercises with no hesitation, no nervousness, then you are a gem in the rough. You have wondrous personal flexibility. If you consider yourself to be a polite or considerate person, then be rude for a day. The variants are endless. Bump into people on the street and blame them for the collision. Eat a lot of garlic and then stand close to people when you talk. Walk up to strangers and tell them their clothes or hairdo or jewelry or whatever is ugly. Caution: we are taught from the age of two to say \"please\", \"thank you\", etc. A hundred years ago the great sin was sex. Today the great sin is anger. If this exercise raises too much anxiety, back off and do it by small degrees. Do one rude thing one time and then let yourself relax back to your normal way of being. Then try two times. Work up to a full day. Then work up to two days in a row. If you consider yourself to be aggressive or easily angered or a \"stand up for your rights\" person, then be ultra polite for a day. Walk up to strangers, either gender, and tell him or her how nice he or she looks, etc. This is not a pick up or a come on; it is an exercise. So make the statement and just walk away. Don't wait for a response."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"268    Undoing Yourself Get some food at a fast food place and return to the counter to tell the counter person how wonderful the food was.

These examples of rude and polite are just examples. There are many more you can think of along the same lines. The more you do this exercise, the more it will prepare you for the last one. *** You have now taken a swipe at that overblown, tyrannical super- ego. Hopefully, you now have some personal, experiential insight into how much of our lives, as humans, is ruled by this internal mon- ster. But, before I begin the next exercise I would like to include a little diversion to show how much of your life is ruled by that law- giver inside your head. As this contribution to Dr. Hyatt's Undoing Yourself was being written, the attack on the New York World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurred. What struck me most about people's response was the phrase used again and again when people on the street where interviewed: \"I don't know what to feel.\" Think about that. What does that oft-repeated phrase mean? \"I don't know what to feel.\" Why does one need to \"know what to feel?\" Isn't feeling simply there or not? Isn't a feeling automatic and you do not need to know ahead of time \"what to feel?\" Interestingly, no. Feelings are not automatic; and they are more often than is real- ized the result of the superego, the supposed to feel. How often do we fake feelings? I don't mean just lie about them or hide them, I mean fake in the sense of create for personal or interper- sonal display. There are actually two parts to this tyranny. The super- ego can create emotions for personal or inter-personal display or it can squelch emotions that are \"unacceptable.\" Dr. Hyatt has amply demonstrated how this internal policeman— and a brutal and sadistic cop it is—gets stuffed into young and pliable minds. The purpose of his energized meditation and body work is de- signed to help you put that cop in jail, perhaps in solitary confine- ment. The purpose of my contribution to Dr. Hyatt's fine work is to"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    269 give you some personal experience of how much of your life, your actions, your choices, and your emotions are ruled by this tyrant. Psychological researchers in emotion call these superego dictates \"display rules.\" Different cultures have different display rules and thus different emotional responses to the same situation. An interest- ing study was done in Japan. Japan has a very group-dependent culture. Group consensus is a high social value. The researchers selected a film which would result in the emotion of disgust. Disgust is one of the half dozen or so emotions which have been identified as showing on the face and which are comparatively culture independent. Using a hidden camera, they videotaped a subject watching the film. As expected, the subject's face showed the charac- teristic pattern of disgust. Then they introduced another person into the film studio and this person was told to have no reaction to the film. In the mere presence of another person, not interacting, not talking, the Japanese subject seeing the same film now showed no reaction. 1 The display rules for acting or reacting in the presence of another person took precedence over the display of any emotion. Why? That superego. The social display rules say you only display an emotion when it is permitted by the group (of two). If you like to quibble, you could say: well he felt disgust, he just did not show it. It is a question of some interest to researchers whether one can \"have an emotion\" and yet not show it. At best, this represents a repression of affect and, for some theories, it says very explicitly that there was no emotion. In truth, you are already probably very familiar with this aspect of emotion; you just never identified it as such. If you go to a perfor- mance (concert, play, etc.), don't you have the tendency to react the same way other people around you are reacting? Why do television shows add a \"laugh track\"? They do so to tell you when you are sup- posed to laugh because others are laughing. If the fabricated audi- ence—the laugh track—finds the dialog funny, then you are supposed to also. If the superego did not demand that you think it funny be- cause other people think it funny, then television producers would not add the laugh track. 1 For the scientists among the readers: yes, they did reverse the order. They got the same results. With anther person present, no reaction. Without another person present, disgust."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"270    Undoing Yourself But then, too, there are oppositional people. Their superego de- mands that they react in an opposite way. The superego not only sup- plies the demanded response, it also supplies the excuse: you are an independent thinker. You go your own way. You decide for yourself. You are a person of taste. You are a highbrow or a lowbrow. 1 You think for yourself. You don't follow the crowd. The superego demands, and then provides, the excuse why it is laudatory. 2 But, as the superego creates emotions, it also does the opposite. If you get angry at work you often don't display it because it could get you in trouble. 3 The superego can create emotion and it can prevent it. One more example. Many years ago I was actively involved in politics. Of course, we ran the mandatory opinion polls to see what was important to the voters. We stopped after just a few of these because we already knew the answer. What was important, according to the polls, was whatever had been in the newspaper headlines in the last few days. People tend to think or feel what they are told is impor- tant or appropriate to think or feel. I'll repeat that point: THE SUPEREGO CAN CREATE EMOTION AND IT CAN PREVENT IT! As you work through these exercises and the energized meditation that Dr. Hyatt has provided, you are changing your superego and thus your feelings. As a matter of fact, one of the hallmarks of the person acting at a higher level of psychological development 4 is that his thinking or evaluation of a situation and his emotions (body state) come to be in greater harmony. That is actually a measure you can use to watch your progression through energized meditation to what Scientologists call \"clear.\" 1 The fact that this phrase, coined by a sociologist some 100 years ago, is a body-state description is not coincidental. 2 It may surprise you that the superego also can create or prevent sexual orgasm. Create? Yes. There are actually superego orgasms. Real physical orgasms that are created on the demand of the superego because \"you should be able to have orgasms.\" 3 But aren't you still angry? Aren't you boiling inside even if you don't show it? In a way, yes; but the anger is converted into a physical symptom like heartburn, or ulcers, or a headache. 4 Or a higher level of consciousness as discussed by Robert Anton Wilson in Prometheus Rising, New Falcon Publications."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    271 As you develop, you will find less and less conflict between your thinking and your emotions. This, of course, does not mean that we can escape display rules; it only means that we will display or not display an emotion based on our rational conviction of its appropriateness. It is certainly not appropriate to do the rude exercise at work and it is not, generally, appropriate to display anger at work. That is part of our culture and the price for violation is high. EXERCISE 13 There is going to be a final exercise, a real hard one, but to prepare you for it I would like to add the following energized meditation to Dr. Hyatt's list. The purpose of this meditation is to teach you how to identify your emotions. First, you will have to take on faith until you experience it yourself, that it is extremely rare for us to have only one emotion at a time. Sometimes we are vaguely aware of this melange of emotion. When we are asked, \"How do you feel about X?\" we sometimes hon- estly answer \"I don't know. I feel all kinds of ways.\" As a rule of thumb, at any given moment, you have about a dozen ongoing emo- tions. This exercise—and some will be very good at it almost imme- diately and others will have to practice at some length—is designed to aid you in identifying not only what all those emotions are, but where in your life they came from. (The current situation is only the stimu- lus to the recall of past emotion. 1 ) Broadly speaking, there are three modes of thinking: visual, audi- tory, and kinesthetic (see Monsters and Magical Sticks: There's No Such Thing as Hypnosis?, Steven Heller, New Falcon Publications, 1987). Some people think in pictures. Other people think in words. Still others are best at sensing their own body states and \"go with their gut.\" Here we have to call on at least two of these three. We start with the body (that is where emotion is) and then apply either pictures or words for the next step. Either method can work, so use the one that is easiest for you. 1 For the highbrow among you, this is based on the initial theory of emotions as developed by James-Lange and then modified by Sachter and Singer and on the writings of an obscure Scottish philosopher, Sir William Hamilton."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"272    Undoing Yourself This exercise can be done at any time. It is best done when you are otherwise emotionally calm, but the better you get at it with practice, the more you can use it. You can be having a morning cup of coffee, jogging, watching a TV program, talking on the phone. Any time is fine (except driving a car where it can easily distract you). Step 1: Find any part of your body where you can sense some ten- sion. It can be an arm, a leg, your back, your jaw, anywhere in your body. Step 2: Identify that tension with an emotive word or phrase. If your preferred method of thinking is kinesthetic, then ask yourself: what does that part of my body want to do if it could act on its own? If your preferred method of thinking is visual, then picture a black- board and let the emotion (the tension) write a word on that black- board. For example: You might find tension in your calf. If that calf could act on its own—if it had its own will—it might want to run (i.e., to flee, anxiety), or it might want to kick a ball (i.e., have fun, enjoy- ment), or it might want to kick out (i.e., anger). For another example, the tension is in your shoulders. What do your shoulders want to do? Perhaps, shrug (I don't know, I don't care, leave me alone, annoyance). Perhaps rise to your head like a turtle pulling in its head (fear). Perhaps move your arms to reach out (lonely, need reassurance, need tenderness, want to be held). Perhaps move your arms to strike out (anger). Perhaps to pull them back as in a military posture (courage, determination, stubbornness). You do not have to identify the emotion exactly; sometimes it is an emotive or action phrase as opposed to a word. Step 3: Now take that emotion/tension and spread it over your whole body. I liken this to pouring a can of paint at the top of a wall and watching it gradually move down the wall covering it all in the color. Again this can be done visually or kinesthetically. You can see the tension spreading through your body or you can feel that specific tension spread over your whole body. Step 4: Holding that spread tension (emotion) state, now again scan your body for a new area of tension. While it can be in the same place as before, that is rare and you should try to find a tension in some other part of the body. Once you have found that new tension, again find an emotive word or phrase that describes the new tension. Almost always, on this second emotion, you will spontaneously recover a memory of when these two emotions occurred together in"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    273 your life. It is that past scene to which you are currently responding and the issue of undoing yourself is to see how that past event either participated in causing the present event, or how the past event pushed you toward a specific response to the present event. There is no reason to stop at two areas of tension. If two does not get you to a memory, try for a third pass (identify, grow, scan, iden- tify). There is also no reason to stop at one set of emotions. As I men- tioned, at any given moment we generally have about a dozen ongo- ing emotions (areas of body tension). The more you do this, the better at it you will get and the more you will be able to unscrew the in- scrutable. EXERCISE 14 And now a final exercise, lucky 14. This is an exercise for the rest of your life. It is the most exacting, requiring the most integrity (integrity is honesty turned inward: the refusal to lie to yourself about yourself). Make a list of every trait of yours you can think of. Keep the list handy and keep adding to it over time. To give you an idea, here is a list I constructed from one of my Reichian patients: 1. gets bored easily when reading 2. demands proper manners from his children 3. has trouble concentrating, tends to go off in his mind to other subjects 4. uses humor to make friends 5. looks to effort rather than results (if he works hard, he is doing it right, irrespective of the outcome) 6. pays little attention to his clothes 7. has very limited ability to sense his body 8. is polite 9. has a very active social life 10. is a very attentive father 11. treats life as a series of tasks 12. does not make long range plans 13. is forgetful 14. has trouble with anger 15. has a relatively low (for his age) sex drive 16. generally wants his wife to initiate sex 17. remembers anniversaries, birthdays, etc."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"274    Undoing Yourself 18. is compliant rather than assertive 19. sometimes drinks too much at parties 20. occasionally uses recreational drugs at parties 21. is willing to lie to protect someone's feelings Now, with your list, for each of the traits or ways of being, try to do the opposite for a few days. Notice the anxiety (either in planning or in executing). Apply exercise 13 to find out where the pattern came from. Like healthy eating or exercise, exercise 14 is something you should plan for as part of your life from here on. With time you will add things to your list. For example, something you notice for the first time or something someone else may have said or pointed out. Simply add it to your list. You can analyze it later. DON'T DECIDE AHEAD OF TIME THAT IT IS IMPORTANT OR UNIMPORTANT. DON'T DECIDE AHEAD OF TIME THAT WHAT THAT PERSON SAID ABOUT YOU IS NOT TRUE. Just add it to the list and then challenge it. If you can challenge it without a hint of anxiety or guilt or remorse, then you can perhaps mark it off the list. But better to challenge than to let that superego daemon run your life. No doubt there are traits of which you approve. Let's say, cour- tesy. Nothing wrong with it, as long as it is not a compulsion, as long as it is something you can put on and take off as the situation de- mands. But, if you can't see how to break the pattern, then you are a victim, not of society but of your own internal cop. BREAK THE LAW!!! *** REFERENCES 1. DeCasper, A. & Fifer, W.

Lisiewski, Ph.D. In October of 1980, I completed the seven year in-residence classes of theoretical and practical laboratory instruction in Alchemy given by Frater Albertus, the owner and director of the Paracelsus Research Society (PRS). From that time to this, I have not seen any tribute paid to this modern-day alchemist. Nothing has appeared in print concerning either the Society or his alchemical and alchemisti- cal teachings. Conversely, over the past twenty-one years, I have heard rumors of the most shocking and disgusting kind regarding this man, his morals, the \"real\" purpose behind his chemical and physical laboratories, and even of the layout of the PRS compound setting. Most of these ravings were (and still are) malicious delusions gener- ated by those who neither attended his classes nor knew him person- ally. Others were propagated by some of his own students who were simply too lazy to do the interior (self-examination) and laboratory work he laid out, and who blamed him for their lack of results. I make this statement because I knew a number of those individuals person- ally. Despite this occult mainstream nonsense, several of Frater Albertus' books remain in print to this day, e.g., The Alchemist's Handbook, The Seven Rays of the QBL, Praxis Spagyrica Philosophica, and the collection of Golden Manuscripts, the latter of which he edited and republished in the late 1970's. Unfortunately, with the passing of Frater Albertus in July of 1984, the bulk of what he built up—the entire PRS facility—has faded away. The former buildings that served as the dormitories and laboratories have since been converted into apartments. Other parts of the property were sold off to the highest bidder, while his vast library of alchemical research 276"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    277 manuscripts dating back to the 12th century, were sold to book/antiquarian dealers, or discarded into the trash heap. Only his Alchemical Teachings remain; and those in the minds and laboratory journals of that handful of students to whom he orally delivered those teachings during those incredibly intense, yearly, two-week class sessions—and those who did the work! Upon the passing of Frater Albertus, and immediately before his own death in March 1985, my mentor, Israel Regardie, made the ex- press statement to me that he wished the works of the man and the Society be remembered. In keeping with Regardie's wish and my own desire to once and for all quell the rumor-mill, I have finally set down this curious paper. It contains the facts of the man and the PRS, based upon my ten years of personal involvement with them. That period covers the time I was a student at the PRS and the years that followed the completion of those in-residence studies, right up to the day of Frater Albertus' death. These are the qualifications from which I desire to shed not some little light on the man and mage who chose to refer to himself simply as \"Frater Albertus\"—\"Brother Albert.\" And if, after having labored in the Art and Science that is Practical Laboratory Alchemy since 1974, I am fortunate enough in accurately conveying something of his instructions in attaining to alchemical transformations and transmutations in the physical laboratory— \"Where it counts,\" as Brother Albert insisted, \"where there is no place or room for the confusion and delusion that abounds in the realms of 'spiritual alchemy' and 'soul transformation'\"—then the record will be set straight here, once and for all. Frater Albertus was the fraternal pseudonym chosen by Dr. Albeit Richard Riedel, a German national who came to America in the mid 1930s. As he personally related to one of my classes, he emigrated to escape the forthcoming nightmare he foresaw with the then rise of Nazism in his native homeland. Prior to emigrating to America, he married Emmy in 1932. Without \"Sister Emmy\" and her tireless efforts to keep the dormitories and the students in order, it is very doubtful that he would have succeeded in his mission of bringing Alchemy down into the laboratory—where is belongs. While Frater spoke fluent English, he nevertheless had a very slight accent which he disguised by speaking slowly and with perfect clarity. Even in his later years, Frater, as we simply called him during our classes, was a large man, standing about six feet one inch. His broad, thick frame carried a heavily built body. His features were"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"278    Undoing Yourself typically German for the time: a large face with well-proportioned ears, classical Roman nose, broad mouth, large, deep set blue eyes, and almost completely grayed-over blond hair. He was an imposing figure for any time period. And with his mental acuity and powerful logical faculty, he could have chosen any profession he cared to. His mastery of the scientific method was better than many scientists of my own profession of physics, while his analytical abilities were second to none. Yet, he chose to devote his life to teaching Alchemy, or Parachemistry as he preferred to call it, to those individuals he chose, to attend the classes that he taught at his research institute, the Paracelsus Research Society. The PRS was located at 3555 South 700 East, in an outlying county district of Salt Lake City, Utah. He chose this site to build his home and research institute due to the general climate and snow- capped Rocky Mountains that surround the city. All reminded him of the region of Germany from which he came. This residential setting allowed for peace and quiet during the periods of instruction, with virtually no interference posed by the distant neighbors that flanked the compound on three sides. The compound was situated upon a substantial tract of land. It housed seven buildings: Frater and Soror's large, private home guarded by two enormous steel gates that bore the crests of the Red and Green Alchemical Lions; the two-story main dormitory; research laboratory; a small, single-story home used to house European re- searchers and their families who came for extended periods; a second single-story home that was permanently occupied by two elderly relatives of Frater's and Soror's; and two single-level supplementary dormitories at the back of the property. The main dormitory had two fully equipped kitchens: one upstairs and one downstairs. It had four bedrooms downstairs and two on the second level, with two students per room. Each of the supplementary dormitories housed two to three students each, while the single-story home served the needs of up to four people as well. In 1974 I was twenty-five years of age. Dr. Francis Israel Regardie, my mentor in Magic, introduced me to Frater Albertus in October of that year. Owing to my majoring in physics at university, Regardie considered it absolutely necessary that someone in the hard sciences be taught the ancient Art and Science of Laboratory Alchemy. Both Albertus and Regardie insisted that Alchemy be studied scientifically, and eventually brought into the light of the"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    279 physical and chemical sciences, proper. But this, only after the pecu- liarities of this early science were understood on their own terms, and their claims evaluated objectively. In keeping with their aims and my own desire, I was admitted to the cycle of seven-year classes in February 1975. I completed the seven years in six years, by taking the fifth and sixth year classes back-to-back. Separate application to each yearly class had to made. That is, acceptance for one class did not guarantee acceptance into the next year's class. Typically, re-acceptance was based upon each student taking the instructions for a given class back home with him or her, and continuing that work in their own home laboratory. Each one had to bring their results back to PRS the following year, and demonstrate what they had accomplished on their own. This was a three-day period Frater designated as Show-and-Tell. If—as in most cases—a student neglected to do any at-home work for a year or two, he or she eliminated themselves by not reapplying for the following year's class. In some cases, those who did not actively pursue the experi- mental work on their own still applied for further instruction. They were denied subsequent re-admission outright. There were also some individuals whom Frater allowed to return for several years, even though they staunchly refused to do the required at-home laboratory work. It was his way of allowing the genuine spiritual transformation that occurs from even an acquaintance with Laboratory Alchemy to take hold, and point those aspirants into other directions that were more suited to their personality structure. At some point in the seven- year program, these students also eliminated themselves. At the opposite end of this student spectrum, individuals were admitted who could neither pay the nominal sum for the mandatory dormitory stay, nor buy their own food. In these cases, Frater waived their dormitory fee. He then gave them money to buy their own gro- ceries and personal toiletries. This was done on one condition: that this money was never repaid to him or to the Society. Rather, he requested that they do the same for another individual at some time in the future if their circumstances allowed. He told us many times, \"When you come here for these classes, all of your needs will be tended to, whether you can afford them or not. This is done so you can devote yourselves completely to the work at hand.\" Such was the mundane component of this man's philosophy. Each yearly class of the seven-year cycle was given a correspond- ing Latin designation: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, Quinta, Sexta,"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"280    Undoing Yourself and Septa. Generally, there was one complete, seven-year cycle of classes held at PRS each year: from early February through mid-May. From early September through late October, additional Quarta, Quinta, Sexta, and Septa classes were held for advanced students from America, Europe, and Australia, who were unable to attend them earlier in the year. In the summer months, Brother Albert and Sister Emmy traveled to Switzerland and Australia on a yearly, rotat- ing basis, where he taught students who were unable to travel to Utah. This schedule was maintained from 1960 through 1980, the time when Frater declared that our Septa Class was the final class of the seven-year class cycle. \"The Twenty-One Year Cycle has been com- pleted,\" he told us on October 31, 1980, the last day of Septa Class. \"Yours is the final class of the Cycle.\" From 1981 throughout 1983, the classes were reduced to a Three-Year Cycle. When I asked him why, he smiled and replied, \"Don't you know? My Work here is nearly completed!\" He passed away in July 1984. Each class had between twelve and twenty-one students. As the dormitories were fully equipped with daily living accommodations, it was not necessary to leave the compound, except to buy groceries for the upcoming week. Living at PRS for the two-week classes was mandatory. No one was allowed to take hotel or motel accommoda- tions elsewhere. Nor were local students allowed to live at home during the class period. This encouraged full, around-the-clock partic- ipation by each student in the experimental laboratory work that began on the third day of class and lasted until the eleventh day. On the twelfth day, all experimental setups had to be torn down, labora- tory reports written and submitted to him, and the labs and dormito- ries cleaned and prepared for the next incoming class. The first year class, Prima, was not simply devoted to the basics of Alchemy, but to Frater's teaching a complete curriculum of Occult Philosophy. This philosophy was aimed at achieving a single purpose: the unique discovery and awareness of the Self by each student through answering three basic questions: 1. Where did I come from? 2. Why am I here? or, Why am I who I am? 3. Where will I be? or, What will happen to me after this life? To answer these questions, he taught the principles of Astrology and Western Qabalah individually, and then wedded them by an oral"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    281 esoteric teaching in such a way, that by applying the principles, the first-year student began to experience the Self. Glimpses of the whis- perings of Self and glimpses of the \"I\" forever changed the individ- ual. But the astrology was not a coffee table type; nor was it exclu- sively that which is found in any elementary textbook on the subject. Rather, the Astro-Cyclic Pulsations, as he called his astrological lec- tures, stressed the periodic nature and esoteric principles that lay behind the subject. Each student was also required to carefully copy and color the numerous astrological and qabalistic charts and diagrams he pre- sented to the class, as they embodied Frater's esoteric system of self- analysis and unfoldment. This mechanical procedure he insisted, would aid in the mundane understanding of the principles, while facilitating an unconscious absorption of them. Together, the oral teachings and the individual personal effort produce an effect that would eventually bring about a change or transformation in the spiri- tual nature of the student. This change, in turn, would allow the stu- dent to successfully work in the practical laboratory phase of al- chemy. \"Know thyself!\" were among his special watchwords that he tried to instill in all of us. The alchemical teachings in that first year class dealt with the revelation of the physical nature and recondite qualities of the Three Alchemical Essentials as they are termed in the ancient alchemical texts: the Salt, Sulfur and Mercury; and of the Three Alchemical Processes: Separation, Purification, and Cohabation (to cohabit; to lie together). These were then applied to the most elementary Kingdom of nature: the Vegetable, or Herbal kingdom. As he explained, the process of laboratory alchemy must begin with the application of the alchemical principles to this elementary realm of nature. For it was only by understanding how the Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury of a herb could be extracted through ordinary chemical means, and then recombined through the three processes of separation, purification and cohabation to yield a new creation that lies beyond the province of nature, that the student could aspire toward applying his or her knowledge of the three essentials and the three processes to the high- est of the Three Kingdoms. This would be the Mineral Kingdom, that area of experimentation in which such compounds as the Philo- sophical Mercury, the Potable Gold, and the Philosopher's Stone itself could be obtained."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"282    Undoing Yourself Nor was it enough to be able to produce a simple alchemical tinc- ture of a given herb, although to do so was to produce a powerful medicament for healing the body and balancing the mind. Rather, since the ultimate aim of laboratory alchemy is to produce the famed compounds mentioned, the student was encouraged to first learn how the three essentials and three processes are combined consciously in the laboratory to produce the Herbal Stone: a \"stone\" which not only mimics the virtues of the reported Philosopher's Stone, but which—- through its production—teaches the student exactly those physical laboratory operations and esoteric principles needed to produce the Sunnum Bonum: the Stone of the Wise itself. Thus, the manipulations and principles to which the ancient texts only allude as being neces- sary for producing the Great Stone, are actually taught to the student through the successful production of the Herbal Stone. It was the duty of each first year student to take the processes of separation, purification, and cohabation as demonstrated in the PRS laboratories back home, and produce a set of Tinctures of the Seven Planets of the Ancients for his or her own use. This was done by selecting seven herbs, one that corresponded to each of the seven planets recognized in classical astrology. Each was then put through the first two alchemical processes in order to remove its salt, sulfur, and mercury. These alchemical essentials were then recombined through cohabation. The seven powerful tinctures that resulted were then imbibed over the course of the year. By doing so, gross material was removed safely from the student's physical body, while the qabalistic qualities of the planets were infused into the student's nature, thus preparing the individual for the advanced alchemical work to follow over the remaining six years of classes. It was also expected that each student would begin his or her own laboratory work on the Herbal Stone at home; a process that Frater cautioned, \"would take at least several years to complete. Nature does not give up her secrets easily! Nor does that realm beyond Nature which will enable you to eventually succeed in this 'Little Work',\" as the Herbal Stone is called in the literature. But what of these Three Alchemical Essentials? Just what are they? Do they actually possess a physical nature and occult proper- ties? Are they the same in each of the Three Kingdoms of Nature? If not, how do they differ? And how are the Three Alchemical Processes applied to them? It is not possible in a paper of this length to give very detailed information regarding the above. However, what is"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself 283 given here is the true essence of the Three Alchemical Essentials and the Three Alchemical Processes. This, albeit brief, instruction will nevertheless enable the earnest seeker after the hidden knowledge of alchemy to read the classical medieval texts with great profit, and will open up the kingdom of this ancient art and science to his or her own experimental investigation—if the following is studied closely. As Brother Albert explained in that Prima Class, the alchemical 'Salt' is the body of the herb, animal, or mineral. It is that which is left after the natural form has been reduced to its essentials by Fire. This 'body' is the same in all Three Kingdoms of Nature. That is, a substance with salt-like qualities and appearance, and whose chemical nature is basic, not acidic. It is the product of final reduction. It will undergo a change-of-state as it is purified—one that reflects the Supernal Triad on the Tree of Life. That is, it will pass through the color changes from black, to gray, to white—passing from Binah to Chokmah to Kether—as it attains purity. This is not only true of the Salt in the Vegetable Kingdom, but of the Salts in the Animal and Mineral Kingdoms as well. When it reaches the final stage of white, it can defy physical laws as we know them. An example being, the puri- fied salt can literally rise up from the surface upon which it is under- going purification, and float in the air. I have personally witnessed this a number of times, and have satisfied myself that air or thermal currents from the heating-purification operation have nothing to do with this phenomenon. The alchemical 'Mercury' is the esoteric Life of the substance being worked with. It has different 'vehicles' depending upon the Kingdom of Nature in which the individual is working. In the Vegetable (Herbal) Kingdom, the vehicle of the Life is an alcohol. It is obtained directly from the herb being worked on by the technique of fermentation, and extracted by simple train-distillation. In the Animal Kingdom, the vehicle is the blood. In the Mineral Kingdom, it is an alkahest, and is removed from the mineral, e.g., antimony, by first subjecting the mineral to a sub-process of Separation called digestion. In this step, a menstrum, or other liquid medium capable of binding with the alkahest, is first added to the mineral. In the case of antimony, the menstrum remains combined with the alkahest for use. The menstrum used with antimony to achieve this is common 190 Proof grain alcohol. This is used in preparing the Unfixed Tincture of Antimony. For producing the Fixed Tincture of Antimony, the previ- ously prepared antimony is 'treated' with 6 N acetic acid in order to"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"284    Undoing Yourself 'fix' its Mercury. The resulting antimonious acetate is then extracted, using grain alcohol in order to separate the antimony's Sulfur and Mercury for use. In the case of lead when the 'Great Work' is attempted, the men- strum is removed from the alkahest after digestion by another Separation—repeated distillations, the first of which is through simple train-distillation. The remaining distillations are only accomplished through laborious distillations using extremely exotic glassware that must be specially designed by the student and blown by a master glassblower. The alchemical Sulfur is the occult Consciousness of the substance under investigation. In all Three Kingdoms of Nature, its vehicle is an oil. That is, a physical substance whose common qualities of viscos- ity, odor, and appearance resemble that of an oil. In the Herbal Kingdom of Nature, due to the minute quantities present, the oil is separated by the ordinary chemical process of dry distillation. Normally, many pounds of the fresh herb must be treated in this man- ner due to the exceedingly minute quantities of oil present in herbs in general. The Sulfur is removed prior to the fermentation. In the Animal Kingdom, the sulfur is obtained from the yoke, that part of the embryo which produces the veins, arteries, and blood of the animal. This Sulfur is extracted through an ether separation, a process that is actually easier than it sounds. In the Mineral Kingdom, the Sulfur is obtained from the alkahest, as it is bound with it by nature. This latter separation is not exceptionally difficult with, e.g., antimony. It is extraordinarily difficult when working with lead. As to the preparation of the Herbal Stone, or, accomplishing the Little Work. After the student selects the herb to work with, it must first be dry distilled as stated earlier in order to obtain the alchemical Sulfur (Consciousness) of the herb (Separation). Following this, it is fermented to produce an alcohpl, which is actually a 'wine' of the herb which will contain the alchemical Mercury—the Life of the herb (Separation). This alcohol must then be separated by successive train- distillations to obtain the pure alcohol of the herb. After the Sulfur and Mercury are obtained—and according to their natural propor- tions as established by Nature —the herb, now referred to as the 'feces' of the herb, must be incinerated to reduce its gross body (Puri- fication). The first color achieved here is that of black (corresponding to Binah). In this state, the black ash is referred to as the Caput Mortem or, Death's Head."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    285 Following this, the black ash is placed in a unglazed earthenware dish and calcined (varying degrees of heat applied with a Fisher burner), to further reduce its mass by separating the essential from the nonessential parts of its physical nature. An unglazed dish is used to allow the ashes to breathe as the heat of reduction is applied. That is, air flow will occur from the bottom of the dish propelled by the flame beneath, and move through the pores in the dish, completely remov- ing that which is unessential in the process. This is a very important consideration. As the calcinations proceed, the black ash will turn to a dark gray, and finally—after approximately seven days of continuous calcina- tion—to a light gray (a correspondence to Chokmah). The purifica- tion is continued for weeks or months—day and night—until the salts appear as a white, powder-like substance in the dish. These are the true alchemical Salts of the herb. Their essential Quintessence have a color and occult correspondence to Kether. The beginning of the Little Work proper now commences. It must be remembered, as Frater Albertus stressed to us in class, the creation of the Herbal Stone is not simply a product of mechanical manipula- tions as employed in an ordinary chemical laboratory. Rather, since the Stone's creation is said to reflect the state of genuine, not imag- ined, spiritual development of the student, success will only be ob- tained when the inner process of growth and the outer manipulations in the laboratory have achieved harmony. Hence the reason that it may possibly take years to produce. The pure white Salts are now placed in a \"Pelican's belly,\" as the medieval texts refer to a retort, and the slow process of imbibition with the Mercury (alcohol) and the Sulfur (oil) begun. Drop by drop, the Sulfur and Mercury are added to the white salts until the salts take on the color hue of the Sulfur, and a semi-viscous mass results. This mass is left to cohabate (\"lie together\") in the retort, until a distillate appears in the arm of the retort. When the clear distillate reaches the lip of the retort, it is collected and saved. This highly volatile liquid is referred to as the \"Sharpened Mercury of the Stone.\" The process of imbibition continues over months, until the semi-viscous mass cannot accept anymore fresh Sulfur-Mercury combination. As the mass con- geals and nears its endpoint by refusing to accept additional fresh Sulfur and Mercury, the worker must swirl the retort. As this is done, the mass will roll into a stone-like object. Now the final process of imbibition begins."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"286    Undoing Yourself The Sharpened Mercury of the Stone is now applied to the hard- ened mass in the retort, drop by drop, over weeks or months. The small 'stone' in the retort will now accept this more volatile Mercury. At some point the stone will refuse to accept anymore, evidenced by an even more highly volatile clear liquid being given off by the stone, and condensing in the arm of the retort. At this point, it is necessary to smash the retort in order to remove the stone-like object. Finally, the object is placed in a glazed crucible, and Fire applied in ever-increasing degrees of temperature until the stone-like object hardens into what literally appears to the sight and touch as a 'stone.' I used a highly regulated, thermocouple-temperature sensing, solid state Blue M Muffle Furnace in my own work. The temperatures used began at 100° C (Celsius), the work being completed at 1,000° C. While the stone is forming throughout the degrees of heat, it must be re-imbibed with the Sharpened Mercury after each treatment in the furnace. It is this final action that brings the stone to completion. The finished Herbal Stone will be pure white in color, extremely hard, and extraordinarily heavy. The stone is tested by wrapping one end of an ordinary string around it, and attaching the other end of the string to a pencil. Several ounces of any dried herb are placed in a large glass vessel, e.g., a 2-Liter beaker, along with approximately 1.5 liters of plain tap water. After the herb becomes saturated with the water, it will of course, sink to the bottom of the vessel. The stone is then added to the beaker, such that it is suspended by the string-pencil combination at a point just below the water surface. What happens next is beyond the explanation of everyday science. Depending upon the maturity of the stone, in a few minutes, the heavy, saturated mass of herb on the bottom on the beaker will float to the top of the water, and surround the stone. It will remain there for hours, after which it will sink back down to the bottom of the beaker. A few hours later it will float back to the surface again. This time, in only minutes, it will sink back to the bottom where it will remain. But floating on top of the water's surface will be found the entire Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury of the former dried herb. The Mercury-Salt- Sulfur combination is now simply spooned off and consumed by the worker as a powerful herbal medicament. In brief, the action of a functioning, mature Herbal Stone, is to remove the Life, Consciousness, and Body of a raw herb and concentrate it in a very brief period of time. The stone is then simply washed off and stored"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself 287 away for future use. It remains a permanent object, refusing to dis- solve even in weak acids. I should point out that there are several ways to make a Herbal Stone, all of which were discussed in detail at the PRS during subse- quent class years. These other methods include making the stone from the light gray Salts as well, or from the water-soluble Salts that can be 'leached out' of the gray Salts. I have provided a few references at the end of this paper for those interested in pursuing this Work. In my own case, I made four stones by four different methods, and demonstrated their action to Frater Albertus and my fellow students in my combined Quinta-Sexta Class in 1979. It took four years of work to unlock that within myself which was necessary to create this alchemical material. The knowledge and experience of the alchemical procedures involved, and that which the final Herbal Stones 'conveyed' to me, are invaluable. The next three years of classes, Secunda through Quarta, were concerned with working in the Mineral Kingdom of Nature. That is, expressly with antimony. Occurring in nature in the deadly form of antimony trisulfide, this mineral is always found bound up with arsenic. Frater explained to us that Nature hides its most precious medicines among its deadliest poisons. To unlock the secrets of the alchemy behind the laboratory operations, Frater gave each of us a copy of A. E. Waite's translation of The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony. Written by the German Benedictine Monk, Basillius Valentinus (Basil Valentine) in 1415, and first published in 1604 through the efforts of John Tholden Hessius (Johann Theolde), those three years of classes were spent going over the entire volume sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, and page-by-page. Frater's initiated comments and further explanations along the way opened our eyes to the incalculable value of the manuscript before us. From the Unfixed and Fixed Tinctures of Antimony made from the 'fume' and the qabalistic colors of the Glass of Antimony this ele- ment produces when exposed to heats of 900°C. to 1800° C.; to the secrets of preparing the Krikrum Menstrum and the Sulfur of Antimony; to the final preparations of the \"Butter of Antimony\" and the methods of their safe, proper and natural use—all were covered in minute detail before their preparation was demonstrated for us by Frater in the laboratory. \"Know the theory before attempting the praxis!\" was his razor call before attempting any practical laboratory work in alchemy. As with each year's instruction, we took the knowl-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"288    Undoing Yourself edge we were given back to our homes and labored to reproduce the results on our own, prepared to show what we achieved during the next year's Show-and-Tell sessions. The reader would do well to remember, that if the explanations of the Three Alchemical Processes and the Three Alchemical Essentials are applied to The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony in a thoughtful way, the secrets laid out by Basil Valentine in that important work will open before your eyes. In the fifth year class, each of us was given separate laboratory space and all equipment needed. We were allowed to work for the two week period on our own, reproducing or perfecting any of the antimonious marvels we had investigated in our home laboratories, and compare results with our fellow classmates. As with each class, extensive laboratory reports were prepared before the two week period ended, and submitted to Frater for evaluation and permanent storage. The curriculum for the final two classes, Sexta and Septa, was determined by Frater according to the makeup and complexion of the students who succeeded in completing the Seven Year Cycle. In some classes, work began on the \"Green Lion;\" others began their work on the \"Philosophical Mercury,\" while yet others worked on the \"Potable Gold.\" My class was instructed in what is reputed to be the darkest corner of alchemy: the \"Water Work.\" It is a subject in which I was intensely interested, and which I spoke privately to Frater about in earlier years. This work is based upon the theory and practice set down in The Golden Chain of Homer, a private manuscript translated from a Latin work circa the fourteenth century first into French and then into German. The English translation used was derived from the first German publication that appeared in Leipzig in 1723. It deals with the production of a substance termed \"Gur,\" or the \"Pre-Adamic Earth,\" from which the Three Kingdoms of Nature themselves can be gener- ated. In other words, this is the primal base material from which all Creation arose. In the Christian-dominated Europe of the day, it is easy to see how this area of alchemical experimentation received the title of \"Nature's darkest corner.\" My interest lied solely in generating the Animal Kingdom of Nature. That is, to start with, the generation of small crustacean-like creatures Homer reported could be 'created' from simple rainwater, which was the foundational material of Homer's entire manuscript. What makes this work unique, is that this water must be collected"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    289 during a violent electrical thunderstorm, following which it must undergo the process of \"putrefaction\" (chemical breakdown). The putrefaction produces the Gur, or Pre-Adamic Earth, which precipi- tates out of the water medium as a grayish, string-like substance. Following this, the experimentalist must obtain the \"Water of Air, Water of Earth, Water of Water and Water of Fire,\" by successive distillations of the electrified and putrefied rainwater. These 'waters' are then used in certain combination to imbibe the dried Gur. It is from this process that the creatures of the Animal Kingdom referred to above are generated. It is, as it were, an early experiment in Spontaneous Generation. However, the Golden Chain reports that the creatures generated do not fit any known species or genus. Approximately 200 gallons of rainwater of the type described are required to begin the process. Our experimental efforts in this corner of alchemy were limited while at PRS due to the putrefaction and distillation times required: six months to one year. But that work did begin, and the progress made demonstrated to us that there was indeed a basis in fact for what was written in the manuscript. I continued the Water Work after completing the seven years of classes, and produced two papers which were published by Frater in his journal Essentia: Journal of Evolutionary Thought in Action. The first paper was entitled \"The Analytical Technique Applied to the Water Work: A Modern Approach.\" It appeared in Volume 1, Winter 1980 issue. That essay dealt with the very real everyday problems encountered in collecting and handling such a massive quantity of rainwater. Modern techniques of 're-electrifying' the water and effec- tively putrefying and distilling it were also given, such that other contemporary workers could also delve into this alchemical branch of Nature's mysteries. These techniques were based upon my own suc- cessful efforts. After two more years of work, my second paper, \"On the Generation of Animals\" was published in the Essentia journal, Volume 3, Summer 1982. The cover of the journal featured a color photograph of the Gur-Water combination and the crustacean-like creature that was generated by the Homeric process. The paper itself, complete with numerous photographs, explained the process com- pletely in everyday terms so others working in the field could repro- duce the results for themselves. As stated by Homer, the crustaceans"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"290    Undoing Yourself that resulted could not be classed into any species or genius when given to zoologists and biologists to identify. Following these successes, Frater and I had several private discus- sions regarding what is traditionally described as the blackest area of this dark corner of alchemy: the creation of an \"Homunculus.\" This was the single goal to which I directed my alchemical investigations after completing the seven years of PRS classes. According to legend, this creature appears as a miniature human being. That is, it is made from the Salt, i.e., possesses a physical body, which is infused with the Mercury, or Life itself. But it does not possess a Soul, or 'consciousness' in alchemical terms. It is up to the alchemist to work with such a creature, and give it a purpose to fulfill. The Salt for this Grand Experiment is the Gur, or Pre- Academic Earth. The 'Mother Earth' in this context is the Body. The Mercury or Life must come from the \"Father.\" That is, from the alchemist himself. For in this particular realm of alchemy, only a male alchemist can generate the Homunculus, as his seed must impregnate the Mother Earth. After the impregnation occurs—as with a human child—the cycle of development and growth begins. The rest is left up to the reader to fathom—or to \"reproduce.\" In closing, it is my sincere hope that the knowledge and instruction presented herein will serve to forever dispel the gross accusations and pseudo-intellectual diatribe leveled against the genius and man who was Frater Albertus—Dr. Albert Richard Riedel. His initiated under- standing and love of knowledge and wisdom opened up the secret paths of Alchemy to literally thousands of individuals throughout the world. That work is still being carried on today in the private alchem- ical laboratories of those few of his students who persist in carrying out his highest axiom: \"Work!\" SUGGESTED READING The following books, when used with the information provided in this paper, will help the desirous student to unlock the mysteries of the Three Kingdoms of Nature. — Frater Albertus.

Her tongue began to loll out of her mouth and her eyes rolled upwards. Suddenly she was a dead weight in my arms. I orgasmed violently!!!!!!!!!! Then I gently lowered her unconscious body to the ground. Her eyes fluttered opened, and she smiled softly. I held her in my arms the remainder of the night—both of us content and at peace—dreaming of the next way I would kill her during our sex. That was no fantasy. In addition, we aren't the only couple having such sexual experiences. How dangerous that was you are thinking? She could have died. Yes, it was dangerous, and she could have died! How perverse and evil that act must be thinks that conditioned reli- gious response gnawing at your soul. Yes, it is deliciously evil! She must be a masochist, and he must be a sadist you rationalize. After all, that is still covered in the DSM IV. That is the reason for their behavior. Ah, yes, that is it. It was just a twisted S&M game. Ah, if only the intricacies of the human psyche were that simple to explain. A hundred plus years of psychology and neuroscience really just gives us more labels to place on our behaviors and ourselves, but are we more liberated and truly free because we think we understand why we are the way we are? Eros and Thanatos. Love and Death. Creation and Destruction. The polarities are endless. At the tender age of four, I remember having my first sexual fantasy. I would lie on the mat on the floor in the local daycare and images of my beautiful Mrs. Church being hung slowly would excite my little body and mind. By age 9, I had a love of horror movies because I could see images of beautiful women being terrorized and killed. Of course, my favorites always involved asphyxiation of some type. By age twelve, I was masturbating to these images. I hid these desires so well during those teen years, but I was constantly plagued with thoughts that I must somehow be fucked up. I was a serial killer in the making, right? So, that's when the search for answers began. I read the details of all the great serial killers of modern history and the psychological analyses of their be- haviors and life. Nevertheless, something was wrong. I didn't torture small animals like they said I should. The thought appalled me. I didn't perpetrate violent acts towards my younger siblings or friends. My father wasn't violent and my mother wasn't seductive. OK, I had"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"294    Undoing Yourself to keep searching. I moved on to the greats. Freud understood and labeled the twin instincts of Eros and Thanatos, but his Victorian writings hinted at nothing of their uniting during the sex act. Maybe Jung would hold the key. Ah, this must be a shadow side of myself. I must secretly hate women or some other dark horror existed there within this waking dream. College came and went. My first lovers were ultimately boring to me. Yes, they were beautiful and at times I even orgasmed. Yet, something was missing. My masturbatory fantasies were far more exciting as I watched Hitchcock's Frenzy with Barbara Leigh-Hunt strangled in her office chair so deliciously. Then that fateful day ar- rived when the unstoppable urge for the union of the opposites oc- curred. I had a lover whom I strangled during sex. I remember only that she came hard and was shocked and scared. I blacked out. I awoke naked and cold sitting in the chemistry-building stairwell with her and a friend trying to cajole me into clothes. Ah, Virgil, the jour- ney had just begun. I first saw a Christian counselor on campus. She attempted to convince me that my collection of Playboy's and my having sex out of wedlock were to blame for my strange and perverse behaviors. Our therapeutic relationship didn't last long! Next came the Freudian while I was in graduate divinity school attempting to deny those dark desires. He was certain that I must hate women and that stemmed from my love/hate ambivalence towards my mother. Maybe he was on to something. My mother and I had a strained relationship. Later I was to discover that it was because we were both so damned equally willful and neither of us was willing to budge. So, that didn't explain my sexual desires fully. By now, I had met a perfect lover. She was a drug addict and lived most of her life in a Heroin haze. My strangling her to unconsciousness during sex was nothing new to her. And she was so fucking out of it most of the time that it never really crossed her mind to determine that maybe I might accidentally or even pur- posefully hurt her. Ah, but I still struggled inside to reconcile with and understand this hungry beast. The next guy was a psychiatrist. I can only imagine what he thought my issues were, but it became abundantly clear that he wanted to lock me up. I packed my bags and left the state the next day. More lovers followed. Some I practiced erotic asphyxia with and some I didn't. Counselors came and went.

I breathed. I cried. I kicked and flayed about on mats on the floors. I was rebirthed. I got Rolfed. Hell, I even got acupuncture. By my mid twenties, I was a counselor and a healer having studied and participated so fully in all my own explanations. I denied my desires with some lovers and ex- pressed them with others. I pushed my own boundaries. Did I want to secretly be asphyxiated myself? Tried it, and nothing happened. Was I gay? Tried to have that experience and nothing got stimulated there either. OK, so now what? Traditional religions and therapies didn't hold the answers. Perhaps non-traditional ones might. Hypnosis re- vealed some sexual abuse from my past by my grandfather. Well, that must be it, right? Nah, I was abused at an age after I had already begun having such fantasies. Maybe it was my Mars conjunct Neptune in Scorpio. Yeah, that fit. But all that did was describe what I already knew. It really didn't offer any answers as to where it came from. Or did it? Was I beginning to come to the slow realization that I simply was this way from birth. What a novel concept. Jung said that the goal of human development was not perfection but rather integra- tion. Gay friends would struggle to tell their heterosexual friends that they felt attraction for their same sex at an early age. It was just natu- ral for them. Was it simply natural for me to feel turned on by death and the act of murder? My first wife came and went. She didn't know of my desires until she married me. She tried to accommodate them but ended up seeing me as the personification of everything evil she had dejected in her- self. The clinical sexologist was next in the exploration of Virgil's dark psyche. \"Sexuality is a continuum,\" he said, \"We all fall some- place along it.\" Eureka, I thought, finally something that made true sense. I embraced my desires. I sought out others who shared it. I joined secret sex sites scattered through out the web of other \"necro\" lovers. I wasn't alone. There were others. Some, like myself, loved the noose and the thin cord around their lover's throat. Others wanted the sharp blade and the blood. Still others went to a place that I never wanted to go—they wanted to have sex with the dead. There are sites out there with images of dead women laying on slabs. Men fantasize about sex with them and in the forums they struggle with this desire that has led them to become morticians and EMT's.

Out of all of her lovers, I understand her the best because I have been to that dark place in my own psyche where my sexuality is not able to be easily labeled or understood. I surrendered to the dark sides of myself and have found the integration. This is the goal of all true Tantric systems. So, why I am this way? Does it matter? Is there any rational expla- nation?

I followed him along a path that wound its way around the back of the hut where the W.W.II vin- tage vehicle sat parked under a somewhat rusted, make shift tin-roof structure. He briskly jumped into the driver's seat, cranked the engine a few times as I situated myself in the front passenger seat and after several attempts the high bishop started the engine and off we went. \"And we'll pick up Jason along the way,\" he said, \"He should be ready, that is if he's not drunk on his ass.\" We sped our way down the sandy coast as I sat quietly gazing out over the moonlit ocean that surrounded the island. \"There they are,\" declaimed the pontiff as he looked out over the black chrome sea. \"There is what?\" I questioned. \"The three stars,\" he retorted. He then pointed his finger towards the heavens that embraced the utter dark- ness of the flat and briny liquid expanse that lay only a few feet from the path of the speeding jeep. As I scanned the South Pacific skyline for three specs of distant light he retrieved a cigarette from his shirt pocket, lit it and continued to push forward through the cooling tropi- cal night air. After we had traveled about a mile or so I began to notice bits and pieces of some form of wreckage poking up out of the sand here and there. Soon it became apparent that what I was seeing was the re- mains of some long forgotten military skirmish. Various fragments of late twentieth century helicopters, armored vehicles, rusted wheels and ripped up tires littered the once pristine beach. \"This is only one of our monuments to the Great War,\" came the voice of the Dr. over the rumbling drone of the speeding jeep. \"Why they would even look for us out here is still beyond me,\" he half-hollered over the unrelent- 298"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    299 ing noise of the engine, drive train and the slender all-terrain tires that ferociously spun their way through the wind blown sand. \"We put up a good fight until we decided that playing dead would be a far wiser decision then giving them cause to call in reinforcements. We simply disappeared into the shelters and they flew away happy. They would have annihilated us if we hadn't of done so... But it was their Christian duty,\" he half humorously sneered. \"They were, after all, the initial catalyst for the eventual genocide of almost ninety-nine percent of the world's population, and all in the name of Jeeeesus!\" Just then, he reeled off sharply to the right causing us to leap over the crest of a sand dune in the process. When we touched down I released my grip from whatever it was I instinctually grabbed as the jeep suddenly went airborne for several thrilling seconds. I then took the liberty of snatching a cigarette out of the Dr.'s shirt pocket. I pushed in the cigarette lighter on the dash and looked up at the heav- ens. \"If one could count the stars, one might then know the meaning of infinity,\" I thought to myself as I tilted my head back and contem- plated the star laced & ebon firmament above us. As I silently considered the possibilities that existed within the boundlessness of eternal space & time I could feel the velocity of the night air against my face gradually lessen. The Dr. then began to brake & downshift slowing the dogged little jeep to a snail's pace. I lowered my gaze and looked out through the distinctly rectangular, split-in the-middle windshield. Ahead of us was what appeared to be a substantially large boulder in the middle of the beachhead. \"I think you're gonna really like this,\" said Dr. H as he pushed a little black button at the top of the dashboard. Like magic, the huge obstruction ahead began to split and separate as slender beams of light slipped through the newly created fissure. As the aperture directly before us grew wider it became increasingly apparent that the opening ahead led down into a well-lit and surprisingly capacious parking structure. \"Are you ready Jason?\" intoned the Dr. in a rather teasing sort of fashion to the man who stood waiting for us at the bottom of the ramp. Me ready? replied Jason with a quite obvious hue of amuse- ment in his voice. \"The question is: are you ready this time dear Dr.?\" Jason then walked off a short distance in one direction as we pulled off and headed in the other, the Pope giggling under his breath whilst muttering something or other about all his friends being Qlipoth. 'This is as far as we will be going in this antique,\" said the amply fed yet somewhat weather worn bishop as he parked the jeep in a"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"300    Undoing Yourself secluded corner of the hide-away underground parking structure. High above me I could hear the sound of the phony rock doors softly colliding as I began to take notice of the opulent array of vintage cars and military vehicles that filled fifty or so spaces within the under- ground garage. When we finally caught up with Jason, who was waiting for us at the other end of the hidden parking lot, another secret doorway opened in the rocky wall before us. On the other side of the doorway was a small balcony that overlooked a huge underground lagoon about hundred and fifty feet below us. \"This way,\" motioned the Dr. as I turned around to see an elevator guarded by two beret-capped soldiers. Neither soldier even as much as blinked as we stepped into the brushed steel interior elevator. His holy See pressed the G button and I soon could feel the G-force tugging within the pit of my stom- ach as the elevator rapidly made its descent to the ground floor. Around the lagoon was a large flagstone deck and around the deck were a number of well-lit doorways that led into various chambers that had been expertly hewn into the solid bedrock that this veritable tropical paradise rested upon. My attention was drawn mostly how- ever to the fairly large number of half-naked Polynesian women who graced the gray stone decking around the lagoon. \"Behold, the Eves of the New Aeon!\" roared the pontiff. As I looked closer I discovered that as many as a third of the women I could see were indeed in some stage of pregnancy. \"These women shall bear the new Children of the Earth,\" Jason explained. \"If these are the Eves then where are the Adams?\" I asked. \"There will be time to explain all of that later,\" said the Pope, \"but now we must concentrate on the matter at hand.\" We all lowered ourselves into some kind of speedboat that sat waiting at an inlet on the far side of the lagoon. The good Dr. then took a swig of bourbon, turned the key and the slender vessel lunged upstream with a vengeance. The exuberant pontiff navigated the myriad of tunnels as if he had been through them thousands of times and he did so at lightening speed. The craggy tunnel walls were lined with torches that whizzed by in quick little blurs as the super-charged V-12 engine in the back roared with a reassuring hum of complete self-confidence, jettisoning us through each new corridor along the way with ease. Within me I began to feel as if my soul was becoming super- charged. Whatever fears I may have initially had regarding the incred- ible speed we had attained were completely squelched by the exhila-"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    301 ration that flowed through my veins with an electricity and puissance one can only feign describe. It was almost as if the very Life Force of the Universe Itself had shot a searing spark of Itself into the very cen- ter of my being. It was almost if I had never ever really been truly alive until that point in my life. Many, many people have so called peak experiences, and after the experiences are gone they are just as ignorant, stupid and dumb as they were before they had the experiences. Without warning, Dr. H slowed the speeding boat down to a crawl. What I then witnessed, as I gazed at the mysteriously haunting yet astonishingly beautiful panorama that blossomed out of nowhere just ahead of us, was, without question, the most magnificent sight I had ever beheld. The boat silently drifted to the centre of a huge sort of water- topped balcony that glowed with an amber light that radiated from below. The maverick pontiff then leaped over the narrow windshield and then landed with ease upon the boat's streamlined prow. Raising his arms to the blackness of the star-speckled night sky above him he shouted, as if to the Gods themselves, \"This is my island, my king- dom, my universe and my Self!\" I looked out over the edge of the massive pool to see, opposite us, a massive concave wall of solid green rock that had been intricately carved into the face of an ancient mountain or volcano. Subtle flashes of green light would from time to time move in various patterns through the translucent surface of the rock that was sparsely covered with jungle vines as well as various ferns and other tropical foliage. There were also a number of water-balconies such as the one we were on. All of them varying in size and all of them possessing a lumines- cent waterfall at their outside brim. Each one seemingly somewhat different in size and shape, and each one's glowing waterfall a differ- ent color, I studied this fantastically strange yet wondrous view for several bedazzled moments as if lost in a sort of trance. I then began to realize that this most curious place and something deep within me were interacting in some very significant way. Sublimity, harmony, duality and oneness all seemed to pulsate as living things within me and without me. I, and this bewitching and mysterious place, were resonating with a current of divine electricity that I had ne'er this intensely felt before in my life."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"302    Undoing Yourself \"Blavatsky was right,\" piped Jason. 'This, my friend, is Lemuria!\" he then stated with a sort of patriotic pride. Perhaps I should have acknowledged Jason's astounding announcement in some way, but I didn't; I just sat there with my wide Irish blues completely and in- trepidly fixated upon the indescribably beautiful spectacle I was now beholding, while my heft hand, with the distinct flow of an habitual and deliberate automation, retrieved the Dr.'s bottle of bourbon. I unscrewed the top, put the bottle to my lips and with a sort of vigourous nonchalance, downed a right healthy swig. The exuberant Pope then jumped back unto the boat's deck, grabbed the helm with an unmistakable air of satisfaction and navi- gated the small craft back to a dock that lay just inside the entrance to the water-balcony. We then slipped through a narrow entranceway that led down a staircase that was hewn through the luminous emerald coloured stone. As I examined the anomalous rock from this closer vantage point I noticed that beneath its solid exterior surface it seemed to radiate with a kind of intelligent fluidity, I soon felt as if the walls around me were trying to communicate something or other to me. And then gradually, as we continued our descent, I began to somehow psychically hear the eerie echoes of someone attempting to speak to me in some ancient & foreign tongue. Just then, as the inter- nal volume of the voice began to grow to the point whence I could swear I was actually hearing it with my physical ears, Dr. H emphati- cally grunted \"Watch it! These are the living rocks that were prophe- sied by our dear old Uncle Al my good friend. And, if you continue in the direction you are presently heading for too long you will be talk- ing to these stones for days, that, whilst you are totally unaware of us or much of anything else. Think about a velveteen alter of nice tight pussy for now o prophet of the whispering rosy red rectum. There will be plenty of time to engage yourself with the precious stones of water down the road a ways.\" Step by step, we coursed our descent through the strange enchant- ment that lived and breathed within the ancient stairwell. I subdued the seduction of the voices as best I could. Dr. H assisted me in my efforts to do so by striking up a monologue regarding the little known fact that the British government had nearly declared war on the United States in the early part of the Twentieth Century. Jason inter- jected his take on the topic and me, I just continued walking, watch-"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    303 ing and resisting the subtle yet distinctively powerful seductions of the enigmatic stone conduit that surrounded us. We were approximately half way to the bottom when a variety of geometric figures began to appear before us as holograms in some- what predictable intervals. All, not only differing, but changing in shape, color, hue & size. At various times two or three of the translu- cent and three dimensional forms would merge with one another; forming new shapes, shrinking and finally disappearing into little spark sized circlets which would dart off into the distance and or burst into a thousand tiny specks of multi-coloured light. The latter re- minded me of a typical holiday fireworks display, only on a smaller more subtle level of course. \"They are talking to us now Jesus!\" remarked the Dr. I somehow knew that by \"Jesus\" he, in his characteristically sardonic fashion, was addressing yours truly. This statement was, needless to say, followed by one of his rhythmic little sarcastic giggles. \"Indeed they are my most holy Pontiff,\" I responded in kind. \"But what the hell are they trying to say for fucking Christ's sake?\" I added with the best sense of humour that I could, at that point, inject into the words I was virtually forcing out of my tightening throat. \"Chaos, transmutation, creation, dissolution, order... The Universe is a system of numbers that flow and interact, sometimes in ways that are perceivably orderly and at other times, they are seemingly quite chaotic or random in the way they act, react, perform and, ah, play,\" he promptly replied with a certain tone of controlled enthusiasm in his voice. This, I supposed, was a good enough explanation for the time being at least. It did not then, from that point, seem to take us long before we reached the last step and finally walked out into the aged yet Elysian remains of this once long forgotten city. It was indeed hard to believe that much of what lay before us, despite its obvious antiquity, was perfectly preserved, at least as far as I could tell. And the Pope's an- cient citadel was astonishingly abundant with life! Lush green fauna, illustrious gardens, strange looking yet docile animals; and human beings; tall herculean males and voluptuously antaean females, some dressed in white robes and some in midnight blue and gold. And many, especially those who lay basking in the effulgent pools of steaming hot mineral water, adorned in naught but playful clouds of steam and the soft coloured light that seemed to emanate from the"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"304    Undoing Yourself pools as well as various large stones that nestled themselves cozily between the thick vegetation and the ground beneath them. \"As the Master has declared, the hero knows when it is time to rest,\" said the Pope as he and Jason quickly disrobed and simultane- ously dived into a nearby pool. \"When in Rome,\" hollered out Jason in my general direction. I soon found myself slipping head first through the glowing and calescent liquid below. This particular pool radiated with a sort of mystical purplish light that rose above the surface of the water into a fine mist, which in turn, continued to ascend from the soothing effervescence several feet higher into the cool night air above. It was not long before I found myself quite comfortably harboured between two of the immense blonde-haired wonder women that I had previously been admiring from some distance. Silently and systemati- cally they began to wash me with some exotically fragrant sort of saponin or soap. As one of their hands began to apply the lathering & aromatic bar of solvent to my, so-called \"privates,\" I briefly closed my eyes. And in my self imposed blindness I could see a long and winding cord of silver extending from the point that was now being washed. It flew, as if off through the limitless boundaries of space and time in several directions. As I studied the silvery cord for a bit longer I couldn't help but being somewhat amazed at the unmistakably decided and undulant motion it made as it moved across the dimen- sionless & eternal abyss that silently engulfed it and me. \"Nuit\" whispered a voice from somewhere within me. \"Nu-it - Na-hash - Tu-it - Na-hash - Du-it - Na-hash - ...\" it repeated with a distinct flow and meter; the glimmering serpentine cord that extended from me, pulsating in perfect time to the magical lilt of the words. I do not exactly recall when the two women, who were now both fondling, stroking and bathing my more than grateful genitals, began to synchronistically whisper the words I, at first, had only heard within the confines of my own head; for as I opened my eyes I be- came deeply entranced in a sort of burning bewitchment that streamed forth as lasers from their crimson irises. And as I gazed ever more deeply into their massive plumes of flowing and fiery red hair, I could not help but feel the burgeoning onslaught of a new anointment or initiatory rite of passage or gnosis (or whatever one might want to call it) as it pushed its way through my physical and then more subtle body with the insistence of a 1938 Big Boy locomotive, steaming its"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    305 way through the eternal tracks of my consciousness. Naught but dreams followed, dreams of wild orgies and feasts of drunken ec- stasy; of sailing across the Universe as upon the wings of either devils or angels. And of the undulating life-rhythm of the silver thew or ser- pent that, as far as I could tell, extended on into the unfathomable depths of perfect infinity. After awaking from what seemed to be an endless succession of dreams and visions, I could vaguely make out several male figures adorned in an elaborate array of ceremonial robes & jewelry. \"We must now prepare for the great invocation,\" said the one standing directly in front of me. \"There is little time left,\" quickly added another. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and with a quick quivering of my head, I attempted to shake the cobwebs loose from the fading corri- dors, chambers and miscellaneous alcoves that lay hidden within the confines of my unconscious mind. \"You have successfully passed through the first three ordeals and it is now time for you to take a stab at the fourth,\" I then heard still another say. I knew in an instant that this was the voice of someone I knew. As my post-slumbered vision cleared, I glanced up to see the Holy See. He was adorned in an exquisitely fashioned set of red & black satin vestments, which included a headdress of fabric, precious gemstones and a multi-coloured myriad of flowing and exotic feath- ers of one sort or another. Not to mention that he looked nearly half as old as when I last seen him. \"The great demon Lucifuge Rofocale must be summoned at ex- actly midnight and you must be dressed, ready and in place by at least a quarter to that hour,\" he pontificated in a somewhat laconic fashion. The Pontiff and the rest of the robed men then slowly exited the solferino, gray, russet and Chinese red sanctuary of my lavishly deco- rated boudoir. At the foot of my bed I noticed that a set of garments had been neatly laid out. I examined them for a moment & then slipped out of the huge bed I'd somehow been transported to, stretched my arms towards the elaborately carved wooden ceiling and rolled my head from side to side whilst I refreshed the rest of me in the irresistible sigh of a huge yawn. I walked over to a nearby vanity and looked into the mirror that was attached to the back of it. I was no longer nearly sixty-years on but twenty or twenty-one at best. In the reflection I could see behind"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"306    Undoing Yourself me several Nordic women, their light blonde hair flowing over their naked torsos as gentle fields of flaxen wheat in the early autumn Norwegian breeze. I closed my eyes for a moment as I breathed in a distinct feeling of exaltation. I could sense the connection between Lucifuge and my Self beginning to occur as two of the women approached me from behind so as to hang from my shoulders a long black velvet robe. A long red sash was then draped equilaterally around my neck; a pen- dent of Baphomet, a golden crown or helmet that boldly displayed a spiraling set of ram's horns, a pair of black sandals and two serpen- tine gold bracelets followed—all the adornments needed for the invo- cation of the great Lucifer's right hand man except for one. Two different women then called me back to the large circular bed across the room. \"Sit,\" said the one in a heavy northern European accent. As I fol- lowed her simple instructions she produced an alcohol soaked cotton ball from a fancy looking silver or pewter tray that sat nearby upon the surface of the impeccably crafted wooden bed. \"Dis vill only hurt only little bit,\" the other stated in voice but only a notch or two louder than a whisper. \"I am artist at this, trust me,\" she touted with no small degree of conviction or insistence. \"Ready?\" she asked, as her icy blue Scandinavian blue eyes con- nected with my own. \"Go for it!\" I replied, (wondering how it was that I was so easily agreeing to what I knew was coming next). As the surgical steel began to pierce the topmost layers of the pliant and warm epidermis that covered my chest I instinctually forced my eyelids into...close position. I could feel the trickles of blood make their way down the nakedness of my front side yet I indeed felt not one iota of pain. And, of this much, I was indeed quite thankful. I would occasionally take a peek at the progress she was making as she continued to apply the fruits of her talent to the surface of my skin with the diligence, focus and perfection of a master dia- mond cutter for several more minutes. When she had completed her task she grabbed me by the hands, lifted me to a stand and proceeded to guide me back to the mirror. Upon my breast she had, with no small degree of excellence, carved the Mark of the Master Therion, 666, the Priest of Princes. She daubed up the blood as I studied the revered sigil of the Sun & Moon Conjoined in the reflection before me."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    307 Just then, I was handed a book; that is, an ancient Grimoire of spells and invocations. I turned to the page that was marked with a red satin marker yet before I could but read one word I heard a voice from near the entrance to the room demanding: \"Come now, vee must not vaste time, come, come...\" Frater Abraxas, a dear friend and ally of the Pope, stood before me, spouting out the proper prayers and incantations as the general assemblage of those in attendance airily sang what sounded like Gregorian chant. And then, at midnight, the Pontiff delivered the solar adoration unto the dung beetle-god, Kephra. I could feel the presence of an almost inconceivably high intelli- gence begin to make His presence known within the subtle brains and bodies of the temple's inhabitants. It was as if a life-beam from the living and most Holy Sun God Ra had pierced the inner eye of my soul. I indulged myself in the moment as I scanned the interior of the elaborately decorated underground temple. I gazed at a small fire that silhouetted a naked priestess at the peripheral edge of the great circle. Mindlessly I watched the flames through the aperture that opened between her legs. I wallowed in the mystique of the whole affair, the torches upon the walls spoke to me in a silent tongue, the statue of the beloved Goat of Mendes that topped the alter seemed to move in time with the ancient and heavily echoed chanting that filled the interior of the dank & stone temple. Nowhere on earth was there an atmosphere more chthonian than the splendidly infernal atmosphere that then existed in that room. Memories of Lemuria skated through and then faded from my thoughts; being replaced by a radiant feeling of excitement & antici- pation that relentlessly pulsated through my being, pushing me to ever higher levels of self-awareness, satisfaction and anomalous desire. It seemed as if every second became more and more sacred as we moved closer and closer to the well planned for and long awaited invocation of the Prime Minister unto the very King of Hell. The grand vicar of Lord Lucifer. Lucifuge Rofocale.

Two of the Scandina- vian women I had seen in the boudoir lifted the huge black robe from my shoulders. My most divine part of mind and soul; that is to say my wand of flesh and muscle and (ever-increasing amounts) of blood began to swell with anticipation as I continued to study the woman before me with no small degree of wantonness. As I began to walk towards her I could smell the intoxicating pungency of her perfumed body through the heavy billows of incense smoke. As we then locked gazes, I could feel a flaming bridge of passion and desire span the ever-decreasing distance between us. I lifted myself up upon the alter as her supple young limbs engulfed me in an ocean of pleasure and utter satiety. A satiety that grew stronger with every passing second. I moved over her smooth warm body as a serpent over the lush green grass of a mid-summer meadow. I kissed the shaven and painted lips of her awaiting vagina for several prolonged seconds un- til I began to move my mouth, my lips and the wetness of my lambent and blood-tinged tongue gently, slowly towards her own. We lost ourselves in a succulent whirlwind of passionate kisses for several more moments. I could feel the soothing softness of her slen- der fingers as they gently tightened their grip around my throbbing and more than ready phallus. I could feel the heart within my chest pounding out the delight of existence, as if existence was the bride of the Devil Himself—the God of pleasure and drunkenness and orgasm. She moaned in wanton whimpers of delight, sheer and unre- stricted, as my welcome rod slid gladly through her lips, the lips that were, at that very instant, the gateway unto the heart of heaven itself. \"The Cunt is Hell which is also Paradise,\" I thought to myself. \"The Devil is my ecstatic Cock, the Serpent, the Liar, the Fool, the God—Me.\" I thrust my penis harder and deeper... I pictured the ser- pentine cord that extends from the astral self unto the boundlessness of the Universe as a blazing snake whose name is Nahash, Lucifer, Satan, Set, Yeheshua the Liar, Aiwaz, Horus, the Child-god/the God of War. \"Odin,\" she whispered and then repeated several times. She then proceeded to babble on in a strange and foreign tongue as I, in the very essence of things, became as the Beast upon Babalon.

I held the crystal ball, head level with out-stretched hands as the Pontiff, facing me, called upon Lucifuge Rofocale to appear in the name of Lucifer & Aiwaz... Loudly and with the extremely brazen enthusiasm and or conviction befitting a man of his intellectual, spiri- tual and magickal stature he repeated the words, phrases and poetry of the aged invocation. A guarded but no less eager sense of anticipation and confidence mounted within me even as flurries of doubt began to fly throughout the outer regions of my consciousness. Seconds began to turn into minutes as the Pope's mesmerizing incantations continued. Yet soon, the flurries would turn to snowflakes in the wind as whatever doubts I or any else in attendance may have had diminished; disappearing into the abyss of oblivion as the demands of the Holy See slowly trans- formed any doubts into a visible reality for all in eye shot of the now glowing ball of polished quartzite to behold. Lucifuge first appeared as a radiant yet cloudy and distorted image within the interior of the crystal. As I peered into the ball I could, within a short period of time, recognize one image and then another and so on. The eye of a cat, which would change from one luminous color to another, spindly clawlike fingers and hands, spiraling horns and, eventually, the crystal clear portrait of Lucifuge Rofocale. A strange and telepathic communication then commenced that had the effect of completely involving all within the temple who even en- tertained the notion of engaging this immensely powerful and ancient spirit. Within the confines of my own brain I could hear the sound of pounding timpani, of majestic brass and sweeping flourishes of echo- ing flutes and stringed instruments. It was as if the great amphitheatre that somehow existed deep within the mysterious domains of mine own soul had engaged the Devil's own well rehearsed as well as exquisitely accomplished symphonic orchestra to work its grandiose magic within the orchestra pit of that theatre. I held the crystal ball higher in the air and closed my eyes. Soon, whatever mystical Force that had, at first, appeared only as chaotic and indistinct images within the skew-stone had worked its way through the capillaries & bones; the nerve cells, sinews, muscle and flesh of my two out-stretched and uplifted appendages. Flowing and unstoppable currents of pulsating electricity soon began to fill my body and brain. As I slowly opened my eyes I could barely see the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"310    Undoing Yourself immaculately garbed Pontiff through the strange effulgence of gold and white fire that had by now completely enveloped me. To my best recollection this was the flashing snapshot of rapture that directly preceded the Arch-demon Lucifuge Rofocale's possession of me. I could feel my consciousness begin to soar as the other-worldly con- sciousness and intelligence of the Arch-demon Lucifuge Rofocale, the very Prime Minister of the Nether-worlds systematically and ut- terly took control of the carbon based manifestation of my physical being. And all this, mind you, at the impeccably delivered insistence of the Pope. It is now all but impossible to recall that which took place from that point on. It is only from the sound and the images that were cap- tured by the various audio & video recorders we had utilized that night that I am able to now relay the strange conversation that took place on Walpurgis Eve, 1978. As Frater Abraxas held up the parchment that the unknown priest- ess and I had consecrated earlier, and as the holy (or unholy) Gnostic See incanted the ancient & hypnotic words of invocation, the some- what blinding radiance that surrounded me gradually began to take on the form of the demon. And in time, the glowing and mystic light would eventually transmute itself into an opaque and multi-coloured image. Also, the blazing wall of fire that had, at one point, completely engulfed me could, at this juncture, only be detected as radiant glints of light or fire that flickered and escaped through the seams of the unearthly apparel and the countless hairline fissures that layered the bewitching and ancient figure's skin from head to toe. \"Why hast thou summoned me from the rapturous comfort of my paradise that lays beyond the world of mortal men?\" demanded Lucifuge as his hoarse voice filled the interior of the underground sanctuary with a thunderous roar. \"So that the Secret Chiefs of the living Earth might know the very secrets of heaven and hell o gracious and exalted one,\" responded the Pope. \"This is no concern of mine—what thou knowest or does not know, why should I deliver aught unto thee o Bishop?\" \"Because I have invoked thee in the exalted names of Lucifer and Aiwaz and Satan who is the reigning Emperor of Hell lord Rofocale!\" \"What then shall you surrender unto me o true Pontiff of the world of Humankind?\""},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Undoing Yourself    311 \"My governorship over the chosen elite of this world for the period of exactly one Earth year o powerful and most enlightened magistrate of lord Lucifer,\" answered the Pope. \"Of these ye shall be allowed to direct and manipulate for the aforementioned time period according to the Law of Nuit and Hadit and the great God Ra-hoor-kuit as delivered unto the Master Therion through the great Angel Aiwaz,\" boldly stated the Pontiff. \"Not enough!\" resounded Lucifuge, \"not enough!\" This gave the Holy See pause as it had been discovered before the ritual, through certain strange and exotic divinatory techniques, that this would indeed be the very gift that would entice the aged and fallen angel to reveal that which only one of his high degree could reveal. An eerie silence overwhelmed the occupants of the richly deco- rated subterranean temple for several somewhat tense seconds. \"Is it not the wish of ye and thy lord, who is called Lucifer the Great, that the world of men be freed from the tyrant-god who, in a rage of pompous and unrelenting anger, cast thee, thy Lord Lucifer and many a sundry legions of magnificent and wondrous beings such as yourself into the seclusion of Hades that Man and Woman-kind should ne'er realize the majestic puissance that exists within them... that they should forever be forbidden communication with the truly liberating Intelligence that once ruled the Earth & all the celestial spheres?\" the Pope finally retorted. \"It is,\" whispered the fallen angel in a low and gravelly tone. \"Is it not then thy desire that the Holy Spirit that dwells within Man and Wo-mankind should join thee in a new Æon of self libera- tion; an Æon that shall render unto thee and the inhabitants of the Earth the freedom and the right to shake off the bonds of slavery and the perpetual enforcement of disharmony and ignorance?\" \"Send forth the High Priestess of Odin,\" replied Lucifuge with the unmistakable hint of a smile. \"Let her approach me now then,\" he continued. Naked, save the mask that concealed the upper portion of her face, the priestess stepped forward. The Mark of the Beast, which had been so solicitously cut into the middle section of her voluptuous Caucasian torso, began to shed tiny droplets of fresh warm blood. Lucifuge's neck then began to gradually extend in her direction as if it were composed of some sort of electrically charged plasma. Quivering beams of blinding light then began to swirl around him as his swarthy and powerful face came closer and closer to the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"312    Undoing Yourself approaching priestess. The priestess closed her eyes as Lucifuge's extremely long and skinny tongue began to lap up the blood from her breasts and belly. Within thirty to forty seconds, the newly summoned life of the party had enlarged his visible stature to elephantine proportions. At that point, (as I have noticed from watching the video over and again) one could barely make out the glowing design of Crowley's Sun & Moon sigil (the legendary Mark of the Beast) that emblazoned the arch-demon's, now naked, chest. Then, as the index finger on his left hand gently touched the centre of the luminous sigil upon his own breast, his right hand simultaneously extended towards the priestess, touching the centre of the sigil of the Beast that was by now radiating with a persistent and pulsating light & rhythm upon her well-endowed breast. As the \"physical\" contact between the two entities continued the now huge and pliant demon gradually dissolved into a sort of glowing mist of amorphous vapor. The curious mist then languidly streamed into the vagina of the Nordic priestess, filling her entire body with a strange sort of radiance, which seemed to escape and radiate through her eyes, the tips of her fingers and the blood tinged Sun & Moon Conjoined sign between her large white breasts. The Pope and Frater Abraxas scurried to break her fall as she quickly collapsed upon the hard stone floor. There was little to be seen after that point as the surrounding area became invisible due to a brilliant and blinding explosion of light that resulted from the unexpected union of Lucifuge Rofocale and the masked priestess. In the wake of that silent blast of light, the high priestess and I were found huddled together atop the alter. Between us was an age- worn leather-bond book that bore a title that was written in Sumerian or Mesopotamian script. 1 1 The preceding was extracted from a much longer story which I have entitled \"The Aeon of Horus.\" It deals with several \"me's\": several person- alities or levels of \"individuality\" that I may or may not be experiencing at any given time at any number of given points in an infinite Universe. If the events and or characters that I have portrayed in this excerpt shocked you or offended some hidden \"moral fiber\" within you, then so be it. No one made you read it. The £ion of Horus is intended to unravel the tangled mess of already short-circuited wiring in one's brain; wiring that is, to a great degree, the result of incessant tampering by a highly dysfunctional group of war mongering primates called Modern Society (The Tribe)."}]
