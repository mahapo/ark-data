Prior to 1 985, as I stud ied and learned, I witnessed others trying to fit new ideas into old concepts. Instead of seeing the New Age seekers come tog ether with one mind , I began to see them being divided by their expand ed p hilosophies, with intolerance bu ilding. Intolerance, in my opinion, is one of the greatest hind rances to the evolvement of mankind . I began to search for the threads of sameness, not diversity, to show that the various ph ilosophies were not so different from one another. I found that most differences were semantics, the label or name we used. We adopted an ironclad rule in my bu siness establishment that ph ilosophical thought, no matter how different it might app ear, was to be honored as long as it harmed n one. This gave all of us, workers and seekers, the opportunity to broaden our und erstanding by learning to respect the beliefs of others. Thru the years I realized that neither cre ationists nor evolutionists were totally wrong. It was only that we were not seeing the whole picture. This book attempts to show both views are c orrec t; t hat reincarnation is a fact; t hat there is an ultimate state of non-physical being; that there is both a masculine and feminine e nergy g uiding mankind ; that ph ysical man on Earth receives help from advanced as well as non-ph ysical beings; and that all of this was known and recorded in ancient times in the days of Thoth. Further, that this knowledge is our heritage as well as our legacy; and that Cosmic Cycles of Time affect our knowledge and level of und erstanding concerning the true nature of man. It further attempts to bring tog ether the New Age c omm un ity by showing that we are on the same path, even if we don’t t hink so a t times. My hope is that it will strike a note of truth in all who read it, especially general New Age, Christian, and those professing no particular ph ilosophy bu t who have an interest in what life is all about. I have spent my entire life searching for answers. At this point in space- time, most knowing seems to be c oming from within. I have not"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 attempted, nor do I have the ability, to sup ply empirical proof. Those who read this book will find their proofs, acceptance or denial within their own b eing based on where they a re in their own personal evolution. It pivots around Thoth’s teachings and also acknowledges that there is a feminine aspect of creative e nergy working with the masculine aspect of cre ative e nergy. Christians who have expand ed their belief system m ay find answers to some of their unanswered qu estions. Those who float between Eastern and Western p hilosophies and have become c onfused might find some c larification. Those that are locked into a narrow religious view, not acce pting evolution n or re incarnation as a possibility, will probably be disturbed by its implications. Anthropologists and scientists will probably take issue with the family tree and theory that the whole hu man race was genetically engineere d, all the way back to Homo Habilis. Evolutionists might have difficulty in acce pting that the hu man b ody and imm ortal soul are differe nt aspects of a total being a nd each has their own roles. Even though it refers to Astrology in a g eneral way, and is not intend ed to be a dissertation on the subject, astrologers might find some interesting concepts on the c ycles of time.

This is as inevitable as needing a ir to breathe. During the dark ag es very little awareness is retained in the c onscious mind of the days long past; bu t in the hearts of man a dim m emory is s tored giving rise to myths and legends. For over 400,000 years the Earth has been going thru a Cosmic Dark Age. ( See As Above, So Below-Part IV-Chapter 3 ) This is the first COSMIC D ark Age since man arrived on Earth. Even thru this Cosmic Dark Age, we occasionally glimpse a little light at the beginning o f a new equ inox every twenty-four thousand or so y ears. At that time we temporarily raise up to a new level of consciousness before beginn ing the gradual decline aga in. During these times of light, man reaches up to his creator and for a little while he accomplishes what seems to be a miracle of civilization to future generations. Now the Cosmic Dark Age that has lasted so long is finally coming to a n end and man h as the opp ortunity to soar to unb elievable heights. To a point where the twenty-four thousand year cycles will not impact nor restrict him to where he loses all the progress made in each p revious golden cycle. In Earth’s remote past, prior to what we call the third glacial age, there existed a mighty civilization. It was located in an area known in p resent times as the Himalayan Moun tains, which was then a coastal area. This civilization was established du ring the first Cosmic Golden Cycle after MAN ’S arrival on Earth. It thrived for nearly two million years, before the r ace known as MAN was no longer identifiable as MAN . MAN was once again established on Earth around 1,800 ,000 m.y.b.p., and , across the c ontinents a short time later, arose the Atlantean culture on a large continent in what we call the Atlantic Ocean. They, over the course of four-hund red thousand years, evolved a murray of sciences and technology. This civilization met its end n ear the beginning o f the Third Glacial Age, at which time, most of the Continent sank. (See the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 section on ‘Family Tree’ in Book 1 – Part 1, and App end ix III at the back of the boo k for more details leading up to this.) At a later period, Atlantis again hosted a g reat civilization on the remaind er of what had once been a great continent. They were visited and h elped by a dvanced races from other areas of space, notably Aldebaran, who taught them the sciences and monitored their progress. Thoth, son of the King, thru h is devotion to learning, was s ingled out as a recipient for advanced knowledge; and in the course of his s tud ies learned how to ov ercome ph ysical death, as we know it. Among the things taught Thoth was the knowledge of twelve major mag netic grid p oints around the Earth thru which life sustaining energies flowed from the Universal Sun via the Galactic Sun and our Solar Sun . (These are known as the twelve Pyramids of Thoth) These twelve major grids conn ect to other grids within the Earth’s field and the direction of their conn ection is known as the mag netic “ley-lines”, a term coined, and adopted by the New Age Movement, in the twentieth century. (Knowledge of these grids contributed to the cr eation of the “Sun Worshippers”, who left t heir symbols all over the planet.) Und erneath the “Atlantean” g rid was bu ilt the Atlantean ph ysical pyramid (which h as been rediscovere d in recent times sun k off t he c oast of Bimini). The pyramid marked the portal to a nother dimension, which could b e entere d by those initiated in the mysteries. Another round of destruction b ega n the sinking o f what historical tales have c alled the Island Kingdom of Atlantis. The island area with the pyramid, Thoth’s home, went un derwater around 52,000 years b.c.e. Just prior to the sinking o f his homeland, Thoth, with a selected crew, flew from his beloved Atlantis in a craft given h im by the people of Aldebaran to the land we call Egypt. There he c onquere d the barbaric people inhabiting that land b y his s oph isticated technology a nd set up a kingdom that would eventually impact the culture and religions now prevalent thru out the modern world. The sinking o f the re maining island landmasses was gradual over the next 38 ,000 y ears allowing time for some of the surviving population to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 slowly migrate and establish colonies around the world. The final sinking o f the Island s of Atlantis occurre d around 10 ,000 b.c.e. (12 ,000 years ago ). In the grid in “Northeastern U.S./Southeastern Canada” our scientists have e stablished that it was inhabited AT LE AST 7,000 to 12 ,000 y ears b.c.e. In the grid in “South America” near Peru and Lake Titicaca, Bolivia, archaeologists have discovere d ancient ruins with pyramid techn ology and indication of “sun worshippers”, and the same in the “Mexican” grid. The same is true of ancient civilizations in the “Artic” g rid of Northwestern Canada that predates the Ind ian culture, where legends say the inhabitants arrived from across the “SUNR ISE SEA” o n the back of a “ flying turtle”. “Stonehenge” is another major grid p oint, and where exa ct knowledge of astronomy by the ancients has long been a pu zzle. During the height of the last Atlantean civilization they were in contact with, entere d into trade, and were taught by advanced races from other worlds. Aldebaran and S irius being a mong the most notable. These planets are frequ ently featured in the alignment of astronomical sites as well as orientation in the pyramids found around the world. The sph erical craft used b y Thoth to migrate to Egypt came from Aldebaran and is now buried d eep b eneath the Sp hinx. Thoth had volun teered to stay behind to help the people of Earth when the “Children of Light” were e vacuated from the planet prior to the destruction of the main island in the Kingdom of Atlantis. Atlantis had been a beacon of light for tens of thousands of years un til it was infiltrated, for a second time, by a race of beings evolved on a nega tive plane of existence beyond the Constellation of Orion. They o nce again brought an era o f darkness and d egradation, war and abomination to the planet. They usurped control of the government and genetically cre ated a work force of man/beast creatures. (Similar to o ur scientific end eavors today.) It was they who had originally un leashed h orrific"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 weapons upon Atlantis and Lemuria (as well as Su mer which was inh abited at the same time), causing the initial breakup of the continents. The secre t evacuation of the Children of Light, at that time, had so enraged them that they turned their dreaded AtomicVrill Ray weapons upon both continents causing the c ontinents to eventually break up into island s, then left in an attempt to return to their own area of space. One c ould make a strong a rgument that their presence is once again b eing felt on the planet today. (See App endix III for more information.) Thoth, with continuing aid from the beings of Aldebaran, brought a new consciousness to the tribes of Egypt and eventually, via migratory patterns, to the r est of the world thru the many peoples who came to live in and pass thru Egypt. The people of Aldebaran h elped Thoth to build the pyramid of Gizeh (which was considered to be the ce nter stationary point of the planet.) Perhaps it would b e more accurate to designate this as “O” degrees longitud e rather than “30” degrees E. longitude. Because the locals thought Thoth and the others were gods, it gave them the opportunity to medically treat and otherwise help the local population. They a lso operated on the man/beast creatures that survived the deluge, surgically removing app endages and altering their DNA so that eventually these mutations were not passed d own to offspring. Even in our modern times there is a rare throwback genetically. Having overcome ph ysical death, as we know it, Thoth ruled for 16 ,000 years in Egy pt (un til 36,000 years b.c.e.) He periodically disapp eared for a time into a nother dimension for re newal. After Thoth chose to leave the ph ysical, his ego (consciousness) returned in other forms to assist mankind many times. One of his incarnations was Hermes Trismegistus. In this form he wrote down a cond ensed version of the great mysteries on thirteen indestructible tablets known as the “Emerald Tablets of Thoth”. All but two of these have been allowed to be translated and given to the world. It is not yet time for the re maining two to be made known."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 The tablets were kept in the pyramid of Gizeh, which became a center of initiation. It is said that Jesus himself, as well as John the Baptist, used the initiation chamber. These tablets and their knowledge were taken b y descend ents of Thoth’s priests thru out the world. They were also shared with the progeny o f other less knowledgeable descend ents of Atlanteans who colonized other parts of the world b efore and after the destruction of Atlantis. (As was the case of the Incan civilization of Peru.) The tablets were seen as a mark of authority direc tly from Thoth as they were carried abroad b y the priests. At the beginning o f the 20 th century they were finally returned to the Pyramid of Gizeh and placed in one of the many und iscovere d secr et chambers. Thoth, in h is personification as Hermes, wrote some 20 ,000 “ boo ks”, most of which are thought to have been stored in the Library o f Alexand ria. They were lost to the world when the Romans destroyed the library. (Much of the information recorded in the “Dead Sea Scrolls”, especially the “Copp er” Scroll, came from his writings; and most probably the hidd en information found in the Torah.) Thoth’s knowledge and influence, promulgated thru the writings of Hermes, was felt around the world and b ecame the basis of the oldest cultures and religions includ ing the Hindu , Jewish, and Christian. The twelve Pyramids (major mag netic Earth grids) of Thoth h ave been the sites of major civilizations, now mostly extinct. Some c orrelate to known ph ysical pyramids, which app ear to have been built directly und er the ce ntral energy point of the grids (said to be portals to o ther dimensions). There are five grids on 30 degrees North Latitude; three at 15 degrees South Latitud e; one at Antarctic; one at Artic; one at 40-51 degrees North Latitud e and another originally a t 51 degrees North Latitud e, now probably a little southeast of the original point. (Different Longitudes of course for e ach p oint) We know of five ph ysical pyramids on or near 30 degrees North Latitud e. (1) Mexico (N.E. of Mexico City) (2) Off t he c oast of Bimini - (At 42 degrees W. Longitude) (3) Great Pyramid of Gizeh"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 (4) Himalayan Mountains (Near Burma) (5) China (The Largest – 1500 feet in diameter and 1000 feet in height) – 60 Miles West Of Sian Fu in the Shensi Province.) The three great pyramids, Gizeh – Tibet – China, were bu ilt 45,600 years b.c.e. to help stop the axial excursion of the planet and to avoid our mag netic field d iminishing to “ o” degrees, thereby preventing further mag netic pole r eversals. These three pyramids are automatically a utomated when our mag netic field reaches a certain critical point. The last such reversal occurre d around one-million three -hun dred thousand years b.c.e. at the e nd of the Cosmic Treta Yuga Cycle and would have occurre d again around the year 2150 a.d. (according to o ur scientists). It app ears that two physical pyramids were constructed within one major mag netic grid (China and Tibet). I am not aware of a physical pyramid at the 30 degrees grid p oint in the Gulf of Kuwait. (Curiously though, the grid point in the Gulf of Kuwait is in the general area where the Anunn aki were said to have genetically cre ated a more advanced race (250,000 y ears b.c.e. , according to some sources), which eventually found ed what is known in our written h istory as the Su merian civilization – (correlates with the biblical Garden of Eden area o f Iraq/Turkey/Iran, and it is also near the app roximate location where the Tower of Babel is thought to have been). Of the other seven grid points, i.e. “South America” at 15 degrees South Latitud e; Lemuria at 15 degrees South Latitude; Australia at 15 degrees South Latitud e; Antarctic; Artic; Stonehenge at 51 degrees North Latitud e; and U.S./Canada a t 40-51 degrees North Latitude, only the South American grid is known, by this writer, to hav e a physical pyramid. Of these twelve grids the one most active in b ringing in energies for the New Age app ears to be the U.S./Canada g rid thru which the feminine energy a nd DNA alterations are direc ted. There are known to be ten “Vile Vortices”(Devil’s Triangles) around the e qu ator alone, with five on 25-30 degrees North Latitud e and five on 25 -30 degrees South Latitude. The five major “Vile Vortices” a re:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 (1) Bermud a Triangle – o ff the East coast of Florida beginning due east of Jacksonville.

(As yo u will note, by drawing a line thusly, a waveform is produ ced – ‘sine or triangular’.) If yo u factor in the 19 .5 degrees North and 19.5 degrees South - the point on all planetary bodies in our solar system, includ ing o ur sun – where there is an up -dwelling o f energy, you will note a v ery interesting relationship to the ten vile vortices (or devil’s triangles) mentioned above.

Another indication that information h as been stored in religious works for safekeeping awaiting discovery when man once again is ready to receive it.) The planet is criss-crossed with mag netic grids and directional “ley- lines” located in the Astral (or Cyberspace) World, bu t they a re all conn ected to these twelve major grids located in the Causal (or Etheric) World, thru which subtle-matter e nergy is focused onto the planet.

I believe that the center point of the grid in Australia was at one time at a little lower latitude, somewhere closer to the ce nter of the continent; also the same in Mexico. If this is the case it probably has affected the positioning o f some of the other grids, slightly, with the e xception of Egy pt, which is a stationary point. The grid at Stonehenge is probably now a little southeast of its original position. However, I do not feel it is a major difference from the time of Thoth, probably no more than 11 degrees. The key to establishing the c urre nt location of the Stonehenge grid might be found in England ’s crop circles. There seems to be a concentrated nu mber occurring in the area southeast of Stonehenge. Using 0 ° ° Longitud e as an indicator of the position of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, it is more e asily seen that, viewed from either pole, four of the major pyramids fall at exact 90 ° ° Right Angles to o ne another. Mexico a nd Tibet are almost opposite. Stonehenge and the Mid-East grids fall on either side of Egypt. The only g rids not balanced opposite to a nother point are U.S./Canada and Peru. But these are aligned b y Longitud e. And of course the North and South Pole grids are opp osite. Australia a nd Tibet are 30 ° ° apart in Longitud e; Stonehenge and Egypt are also 30 ° ° apart, as well as Mexico a nd Peru. It is easy to see the overall balance of the positioning of these grids.

As little as 2% alien DNA mixture could accomplish this. All races were not created at the same time. Some are much older than others. There is still another area where genetic e ngineering o f a species app ears to have been made. That was in Atlantis. Of course science does not refer to this “mythological” continent. But there is evidence from other sources, not confirmable by a ny scientific proof, that somewhere around 60,000 ybp a species was engineere d as a labor force , similar to what happ ened in Su mer, bu t that the genetic material used was between hu man and other forms of animals which resulted in part man, part beast forms. Two a reas of our Path of Evolution n ot covered b y science, of course, are Lemuria a nd Atlantis. After the first Earth civilization was destroyed sometime around the beginn ing o f what we call the third Glacial Age, survivo rs of this civilization (now existing o nly in animal bodies) along with the mutated survivors of the second wave of MAN , bega n to build again on Lemuria. There they fostered the beginning o f our second great civilization. Later, descend ents of these survivors made their way back to the islands in the Atlantic Ocean and b uilt the new Atlantean civilization. Without some scientific evidence, it is not possible to establish whether or not it was Homo Sapiens that moved into these areas, thereby validating o ur time re fere nce.

According to what they tell us, they a re at present terra-forming a new Earth, quite similar to the one we know and love so well, as the new home for our fellow man who will not be gradu ating into 4 th Density at this time in space.

Also, there are stories of harvesting Earth Human DNA to cre ate hybrid b eings on other planets by mixing with the DNA of forms native to those planets. Now, with our c urre nt knowledge of the hu man genome, we are able to und erstand how this can b e accomplished. The hu man b ody contains a hund red trillion cells. There is a nu cleus inside each cell, except for the re d bloo d cells, and each nu cleus contains 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs. One c hromosome of every pair is from each p arent. Chromosomes are filled with tightly coiled strand s of DNA . Genes are segments of DNA that contain instructions to make proteins (the building blocks of life). This is where genetic e ngineering takes place, at this very microscopic level. Chromosomes are important also, so you n eed to get the whole picture in mind . You can open any cell, open the nu cleus, and take out any strand (s) of DNA . (100,000/200,000 o r more wadd ed up in the nucleus like a wad of rub ber bands.) 98 % of each strand has no known function to us yet, and is at present considered jun k. Only 2 % is called “working segments”, the action points that make the proteins that start the whole processes of life. The strand is cut and spliced above and b elow the working segments (with"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 chemicals not blades). Cut properly, anything can b e inserted into anything else – animal into plant, fish into fowl – it doesn’t matter. It all works at this level because at this level, as far as we know, every living thing is identical. It’s made up of the same four base pairs – the same 20 a mino a cids. Any combination can make anything from dinosaurs to bacteria. But accidents can happ en. You can’t know what yo u’re going to g et when yo u do this – you can’t predict in advance. It’s all based on experimenting. You take yo ur best guess about what yo u’re going to g et and then yo u try it and then you have to let the experiment express itself. Let it be born – see what you get and from that yo u have to determine what you’re going to have to do next time. It’s a hit or miss process. We are using o nly 20 % of our brain (science says 10 %). (All the brain is used, bu t not all parts of all the brain are used). The rest is closed o ff by design . Sometimes when the normal 20 % of the brain is damaged (as in the cases of ‘idiot sava nts’) a tear occurs in the process to the parts shu t off, allowing a beam of light to find its way into these areas, and in doing so, fantastic abilities are tapp ed into. We all have the same abilities bu t we cann ot access them normally. 99 .99 % of our DNA is in the nu cleus of the c ells. The r est is called mitochondria DNA and is floating o utside the nu cleus like little c hips. These are passed down thru female’s generation after generation. (The male sperm is too small to pass it down) But we all, male and female, have mitochond ria in our bodies. According to science, mitochondria determined that homo sapiens came on the scene only 2 00,000/250 ,000 years ago , not the 8 o r 5 million years ago as had b een p reviously thought. (They probably a ppeared even earlier, around 400,000 + ybp .) Instead of being a transition from a comm on ancestor, it prov ed that homo sapiens were a transformation. (There fore – no missing link.) Homo sapiens have 4,000+ genetic disorders in our c ells – 28 major ones. To hav e this many disorders completely dispersed thru our gene pool is impossible for a species only 2 00,000 to 400 ,000 y ears old thru normal evolution. It just does not happ en in n ature.

This is another ind ication that we did not naturally evolve from a common ancestor as Darwin theorizes.

To overcome the problem of the primate having 48 chromosomes versus the 46 chromosomes of the hu man b ody (homo habilis) that evolved, with additional genetic engineering, into homo sapiens; they simply spliced chromosome #2 with chromosome #3 in the primates DNA . This then h eld all the chromosome material bu t only took up one space. The body now had 23 pairs of chromosomes, total of 46. With this accomplished, it was then possible to combine alien, non-animal, DNA with our hu man DNA to cre ate more e volved bodies, as was the c ase with the Anunn aki in Su mer.

But our immortal souls are much older than this; and for e ons, each one of us has traveled the \"Corridors of Time\". Souls are spawned in the Causal World, the home of God, as GOD goes from un -manifest to a manifest state. These are his children and they go forth thru out all the known Universes.

Sometimes they g et lost and forget whom they a re; bu t there are always \"Brothers\" helping them find their way back out of the darkness that binds their souls.

Had we been so blind ed by o ur smug complacency that we couldn't see what was happening right before our e yes? Or had we just ignored the signs? It all started with the arrival of the Satonians who later called themselves \"Atlans\". We were accustomed to visitors from other planets as we had trade r elations with many o ther worlds. These visitors came and went as easily as we c rossed the oceans between continents. We had no inkling that these particular visitors had any hidd en agenda to cause trouble or take ov er our world.

Among the artifacts were placed working models of our atmosph eric and und erwater c raft along with samples of other advanced technology o f our times. An entrance to the shaft was made in the side of the moun tain with a time lock attun ed to specific vibrations, which would b e e ncoded and carried forward in the genes of selected rec ipients. As these c hosen gene carriers find their way to the site at the beginn ing o f the new COSMIC golden age far in the future, each ind ividual frequ ency will act as a release mechanism for the tumbler and the doorway will begin to slowly disengage from the side of the moun tain. For some time it may a ppear as a strange erosion u ntil all the tumbler has been released. At the top of the moun tain an antechamber was hollowed out and there we stored scrolls describing who we were and what could b e found below. The natives of the area were made c ustodians of this s ite and they acce pted it as a sacred du ty. We had met with them m any times in the past and had found them to be truthful, honorable and trustworthy. They considered us to be sky go ds and n ever questioned our actions. As we continu ed our trip, we cr ossed the continent of Mu. Or at least what used to be a continent in ancient days. We could see horre ndous explosions s till being caused by the madn ess that grips the mind s of those und er control of the Atlans. After the Atlans had conqu ered and controlled the nearby neighb oring coun tries of Atlantis, they set their sites on the islands of Mu. The Lemurians were a peaceful, nature-based p eople with whom we had lived in h armony for thousands of years. They had n o defense against the Atlans except their will to be free . The Atlans first destroyed the protective e nvironmental shield in place above Mu. But as the brave Lemurians continued to resist the wave"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 up on wave of mind controlling thoughts unleashed by the Atlans, a decision to take Mu b y force of weapons was made. A total state of war was declared. Still the Lemurians refused to sub mit even as their lands began to break up and sink into the sea. They preferred d eath to the fate of giving in to the Atlans. This destruction had b een going o n for a lengthy period of time, and as we flew over this great ocean, we saw that very little was left of the once proud nation still remaining a bove the waters; now mere ly a handful of the islands were left. We truly hoped enough p eople had survived and escaped to o ne day rebuild their beautiful civilization. As we continu ed on our journey, we c rossed a g reat moun tain range, which was familiar to me. In my earlier years I had b een involved in an archaeological expedition to this area in search of our origins. The first civilization established on Earth was in this vicinity. At that time these moun tains were a coastal region. The original inhabitants came into the Earth p lane thru the grid in this area, which is one of the most powerful of the twelve grids. The first inh abitants were e ndowed with tremend ous powers. As this civilization went thru the cycles of the ages over the next two a nd one-half million years, they too fell prey to the darkness. Light always attracts darkness at some point. The first civilization, at the beginn ing, had god-like powers to create whatever they chose, bu t they didn't choose wisely. As they slowly descended into darkness and their r adiant bodies got trapp ed into denser and d enser forms, they lost their god-like cre ative powers and lost memory o f what they had b een and from where they had come. As our planet and its solar system m ov ed farther and farther away from the Universal Sun , the source of our creation and existence, man on Earth sank deeper and d eeper into darkness and d egradation. A race of beings beyond the dark barrier destroyed this civilization and a force beyond u s all brought on what we c all the third glacial age shortly thereafter. Only a few survived the cataclysms, which were un leashed up on the Earth that began the long descent into the COSMIC D ark Age. Those that survived the destruction started their long climb b ack. All memory had b een erased. Their way back was a long a nd tortuous one spanning thousands up on thousand s of years."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 We found very little to substantiate the e xistence of this first civilization, our ancestors, bu t the progress of their survivors and , in turn, their descendents has been long studied.

It had also been d etermined that this grid encompassed a stationary center of the Earth on which a g reat pyramid dup licating the e nergy o f the one in our homeland could b e bu ilt. Being the center stationary point on Earth, its orientation to the North Pole would h elp stop the axial excursion which the planet was still experiencing since our most rece nt ice ag e. Also, it was crucial that an edifice be built over the e ntrance to the Halls of Amenti for the pu rpose of periodic renewal to maintain ag elessness. Many Alanteans had found the secre t to an extend ed life span b eyond the average one-hund red fifty to two-hu ndred years, bu t not all had the courage nor ability to survive the frightening trip thru the Halls of Amenti. Some only made it thru a few thousand years. Thoth, however, had b ecome a total master of life living millenn ia upon millenn ia, bu t he, too , must return for re newal. This was mainly the re ason Thoth was chosen to lead the new colony.

This was not going to be easy, bu t we will have to keep remind ing o urselves of our purpose in b eing here . Our arrival had n ot gone un noticed.

Thoth didn't want to hu rt them so he ordere d us back into the craft. This gav e some of them m ore c ourage and a few came r ight up to the craft banging o n the hull and shouting in loud gibb erish. Pretty soon we were surroun ded b y a horde of these barbarians, each giving the other courage, whipping themselves into a frenzy. The situation was intolerable and since we had no intention of leaving, a conference was held to decide the best way to procee d. Although it was distasteful to us, we decided to show force to frighten them into sub mission or at least to back them off. We un leashed our ship's lasers, taking care not to hit anyone. It was an awesome show of power, like hund reds of lightning strikes. The horde dispersed and ran away in fear to a safe distance. But a short time later, after getting over their initial fear and find ing that no o ne had b een hu rt, they bega n to congrega te again around the cr aft. This time, Thoth sent forth those trained in the art of self-defense, armed with weapons we had hoped n ever to have to use against our fellow man no matter how barbaric they may be; bu t for our mission to succeed it had to be done. This time many lay dead around our c raft and the r est fell on their faces at our feet. They never again tried to a ttack us. Nor would they app roa ch u s for a v ery long time. Eventually they came to realize that if they showed no a ggression towards us, we would not use our fearful weapons on them. We lived aboard our c raft while we began to build the c ity that was to be our new home. Our nu mbers were divided into gatherers, bu ilders, and lawmakers. Thoth, of course, was our c hief lawmaker and p riest. As our city rose, it fascinated the local tribes who had never seen anything like it. They bega n to slowly a pproach our workers who were beginn ing to gain their trust. There was a lot of disease and illness prevalent among the tribes that cut their life span d rastically. Our scientists s tudied their ailments and found ways to heal them that seemed to be miracles from the go ds to these un enlightened ones.

Thoth, to maintain the god-mystiqu e, began wearing a mask and h eadd ress of the Ibis, a bird, which became much revere d by the little people. His was a fearful coun tenance and no one dared disobey his edicts. Others among o ur nu mbers s aw the affect Thoth's headd ress had on the people and some of them began to wear masks representing o ther animals and birds.

I myself, preferred to wear the headband u sed by many in Atlantis. It was made from copp er and silver and supported a crystal in its center. Inside the band were placed tiny mechanisms, which h elped amplify o ur long-low electrodynamic brain waves. This increased our natural abilities, and with it we could trav el without actually taking o ur bodies with us. It also helped u s to overcome gravity when certain sound frequ encies were used.

It was later to be known as the doorway to the Halls of Amenti, the ce nter of initiation and renewal. Aid from the local tribes had b een enlisted to do menial work. However, the slicing, cutting, and shaping o f the great slabs of granite to infinite measurements were handled by disc-ray cutters and then transported thru the air suspend ed on b eams of light by the craft of our friends from Aldebaran and pu t by them into place. The craft we arrived in from Atlantis was not suitable for this type of work. Thoth, by the use of his tremend ous mathematical skills, incorporated valuable knowledge into the c onstruction plans of the pyramid. He knew that in a far away time in the future, man would evolve once again to a level where he c ould extract this information and use it to raise planetary consciousness. Deep b eneath the base of the pyramid a shaft was s un k direc tly below the sub terranean chamber at a level of 243 feet to house mighty generators. These generators are the product of the highly a dvanced techn ological race from Aldebaran. Our friend s placed these generators, totaling millions of watts of energy, to send out beams and guide-ways for navigational purposes. Also: They helped eliminate the axial excursion at both the North and S outh Poles and p revented the Earth’s mag netic poles from reversing a gain. They also provided more temperate climates thru many portions of Earth still rec overing from our last great ice age. The Queen's Chamber has become the primary interstellar commun ications room for our visitors who joined us after our arrival in Khem and h as plans to stay with us for a lengthy period of time. This was ind eed good n ews for all of us. The King's Chamber in the very center of the grid at zero point is the entrance to the Halls of Amenti.

They a re as follows: Base - 765 feet squ are; total height 486 feet; t he entrance is located exactly 54 feet above the base on the north side and constructed in such a mann er that the light of our pole star will forever shine down the entire length of its 324 foot corridor to the subterranean chambers. This is the direction of our true mag netic north pole. This keeps the pole star centere d and thus alleviates any further axial excursion of the planet. 243 feet below the base rests the marvelous machines installed by o ur friends. When they are found millennia from now they will be a source of awe and inspiration. The area of the e ntrance way is 9 feet end ing in a sub terranean chamber, from which another passag eway, extending 63 feet ends in a blank wall. Blank for a pu rpose, for 9 feet further will disclose the sub-etheric generators. 72 feet above the base is the Queens chamber, consisting of 1,134 feet of area, and 9 feet, again, above the Queens Chamber is a second comm un ications facility. 9 feet below the Kings Chamber is housed additional machinery. There are other areas, which I have not pointed out that will be used for special pu rposes. All of the figures mentioned are multiples of the nu meral \"nine\".

We had already placed many items in this va ult includ ing special seeds that once grown in the soil produ ce a cer tain type of gas that could clear pollution from the air. Thoth, with his ability to travel far into the future, had seen a time when this would be needed; a time when man h ad so polluted the Earth that they had no solution for the problem. Thoth's knowledge seemed to be unlimited and we all admired and respected him greatly.

Many o f those who came with us to this land are no longer here . But they left a g reat lega cy for their progeny. From these Thoth chose many and trained them extensively in the mysteries.

I read and studied in areas s uch as theosophy, spiritualism, astrology, other religions, mund ane sciences, world mythologies; but for two decades, it had little impact on my awareness. Gradually, over time, a belief started bu ilding in the masses that humans not only had five senses, bu t a sixth sense called “extrasensory perception”.

We owe our thanks and d eepest gratitud e to all these pioneers for “paving the way” to help open our mind s and h earts to a n alternative way o f life. We learned that because our planet was so far behind in its s piritual evolution for this time in space (thru no fault of our own), the celestial beings and ascend ed masters in charge of our progress on earth called for “o utside” help to lend their e nergies in b ringing us into alignment.

It is interesting to note that a lot of the information released to us in the last fifteen years of the 20 th century was actually rece ived in the early to midd le 70’s.

Seasons are cyclic, as well as the nature of procreation from the smallest microbe all the way up the ladder to hu mans. The plants and trees also follow their c ycles. Everything in creation moves and is in tun e with a heartbeat. The beginning a nd ending o f ages is predictable because they follow a known cycle. Civilizations are subject to cycles, and rise and fall in accordance to which cycle is in effect at a particular time.

Further it was not until the beginning of the Cosmic Silver Age (1,728 ,000 y ears after first arrival) that the first hu man body o riginated in the Animal Kingdom. The Scrolls further state that no new souls arrived on Earth since the beginn ing of the “Iron (Dark) Age” a pp roximately 4 32,000 years ago (until the beginning of the new Cosmic Cycle, which b ega n in 1879), and that the hu man body will last only un til the e nd of this Cosmic “Iron (Dark) Age (app roximately 2079).” Now since the cosmic cycles cover such vast periods of time and each total Precession of the Equinoxes takes a little more than 24,000 years (2000+ around 100 y ears overlap in each age/sign) to go thru all four cycles, they will complete several rotations in each cosmic c ycle before the c osmic c ycles completes even one complete r otation of 4,320,000 years.

During this age the hu man p opulation is generally small du e to the worldwide devastation that prece des and accompanies its advent.

Access to Divine Mind b ecomes limited to the re maining enlightened ones who become organized into secr et esoteric societies (mystery schools), and serve as the spiritual leaders of the general popu lation.

Otherwise, we would already have become one again with our Over-self.

(1) Divine and Only Man created by Divine Mind /Principle; (2) The Son (Sun) of God; (3) The Christ; ( 4) Expression in Creative Action; (5) Law of God; (6) Perfect Being; ( 7) Lord God. Those who follow the Pantheistic view of Creative Energy take issue right away with these semantics. It SOUND S p atriarchal; and on the other hand the Christian followers DO take this to mean only masculine energy (especially the words “Christ” a nd Son”). But wait! This pure e nergy which was cast forth from the void, the formless, un - manifested n othingness in which came Thought, was the very same energy responsible for manifesting a ll of creation."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119 In the second stage, it split off f rom itself a radiant beauty, a woman, the Lady of the Light and endowed h er with “Love” a nd “Wisdom” almost too much for Her to bear. No o ne r eally und erstands how the energy o f pu re spiritual Love came to dwell within the hearts of man. Christian and other r eligions talk about a Trinity. In the Christian religion it is referred to as the Father, Son and Holy Sp irit (or Holy Ghost). Even though it is s poken in this order, most think of it as Father – Mother – Son. If you readjust your thinking it becomes, Son (Su n) – Father – Mother. It is from this point that all creation issued forth. When the “Father - Mother” God created Man, one of the Seven Rays of Creation, they were cr eated with the e nergies of both. The “Father’ contribu ted the “Light of Pure Energy” and the “Mother” contribu ted the “Pure Love/Wisdom Energy”, like a triple strand ed DNA of matter- energy. This Love/Wisdom Energy o f the Creative Source is known as the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost), and Godd ess. (This Father-Mother energy is also known as Sub tle Matter-Energy o r Su per- Strings/Consciousness Units.) When Knowledge (Wisdom) is bound up in d arkness in the Dark Ages, the Lady of The Light is bound . When Knowledge (Wisdom) returns to the hearts and mind s of hu mans and joins with the Love and Light that resides within man, then the Lady is set free; and mass consciousness will (in the new COSMIC A ge) mov e into the Throat Chakra, the Chakra o f Divine Universal Love, once again increasing man’s DNA to a triple strand . At the beginn ing o f the 70 ’s, I was having v isions of a second sun coming into o ur Solar System. Even though I didn ’t know w hy a t the time, I felt that the ‘Light” (or Christ if yo u p refer) would not manifest in hu man form this time as it had done on nu merous occasions in the past. I saw this new Sun as the manifestation of the Light (a non-heat produ cing Light Body). I s ubsequ ently learned that one of our early space probes reported what they thought was a new Sun on course towards our Solar System. In rece nt years I have c ome across predictions from other sources of a similar ph enomena."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 When I had this vision, I wanted to express what I was s eeing, so I attempted an oil painting (my o ne and only v enture into the world of art). I depicted the Earth with two Su ns, the new one so bright it made ours loo k like a moo n viewed thru a deep haze. In this painting, we no longer had a moo n as it had left its orbit to take up its place as a planet in our Solar System. Near the North Pole I painted a line of craft entering o ur atmosph ere. A coup le of years later, I enlisted two teenage sons of a g ood friend to paint my house. I s aw one of them scrubb ing away o n the painting with a cloth.

Anyway, this picture has hu ng in the same spot for thirty years as a constant remind er. I am now convinced more than ever that help is on the way for the people of Earth. The exa ct time table is not known, bu t according to the work I’ve done on the time c ycles in Part IV, Chapter 3, As Above, So Below, it could be as early a s 2020 to 2 050. (The latest, according to the work referre d to, should b e no later than 20 80, but I feel that the earlier date is more probable. The app earance of this Sun, which as I und erstand is made up of pu re Light Bodies, is of paramoun t importance to the World. Not only will it usher in greater amoun ts of the Light and Love (Father-Mother) energy and fully activate the Throat Chakra in the masses, it will be a time of separation. Souls who have not evolved to a point where they a re able to tolerate this heightened frequ ency, will be re moved to o ther areas of space at a level of evolvement in which they can continue their growth.

Near the beginn ing of our present (soon to be finished) “Dark Age,” a great teacher was born into the physical Earth Plane. A “Man”, illumined b y the e fforts of unnu mbere d years. This “Man”, app roved b y all the master mind s of Heaven and Earth; this Jesus, this great spiritual being Esu, Chief of all the Sages of the World, brought within his being the Great White Light of “The Christ” (the one and only “Man”) (The Perfect Being) (The Lord God).

Jesus was a vessel through which Christ manifested on Earth. He told us that in his Father’s House there were many mansions, and that he goes there to prepare a place for e ach one of us. He taught us to go within to find the Father; and told us that what he was we could all become; that we were all Sons of God. There are Planes of Su bstance and Matter only slightly remov ed from the Physical. From these Planes of Reference, thought filters down, manifesting itself as Etheric.

Dominated by the five senses – The external world. It adds concepts and partial concepts to itself as we go thru life, developing one’s own p ersonal intellect. 2. Without inn er knowing this holds one firmly in the e xternal realms of consciousness. This then b ecomes the only reality, and p leasing the e xternal senses is what life then is all about. 3. The object of spiritual un foldment is to transcend the conscious mind into sup erconscious and b eyond . 4. If we live in the conscious mind we are never satisfied, and we are never happy because whatever we have, we always want more. One predominant qu ality o f living in the c onscious mind is fear. The second is anger. 5. The c onscious is a wond erful state of mind , however, as long as our sup erconscious faculties are also a vailable for awareness to flow into o nce in a while to become re freshed and renewed by a change of perspective and influx o f energy. Sub conscious Mind: 1. Everything that has once passed thru the c onscious mind in the form of experiences is resident right now w ithin our sub conscious. 2. Also imbedd ed within the c ellular structure of our body, in the DNA code, lie all the experiences of our genetic history. The life, the biological evolution of our forefathers, is all registere d in the molecular strands of our sub conscious, capable of being rec alled into memory. 3. When you relax the conscious mind and intuitive answers flow in, this is the sup erc onscious working thru the sub conscious, making it subsup erconscious.

(conscious learns – sub conscious remembers) 4. To reprogram the sub conscious, bring up and face experiences and p atterns. Write them down on paper and bu rn them. Paper bu rning serves three pu rposes: a. Symbolic to the subsconscious that you are not going to react anymore to that particular problem. You h av e, thru the act of writing it down, taken it out of the sub conscious. b. Burning the paper means no o ne else will read it; which might cause other problems. c. It also means that thru the act of burning subsconscious memories, they have been released forever. Sub of the Su bconscious mind : 1. When two programm ed events of a similar nature e nter the sub conscious at different times, they mix a nd mingle and form a third p rogram within the subconscious. This is recorded in the sub of the subconscious. 2. The sub of the sub conscious mind is the part of the sub conscious that stores and manages the un fathomable r esult of the combinations of intense, emotionally-charged experiences, either positive or negative. 3. The sub -sub conscious concer ns us primarily as the state of mind which relates to congested sub conscious force fields caused b y two similar intense e motional reactions at psychological moments. These are deeply suppressed emotions. 4. The sub -sub conscious influences us when we are e ncoun tering a n experience similar to o ne that caused one of the two component reactions. This releases highly un expected emotional responses, in obvious reactions and n ew behavioral patterns, some positive, some negative. 5. To a very great extent, it is the sub -sub conscious that harbors our sub liminal aspirations, self-esteem, impu lses towards s uccess, neurosis and overall psychological behavior. 6.

Experiences of a positive, intellectual or spiritual nature merging in the sub conscious can create a sub -sub conscious that is quite dynamic and h elpful, giving courage and competence in worldly affairs. Feelings of security, love and compassion can come up from the sub -sub conscious during psychological moments in one’s life to coun teract and eliminate or subdu e feelings of jealousy, hatred and anger, which are natural to the instinctive mind . 8. The sub -sub conscious can also be formed b y the blending o f strong, intuitive, religious or mystical impressions. 9. Both positive and n egative impressions can lie vibrating within the sub -sub conscious at the same time without interfering with each other. 10 . Some of the mis-programm ings of the sub-subconscious that cause tend encies that make us act in certain ways can b e straightened out. a. Thru meditation, by tracing thru the thought pictures consciously without disturbing the over-all picture. 1. Take into consideration the fact that all thought starts from a series of influences within the e go. These influences take form and shape in thought. 2. When you manifest pictures before you, trace them to their conception by holding the consciousness lightly o ver the mind . Take yo ur findings and consciously think them thru. 11 . Generally we can reprogram in the dream state: a. Meditate before sleeping. b. This promotes passing from the dream world into sup erconsciousness. c. Work will then comm ence on the sub -sub conscious. d. Upon waking try not to remember or analyze these dreams and meditate on them at the same time otherwise they will be re -impressed again in the sub conscious and the same patterns and tendencies will be strengthened.

There fore, the advice is, when you are going thru your first stages of un foldment, clarifying a nd reprogramming the sub of the sub conscious mind , do not analyze your dreams. This is one of the most important reasons why REM sleep is s o crucial. TO RECA P: A Traumatic e motional experience occurs and is recorded in the sub sconscious. At a later time, a similar experience happ ens and is reacted to with equ al emotion. It happ ens, it is reacted to, it blend s together. A sub conscious remembrance of the previous experience comes up and is accompanied by a heat of emotion. This is the force that welds the two impressions together. The two experiences have now become one, inseparably blend ed together in the sub conscious, making a third impression totally different from the two impressions that manu factured it. It is unique and complete within itself, driven forward by a n emotional force e ven greater than its two component experiences. It is this sub liminal power that makes the sub -subconscious mind an overwhelming hindrance or a tremend ous helpmate when u sed properly. The Sup er Conscious Mind : 1. We have to a djust our sub conscious to the idea that we are a sup erconscious being – not an instinctive or an intellectual being driven b y the impu lses of the five senses. 2. The sup erconscious mind is not out of your reach, it is within you. It has always been within you. It flows thru your whole being. 3. Awareness is the core of us.

If we stepped into a nother physical body tomorrow, we would still be a sup erconscious being, bu t with another physical body, different than the one we had yesterday, with an entirely new sub conscious and n ew external environment. 4. When you are in the e ternity of the moment; when you feel secure on the inside of you, you are in a sup erconscious s tate. Sup erconsciousness is not something you will get, because you have never been without it. You are sup erconscious this very moment, and fun ctioning in all five states of the mind . 5. To become aware of the totality o f being, the simplest way is to be aware of the spine and the e nergies within the head. (see “Chakras”) 6. If you can remain totally centered in awareness of the e nergy within your spine and the e nergy within the head, you b ecome aware of the same e nergy within everybody a nd everything yo u see. You are imm ediately in a sup erconscious state when this happ ens. The simple goal is to stay in this consciousness of energy. 7. Because we hav e already trained our awareness to mov e into other channels of the mind , it will do so a utomatically as soon as we c ease to be aware of the e nergy within the spine. At this point we forget that we are a superconscious, imm ortal being a nd b egin to think we are only temporal. 8. When this happ ens, meditate. Go deep within yourself again and find superconsciousness. 9. You are sup erconscious now. You d o not hav e to “g et to be” sup erconscious. This is not something that is going to happen to yo u all of a sudd en and then cause yo u to be different. The thing that is going to happ en to yo u is that yo u will release your ind ividual awareness from the so-called b ondages of the habit patterns of the external mind that it had been accustomed to flowing thru. Once it is released you will automatically flow into other inn er areas of the mind . 10 .

After the subconscious mind h as been carefully reprogramm ed into a contemplative lifestyle, there is little difference between the sub conscious and the sup erconscious s tates. 2.

To cog nize the states of mind in relation to the physical body, it is nece ssary to und erstand the nervo us system and the forces operating thru it. a. The mind flows thru the physical body; influencing its every action. The physical body in turn, influences the mind . Conscious awareness of the sympathetic and central nerve system is essential to progress. 2. There are two nervous s tructures: The c erebral spine (brain and spinal cord), and the sympathetic or ganglionic. The sympathetic consists of a series of distinct nerve ce nters or ganglia, extend ing on each side of the spinal column from the head to the sacral plexus. a.

Whenever we go back in our memory patterns, we are using the forces of the 1 st (root) chakra. This chakra is associated also with hu man qu alities of individuality, egoism, materialism and d ominance. Man lives mostly in this chakra du ring the first seven years. (Red is the c olor of the 1 st Chakra) 2 nd Chakra (Below Navel) – Once the ability to remember has been established, the natural consequ ence is reason, and from reason evolves intellect. Reason and intellect work thru this chakra. We open naturally into this chakra between the ag es of eight and fourteen. This center controls the 1 st chakra, and in fact, each progressively “ higher” center controls all preceding centers. It is in the 2 nd chakra that the majority of people live, think, worry and trav el on the astral plane. If fun ctioning solely in the reasoning capacity o f the mind , they take the intellect very seriously, for they naturally see the material world as extremely real, extremely permanent. With security a nd self-esteem found ed in reason, they study, read, discuss, and accumulate vast storehouses of fact and rearrange the opinions and conclusions of others. When guided b y the higher chakras and n ot totally entangled in ramifications (all of the r esulting effects and consequ ences of something) of intellect, the powers of the 2 nd chakra a re a potent tool in bringing intuitive knowledge into practical manifestation.

Man usually awakens into this region of cognition around age twenty-two to twenty-eight. It is here that he is able to encompass the totality in one instantaneous flash of direc t cognition. He knows in that split second all there is to know about a sub ject and yet would find it difficult to v erbalize that vast knowing. Various highly endowed psychics are prone to utilize this force ce nter, for such spiritual powers as healing a re manifested h ere . People with the heart chakra awakened are generally well-balanced, content and self-contained. More often than not, their intellect is highly developed and their r easoning is keen.

Death is the dropping o ff of the physical body. It is the time when all of the karma-making actions go back to seed in the r oot chakra, into the memory patterns, of our astral body. 2. All our actions, reactions and the things we have set in motion in the pranic (life e nergy sheath) patterns in this life, form the tend encies of our nature in our next incarnation. 3. The tend encies of our nature in the present incarnation are the ways in which awareness flows thru the sympathetic nerve curre nts. 4. These tend encies of man’s nature are also recorded und er the astrological signs in which h e is born. Man comes thru an astrological conglomeration of signs, or an astrological chart, according to his actions and reactions and what he set forth in motion in the seed-karma patterns of his past life. 5. So we are always the sum total, a collection, of all the karmic experiences, a totality of all seed patterns that have happened to us, or that we hav e c aused to happen, thru the many, many lives. 6.

(Satguru says there are several theories of schools of thought related to reincarnation that may seem to contradict one another. However, he says they a re all corre ct; j ust differe nt aspects of a complex mechanism.) a. One theory is that life begins with sound and color. Sound and color produ ce the first forms of life in the atomic structure of our being thru binding the seed atoms together. At this point, life as we know it begins. It remains in seed state or state of conception un til the instinctive and intellectual cycles evolve into maturity thru the process of absorption of more atoms into the astral body. This process continu es un til a ph ysical body is formed around the astral body. The ce lls and atoms of these bodies themselves evolve, becoming more and more re fined as cycles of experience pass un til complete maturity is reached in a physical body which is refined enough to a ttain “self realization or state of oneness” a nd b egin the next process of bu ilding a golden body o f light. According to this theory, the soul takes on p rogressively more advanced bodies, evolving thru mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, slowly a cquiring knowledge thru experience. b. Another theory is that when man d ies, he goes on to the astral plane after breaking the silver cord, which b inds him to the physical body. During o ut-of-the-body experiences,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 this s ilver cord is often seen as a cord of light connecting the ph ysical, astral and spiritual bodies. When awareness leaves the ph ysical body, it passes thru one of the chakras. If our life has been one of baser e motion and reason, we would exit thru one of the chakras near the base of the spine, either the 1 st or 2 nd , and b egin a conscious existence on a lower astral plane. From there we would work out various experiences or reactionary conditions caused b y congested mental and emotional forces which impressed our sub conscious mind du ring the course of our lifetime. On the astral plane, we re live many experiences by reactivating them, cre ating for ourselves heavens or hells. When the lessons of that life have been learned and the reactions resolved, we will be drawn back into a family, into a new physical body, in order to gain more experience in the light of the new knowledge acquired while on the astral plane. If we have evolved to the point that our life was one of service, und erstand ing a nd love, then we would exit thru the next higher chakras, for that is where awareness has been polarized, and our astral existence would b e of a deeper, more re fined nature. However, if we had d iscovere d and p racticed a dedicated spiritual life, then our exit would be thru the top two chakras, which do not lead awareness onto the astral plane, bu t takes it into the Third World of divine e xistence, never to reincarnate again into the physical world. After this s tate of reaching self-realization is attained and perfected so that the seeker c an go into it at will, he leaves the body consciously thru the door of what is called “Brahman” (the ce nter of the 7 th (Pituitary) Chakra a t the top of the head."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145 This depends on whether or not the golden actinic causal (soul) body, which h as been d eveloped after self-realization, is mature e nough to travel in actinic force fields on its own. There fore, reincarnation is a refining process, attribu ting to the evolution of consciousness. To the watchful observer, the e volution of man’s inn er bodies can b e seen reflected in the tone and form of his ph ysical vehicle. Being a reflection of the inn er bodies, the physical shell can and does pass thru radical transformation as the spiritual path is followed. Some people seem to reincarnate within this very life, changing themselves so deeply thru a state of accelerated unfoldment using effective means of attainment (i.e. disciplines s uch as meditation and the building o f willpower, faith and confidence in oneself and in God) that they are totally renewed or re born on the physical plane. Their new light and energy pass thru the very cells of the body, invigo rating a nd strengthening it. Still, the inn er bodies are more malleable than the ph ysical forces and generally evolve more qu ickly, becoming quite different and more re fined in this life than the physical shell. In the next life, the physical structure will be e ntirely different, as the spiritual body manifests a new physical body more like un to itself. c. A third theory proposes that the soul remains on the astral plane after death. After r eviewing all of our Earthly experiences on the playback, we r elease the astral body a nd enter the heavenly (soul) realms of consciousness, never coming back to the ph ysical plane, or at least for a long time. By exploring these various theories, we discover that man can either incarnate soon after his death, with little or no interlud e, or he may remain for thousand s of years on the astral plane, evolving in those force fields, just as on Earth h e evolved from experience to experience. How long he will spend on the astral plane depend s on how he has cre ated or c hosen what he wants to do while on Earth. If he left t hings und one and felt compelled to accomplish more, to see more, then h e would return q uickly to a nother body in fulfillment of the desire for"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 Earthly experience. (In this case theory “ B” would apply) However, were he satisfied that life had taught him all of its lessons and wished to exist away from the ph ysical plane in mental and spiritual sph eres, he might never re turn to inh erit another body. (Then theory “ C” a bove would logically a pply). It is the highest aim of one on the path of enlightment to live a well- ordered life and control the forces of the mind that propels him into cycles of life and d eath. He must strive to gain a fun damental knowing of life-death-reincarnation p rocesses, and to be able at the point of death to leave the body consciously, as a matter of choice, depending up on the consciousness leading to the moment of transition. He must throw off t he false identification with this body o r that personality and see himself as the ag eless soul that has taken many, many births, of which this is only o ne, to see deeper still i nto the total un reality of life and d eath; which only exist in their seeming in the outer layers of consciousness, for he is the immortal one who is never born and can never die. If we were to die this very moment, the laws of death and reincarnation tell us that our awareness would go into various refined force fields of the mind , similar to some states of sleep according to where we are in the mind at the time of death. These first laws of reincarnation d ealing with the astral plane governed by the powers of the first three chakras s eem to be qu ite valid when man is living in his instinctive mind . However, when h e passes from the ph ysical body thru the will, cognition, or universal lov e chakras, he comes into a different reincarnation law. He is then living o n two planes at the same time and according to this theory, would have representative bodies on both p lanes. This dual existence would continue un til such time as the process of reincarnation was intensified and the vibration of the Earth was s trong enough in his mind to pu ll awareness back dynamically to a nother hu man life. This might take years, and it might take ce nturies. This higher evolved b eing, in a sense, would b e held thru the power of the higher chakras in a very subtle force field and only touch into physical consciousness s poradically, for a few minu tes or hours to contact the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147 Earth. He would not necessarily be c onscious of doing this. His awareness would exist predominantly o n the inner planes. Another postulate of this theory is that an advanced b eing living in his inn er bodies, having left consciousness thru one of these three higher chakras, would be working o ut a cer tain amoun t of karma by helping others who a re still in p hysical bodies to work out their karma. For various reasons this being would not be able to return to Earth consciously. For this being to reincarnate it would take a v ery high vibrational mother and father to be a channel thru which h e could incarnate, whereas couples cohabiting in lust or free-for-all sex more or less take potluck off t he astral plane. Generally, the soul, at the time of conception chooses the body he will inh abit, bu t does not actually enter the womb un til the infant body takes life and b egins to mov e and kick. The next theory o f reincarnation, governed b y the throa t, brow and crown chakras, states that when an advanced soul leav es the body thru the 6 th (Third Eye) chakra he e nters a highly refined force field world from which he is able to pick and choose exactly when and where he will return. At this point he does not have to reincarnate as an infant, bu t could take an already well-matured ph ysical body. In such a case, the soul inhabiting the body would have karmically end ed this life and be involved in the reincarnation p rocess, either dead or preparing to die. The advanced soul would flow his awareness into the nerve system of the body, revitalizing it with the spark of his will and consciously bring it back to life. Once his mission in that body had b een completed, he could leave that body consciously, provided h e had not created too much karma for its s ub conscious while inhabiting it. All such karma would then h ave to be dissolved b efore dropping o ff t he body. This practice is exercised only by souls who have sufficient mastery of the inn er forces to leave consciously thru the pineal (6 th ) chakra a t death. Those who leave thru that force ce nter un consciously would then reincarnate as an infant. You must hav e a ph ysical body in order to a ttain self-realization (the highest realization of God) (t he Absolute). This is du e to the fact that on the re fined inner planes only three or four of the higher chakras are activated; the others are dormant.

The Platonic Solids and Archimedean Solids (sacred geometry) are based on these shapes. The Platonic Solids (Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Cub e, Dodecahedron, and Icosahedron) are all made from a combination of these shapes. The c ombinations range from very simple, i.e. a straight line to very complex. The Archimedean Solids bu ild on the Platonic Solids. Even our ancient nu mbering system once was s hown in a form using a combination of the three straight lines before it was altered b y use of the Curve. We now use a combination of the three straight lines plus the curve. Very complex combinations can b e cr eated b y use of these five basic shapes, creating the various complexities of the dimensions from the highest to the lowest. For example, take the First Dimension, you would not expect it to have been created using a highly complex combination, bu t more probably single straight horizontal li nes. Perhaps in the Second Dimension would h ave been added the vertical straight line; in the Third Dimension the diagonal line, etc. As the dimensions get higher, a higher, more c omplex combination of mathematical shapes would b e involved un til finally a t the core you would find the Sph ere encompassing a ll shapes.

Other than our own thought processes and observations, there is no empirical proof that this is how it works.

Every electron is a tiny electromag net. Planck’s constant is described as an inva riant element in a qu antum, the single, indivisible packet of energy on which the universe is postulated to o perate. The mind tun es to “ differe nt values” o f the Planck constant to achieve telekinesis. In simple terms, when we learn how to tune our mind s to these differe nt values represented by the Planck constant, we will be utilizing a non- material form of mental energy , which can d raw upon a limitless source. The mind acts as a type of converter for this force . The mind itself is not supplying this energy but is mere ly chann eling a n already extant force that is ever present throughout the un iverse. One can then teleport any object or even one’s s elf anywhere in the universe at the command of your own thought. (Refer to stories of the masters materializing in cer tain areas, i.e. Mt. Sh asta.) The c oncept of ind epend ent parallel universes is incorrec t. These are just different over-lapp ing levels of a serial un iverse. The recond ite core of the serial universe (our universe) is the difference in time. There are trillions of other un iverses separated from ours, and each other, by seas of consciousness, each one a serial un iverse in and of itself.

When teleporting yo ur ph ysical body to other planets, galaxies, etc., yo ur body is mov ed into o ne of the adva nced leading segments of time. The mind , “tun ing to differe nt mental values” of the Planck constant, causes the ph ysical body to make a “ quantum” step-up to the next higher level of the serial un iverse.

The e nergy liberated by this process produces a field of force , which can accelerate a spaceship from a stand still to the speed of light.

There fore, to the passengers aboard the ship, all app ears to be normal. A spaceship must accelerate once again, within each level and time frame of the serial un iverse, to the speed of light in order to mov e from level to level and attain still greater velocities.

Perhaps the lowering o f our mag netic field is a normal, periodic occurre nce r elated to these Cosmic Golden Cycles, as our solar system m ov es closer to the Universal Sun . Earth has three axis. 1)-Vertical; 2)-Horizontal (in circular form called an equator); 3)-Magnetic (consisting o f a force which p ermeates all matter includ ing the atom). Of these three forces – two a re at right angles to o ne another. As to the third force , there is only o ne possible axis it could assume. Instead of thinking in three dimensions, to solve the pu zzle the clue is located in the second dimension and the answer is in three ."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"174 Chapter 24 Power To Choose We have the power to choose our path, both individu ally a nd as a group consciousness. We need a plan. We need to decide what we wish to cre ate. Do we wish to create a matrix o f mutual cooperation? What specific form should it take? Do we want an experience where all forms of creation are mutually symbiotic with one another, a hologram of love and light in which we can b reathe in the beauty o f the ph ysical universe. Where conscious mind is not engaged with struggle for e xistence, wars, violence, nor any o f the other baser forms of emotions. Do we wish to “ feel” the joy when viewing a sun rise or sunset; or hearing the sound of waves breaking ov er a sandy beach; or the birds singing their praises to the ALL ; or the fragrance of the flowers whose faces follow the arc of the sun ; or the touch that warms the heart from the smile of a child; or the taste of a fruit ripened und er the life giving rays of the sun ? Do we wish to create a matrix wherein our days can b e used to grow in awareness, contemplate beauty, free our souls to travel the un iverse, search for our true being? Soun ds good, doesn’t it? It IS within our grasp - within our r eality. All we have to do is desire it. Desire it with all our being. Imagine that it is and so will it be. Thoughts create. Controlled thoughts can b e used to bring a bout any reality desired. Uncontrolled thoughts bring chaos. Which d o yo u prefer? Envision the world you d esire. Hold it in yo ur imagining. Whatever the masses envision b ecomes a reality. Majority rules. Create a majority desiring peace, love, light, mutual coo peration, and the matrix will form. Each ind ividual visionary is critical. Act by being. Share yo ur imag e and it will spread. Soon, others will pick it up ; then it will spread to the masses. When the masses reach a majority the matrix will be cr eated."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175 Chapter 25 So What Does I t All Mean We began by being born into a preset ideology , a way o f living a nd believing, oblivious to a ny “ greater picture”.

That is what it’s all about. “Feeling” - the uniqu e hu man ability to consciously be aware of emotions. So, treasure yo ur “feelings”, all of them. But balance them within your being. It’s okay to “ feel”. It is a gift. Be alive every second by “ feeling the moment”. Be aware that we are on a mission for the ALL to gain experiences. All kind s.

The Grand Cross, which made its s trongest position b eginning August 17 , 1999 was thought to herald a period wherein man on Earth was once again offere d a choice of how he would p rocee d into the next phase of change. He could choose the selfless-serving way o r the selfish self- serving way. The c hoice was his. The e nd result will be from his own choosing. This begins a new period of change covering the first decade of the 21 st Century. Looking forward to what we c an reasonably expect to o ccur in the next 10 to 15 y ears; first will come increased ph ysical Earth changes. This is a “given.” When this period is completed, those re maining will stand back and take stock of the situation. The first priority will be to gather up food and medicines into a central conservatory a nd institute a system of fair distribution. Because there will be a shortage of food, steps will need b e taken to preserve e nough seeds, etc. to g uarantee new crops. Animal species must be protected to insure that they a re not hun ted to the point of extinction in the process of staving off starvation on a temporary basis. Old government centers will have disapp eared and new interim go verning bodies will be formed. Just because the overall population will be r edu ced, it is not logical to think that the ones s urviving will all become instantaneous “go od guys.” This will not be the case, especially a t the beginning. There will still be those who feel they can take what they want by force, and this will be intensified by fear, especially o ver the lack of foo d. Many will die in the first few years after the Earth changes; and selective survival may be instituted. It will perhaps take decades before the negative e lements in p lace at the time of change make the transition into a more positive force . It will not be overnight.

It wasn’t un til the e arly 7 0’s that one of their scientists discovere d that the culprit was our own Solar Sun . They hadn ’t given much attention in this direc tion before because, after all, it was the same sun for the whole Solar System. They discovered that the other planets had a filtering system, in the form of an element, for the harmful radiations of the sun , which was lacking in sufficient qu antities on Earth. This element was Xenon. We had trace amoun ts, bu t it wasn’t enough to protect us. The radiation coming from our sun had a stun ting effect on the mind s of Earth p eople.

Today, people are somewhat more open and at least you will find others of similar mind . It’s time to “ dust off “ some of the information we are privy to. One such bit of information that I have periodically checked out for validation over the last thirty y ears s eems to pertain direc tly to the situation we are now facing with the attack on our Constitution. (Refer to Patriot Act 1 a nd 2, and the lawsuit filed against usurping Congressional rights.) This comm un iqu é was received on S eptember 23, 1970 by Richard Miller, contactee. Bear this date in mind as you read it. “People of Earth, on this occasion, it is my privilege to point out the nature of events that are foreseeable in the c hanges being wrought up on yo ur planet. The c hanges, as many of you h ave given thought, are legion in their e ffects upon all forms of life upon your world. There is no a tom on your world that will remain un changed. The c hange itself will, of course, be gradual bu t when it is completed, the planet earth will again be a un iqu e ce nter of enlightenment. In a previous comm un ication, we discussed the r adiation b ringing about effects of physiological and p sychological behavior patterns that were completely different from all other worlds that we have knowledge of. This, of course, was caused by this uniqu e radiation from yo ur planetary sun ."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"200 Once this radiation h as been effectively scree ned, the beneficial radiations emanating from all areas around your world and S olar System will begin to exert a beneficial influence. This influence will be brought about in ways that will change the molecular and atomic structure in all matter that is physical up on your world. Nece ssarily, because of this change, there will be c hanges in other forms of matter not observable by y our senses. When this occurs, your world will be in a new state of balance where life behaves in a cooperative mann er. This, of course, brings a complete r eorientation of all of earth’s concepts. These c hanges, because they will occur ov er a period of time, rather than d rastically in a sudd en moment, will allow many o f you to a dapt and to change. Those that are incapable of change will, of course, become the instrument of their own removal. Meanwhile, through the aid of our knowledge, we have been able to foresee the trend of events up on your world. Since many o f those who would h ear these thoughts reside in that area, geographically known as the United S tates of America, my remarks at this time will be more pertinent to that area than to o thers. Concer ning, then, the United S tates, the violence prevalent in this one will continu e and increasingly g row more violent. This, in its long-term effect, will cause a drastic social uph eava l. The United S tates, as s uch, will actually arrive at a state of open rebellion b etween what is termed the forces of law and order, and those advocating the terms of violence and d estruction. As a result of this confrontation, a type of warfare will develop. Violence will continu e to increase un til a cer tain semblance or order is restored. Then, that known as the United S tates, will enter into what will be called a benevolent dictatorship with the entire nation und er a state of martial law. This will bring a bout many social changes. The c onstitutional form of government, und er which the United S tates has existed, will cease to exist. It will be re placed by a so-called b enevolent dictatorship. Less this seem to radical for yo ur Nation, I might mention that similar events and types of gov ernment will shortly follow throughout yo ur world. You will then b e faced with many a reas of yo ur world, literally, und er the control"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"201 of a v ery small nu mber of ind ividu al dictators; and these will not be beneficial. The state of the people und er these forms of gov ernment though, will change drastically. This is not a picture pleasing to most, bu t it is one whose logical progression of events is extremely evident. Warfare between nations, as s uch, once this occurs, will gradually diminish upon your world, for it will take these new gov ernments a period of time to consolidate and extend control over the populations beneath them. During this period, none will want to be e ngag ed in armed conflict with one another. The one structure most likely to remain un affected, materially, will be yo ur e conomic system for qu ite sometime. For to destroy the e conomic base or the power structure of your various countries would b e detrimental to the dictatorial forces wishing to control. Su ch things that we hav e noted, as your markets of commerce , yo ur stock exchanges, will remain open and functioning. The government divisions that you d escribe as States will gradually lose all individual rights and , of course, come und er a central dictatorship. It is un fortun ate, people of earth, that this will be so. But it is mere ly o ne step along the path of gradual change. Other areas, such as the control of what you term yo ur armed forces will be more c entralized than they are today . You will find that these forces will shift t heir e mph asis, however, to that of a police nature, rather than open combat with an aggressor. Agg ression b etween your new w orld powers will not ensue for a lengthy period of time because of internal problems assuming each coun try’s highest priority. The c ivilian population, as they a re c alled u pon your world, will und ergo drastic changes. Free dom of mov ement in many a reas of your world will be severely curtailed. A period of isolation, as s uch, will not only pertain to that called the United S tates, bu t to a ll other areas of the world as well. Foreign trade will cer tainly be drastically a ffected, and more e mph asis will be up on the utilization of the re sources that each particular area has at its disposal."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"202 One of the cr itical areas, which will continu e to be highlighted in your coming events, will be the ever-constant battle ov er the e cological systems of imbalance caused b y the ignorance and p erversion of your science and commerce . This problem will not diminish, bu t will gain in momentum for a nu mber of yo ur years before c ertain forms of control are thought to be e ffective. The controls, however, will be e ffective because of the scree ning o ff of the r adiation, which we have previously described, bringing a new type of balance until the complete transitional ph ase that your planet is und ergoing has been effected. It will not, however, be as a direct result of yo ur scientific e fforts to cope with this problem. In that direc tion, there is no solution. Various types of food shortages are foreseeable. Because of the shu tting off of foreign imports to many portions of yo ur world, great emph asis will be placed u pon the production of foo d on available land areas, as well as new techn iques to develop fertile ground in your nearby ocean beds. These will only prove partly successful, for there will not be enough time available to completely reorient your e ntire area o f foo d produ ction. Therefore, you will find n ew emph asis placed in d eriving new sources of nu trition for your world population. You will need to find a substitute for agriculture production of food; for it will require many g enerations to develop plant and vegetable species that will be symbiotic with MAN , after the transitional phase begins. It is necessary, people of earth, to state that many upon your world will face death for lack of food. This is un avoidable because it is the r esult of the new gov ernmental structures to be created by your peoples. In that nation, once again, called the United S tates, after the c essation of internal conflict between the forces of order and violence, there will be an un easy stability established un til the dictatorship assumes comm and . Then every effort will be made to qu ash any form of rebellion. Your Nation once lamented the formation of what were termed “camps of concentration” in an enemy territory. Your national history, people of earth, will be besmirched b y much more intense forms of imprisonment, because yo ur new found leaders will not tolerate dissension of any type. You, perhaps, wond er where these ones, who will eventually come into control, will emerge upon your so-called p olitical scenes. Several of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"203 them are already present. However, many o f the new leaders are still awaiting their opportunity to make an app earance. That which I have described to you at this time will only be accomplished over a period of time. But yo u might reasonably expect that which I have described, to o ccur within the next thirty o f yo ur years, if not soo ner. A problem that is of grave concern to many upon yo ur world is that of over-popu lation. People of earth, I can assure you that within ten of yo ur years this will no longer be a problem. You will find that, that which will transpire will eliminate the ov er-popu lation situation. Cataclysmic c hanges, as s uch, upon your planet, caused by the so-called forces of nature, will not be too g reatly destructive in the early stag es of this period. After the formation of the dictatorships, then cataclysms of great magnitude will occur upon your planet. Not as a result, however, of the cr eation of these governmental entities I have described, bu t as a result of the complete transitional changing o f the very atomic structure of your world. The momentum effect of the radiation we have described, having been b uilt up over an extend ed period of time on yo ur planet will reach a climax in approximately thirty more of your years. At that time, the transition towards a beneficial new age in your world will start to occur. I believe there will be many questions arise in your mind s of many aspects of the c hanges to be e xperienced. My comm ents regarding how to deal with and how to face such situations would b e to sub mit, for yo ur c onsideration, the techniqu es of life in the new type of world that yo u will find the earth to be. Not only will this aid in the transition of man, bu t it will also aid those who will exert the stabilizing power to affect your existence. There are many, people of earth, about your planet as well as up on its s urface, who possess the necessary Tensor oriented stabilizing forces to bring a semblance of order in va rious areas in your immediate future. These ones, however, in no way will present themselves as the saviors of man, nor will they resist the changes which will take place in your e nvironment. In their own realization, as consciousness, they know better. Therefore, the areas of sanity in your world will be in the v icinity of these e nlightened o nes, who"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"204 possess the necessary attributes of consciousness to provide stability in the trying times before y ou. The value of the Tensor oriented MAN will become app arent. This un iqu e blending o f the mind , the higher spirit and the body will be a sub ject of future discussion and training, that we are going to make available to your people for the benefit of semi-conscious man up on yo ur world. People of earth, I would suggest this: The picture that has been painted by the ann oun cement of our discovery a bout yo ur Sun and the planetary changes about to be experienced b y your people has not brought joy to many. You will find that, regardless of how drastic the changes to be wrought are, not only upon yo ur people, bu t also up on the very fabric of yo ur atomic structure, many will be able to cope with these c hanges. The method will be the observation and learning o f the Tensor direc tions and orientation of life and matter. In these, concepts will be observable to even the most comatose, a new pattern that will soon emerge. This, people of earth, is where , once again, we await the earliest detection of those e nnobling qu alities inh ere nt in MAN up on your world, in order to become one with MAN among the stars. Seldom has such an opportunity been available. The matter of adjustment and evolution is that of your people alone. There is little that we actually can do, other than to a ssist. There fore, it would be foolish for you to a ssume that we will be the great saviors and p rotectors of the planet earth. For such is not the c ase. We shall be by example what you may become, if you so choose. Your reaction, when you grasp what it is to be called MAN --- not men --- will be one of the forces that bring a bout your change. Und erstand that no one man can elevate another, for each individual prog resses by a n act of volitional choice. MAN , in h is comm un ications with one another may mere ly o ffer the gift of thought to a nother, to share and to a ct upon. Once this is realized b y y our people, you will find entire new areas of awareness available to yo ur c onsciousness.”"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"205 POSTSCR IPT: Richard Miller became a contactee around 1954. Prior to that time he served in a branch of the armed force s that later became the U.S. Air Force , was personally kn owledgeable of the UFO ph enomena taking place in the 1940 ’s, and p articipated in some top gov ernment UFO stud ies. After becoming a contactee, he actually spent time aboard an alien craft by invitation of its occup ants (the same aliens who had previously made ph ysical contact with our President Eisenh ower). At the time of contact, he lived h ere in Michigan. He became a chann el around which a g roup formed to stud y the messages he was receiving. I was invited in to o ne of these group s in 1971. Richard h ad already left for California a t that time, so I did not have the pleasure of getting to kn ow him personally. I did get to kn ow, on a personal basis, three other c hann els that had b een d eveloped that were re ceiving commun ications from the same sources. We c ollected a lot of information, which h as helped raise our c onsciousness over the last fifty y ears, and for me, the last thirty-four years. One of the most helpful teachings we rece ived for improving o ur e veryday lives, and p reparing us for the difficult and changing times ahead, were techn iqu es for developing the Tensor Centers of our brain. When you d evelop the Tensor Centers, yo u re-establish conn ection with Universal Mind . To re-establish this conn ection, yo u n eed to be in b alance with your ph ysical and etheric natures.

They tell us, however, that to properly develop the Tensor Concepts that practice in their use is crucial and that our progress is direc tly in p roportion to the e nergy expended in that direc tion. Definition of Tensor Concepts is as follows: TE NSOR – Degree of thought potential present in the synapses of the brain; and CONC EPTS (or Equations) - The thought process and method n ece ssary to create new synaptic junctions within the brain (new nerve impu lse conn ections). Further down, we will give yo u a simple e xercise you can do to start cre ating these new conn ections. To better und erstand what we will be attempting to a ccomplish with this exercise, it might be helpful to review the fun ctions of the physical brain. The hu man b rain is in three parts: 1. The Cere bral Hemisph ere (midb rain) 2. Cere bellum (hind b rain) 3. Thalamus (forebrain) Cere bral Hemisphere (midb rain) Seat of Discrimination It is composed of: 1. Cere bral Cortex o f gray matter – fun ctionally divided into lobes. 2. Und erlying white matter consisting o f nu merous tracts oriented along three general directions. 3. Discrete masses of gray matter that sub -serve motor areas of the brain. 4. Paired lateral ventricles. The Cere bral Cortex is the most highly evolved area o f the brain and is ¼ inch thick. All parts of the Cortex a re concer ned with storage of experience (memory), exchange of impu lses with other cortical areas (association), and the two-way transmission of impu lses with sub - cortical areas. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"208 a) Frontal Lobe – concerned with intellectual fun ctions, i.e. reasoning, abstract thinking, aggressive and sexual behavior, smell, speech, language and the initiation of movement both voluntary a nd postural.    b) The Parietal Lobe – (behind the frontal) – concerned with rec ognition of specific sensory stimuli (i.e. observing a n object that one has s een b efore and being able to make that connection), the ability to use symbols as a means of comm un ication (language), ability to develop ideas and the necessary motor r esponses to carry them out. Rece iving impu lses relating to pain, temperature, touch, pressure, and muscle/position sense from rece ptors all over the body. It is in this area of the Parietal lobe that one largely becomes aware (conscious) of these sensations and is able to discriminate among them. c) The Temporal Lobe – (middle down un der) –located und er the Front (Thalamus) Brain concer ned with smell and language like the Frontal lobe plus emotional behavior with related reactions associated with self- preservation and p reservation of the species – includ es anger, hostility and sexual behavior.

Awareness and discrimination of visible structure, within a cer tain restricted spectrum, occurs here . All these are cortical mapp ing experiments based on electrical stimulation and chemical and p athological data. This has been the principal method by which functions of the Cortex have been discovered. There are areas of the Cere bral Hemisph ere, which have not been charted b ecause they do not respond to a ny known wavelengths. It is in these uncharted areas where ESP and PK abilities lie (Extra-Sensory Perce ption and Paranormal Kinetics), most probably in the right side of the hemisph ere (jury is s till out on this), bu t not in the Cortex itself."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"209 Our mission is to create new synaptic junctions by which we c an integrate and tap into these areas. THE OH ER PAR TS OF THE B RA IN AR E: 1. Cere bellum – (hind b rain) – Coo rdination of muscular activity. 2. Forebrain – (Thalamus) – Seat of Emotion – The r elay center governing the hypothalamus, epithalamus, third ventricle, regulation of the autonomic nervous system, and the pineal (for which science knows no fun ction). (Creating new synaptic fun ctions conn ects the pineal with the pituitary there by creating a bridge between the higher and lower selves. Until this bridge is created, hu mans cannot tap into ESP and PK centers by controlled intent. To make the nece ssary new synaptic jun ctions, we must first increase our psychic sub tle matter-energy. This can b e accomplished thru taking hold of and actively working o n a set of disciplines designed for that pu rpose. By using a combination of soun ds, color visualization and breathing exercises much can b e done to o pen up these ce nters and maintain control.

It is not harmful to a dd additional exercises too quickly, they will simply not be e ffective un til the previous s tep has taken h old.

They were known by those people who colonized and brought the life e ssence of the Adamic Race to the Earth. These same teachings were known widely by many o f the ancients, and by many o n our planet du ring the ages of what we call Atlantis. The und erstanding of this awareness was responsible for many o f the cultural and scientific triumph s of those times. Men and women on our planet were elevated by these illumined teachings to the threshold of the mental sph ere and beheld the r ealms of the sag es. The levels of being that destiny a nd the immortal awareness of MAN decree d that he should know. Thu s, by knowing that the mind and the body a re separate, bu t symbiotic with one another, it was demonstrated that to enslave one’s body was insufficient un less the captive also surre nd ered his reason and his mind . Throughout the ages, the re mnants of these teachings dwelt in the hidd en p laces of our mind s, proving that the mind transcend ed the captivity o f the body o n those occasions when its powers were exercised. The true “Tensor-oriented” man b elongs to a most noble order of cre ation called “Man” (not men and women). The nations and races on our planet, which were blessed b y these Illumined Ones, were fortunate ind eed, for their names are remembere d for their own sake. Those among us who do not comprehend the dignity o f their mind and of its reasoning powers cannot properly be said to be alive. Their e xistence is experienced like one in a state of semi-coma. To those who make the e ffort to learn and to exercise their tremend ous mental faculties, the mind b estows life, in that it reveals the dignity a nd pu rpose of life. Our preoccupation with the body a nd things material bestows a living death, in that these pu rsuits nu mb and cloud those faculties of our mind , which should b e re sponsive to the e nlivening impu lses of creative thought and enn obling virtue.

The precious s pan of our physical years is devoted to the pathetically futile e ffort to establish our selves as an end uring power and p resence in the physical realm of un -endu ring things. The divine awareness that we are MAN , a cre ature of both mind and spirit, fades like a memory a s our awareness, trapp ed in the material bodies of men and women, va nishes from our objective mind s as we focus our partly awakened mental faculties upon our day -to-day activities. In that lurid turmoil of our ind ustrial, political and comm erc ial inferno, we writhe in self-inflicted ago ny, and reach out into the material world attempting to clutch and hold onto the phantom of success and power. We re main ignorant of the cause of life, ignorant of the purpose of life, ignorant of what lies beyond the physical, and yet possessing within ourselves, through the use of our mind s, the answer to it all. We are willing to sacrifice the beautiful, the true, and the good within and about us, up on the bloodstained altars of our worldly a mbition. The world of the Mind – that beautiful garden of thought, where the fraternity o f MAN dwells – fades from our view. In its place r ises an empire of stone and steel: A world in which men and women, potentially to become MAN , scurry to a nd fro in a desperate e ffort to experience life and at the same time the vast institution we have er ected rumbles inevitably towards an un known end .

For it is concer ned solely with the classification of ph ysical knowledge and an investigation of the temporal and illusionary parts of nature. Its s o-called p ractical discoveries bind us ever more tightly with the bonds of physical limitation. Even the religions on our planet have become materialistic because the beauty and d ignity o f the spiritual belief of many is measured by piles of masonry, tracts of real estate or by the ledger sheet. The mind of MAN conn ects heaven and earth like a mighty ladder, which the illumined of all ages have climbed, into the living presence of reality."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"214 In the midst of the so-called learned men, there is rising up a new order of thinkers, which can only be described as the e lite of the worldly wise men. These ones, astound ed by their own intellect and that of others of their kind , consider themselves the great benefactors of mankind . These so-called gentlemen of letters have appointed themselves to be the final arbiters of all knowledge, both hu man and divine. Their declaration that: The Divine is a fabrication of primitive sup erstition; that there is no purpose discernible in the universe; that immortality is a popular figment of the imag ination and that an outstanding individual is bu t a fortuitous combination of genes and cells – a re gratefully a ccepted by many o f our people as the truth. We have embraced the worship of the intellect as a substitute for the knowing o f the Divine and of our mind . How do the lofty, dignified, ennobling concepts of man – o f the mind of MAN – compare with the stun ted and distorted p rodu cts of these e ffete- intellectuals and the stark reality o f our present time? The e vidence of our irrationality is all about us. In our adopted concept that “Reality” is that which only can b e detected or perc eived through the senses of our ph ysical bodies, we have drawn a veil between “Reality and ourselves. When we twisted off t he blossom of the mind from the stem of existence and cast it away, we r elegated our most precious possession to the trash heap. All over our planet, men and women are enslaved by the physical, emotional and cultural systems of our time, and are cr ying out for the return of the vanished age of beauty a nd enlightenment. Some among us have become aware that our mind less s o-called civilization, in its present form, is app roaching its va nishing point. It is beginning to dawn on even the most comatose mentality that our cold, heartless pu rsuit of commerc ialism and material efficiency is impractical, and only the regaining o f sanity through the use of our mind offers the opp ortun ity for the expression of love and all that is worthwhile. All of us are seeking happiness, bu t we do not know in what direc tion to search. All of us, through the e mploy ment of the “Tensor Concept” training o f our mind , must learn that happiness crowns the mind ’s qu est for und erstanding.

They alone can rend the wall, which d ivides the world of cause from that of effect. This wisdom can reveal to o ur struggling hu manity, that greater and more glorious un iverse which is the true home of the spiritual and mental being called MAN . Our c urrent ph ilosophies have failed in that they regard thinking a s s imply a n intellectual process. Materialistic thought is as useless a code of life as is comm erc ialism itself. The power to use our mind to truly think is that which the “Tensor Concepts” brings to o ur peoples. The Great Ones, the learned teachers who hav e e xisted on our planet in the past, were all personifications of this power."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216 AR TICLE III BASIC C ONC EPTS: First, remember that the Tensor Concepts is a discipline, not a ph ilosophy. They hav e to do with increasing the activity o f the brain by providing new synaptic c onnections to here tofore-unused areas of this orga n. The mind is capable of unlimited potential, not only in the fields of expression and creativity, bu t also in the c ontrol of all the forces of ph ysical matter. Although these Concepts are not a philosophy, Tensor-oriented ph ilosophies are possible just as many g eometrical systems can b e developed. Possibly the most important requirement of our civilization is the development of a Tensor-oriented economy. Su ch a system has never existed on our planet to date. The opportunity for bold and imag inative men and women of our evolution to create a system which will free mankind from war, poverty a nd tension. For this to be accomplished, it would b e necessary to take c ontrol of the planet AWAY FROM those who IDENTIFY. The First Tensor Concept and Equation is:  Children, immature adults and animals identify.  W henever a person reacts to a new and changing  situation as if it were and old and u nchanging o ne,  he or she is said to be identifying. Su ch an app roach to life is Aristotelian. (The doctrine of dedu ctive reasoning, the tendency to emph asize the e mpirical. To be scientific rather than metaph ysical.) Due to o ur e nvironment, it is most difficult for us not to identify. Identifying is a characteristic that must be c onditioned out of our consciousness. It is a distinct barrier to o ur future development. Identifying may be e xpressed as meaning many different things. The most important, however, is “to a ssociate with.” If I mention a"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"217 personality, you imm ediately associate this with an individual or, to be more e xplicit, a name. Identifying is truly the stage where a pu pil must learn to progress even further. Henceforth, when comm itting this process, be aware of its error. (In other words: Do not link new information with p revious information there by perpetuating a chain of wrong thinking.) The Second Tensor Concept and Equation is: In order to be a sane and adjusted hu man b eing, an idividual must realize that he c annot know all there is to know. It is essential that the und erstanding of this limitation b e r ealized, not only intellectually, bu t that the und erstanding be an ordered and conditioned process – un conscious as well as conscious. It is essential that these cond itioned p rocesses be instilled in a retentive mind . Sight must never be lost of the ultimate goa l of cond itioned reactions. This conditioning is essential to the balanced pu rsuit of knowledge – of the nature of matter – a nd of life. The Third Tensor Concept and Equation is: For the sake of sanity, an ind ividu al should learn to remov e the blockag es in his own n ervo us system. Blockag es are semantic disturbances, which inhibit a total evaluated response. Blockag es can b e eliminated b y the proper use of the Thalmatic Cortical Pause. It must be und erstood that the hu man nervous system is potentially superior to that of any o ther animal body. For balanced d evelopment, then, it is necessary for an ind ividual to orient himself to the world of reality in which h e r esides. There are methods of learning (the Tensor Concepts) by which this can b e accomplished. Tensor Equ ations is one method which enables the ind ividual to align h imself in the following ways: 1. To intuitively a nticipate the future. 2. To make use of his abilities and capabilities to the utmost. 3. To suit his behavior to his environment."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"218 The Fourth Tensor Equation and Concept is: Human n ervous s ystems are structurally similar, one to the other, bu t are never exactly the same. Any hu man n ervo us system is affected by events – v erbal and non-verbal. An event that is happ ening a ffects the body a nd the mind as a whole. For the sake of sanity then, remember :  First is the event, the initial stimulus. Second is the nervo us impact of the e vent via the senses. Third is is emotional reaction, based u pon past experiences of the ind ividual. Fourth comes the verbal reaction. Most individu als, however, identify the first and fourth steps and are not even aware that the second  and third exist. Because c hildren and child-like grownup s are incapable of refined discrimination, many experiences shock their nervo us system so violently that our psychiatrists hav e evolved a special word for the results; this is called “trauma” . Carried over into later years, these traumas can so tangle an individual that UN SAN ITY (that which is called, neurosis) or e ven INSAN ITY (that which is called, psychosis) can result. The hu man n ervous system is un iqu ely capable of un limited training, bu t the method is the determining factor. The Tensor method of relaxing the mind and the body is based on a vision exercise – the principle that a relax ed eye sees best. The normal eye is relaxed when it shifts s teadily. When, for any reason, an eye c apable of good vision begins to stare, the imag e blurs. Unlike a camera, the e ye sees clearly only o n the instant following the r elaxing shift. Now, for an automatic way to cause that organ, known as the brain, to relax . An obvious app roach would b e the associative re laxa tion of the surround ing tissue. You n ow consciously set about relaxing the blood vessels of the cortex, the thalamus and the sub -cortex where the e mbryo is located. By association, then all cells around the bloo d vessels will also automatically relax. Now if yo u will follow these simple instructions, this is the e xercise: Relax – Look – Relax – Look – Relax – Look – Relax – Look"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"219 It will be determined b y your individual awareness and ability how soon yo u achieve a state of relaxation. After skill i s obtained in relaxation, the method is comprehend ed by your mind and takes bu t a fraction of a second to pu t into a ction. Practice, however, is necessary. In a future Article, we will give you another method of getting into a relaxed state using color visualization. In Article I, we gave you the technique to begin u sing the “Thalmatic Cortical Pause. To further elaborate, the thought is: I am relaxing. All stimuli are making the full circuit of my nervous s ystem along my spinal column up to the thalamus, then through the thalamus and up to the c ortex. Then through the cortex a nd then, and only then, back through the thalamus and down into my nervo us system. Always, I am aware consciously of the stimulus moving up to a nd through the cortex. This is the key. This is the difference between the Tensor-oriented and the animal mind . The THALAMUS, seat of your e motions and the CORTE X, seat of your discrimination, integrated, balanced, in a warm and wonderful relationship. Emotions NOT done away with, bu t made richer and more r elaxed by a ssociation with that part of the brain, the cortex. This favo rs unnu mbere d subtle differe nces in the flow of feeling. Remember this: The stimulus is now going through my cortex. I am thinking a nd feeling, not just feeling. And so is achieved the “Thalmatic Cortical Pause.” The Fifth Tensor Equation or Concept is: In any statement about an object or an event, an ind ividual is abstracting a few of its characteristics. If one says the chair is brown, he should mean that brownness is only o ne of its qualities and as he speaks he should b e aware of the c hair’s many o ther qualities. There fore, CONSCIOUSNESS OF ABSTRAC TING, constitutes one of the main differences between a person who is Tensor-oriented and one who is not. As an exa mple: The map is not the territory. The word is not the thing"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"220 described. Whenever the map is confused with the terr itory a semantic disturbance develops in one’s organism. The disturbance c ontinu es un til the individual can d iscriminate and d etermine the limitation of the map. The Sixth Tensor Equation or Concept is: TIME, SPAC E, ENERGY AR E ALL MANISFESTATIONS OF PRIMARY FORCE. Remember, then:  First, exists SPAC E. Secondly, exists TIME. Thirdly,  ENERGY. TIME is one axis. SPAC E is another.  ENERGY, is the third. MAN IFESTATION then  procee ds in the mann er described and we arrive  at the very core of being. Rega rding TIME, all events – past, present and future – exist together. (The Time Continuu m.) They do not flash into being in some mythical present and then flash out of existence again when the present becomes the past. They o nly seem to, because the observer’s consciousness is mov ing along them and h its them only o ne at a time. (Physical existence is mere ly a particular point in the TIME continuu m where our consciousness rests.) Those additional Tensor faculties, in the mechanism of your brain, can sense all of this and act on it direc tly while the gray matter, the Cortex of your brain, is blind ed to it by yo ur pre-scientific ways of loo king a t things."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"221 AR TICLE IV (THE L IGH T) – THE MOST POWERFUL E MANA TION IN CR EATION Let us think about that most inclusive subject called, “The Light”. “The Light” has been d escribed in many o f the texts upon our world, and h as seemed to be possessed of many exceptional qualities. We use various expressions concer ning “ The Light”. The “Light of the Creator”, the “Light of the Radiant One, the “Light of the Divine”; and other descriptive sources we visualize “The Light” emanating from. There seems to be some c onfusion about this s ub ject of “The Light”. When you employ the term “The Light”, perhaps you could visualize it in this way. “The Light” is of no specific c olor and yet it is all colors, whether it be the visualization of the pu re white radiance, or however yo u do v isualize it. Its color qualities are very incidental. BUT, you are calling forth, knowingly o r not, and invo king the most powerful emanation in creation. In our holy works yo u will find this refere nce: “In the beginning, there was the Word”. “The Word” was “The Light of Our Radiant One” – the most encompassing emanation in all creation. “The Light” may be e mployed in every mann er that is conceivable to our mind and for whatever pu rposes we e nvision. We may call forth or INV OK E “The Light” for the protection of our being and p erson, as well as for our loved ones and our possessions. We have INV OK ED “The Light” o n nu merous occasions to condition the very environment in which we exist. On each such occasion our e mploy ment of this force and essence has always produ ced the desired results. The re ason this topic is being brought into y our awareness again at this time is that in our pu rsuit and study a nd evaluation of that which we are c urrently experiencing a nd that which we shall encoun ter over the next few years, we will have a g reater need to employ this “Light”. I would sub mit for your consideration that up on each and every occasion where yo u are either thinking, or considering, or e xecuting a ny form of thought, word, or deed, that you employ “ The Light”, and that this “Light” be e mployed in such a way a s to use it to clarify your thinking."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"222 When you think of INV OK ING and employing “ The Light” in yo ur daily a ctivities, this is perhaps the most important aspect and u sage of “The Light”, for those thoughts which coarse through your mind s, which result in some form of action, should always be e nveloped and permeated b y this “Light”. We use a statement in many o f our thought processes which seem to be a type of safeguard, when we state “Thy will be done”. What we are implying, bu t could state in a differe nt mann er, is that “The Light” will fun ction as it is intend ed. We dwell often on the topic called “Love”. Can you visualize the mag nitud e of the “Love” inh erent in this “Light”? Can you visualize and comprehend this subtle quality a s it permeates your being and your thoughts as you employ “ The Light”? W hen yo u use this “Light” in yo ur e veryday activities, you will become aware and realize that a new and subtle quality o f this very essence will become AT ONE with all yo ur thought processes. Would not this “Light” then illuminate the darkness of the outermost reaches of your mind ? Could not your thoughts, as well as your actions, be more re adily defined b y the illumination of this “Light”? Would n ot all that is experienced b e that much clearer in your perce ptions? It is un fortunate that like so many o f the terms in our language that this word, “The Light”, has been bantered about so o ften and misused. For, had the r ealization permeated our awareness of the true nature of “The Light”, we would have been p rofound ly influenced in even the mann er in which we treated this word. In those days, which lie ahead in our individual futures, the very mag nificence of the use of “The Light” will bring a bout a new cond ition of being, as it is being employ ed. Listed b elow is a method for visualizing a nd using “The Light” in your everyday life if you so choose. USING A BALL OF LIGH T If you are not yet adept at visualizing, imagine that you see the light. Think of it in a mann er to which you can relate – like loo king directly into the glow of a hu ndred-watt light bulb, or sun rays filtering through tree s, or even looking direc tly into the sun .

When you have progressed in the use of “The Light”, and it becomes second nature to you, don’t forget to lock yo ur home in a bub ble of Light when you go o ut, and also, remember to send the Light on ahead of you and around your car while driving. It works on situations as well as objects and p eople. There is no limit to its uses. You might consider when getting o ut of bed in the morning the first thing to do is visualize a jump suit of Light and step into it and zip it up .

They a re, etheric, emotional, mental, and psychic, each in a progressively finer and more rapid vibratory state. All of life energy is diffused. It must be converted or transformed in order to be pu t to work. ENERGY is explained as “The power by which anything acts effectively to mov e or c hange things or accomplish any result”, or “Power in active exercise”, or “The c apacity to perform work”. There are two types of energy : 1. POTE NTIAL E NERGY, (which is divided into available e nergy , i.e. a coiled clock spring, and diffused energy , i.e. a lump of coal). The difference is that the coiled spring is ready for work, while the lump of coal must be bu rned before e nergy is released as heat. 2. The other type of energy is KINETIC ENERGY. Anything in motion has kinetic e nergy. The four types of kinetic diffused life energy, with which we are c oncerned in d eveloping the Tensor Concepts, are: ET HERIC energy, EMOTIONA L energy , MENTAL energy, and PSYC HIC energy. a) Etheric Energy – This is the life e nergy , which vibrates at the slowest rate. Its accumulation and use by hu man b eings is almost entirely automatic and well below the level of consciousness. It is found in the very air we breathe. It is called “prana” , “chi”, and “life force”, along with other names. You can learn to manipulate etheric e nergy . This is of value in the practice of physical healing. b) Emotional Energy - Every hu man b eing has an array of energy transformers which enable him to draw upon the life e nergy which surroun ds him and in which h e lives, mov es and h as his being. These transformers are c alled “chakras”, and to psychic vision app ear as"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"225 rapidly spinning wheels of differe nt colored lights. Life e nergy, when transformed into hu man energy by o ne of these “chakras”, takes on the qu ality o f that particular transformer. (In “Book One” o f this book, yo u will find d etailed information on the “chakras” and h ow they work.) The most fully o pen and therefore the most active chakra in the averag e hu man is the “solar plexus”; whose chief product is emotional energy. We e xist and function in a “ sea o f emotion” and except in certain rare and un usual situations, only a small part of t he e motion we feel is our own, self-generated emotion. The e motional world is like an ocean and our e motional bodies are like fish in it – swaying with the tides. Emotions are qu ite e asily transmitted from one person to a nother by a sort of emotional telepathic rapport. Your mind is more powerful than yo ur e motions and it is your mind that must be used to cut away the unwanted emotional debris deposited b y others and also to cut out your own und esirable e motions. One helpful way to gain control ov er your e motions is to remember basic Tensor Equation Number 4, in Article III. If you can b ecome aware of the four steps in this equation, and concentrate your e nergy to stopp ing the reaction at the third step, then you can keep the fourth step (reaction) f rom occurring. As a little example; t hink about a situation when yo u have r eally g oofed up , or may be spilt a pot of tomato sauce all over your clean floor. Instead of saying (********), just shrug yo ur shoulders and feel and say “ oh well”, bend down-clean it up without thinking a nymore about it. Doing things like this will help you gain control of yo ur “Emotional” body, and I promise you, it will bring a sense of peacefulness into y our life. c) Mental Energy – Each thought at its inception p roduces a dual effect. First, there is a v ibratory wave, a radiation going o ut from the ce nter, not unlike the r adiation of a television signal. This wave mov es outward equ ally in all direc tions with gradually diminishing intensity which varies with the distance. It continu es to emanate from the mind of t he thinker as long as the thought is held. It ceases instantly the thinking changes or stops. Like all other vibrations, these mentally indu ced vibrations tend to reprodu ce themselves whenever the opportun ity presents itself."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"226 In other words, they tend to arouse in a receiving mind thoughts of the same type as those in the mind of the originating thinker. The distance to which such thought waves penetrate and their impact up on the mind s of others depend up on the strength and clarity o f the original thought. Everyone who thinks high thoughts pours out the kind of vibration that tend s to stimulate a similar level of t hought in others. They a ct vigorously upon mind s accustomed to high thought, bu t also affect to some degree e very mind within the sph ere of their radiation. This tends to awaken du ller mind s to higher possibilities and to stimulate those not ordinarily g iven to spiritual ideas, so that everyone that t hinks on a higher plane is contributing to the e levation of man even though h e may not be aware of the results of his thinking. We affect one another by o ur thoughts . We interact through Verba l Telepathy . (Verbal Telepathy does not mean “spoken aloud , bu t verbalized in thought.) It is as natural, and as automatic an action, as breathing itself. Another e ffect of thought is the cr eation of forms. As previously pointed out, we mov e in a sea of energy, which is most responsive to thought. Every impu lse sent out from the mind immediately clothes itself in a vehicle of t his vitalized matter . Thus, the thought becomes for a time, long o r short, a qu asi-living cre ature with the thought force acting as its soul and the vivified essence acting as its body. These strange forms exist on emotional as well as mental levels, and h ave been referred to by some as “elementals”. Formed b y the thoughts of hu mans, this quasi-living creature floats around in this s ea of emotion. If t he thought is about someone other than the thinker, the thought f orm m ov es to that other person and discharges its energy upon h is or her mental body. The re ceiving person then feels the impact of this thought f orm, and in most cases is not aware that it comes from an outside force . If the rec eiver can d etermine, by his own sensitivity, that this is coming from a source outside himself, he c an, by his own thought processes, refuse its entry into his mind b y pu tting up a “shield of Light”, which will turn the thought back to the direc tion from whence it came. If t his quasi-living creature was formed b y your own thoughts, it will hover about, ready to react upon you, the c reator, whenever you are in a relaxed or passive state. So be careful what you think about yourself."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"227 It will come back and “hit you ov er the head”. Think of yo urself as a beautiful, loving, kind , child of the Light, for that is what yo u are. Know that the thought forms you create about yourself will be instrumental in making yo u that which you b ecome. Each p erson travels through life e nclosed in a v eritable c age of forms, which h e or she has created by their thoughts and d esires. Through this opaqu e medium they look out at t he world and qu ite naturally everything they see is colored and modified b y the vibratory screen they have bu ilt. Every thought form has a tend ency to reproduce itself in the ph ysical world as an action, an event, or a physical thing. A very weak and tenuous thought form will disintegrate long before this “o ut picturing” can take place, fortunately. One powerfully endowed, backed up b y a lot of emotion, will usually result in a physical manifestation in a relatively short t ime. Diametrically opposed thought forms can effectively cancel each other out. So if you find yourself thinking wrong thoughts, immediately send out j ust t he opposite to those thoughts, or think or say “ cancel that thought . When we e xit our physical bodies, our astral bodies s till exist in the Astral World. The Astral World is all around u s. Think of it as cyberspace. If t hought forms make c onn ection with a detached astral body, they can attach to a hu man b ody a t t he chakra points, and can cre ate qu ite a bit of trouble for the physical, emotional, and mental well being o f t he body. This ph enomena was recognized b y Dr. Wallace McNaughton and h e gave it the name “Activa ted Sh ell”. He was able to “blast” these shells from their attachment t o the chakra energy points by using a series of colors in the “visible spectrum of Light”, i.e. blue, turqu oise, and gree n (in that order). As is apparent, it is important to learn to control your Mental Energy . The following a re some tips that may be of use in strengthening your control. 1) Avoid chaotic thinking a nd try to think log ically. Learn to think in an orderly fashion. We are ourselves living thought, and it is extremely difficult to control the incessant stream of material, the sub stance of our consciousness, which flows from our mind s into space. Replace aimless thoughts with p recise ones. When you b ecome aware of a negative thought push it out."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"228 2) Avoid u ntruthful or distorted thinking o r prejudice. Stop releasing dark, dangerous thoughts, for those c ome back to yo u like a boo merang in the form of “bad luck”. Sp end time increasing your ability to work with a ball of Light as s hown in Article IV. 3) In addition to correc tion and counterbalance, adopt a positive attitud e. A benediction sent into the world is the purest and finest form of thought energy . This will return to you stronger than when yo u sent it forth. d) Psychic Energy – (The healing energy – “ The Golden Elixir”) Psychic e nergy creates and supports life. It is also the best healer. When present in sufficient supply, it vitalizes form with its potency and eliminates those congestions and obstructions that are such a fruitful source of disease. It can b e said that all disease is the result of, or exists because of, an insufficient sup ply o f psychic e nergy . The true art of healing consists, therefore, in so releasing psychic e nergy that it f lows through all of t he organs and parts that constitute any ph ysical form. (Use the Thalmatic Cortical Pause (from Articles I and III) frequ ently; along with the exercises using sound and color that we will be presenting in a later Article. To heal yourself is much more difficult t han it is to heal another. The important element is to start work at healing yourself before the problem incapacitates you. No o ne c an h eal himself if he is delirious, has a high fever, or is so weakened h e is unable to think clearly. Build your psychic e nergy up , and n ever let the c harge get low, and you will always be able to cure yourself, so long as you can control your thoughts. Make the necessary effort to increase your store of energy a nd maintain it at a high level. This in itself will protect yo u against most infections and other illnesses. To increase your healing energy, practice the following exercise and make it a part of your daily routine : 1. Sit erect, bu t not t ense (or stand easily with your weight evenly balance between both feet). (This is an exercise, which is also very effective while done outdoors in fresh air.)"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"229 2. Take in a deep b reath to the coun t of 5. 3. Slowly relax as you exhale to the coun t of 10. 4. Repeat 10 times. 5. While performing this exercise, close your jaws firmly and clench each hand into a fist. Keep all the body relaxed except t he hands and jaw. As you b reathe in and out, think to yo urself t hat each b reath is bringing a great surge of energy a nd power that you are storing within yo u. To further increase your Psychic Energy, after practicing the foregoing exercise for a few w eeks, add the following to your daily routine: 1. Sit comfortable in a chair. Hold your back straight and your head erec t. Cross your feet at t he ankles, not t he knees, and hold them touching. Clasp your hands in your lap, or if yo u prefer, before your chest as if in prayer. 2. Take a deep b reath through the nose and coun t rhythmically to yo urself as you d o so. The in-taking o f breath should b e to the coun t of 8. Pace it exactly. 3. Now, hold your breath in your lun gs for exactly 12 coun ts. Don’t speed up and don’t slow down – coun t rhythmically. 4. Let the air out through the nose to the c oun t of 10 , and as yo u breathe out, direct t he flow of t he outgoing air to the spot where it enters the nasal passage from the throat – a round the roof of t he palate. As you feel the air going past this s pot, accompany the flow of air with a slightly aud ible vibration like a pu rring o r hu mm ing sound for as long as the air flows outward. 5. Repeat the foregoing 5 times. e) How to prevent loss of Psychic Energy:"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"230 There is an exchange of energy going o n at all times between hu mans.

Sometime, we just t hrow our e nergy a way. Laziness and inertia a re two o f the quickest ways to drain your psychic energy. You h ave to learn to “ contain” your psychic e nergy , otherwise you will find yourself constantly having to replenish it. A cer tain “tension”, as it were , must be maintained, and one of the best ways to a ccomplish this is by energetic activity throughout your waking hours. Not continuous ph ysical activity, of course, although this is good. The best method is mental concentration, which creates greater tension and more e fficient containment. Have you ever spent time in the c ompany o f someone who is really down on themselves, or down on other people, or the world around them? Have you spent time in the c ompany o f someone who is a chronic complainer, or someone who talks about t heir illnesses and p roblems constantly? If yo u d on’t make a conscious effort to prevent it, you can just feel your e nergy seeping right out of your body. To prevent your Psychic Energy from slipping away, you n eed to consciously gather your forces around you like a force field and hold them there , resisting the temptation and u rgings to send them out in all direc tions. Try enveloping yourself in a bub ble of Light on these occasions. As a matter of fact, don’t even wait un til you start f eeling yo ur e nergy evaporating. Make it a point when yo u go to bed at night, and again when you arise in the morning, to pu t on this s hroud of protection. Just step into it and zip it up as if it were a pair of coveralls.

Visualization is a powerful tool, bu t you n eed to visualize in such a way that the imag e yo u create can manifest itself as an object or e vent in the ph ysical world. However, before putting this conscious process into operation, yo u need to und erstand the basic laws involved. 1) You must hav e a clear, precise idea o f what yo u want to accomplish. 2) It must be a project that is realistic in nature. 3) You may not work on several things at once. When you h ave brought your primary o bjective into manifestation or physical existence, you may then turn to another objective. In our visualization and thinking, we use mental pictures as tools. Whatever you envision, you first see it as an “image” or “picture” in yo ur mind . Try to think of anything without seeing it imm ediately in yo ur “mind ’s eye”. These images are symbols, which we constantly employ in our everyday life. In the conscious employment of symbols, we can endow them with many different characteristics. The mind mere ly assigns the ones needed. Therefore, symbols play a n important part in the transition of thought, from the levels of thought alone, into the material world. They a re the “doorway” to a nother dimension. Symbols act as a conversion d evice where by a thought can manifest itself in the physical world. Symbols are an operative tool that the mind employs. The mind cre ates a thought. A symbol becomes the tool employ ed by the mind to translate the thought into the physical realm, at some point in time. Conversely, anything that exists in the physical can b e translated, through the means of a symbol, back into the re alm of thought. (A good exa mple of this is the writing down on paper of a"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 disturbing program in the sub conscious, and then bu rning the paper to forever remov e it from the sub conscious.) It is the pattern of relationships that we are dealing with that is important. When u sing symbols and symbolic patterns of relationships, it is necessary that they represent operational qualities. To summ arize the important points on symbols: One must come to realize that symbols are the tools that thought uses. They provide the means for translation of thought. They a re the missing link in our thinking. Symbols work in b oth d irections, from the ph ysical level to the mental one and vice versa. Thoughts originate on the mental level and will, in time, manifest as completed forms on the physical level. Physical things, objects, etc., are e volved thought forms. Their master blueprint still remains in the levels of thought. One c an trace back, from the ph ysical, to the original thought arch-type. Time should b e devoted to this method of exa mining ‘causes’ for it will increase yo ur “mental energy”. For exa mple, if you are disturbed b y a “feeling” , bu t don’t exactly know w hat caused it, think back “in yo ur mind ” to when this “feeling” bega n. By tracing back to its origin, you will discover the cause, and it usually can b e dealt with at that point by simply “ letting go” of the cause. Symbols can be designed and arranged to represent new things and objects. The amoun ts of thought force exerted on the higher levels determine how rapidly the transition from the mental to the physical takes place. Symbols can be arranged into working relationships so that mechanisms can operate in both the mental and p hysical levels at the same time. In this instance, the best symbols are those that resemble either the thought or mechanism in greatest detail. For exa mple: A “photograph”, especially a Polaroid having both n ega tive and p ositive, is more true in its representation of a person or object than a “ map” would b e. A strand of hair from an individual would b e stronger than a ph otograph . In the e mployment of mental telepathy (which is a form of visualization), symbols and /or objects can b e used p roviding they possess the mental imprint of the particular individual to be commun icated with. The mind establishes the tuning in, and selection of, an ind ividual’s uniqu e thought patterns and frequ ency. Once the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"233 conn ection is firmly painted, as a pattern of relationships and frequ ency, in the mind of each p arty involved in the c omm un ication, the selective symbol is s tored as a memory pattern. A symbol, therefore, allows the fixing o f one’s telepathic attention on the thoughts of the selected comm un icant. The e asiest visualization to manifest at first is s ituations. Physical objects can also be manifested. It may not app ear in the mann er expected or the time interval desired, bu t if done properly, it will manifest into the ph ysical. We manifest situations and circumstances constantly, as an ind ividual, as a family, as a nation, and as a planetary brotherhood. What we create is not always desirable, bu t by the employ ment of visualization, we c an change anything we r eally concentrate on. When d ealing with nations, it requ ires critical mass being reached. On an individual basis, it only requ ires one person. Don’t expect to blink yo ur e yes or wave your hand and materialize an object in front of you. The hu man race (as a whole) needs to evolve farther to reach this point, although there are some on the planet who can do this at present. Remember “Basic Law 2” above. You can, however, begin to visualize the object or situation you wish to manifest in a mann er that sets into motion the necessary chain of events that will eventually bring a bout its physical manifestation. The more you work on increasing your mental energy , the better you will become at manifesting. Mind is all-powerful. It is in itself our greatest tool. You must learn how to take hold of a thought – concentrate on it – v isualize its manifestation and know that it will evolve because you d esire it to be so. Consciously working with “Mind Power” is a serious responsibility. As yo u practice in strengthening your visualization, I would caution you to keep yo ur motives pu re, maintain a loving nature and do not project negative thoughts towards anyone. If yo u feel yourself slipping in this direc tion, use the Radiant Ball of Light. As you grow stronger your responsibilities become more severe . If you u se these increased powers in a negative way towards anyone or anything – you will pay dearly for it – it is a law of the Universe. Now, choose a project that yo u would like to manifest. Try something simple at the beginn ing, perhaps one to change a situation you’re"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"234 un comfortable being in or an und esirable attitud e being direc ted towards yo u. Do what you can to help – don’t j ust “sit on your hands” as if saying, “now show me – go on and manifest”. Open all avenu es of possibilities within yo ur awareness. It’s easier to go through an open door than a closed one. Also remember, yo ur sub conscious must be convinced that what you are doing is goo d and d esirable and that it won’t hu rt anyone. Otherwise, yo ur own conscious mind will short- circuit the energy needed to bring a bout the desired manifestation. Make sure yo ur project is a worthwhile one. And , as s tated, in order for this law of creation to work in a proper mann er, do all you can do to help it come about. (And always remember to use “The Light” in yo ur visualizations.) As an exa mple, say you h ave need of some e xtra cash and you set about to materialize the necessary a moun t. You set up the visualization on the scre en of yo ur mind , bu t yo u don’t do a nything else but visualize the said amoun t. Nothing happ ens – so y ou keep visualizing week after week. Then one day you hav e an accident du e to the negligence of someone else. Don’t be surprised if the insurance settlement you rec eive is the e xact amoun t you h ave been visualizing. This is definitely not a desirable way to manifest the money you n eed, bu t if it happ ens, you will be the one r esponsible by not opening the doors and guiding your visualization in a proper mann er. The e nergy from visualization, whether done consciously o r un consciously, builds un til i t must be re leased. A simple manifestation may result from a single attempt; a larger project may take more time in p roportion to what is being created, bu t at some point it will happ en. The laws of ph ysics apply here just as they do everywhere in the known Universe. It is easy to see how important it is to control and d irec t your visualization. Sp end time in one pointed thought. In our helter-skelter, hu stle-bustle world, most people find it hard to find a qu iet space in which to do their thinking. Seize every o pportunity for a qu iet moment and spend it in controlled thought. Pick a “ thought of the day” a nd concentrate on it every chance yo u get. If your mind wand ers, pull i t back to “ the thought”. Do simple mathematics in your head, adding, sub tracting a nd multiplying. This also will help increase your mental energy. As you gain more mental control, you will find your powers of visualization increasing exponentially. Here again, is a Tensor Concept,"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"235 which require practice. You will progress direc tly in ratio to the e ffort yo u expend . On the sub ject of Thought: Everything in creation is s urround ed by electromag netic fields. These fields are all important. An accepted d efinition of a field is this: When something happens at one point in space because something else happ ened at another point, with no visible means by which the ‘cause’ can b e r elated to the ‘event’, the two events are said to be conn ected by a ‘field’. Our body is held tog ether by a n infinite nu mber of invisible ‘means’ by which something can do something to something else. This shows that our bodies are organized b y a nd d epend on sub tle, invisible and intangible forces. Thought occupies its own dimension, ‘or field’. Some of the things known about the field of Thought are: 1) Thought behaves like a field and comes in an infinite variety. 2) It can p roduce e ffects across s pace, which as far as we know is not affected by distance or time. 3) Thought is independent of and can exist apart from the hu man body. 4) It can attach itself not only to brain cells, bu t also to any kind of matter. 5) It can influence the Life fields of the hu man b ody. 6) The Organization field, which gives everything that exists its identity a nd reality, is the produ ct of Mind or Thought.

When you u se visualization for manifesting, you are not originating anything, bu t mere ly bringing it from one field into a nother (the ph ysical). The “blueprints” a re already in existence, waiting to be called forth. There are sub -fields within each field for e ach organ, cell, molecule and atom in the hu man b ody, as well as throughout creation. Organization is the produ ct of the Mind of the Creator. It is the und erlying reality. Science has s hown u s that all matter is composed of the basic elements in d iffere nt proportions and arrangements. It has also shown that the elements themselves are c omposed of similar sub -atomic particles in different nu mbers and arrangements. The differences, there fore, between one kind of matter and another, or between one e lement and another, are mere ly differences of arrangement, or organization in space, of comm on b asic components. Physics has s hown u s that the difference between one form of electromag netic e nergy a nd another – between light waves or r adio waves, for instance – is mere ly o ne of frequ ency o r the nu mber of wave cycles per second. In other words, the difference between light waves and radio waves, or between red light and b lue light, is mere ly o ne of Organization in time.

Theta: 4-7 Hz. – J ust prior to deep sleep – intuition, memory, vivid  visual memory. Delta: 0-4 Hz. – Deep sleep, healing, detached awareness. The name “Alpha” was designated for the 7-12 Hz. range simply because it was the first one identified. In our waking state, we fluctuate constantly back and forth b etween all four catego ries. You can rec ognize these fluctuations if you are consciously aware of their existence. For example, when yo u are concentrating o n a specific job or project, you tend to “ rev” up to a high “Beta” level, and I feel relatively cer tain that there is a higher level than Beta, which may not have been identified at the present.

Feeling o f me and mine are strong, a state of outward p assion and self-indulgence. Protection of one’s s mall universe at all costs is the consciousness. 5 th – Personal selfishn ess - state of “sense” enjoyment. This is the true home of the animal nature. Cares nothing for the problems and suffering o f others. 6 th – Unconscionable acts, - no remorse - “g reatest lower r egion” - ego reigns s up reme. Conscience is completely dormant.

Once out of the lower dark chakras, it is still possible to fall back aga in into these lower states of consciousness. In other words, we flow in and out of these areas frequently, unless control can b e gained and maintained. The goal then is to bring o neself out of the conscious mind into the areas of the superconscious without leading into the sub conscious where all experiences are stored within each ind ividual. We are c omprised of bodies working in tandem with the five states of mind , which flow constantly throughout all areas simultaneously. It is up to us to determine the conscious state of mind in which we wish to fun ction. Majorities of our people live in the 3 rd (Solar Plexus) Chakra a nd come und er the influence of “will power” which in turn h as basic c ontrol of all the lower chakras including reason, intellect, and memory a s well as the dark chakras. It is by the exercise of sheer will power that the lower chakras are c ontrolled. When control of will power is lost, they automatically drift back into the lower chakras. Since the lower chakras are already well developed in the hu man race, attention should b e direc ted to o pening a nd d eveloping those chakras that lie abov e the Solar Plexus, inasmuch as they will then b e the controlling factor. The first one to concentrate on opening a nd /or strengthening is, of course, the Heart Chakra. In Article I, we gave you a beginning exercise for this purpose.

As an example, for a sound that should affect a particular area o f the body, I mere ly intoned, audibly, un til the resonance of the sound could b e felt vibrating in the area it was to be used for.

When the sound pattern is established in yo ur mind , this will no longer be necessary. The following a re some basic sounds that we found h elpful: 1) RA – (Pronoun ced ‘rah’) – G above midd le C – Intoned 9 times loudly in succession b rings a notable increase in p hysical energy. 2) MA – A abov e midd le C - Intoned 9 times in succession on the same note and in the same mann er produ ces a warm, comfortable feeling of being nourished and cared for. 3) Now pu t these two sound s together and they become RA -MA. Intoned tog ether on the same note or frequency, (either G above midd le C, or A above midd le C), affects all of the higher ‘sacre d centers’ - t he heart, throat, and the two head centers - mere ly by directing the e nergy to a ny o ne or more of these areas and allowing it to resonate in that area. 4) AU M – B above midd le C – has a beneficial effect on the ph ysical body a nd u pon all the higher psychic ce nters, especially the Pineal (6 th ) Chakra a nd that portion of the Head Center for which it is the physical doorway. 5) THO – (Pronoun ced like ‘throw’ without the ‘r’, with emph asis on the ‘t h’) – G above midd le C - This sound , repeated three to seven times in succession, affects the Throat Chakra a nd its corresponding g land , the thyroid. (The Throat Chakra g overns Universal Love and will be the next chakra to be awakened in Man in the New Age.) 6) UU H – (Pronoun ced like ‘oo ooh’) – A# a bove midd le C - Affects the Heart center as well as the physical thymus gland . 7) MEH – (Pronoun ced like ‘met’ bu t with an ‘h’ emph asized at the end ) – Intoned on G above midd le C, has a soothing effect on the ph ysical nervo us system and a stirring influence on the Heart Center. 8) EEE – D# above midd le C – This clears upset and chaotic c onditions of the mind and emotions. It also helps control the Psychic e nergy you accumulate."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"245 One of our favorite sound combinations is OM-MAN E-PAD ME-OM, intoned on B above midd le C.

It has largely to do with ‘feeling’, i.e. between p eople e motionally attached as in mother/child – husband/wife – g roups – g ood friends, and in events when one ‘feels’ what has happ ened to the other. This form of telepathy is transmitted on the astral level. Friendliness, love, menace, fear, etc. is usually expressed this way. You can p hysically feel this type of telepathy in ‘the pit of your stomach’. 3) Between Soul and Soul – This is an advanced form of telepathy, where c ontact is made through the sup er conscious level of mind between souls, beyo nd the workings of the conscious mind . 4) Between two o r three of these aspects of telepathy simultaneously. 5) Verbal Telepathic Comm un ication – Which is words converted to symbols for use by the mind , which must be decoded back into ideas or thoughts as rec eived. When u sing tensor c oncepts, at least one other part of our brain, which nobody uses even when thinking, can b e in continuous operation for us. It is not an activity o f our c erebral cortex o r our gray matter. It is a sub merged every-minu te-of-the-day a ctivity o f which we are not conscious. This new fun ctioning is located in the four-fifths of our brain for which n o function is known at this time. It does not conform to a ny of the sensory wave r esponses that we know or r ecognize. In employing these techn iqu es we will be opening up n ew synapses, new impu lse"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"248 chann els from nerve ce ll to nerve c ell. Many o f them hav e not been u sed before and they may still be in a highly primitive state. These individual synapses are just bu ilding blocks for two v ery general brain fun ctions: 1) ESP – o r extrasensory perc eption. 2) PK – psycho-kinesis or telekinesis. ESP helps us to detect things, objects, events, and thoughts. PK enables us to a ct upon them. All of the side e ffects s uch as precog nition, telepathy, clairvoya nce, levitation, teleportation, and so o n, are simply different manifestations of these two basic fun ctions, just as colors are different manifestations of light. The first of these, ESP, is more widely known, bu t PK is just as important. In telepathy then, we find there is no a nalogy for sending and receiving, though we may wish to use those terms for convenience. Telepathy is just one factor of our tensor oriented b rain and mind . It is a perc eption, not an action . It is as nearly passive as the detection of sound. A telepath p erceives a thought as he would any o ther e vent in space/time. A mind which h olds a thought does not need to send it, and if it were the mind of a non-telepath, it could n ever rec eive anything which d id not come to it through the usual channels of the senses. Nevertheless, there is a principle by which telepathic attention can b e focused on a desired thought. Thought detection is not limited by distance, nor is the r ange of a transmitted thought. Telepathic commun ication can operate throughout the un iverse and such commun ication is instantaneous. Thoughts and their transmission and rece ption operate beyond the scope of the physical universe. They do not obey physical laws. However, they do o bey the laws that exist in the dimension that thought occupies. Therefore, the mind transcends all that is physical in its operation. It is only the physical brain, the tool of our mind , which n eeds to be trained b y the tensor concepts. Our mind already knows the techniqu es of the tensor concepts. The problem is in impressing them up on the ph ysical brain. Once we have reached that point, we will become ‘one with MAN among the Stars’, and reclaim our heritage."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"249 We have to start by realizing that there is a mental continuu m or dimension, bu t there is no psychic c ontinuu m, because what we c all psychic gifts are only the side e ffects of our fun damental traits, ESP and PK, each with a real existence in the un iverse. These faculties detect and mov e things in space and time and are in turn detected and mov ed. The tensor faculties help u s to pu rsue a single line of thought for any period of time. Without practice, this is sometimes hard to do. The suggested mental exercises in a previous Article will be of help in this area. Everything is possible in the r ealm of thought. Thought is an event occurring within that ind ividu ality o f consciousness, which is uniquely each one of us. It occurs mere ly on a sub tler level of awareness, one not far re moved from the ph ysical world. No thought shields exist other than those cr eated b y an individual’s field of thought. There is nothing in the physical universe that cann ot be penetrated b y a thought. The remote c orners of the galaxies can b e r eached instantaneously by thought. One’s physical body can, as well, be transported or teleported b y the power of the mind anywhere in the universe or, closer to home, anywhere about our planet. Our mind d oes not require the use of a ph ysical vehicle to transport our body thu sly. There is nothing else involved in this process other than our ability to mentally g rasp the concept and the techniqu e e mploy ed. One c an as well see the future, visit the past, explore the present and mov e about anywhere and everywhere at the c omm and of thought and of the mind . One of the great handicaps, which make it difficult for us to g rasp this un limited potential of the mind , is our comm on b elief that the mind is located inside our physical brain. When we c ome to the r ealization that the ‘mind ’ exists outside and b eyo nd that which we c all the brain and our bodies, and when it enters our ‘awareness’ and is finally ‘und erstood’ we would have made a giant step in our training. We are just at the stage of babies learning to walk and talk. Imag ine if a baby refused to take that first step, or tried to utter that first word. What would b ecome of it? If we do not exert the effort to develop the latent powers within each of us, we will continue on as we are, and n othing much will change, except that we may not be able to tolerate the new frequ ency building o n our planet. We hav e to believe in our own ability to utilize our own mental potential."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"250 Many o f us are uncomfortable with the idea of rec eiving another’s thoughts, or of others rec eiving o urs, because some of us harbor thoughts not worthy o f our true being. True, as we master our telepathic abilities, we learn how to create a thought shield. But remember this, when we e mploy a thought shield we are like a lighted beacon calling to o urselves the attention of every telepath n ear us. One of the toughest lessons we hav e to learn is that of cleaning up our thoughts and disposing o f all that is unworthy of the Light within us. None of us will enter the ‘new age’ using a thought shield. Majorities on our planet are already utilizing mind s that are shielded. This was one of the side e ffects of the detrimental radiation from our sun, before it was scre ened off, that caused a g ene mutation. This has been p assed on from parents to o ffspring. It has given us a handicap in our spiritual development. Tensor Concept training will further help to lower these shields. In the past, some of us were able to dispose of these thought shields. Those who a ccomplished this were c onsidered to be the great sages of their time. You see a shield works in b oth ways. It prevents yo ur thoughts from being received, bu t it also prevents you from rece iving thoughts from the source of all enlightenment. Highly evolved people do not employ thought shields. If you hav e c oncer ns rega rding your telepathic priva cy, has it occurred to you that your mind is aware of your c ortical thinking a nd your ph ysical actions, and it can halt the telepathic inq uiry of another mind? Your mind can, at any time, initiate a ‘bu sy signal’ and thus prevent a telepathic interc hange of information. Do not confuse this ‘bu sy signal’ with the use of a mind shield. They a re e ntirely differe nt. Therefore, no telepath can b ecome a mental ‘peeping tom’, without the full knowledge and consent of your mind . Telepathy is a joint sharing o f thought and each mind engaged in such a sharing o beys the laws of the mental continuu m. Your mind will not act in an irresponsible way a nd cause yo u harm or e mbarrassment. A telepath can only read a mind when that mind h as agreed to the interchange of thought. A non-telepath has no a ccess to a nything o utside his normal senses. Remember, we are in error when we view telepathy a s an active process. Incoming thoughts are most easily recognized when our ‘conscious’ objective brain is not engaged in concentrated thought or other activities requ iring great mental attention. An ideal state would b e what"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"251 we call ‘day -dreaming’. In this s tate thoughts are lazily drifting through the brain and our c onscious attention is not focused on anything in particular. Day dreaming is really a useful activity. Normal conscious brain activity (cortical activity) creates a type of mental interference, or static, which is constantly interfering with telepathic fun ctions. Our so-called normal ‘awake’ conscious state is properly termed ‘cortical activity’. It is only when a pause occurs in this cortical activity that the Tensor Centers can get through our jamm ed mental switchboa rd and pass information to the c onscious cortical centers. The ‘Thalmatic Cortical Pause’ produ ces a momentary interrup tion in our c onscious cortical activity. This allows the Tensor Centers of the brain to a llow a thought to slip through. During the periods when p racticing telepathy, let your cortical activity come to rest. Let your thoughts drift. Consciously go into a n ‘Alpha’ level. Try to set aside a period each d ay to be qu iet, and if possible, alone. When the Tensor Centers are commun icating with the cortical centers, yo u may not be conscious of such an interc hange. Later, as yo ur awareness develops, you will recog nize when such comm un ication is occurring. The clue to this will be a newfound clarity of thought and ease in thinking. Creative, innovating, and so-called original ideas are a result of the mind imparting a thought to the Tensor Centers; they in turn p assing it on to the cortical centers, which d iscover, or stumble across, the idea o r thought placed there . Only the cortical centers are involved in the learning process. The Tensor Centers, in acqu iring thought from the mind , know the essence of the thought completely. In Article I, we discussed the brain fun ctions. To further elaborate, we would like to o ffer the following a dditional information of how the brain fun ctions. First the activities of the cortical center and then the fun ctions of the Tensor Centers, as follows: CORTICA L FUNC TIONS – CONSCIOUS 1) The cortex a nd cortical centers occupy 20 % or 1/5 th of the total brain area."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252 2) Su ch activity as thinking, logic, reason, dedu ction, evaluation, classification, etc. 3) Short-term active memory and the process of remembering previously translated thought information.

Note that we includ e ‘sub conscious’ fun ctions under the heading o f conscious cortical activity. This is because, in reality, they a re only another department of the c ortical fun ctions. At present, I don’t believe that science has made this distinction. One measure of our mental co- ordination, is how w ell our conscious cortical department commun icates with our sub conscious one and vice versa.

The only difference is in their ind ividu al method of operation. In MAN , that which we are to become, the Tensor Centers are fully integrated and conn ected with the cortical centers within the brain. When we reach this s tate of evolvement, the two will fun ction in p erfect harmony. It seems s trange that our science has not shown more interest in investiga ting the disparity in size between the known cortical area a nd the un known Tensor area o f the brain. One would think that an area comprising 80%, performing a n un known fun ction, would excite their curiosity. Perhaps investigating such with only the limited ability o f their cortical centers would p rove to be most difficult. I guess we will just hav e to wait for a Tensor oriented scientist to come on the scene. Let us exa mine a little further the transmission of thought from one brain to a nother. The mind of any individual can comm un icate with the mind of any o ther individual, or group of individuals. This takes place in the mental continuu m. Before an individu al becomes aware of this type of comm un ication, the following events take place: 1) The mind n otifies the Tensor Centers that a thought from another is being perc eived. 2) The Tensor Centers, in turn, attempt to pass this thought and its content along to the cortical centers. 3) The cortical centers place the thought, in translated form, in the path of thinking that the cortex is following a t any given moment. 4) The cortex, if its attention is not focused to narrowly on the sub ject of its thinking, will come across the thought, like an object placed in its path that requires a mov ement to go a round . The c ortex would then discover this ‘thought object’ placed in its path and assimilate the content of the translated meaning. Then, depending on the nature of the data a nd the re sponse it merits, the cortex would initiate the proper action. If, however, the cortex a nd cortical centers are involved or otherwise actively engag ed in the process of thinking, the ‘thought object’ placed in its path will be side stepp ed without recog nition and the message go un noticed."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"254 Concentration, or active thinking, a cortical activity, is not condu cive to the re cog nition of a message from the Tensor Centers.

Detach your mind from the sub ject and think about something else. Usually after doing this, when yo u return to the process of cortical thinking, the answer is s ud denly a nd mysteriously a pp arent.

Currently, one of them is ‘extrasensory perce ption. For a short time they had b een known as ‘psionics’ or ‘psi’. Previous to this, it had b een thought by many o f our ancient peoples to be what many called ‘magic’. The medicine man of our early times, with the oxide that he used for paint, with h is knu ckle bones to rattle in a skull and h is bag o f nauseous content, may have practiced it in a clumsy sort of way before the first word was ever spoken. He was grasping a t principles he did n ot und erstand; he more than likely did not even know that he did not und erstand , not realizing there was anything he ought to understand. Knowledge such as this was passed on from hand to inept hand . The witch d octors of our Congo used it. The priests of Egy pt knew of it. The wise men of Tibet were acquainted with it. In all of these c ases, it has not been wisely used because it has not been u nderstood. It has gotten mixed up with a lot of confusion. In the days of so-called reason, it became discre dited and there was hardly a nyone who believed in it. However, out of this primitive r easoning arose a method and a science. There was no place for the magic of the Tensor Concepts in a world that science built, for there was no method in it and there was no system in it. It could n ot be re du ced to formulas or e qu ations at that time, which our scientists could handle or understand . So it was considered suspect as it was outside the pale of what was considered normal. ‘Stupid foolishn ess’, it was called. No man in his right mind , in those times, would even consider it. In our present time, it is called PK, meaning, Paranormal Kinetics.

The machine has represented a form of abstract hero worship; for we have always needed ideals and goals and thu s a vacuu m will exist in this area. The Tensor Concepts can fill this vacuu m exactly.

We have a lot of work to do. First, there are the simple things, the easy things, to be learned and applied. However, we will go on from there . We will grow. Some, however, stop growing a fter a time, mostly because their focus mov es on to something else or they get ‘lazy’, while others keep on growing.

You visualize a cloud of electrons swirling in the forefront of your brain. You then project the resulting field that you just created, onto whatever object that you wish to mov e, since obviously you do not want to teleport the insides of your skull. The c loud s of electrons, in a swirling field of force, affect the gravitational field of the object, reducing the field. The r esult of this exercise is that which we call ‘levitation’. In our initial efforts in the use"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"261 of PK, or telekinesis, we will be using what is described in our science as the ‘Blackett Effect’. Practice the foregoing techn ique to try to mov e objects. Try something light, like a needle suspend ed from a thread. Build this cloud of electrons and d irect them to the ‘needle’. Use your mind p ower to mentally o r verbally direc t the object to mov e. Be sure not to mov e it by breathing o n it. Comm and that it mov e. If it doesn’t work for you the first time you try it, don’t get discourag ed. Keep working on bu ilding yo ur ‘mental energy’, and keep attempting to mov e the needle. As yo ur ability increases, and it will with practice, mov e on to heavier objects, perhaps to a crystal suspend ed on a chain or cord, then try levitating, or raising it up in the air. Once an object is levitated, it will be drifting a loft. At this point other forces requiring o nly a minimal amoun t of mental control will act upon the object. The first of these is that known as Coriolis, which will cause the object to move slowly in a lateral plane. Centrifugal force will keep the object aloft as long as you are maintaining the gravity field at zero. In d eveloping these faculties, it will be necessary for you to try a nd think of nothing at all, to empty the mind of everything possible. The preliminary use, in the early stag es of the ‘Thalmatic Cortical Pause, will aid in relaxing a nd emptying the mind . This is difficult to a chieve because there are always fugitive imag es and washes of faded emotions over which many have no control.

For those of you with scientific background s with a curiosity in this direc tion, I would refer you to the Heisenb erg probability packets in the original Heisenb erg inter-determinacy formula, and to the e arly thinking o f our scientist, Neils Bohr.

The mind d etects the orga nizational field of the subject and through use of the ‘Thought’ f ields affects an action up on it. Working with p end ulums (or dowsing rods) is an excellent way to improv e your PK abilities. The knowledge of ‘how to’ has been around and u sed for ce nturies, bu t not enough credit has been given to its importance. There are many practical uses for a pend ulum. When I was a child, my un cle was the one called on when a farmer needed to find a location to dig for an artesian well. He taught me to dowse at the age of ten. Before we had satellite pictures, dowsers were used to find oil deposits, and in the Second World War, soldiers with the ability to dowse were used to find minefields and armament stashes. They can b e used to find lost articles and to determine if something is compatible with your own personal vibration.

Fifty years ago, this ability, although not rare, was not too comm on. That is no longer the c ase. A large percentag e of our popu lation today can d evelop this ability v ery easily a nd rapidly.

The psychic e nergy o f the dowser, direc ted b y his thoughts, reaches out toward the aura o f the object sought, contacts it, locates it, and represents it to the dowser in the mann er, which h e prescribes.

They a re r adiations transmitted b y a ll and every material as it decomposes, or gets ready to change states. Everything (all elements) has its atomic nu mber (which I believe corresponds to o hms), nu mber of atoms, ind icating how slowly it is going to v ibrate, or how fast it is going to vibrate. All we do in p end ulum work is to tun e in to some atomic vibrations, and if we know how, we can tell which one it is and where it is. 2) You must have both positive and n egative like a radio. You can use the ground wave as negative, and the airwave as positive. 3) So in the matter of pend ulums, the hu man b ody collects the air wave, acting a s the antenn a o r aerial, and the feet in contact with the ground acts as the earth conn ection or ‘ground’. 4) For correct pend ulum work, it is necessary to keep the balls of the feet on the ground u nless one uses another method of tapp ing the e arth curre nt."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"265 5) A gold ring suspended on a piece of string o r thread is used b y some to determine the sex o f an un born child b y holding it above the stomach of a pregnant woman.

His mind h as endowed it with the instructions to mov e in a circular motion. If his mind had endowed h is symbol to mov e in an up and down, side-to-side motion, it would h ave done thusly, rather than mov e in a circular motion. (Review Article VI – Visualization and S ymbols.) 7) You must enlist the aid of your sub conscious. Give yo ur sub conscious a name, which you can u se when talking with it. Call i t ‘George’ or ‘Grace’ or anything you want, just like naming a baby, bu t never tell anyone its name. This is just for yo u. 8) Let yo ur c onscious mind talk to yo ur sub conscious mind in a mann er somewhat like the following: a) ‘George’, ‘George’, I want yo ur help very much. I want you to work with me. I want yo u (then specify what you want – be very specific, not wishy-washy) and remember ‘George’ that really we are all one and what you do for me yo u are also doing for yourself. Repeat this slowly, carefully, and with great thought – 3 times. 9) When using y our pend ulum, keep yo ur feet flat on the floo r so the balls of yo ur feet are in contact with the floor and say something like: a) ‘George’, I want to know what I must do to g et success at (such and such a thing). If you are going to make the pendu lum work, make it swing backwards and forwards for yes and side to side for no as a hu man d oes when h e nods for yes and shakes his head for no. Repeat 3 times very slowly, very clearly, very carefully, what you want your sub conscious to do a nd what yo u expect of the test, because if you are"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"266 not certain what you want, then how can the subconscious give yo u any information? 10 ) Although pendu lums are made out of a lot of different materials and shapes, I am m ost fond of the ancient traditional way as follows: a) Use a wood b all around an inch to a n inch and a quarter in d iameter. These can most often b e found at craft stores. b) Use boot makers thread, or twine, five feet in length. c) Tie (or staple) one e nd to the wooden p end ulum. Tie the other e nd to a rod, or e mpty large spool (like a thread spool). d) Wind all the thread onto the rod or spool so that when yo u hold it in the palm of yo ur hand the thread holding the pend ulum is between the finger and thu mb of your hand . e) First, tune your pendu lum for the particular type of material you wish to locate. 1. For exa mple, Gold – Take a piece of sticky tape one inch wide and pu t a very small piece of the gold (scraped from the inside of a ring, for instance) on the tape and lightly pu sh it onto the pend ulum. 2. Put your r ing, or another piece of gold b etween your feet as yo u stand up . (To tun e the pend ulum, a sample of the material you wish to locate should always be placed on the ground b etween your feet.) Stand up right with your spine straight and your left arm down by y our side. The r ight arm should b e e levated to parallel with the ground . Do not brace your elbow ag ainst your side. 3. Slowly unwind the thread so that your pendu lum lowers to perhaps a foot and a half from yo ur fingers. 4. At this point, the pend ulum should swing in a circular direc tion making a complete c ircle. If not, lower the thread a little or pull i t up a little. At the point where it moves most easily, make a knot where it lies between your thu mb and forefinger and write down the exact length from the knot to the ball and list this as ‘Knot #1 – Gold’."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"267 5. Do the same for silver, stonework, glass, vegetable stuff, water, lead, oil, etc. A partial scale in order of length is as follows: First at around 12” you should find stonework – then glass – the vegetable stuff – then silver and lead close together – then water – then around 18” gold – then copper and b rass. Iron should b e found at less than 30”. As I said, this is only a rough, partial scale, to help guide you. I have used a wooden b all pend ulum for outside work since I gave up cutting a forked tree branch. It’s much easier to use. For ‘inside’ work, especially where ‘maps’ are used, I find a ‘shorter cord’ pendu lum to be preferable. My favorite indoor pendu lum is a qu artz point on a chain. The following is an exa mple of how to use a shorter cord p endu lum: 1) Say yo u wish to find where a certain p erson is living. Set at a table with n o shelves or drawers, like a kitchen table. 2.Have at arms reach some sheets of ordinary white paper. 3. Tell ‘George’ what you want. Say, look ‘George’, I want to find if Betty lives in this area, If she does, please so indicate by swinging the pendu lum backwards and forwards to show yes, or side to side to ind icate no. 4. Have yo ur pieces of paper on the right hand side of the table, and on the top, which is away from yo u, write ‘yes’ and on the bottom, which is close to you write ‘yes’. On the far left side write ‘no’ and on the far right side write ‘no’, and in the very center draw a plus sign p ointing to these four answers. The center where the two lines cross is the spot over which you will hold the pend ulum. The pendu lum should b e held about 2” o ver the c enter of the plus s ign. 5) Sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor, with or without shoes on. Get a map of the area desired and spread it out on your left side, so that yo u have your sheet of white paper on the r ight and the map on the left."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268 6) First, mov e the pendu lum all over the area o f the map saying, ‘George’, this is the area o f my map. I want to know if ‘Betty’ is anywhere within this area. ‘George’, I am go ing to start my investiga tion. I want you to help me. Please indicate yes or no as the case may be. Then pu t your right elbow comfortably o n the table and suspend the pendu lum by its chain or cord b etween your thu mb and forefinger. The pendu lum should b e about 2” above the ‘plus’ sign. 7) Having gotten ready, make sure not to be disturbed. Tell ‘George’ that yo u are now ready to start work. Look at the map and pu t the forefinger of your left hand along the roa d on the map where you think ‘Betty’ might live. Give an occasional glance at the pend ulum in yo ur right hand. It may swing idly without any apparent sense, bu t when you get to where you b elieve the person you are searching for lives, and at that point, the pend ulum will definitely ind icate ‘yes’ or ‘no’. 8) Use a small scale map first so that you can cov er the biggest area, bu t when yo u get some sort of indication as if ‘George’ was saying, ‘this is a big a rea’, ‘I need to g et closer to this’, then yo u get a large scale map so that yo u can, with p ractice locate any ind ividual house. 9) After each test yo u must exchange your sheet of paper for another fresh one, because of the e lectro-dynamic e nergy residu e that attaches to this symbol (the paper). REMEMBE R, MAKE SUR E OF WHAT YOU ARE ASKING BE FORE YOU POSE T HE QUESTION AND NEVER SAY , ‘CAN YOU TELL ME’. Make yo ur re qu est with a sense of authority, and know that it must be granted. When you have finished your search, always remember to thank ‘George’ for his assistance. This techniqu e can b e used to find anything. Our group p racticed, sometimes, by hiding va rious objects around the house. Then by making a rough ‘map’ (which is the ‘symbol’ for the mind ) of the area on which to work, could always find these secreted objects.

When h e learns he is not bound for the du ration of this particular life to it. That he can leave it at will, travel, learn and return. He can d o it mentally, astrally a nd /or ph ysically. He is not limited to a ny particular location, and h e does not need a car, a plane, or train to take him where he wants to go . He can also bring o bjects to where he is. It is all done by ‘mind ’ using the ‘mental continuum. This is called teleportation. Out-of-body (astral) projection is a form of teleportation. We are always out-of-our-body when we sleep soun dly, even if we don’t do a ny traveling. Those who have the vision can see the astral form rising up slightly o ut of the physical body, just hovering there . There are exercises by which attention can b e focused to consciously leave and return to your physical body. For the most part, in the average hu man b eing, it is a fairly comm on form of involun tary projection, which naturally happens without plan and often without the projecting person b eing aware of the near miracle he has accomplished. One criteria for successful conscious projection is the ability to concentrate totally o n getting o ut-of-the-body. We keep going back to the importance of bu ilding up your mental energy a nd concentration. This cannot be over-emph asized. There is more than one type of projection. The best way to project at will and make the person you are trying to reach aware of yo ur presence is through astral projection. However, mental projection is much simpler and it is better to practice with this for a while before attempting the other method. Mental projection means trav eling in ‘mind ’ to a particular place. Concentrate on a place familiar to you at the beginn ing. Close your eyes and think about your house. See the stree t in front of your house and the sidewalk leading up to the door. Now look at the c olor of your house and look right and then left to what is beside yo ur house. The ‘pattern"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"270 of relationship’ of this s ymbol is already stored in your mind , so you have no trouble in visualizing it. Now, open the door and go in, and loo k around the room yo u h ave just entered. Note the c olor of the walls and look at the objects in the r oom. Now go into a nother roo m, and look around and n ote e verything in that room. Now open your e yes. Do you know w hat yo u have just done? You h ave projected yourself mentally into your home. It’s that simple in reality. That is a form of ‘mental projection’. When you want to do some serious mental projection, take a little time to prepare. Don’t attempt to project if you are tired, sick or hav e just finished eating. Your mind must be c lear and active with a good b lood circulation in the brain. Take a bath and b rush your teeth to remove as much extraneous matter as possible from yo ur body. This frees you from m aterial and astral contamination. Put on a loose garment and find a place where you will not be interr upted. Sit in a comfortable chair with a headrest or lie down. I like to do my projecting when I go to bed at night before I get too sleepy, especially if I want to a ctually leave my body consciously. When you are comfortable, take seven d eep b reaths in this fashion. Inh ale to the coun t of 4, hold to the c oun t of 10 , then, exhale to the c ount of 8. Space your c oun t evenly, in a regular pattern, neither too fast, nor too slow. When finished, close your eyes and visualize the place to which you wish to project your mind , or your astral body. Until yo u are adept at out-of- body projection, limit your travels to known locales – whether it is in the next room or a thousand miles away. (I sometimes like to v isit my son aboard h is naval ship just to check up on h im, and later we c ompare notes.) Distance doesn’t matter, bu t in the beginning it is important that yo u know where yo u are going and are familiar with its ‘pattern of relationships’, which your mind h as on file. Then see yourself in this place. Imagine that yo u are in the actual spot yo u have imagined. In order to do this s uccessfully, you must shu t out awareness of your present ph ysical surround ings, and see in your mind ’s eye the appearance of the place yo u are visiting."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"271 When you can actually see yo urself in the place selected, loo k about. Observe furniture arrangements, people who might be present, how they a re dressed and listen to what is said. (While in your c hosen location, those who have the vision q uite probably can see you or feel yo ur presence.) Then return your attention to your body seated in the chair or lying down as the c ase may be. It is important that you remain fully conscious through the e ntire projection, for allowing yo urself to fall in a dream state, brings illusion and un reality. Make sure to stay awake. When you open your eyes, write down all that you observed and the exact hour in case you have the opp ortun ity to verify yo ur observations. You can set up a test projection with a friend or relative by setting up a day , time and p lace, and then checking o ut what you observed later with them. This can b e a lot of fun , especially if your friend is clairvoy ant and can see your app earance. I was involved in a test in the 80’s with some friends who went out to Sedona where one of the party members was highly clairvoya nt and she was able to actually see me e ach time I projected to a predetermined location, and when we compared written notes up on their re turn, it was a 1 00% ‘hit’. It’s really v ery simple and a lot of fun . The most significant differe nce between mental projection and out-of- body projection (as we like to call i t) lies in the focus of consciousness. In mental projection, you are always dimly aware of your body and what is taking place around yo u. It’s like feeling yo urself in two places at the same time. You are aware of the sounds and smells in the place yo u project to, while still aware of what is around your physical body. It’s almost as if your mind is divided into two sets of awareness and you will find it possible to switch your attention from one to the other instantly. The first time I consciously mentally projected, I could feel my body separating. Part of it felt like r ising up , while the other part felt like sinking down, a rather strange sensation. Then all of a sudd en, I was in another location, which I could h ear, feel and smell, and at the same time I was fully a ware of my body in the c hair in my living roo m.

Your body lies in a deep like sleep and is aware of nothing un til you return to it. The impressions, which reach your astral body, are just as vivid, powerful and real as physical impressions. Lower e motions entering your mind , or trying to spy, or invading another’s s pace without permission, will instantly break off an astral projection. Your own conscious mind will not permit it. Also, thoughts of earthy ph ysical things like e ating, etc. will also flip you right back into your body. Again, never try astral projection u nless you are in good p hysical health. This is extremely important. Nor should yo u make an attempt if yo u are tired or hav e just eaten. Another important thing to know is that no alcohol should b e consumed at least 48 hours prior to attempting projection. This is not a game. If you n eed a little e xtra help in getting ‘out-of-body, try this. While lying comfortably, close yo ur eyes and raise yo ur c onsciousness to a point at the top of your head.

At this point, intone softly a nd rhythmically the sound of ‘OM’ seven times on the note of G above midd le C to resonate in the top of your head. Imm ediately a fter, repeat this same intonation silently in your head seven times. Concentrating a ll of your attention on the c ore of this resonating sound , let it lift slowly up ward toward the c eiling. Remember, it is the r esonance that ascends, not your body. Then open your eyes and allow your awareness of things about you to return. Do not be alarmed when yo u realize that you are no longer on the bed, bu t above it near the c eiling. Above all, do not let the feeling of shock and fear; enter your mind or solar plexus when you observe your body, seemingly lifeless, on the bed b elow.

The science of Biorhythms utilizes four of these important cycles. They a re: The Physical, repeating every twenty-three days; the Emotional, repeating every twenty-eight days; the Mental (or Intellectual), repeating every thirty-three days; and the Spiritual, repeating every eighteen d ays. Each n ew cycle begins with an ‘up ’ period with the first day being a critical day (marked b y a n “x” on the c hart). Midway, the cycle goes into a ‘low’ period with the day a fter cross-over of the median line being a critical day (marked b y a ‘period’ on the c hart). In other words, there are two critical days in each complete c ycle for each of the four cycles. Add itional caution should b e observed on critical days inasmuch as you are more prone to a ccidents and injuries on these days, or in the case of the Sp iritual cycle, a day o f confusion or lack of focus intuitively. The pattern of each individual varies s omewhat, so it is there fore advisable that yo u work with your c hart to ascer tain your personal patterns. It is s uggested that you make notations und er e ach d ate as to incidents that occur, your physical and emotional feelings, the state of yo ur mental alertness, your intuition, etc. You will soon b e able to see repetitions relating to the swing o f your c ycles. A Y early Guidance Chart, highlighting favorable and unfavorable times for many situations, which you may face du ring the c ourse of a year, is a helpful addition. This, used in conjun ction with yo ur Biorhythm chart, can give you a better und erstand ing o f yourself.

Many a thletes in ph ysical contact sports have been injured seriously o n critical days. It is interesting to note, however, that baseball pitchers seem to pitch unu sually good games on critical days. I have c harted several professional baseball pitchers and have found that by the use of both Biorhythms and a breakdown of their birth year into periods that an interesting predictable pattern emerged. The most interesting chart I have done was s ome years ago for the Detroit Tigers rookie pitcher know as “The Byrd”. It broke down as follows: In h is Sixth Period, he pitched six ga mes of which h e won five and lost one. This loss was the only ga me played when he was mentally high and p hysically low. In h is Seventh Period h e pitched eleven ga mes of which h e won eight and lost three . All three losses occurre d when h e was high mentally and low ph ysically. However, when h e entere d his First Period his pattern changed. Up un til I discontinued h is chart du ring his Seventh Period, he had lost (in that period) one game while high mentally a nd low ph ysically, and one game where he had a doub le cr itical day the day before the game and a mental critical the day a fter the game. He never lost, du ring the time I charted him, a ga me on a critical day a nd n ever won a game when h e was high mentally and low ph ysically. Another example: If you’re planning marriag e, it is first nece ssary to chart both p ersons concer ned for there are two periods which are not favorable if they fall i n the marriage date of either. These two periods are the Second and Fourth Periods. I have found a nu mber of divorces in cases where the marriage took place in an u nfavorable period of one or the other persons involved, and in almost all cases, the partner in whose c hart the un favorable period fell instigated the divorce . This is not intend ed to imply that it will happ en in all cases, bu t it is advisable to be married in a period known to be favorable. Why take c hances. I find that when the Emotional cycle is high, you tend to be more nervous and edgy. This would b e even truer in your Fourth Period, which is a period when your nervo us system is tried to its utmost limits.

This is your First Period. Then to calculate your Second Period, begin with 6/18 and coun t another 52 days, which will be 8/9. So your Second Period will be 6/18 to 8/9. Continu e in this mann er for a complete year, up to the day before your birthday. When you get to the Seventh Period, you will find more than 52 days remaining. Just throw these extra days into the Seventh Period. There will be an additional two days if you coun t all Februarys as having 29 days, otherwise, there will be three add itional day s to a dd to the Seventh Period. Biorhythms change constantly from the date of birth, bu t your Yearly Guidance Chart remains the same for your e ntire life.

STE P 1 – MET HOD FOR C OMPUTING THE NU MBE R OF DAY S YOU HAV E BEE N A LIVE; The pu rpose of this step is to find out exa ctly how many days you h ave been on Earth from and including the day o f your birth to any particular date from which you wish to start yo ur c hart. First you count the total nu mber of years s ince birth. For exa mple, if yo u wish your c hart to start April 1, 200 3, you first count all the full years and convert them to days. Using the birth date of April 26, 1933 yo u will see that there has been 69 complete years up thru April 25, 2002. Multiply the 69 y ears by 3 65 days and write down the total of 25 ,185 days on a scratch pad. Then coun t the nu mber of days from April 26 ,2002 thru and including March 31, 2003 a nd add that to yo ur total. Next, refer to the list of leap year dates from the list in Part 4 o f this article and count the nu mber of leap years since yo ur date of birth and add them to the re st. The total should b e – 25,537 days in total from the day o f birth thru March 31, 2003. STE P 2 – COMPUTING THE STAR TING POINT OF THE CYC LE S FOR A SPECIFIC DA TE : In order to begin yo ur c hart on a specific date, you need to know the position of each cycle for that particular date. You find this by dividing the nu mber of days in a cycle into the total nu mber of days you hav e been alive. This will show you h ow many completed cycles yo u h ave go ne thru in your life. The only figure that is important is the REMAIND ER after you hav e done the math. The REMAIND ER is where you are at the particular start date you h ave c hosen. "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"288 For e xample: In our sample c hart – the total nu mber of days is 25 ,537 . This figure, 25 ,537 divided by 23 (physical) = 1,110 complete cycles with a REMAIND ER of 7. On April 1, 2003 – the physical cycle is in its 7 th day of a new up cycle. The half way point of the ph ysical is 11 ½ days before it goes into low, then another 11 ½ days before it goes back into high. Beginn ing with 7 a s the first day o f April, coun t 11 ½ days and mark the space by a ‘period’ then continu e coun ting to 23 a nd place an “X” in the 24 th day. (USE A BL UE PEN TO MAR K THE PHYSICA L CYC LE ). The “X” indicates the beginning o f a new ‘up ’ physical cycle. (The period h alf way in the cycle marks the beginn ing o f a down cycle.) Continue c ounting a nd marking in this mann er for as many months as yo u wish for yo ur c hart. Fill in only o ne or two months until you get the hang o f it Then go back and mark the half way point in the ‘up ’ cycle and the half way point in the ‘down’ cycle. Using a ruler, draw a straight line from the “X” beginning a new ‘up ’ cycle to the half way point, then d raw another straight line from the high p oint down to the midway point of the low cycle and then b ack up to the beginn ing o f the next high cycle marked b y a n ‘X’. Next go back and circle in b lue all the ph ysical critical days. Each “X” is a critical day, bu t the day AFTE R crossover midway in the cycle is a critical day. There are 2 critical days in each of the three cycles. Using a red p en, do the same for the 28 day Emotional period. The midway point is 14 days. Using a gree n pen, do the same for the 33 day Mental period. The midway point is 16 ½ days. Using a pu rple pen, do the same for the 18 day Spiritual period. The midway point is 9 days. The most crucial thing is your coun t between the c ritical “X” days. Beginn ing with the “X” coun t: 23 days for the Physical and place your next “X” on the 24 th day. 28 days for the Emotional and place your next “X” on the 29 th day. 33 days for the Mental and place yo ur next “X” on the 34 th day. 18 days for the Spiritual and place your next “X” on the 19 th day."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"289 Use the sample c hart as a g uide (below), and show the pertinent information, i.e. Blue for Physical, Red for Emotional, Green for Mental, and pu rple for Spiritual Also calculate your Yearly Guidance Chart and list the periods for qu ick refere nce.

Perhaps it did n ot even come in from outer space, or from far reaches within our solar system, on a 360 0-year orbit, bu t was at one time a planet within our solar system in orbit around our sun , between Mars and Jup iter. And may be when it ‘blew’ itself up , any o f its inh abitants on Earth at that time just got stranded h ere . In 1956 we re ceived information about this planet, which they called Maldek, via short wave radio. A robot Chronomonitor recorded the final stages of its life onto a ‘crystalgraph ’ recording. A crystalgraph is a sphere of qu artz no bigger than an inch in d iameter and can contain up to 200 thousand hours of data. Remember this was in 1956, long before the integrated circuit. The following is an actual transcription of this recorded message, that when attun ed to a cer tain d evice is capable of converting thoughts and language into our language: “Teritia Maldek, elonto solex polita. Our tears, Oh Maldek, long come, Solar friend . Alas, Oh Maldek, why didst thou n ot foresee thine own disaster? Oh Vadur! Why shouldst thou lash thy sister city Karna with such fury? ‘Tis thine own lust and hu ngers which h ave come about and caused this s trife – thine own life, devoid of Our Radiant One’s ‘Light’. Didst we not plead for thine government to hesitate and to a rbitrate this matter? We plead with thee now to not use the vril force, for destruction will be thy reward. Listen, Oh Maldek, we implore thee not to use this force . “Ever we, your brothers, hav e seen the great Fire-Tongue lighting the heavens for our system. ‘Tis not your r ight to wield such fury un to o ne another. Maldek! Oh Maldek! Do not do this! You h ave one period left. We plead yo u reconsider. Do not yo ur scientists tell you to stop b efore it is too late? To lose thy planet would n ot help. From all space, Oh Maldek, we call and say STOP! STOP before it is too late. We stand by to help thee at this moment, our brothers. We await only yo ur c all."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"295 “Oh Maldek, Light of Sol! Why have yo u fought in this mann er? Thy troubles have risen from thy own pleasures, thy disregard of Our “Light”, the Creator. Thou can have no true growth without this “Light”! Oh, Maldek. Thy time grows s hort. Forgive one another. Dare not use the vril rays. We call you, Oh Maldek. Heed u s while there is yet time. Thy life has been beautiful and b right, thy cities proud , thy people long cared for. That your moment should pass this way is not called for. Listen, Fire-Tongue, we say thou can as yet save thyself. Wait and p ray for thy strife to cease. Call upon the Max im “Light” and b eseech it for thy world”. THE RECORD ING END ED WITH THESE FINA L WORD S: “Oh Maldek, the light of yo ur e xistence is glowing brightly o n our scre ens. Already that which you were is fading. A missile containing the living element hydrogen is on its eventful flight through your atmosph ere. We can n o longer stay a nd plead for your existence. The moment has arrived! --- Adonai, Oh Maldek! --- It is finished, Oh Radiant One!” The way this all came about, Maldek, our morning star at that time, (referred to a s Lucifer in our written records), had a g reat civilization which h ad existed for many centuries. The people had gone through the evolutionary cycles of wars and strife and had finally reached a state of spiritual awareness. The two principal cities upon its s urface were Karna a nd Vadu r. There were three billion inhabitants in all, in these two g reat cities. MAN had achieved the fulfilling of all his needs. Vadur was a shining jewel of beauty. Many people from other areas of space visited this city o f MAN ’S d reams. Here , there was enough b eauty for all to share. It came about, after this had existed for many hu ndreds of years, that the people of Maldek were exposed to the r adiation of fissionable produ cts, which their government chanced to be e xploring the possibilities of. Here a g reat disaster took place. A missile c ontaining CA Lnu tronite, their most terrifying force yet developed, was somehow tampere d with and it exploded over the sub urban area of Karna. The radiations, which were loosed into the atmosph ere of Maldek, seared the"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"296 mind s of all the people e verywhere upon its s urface. A form of madn ess (radiation indu ced) infected all of these people. Karna accused Vadur of having intentionally caused this accident. The people, inflamed as they already were , declared that retribu tion should be e xtracted from the Vadu rian continent. You can imagine what followed. Envy, gree d and h atred, fann ed by the slow falling du st, laden with this radiation, brought about the loss of all reason in these people. A war of nu clear weapons grew to great proportions. The other planets, bound b y laws of unity, could not intervene in this situation. Although many delegations pleaded with both powers on Maldek, they were un successful in impressing upon them the foolishness of what they were pursuing. Finally, after repeated warnings were not heeded, they withdrew and stationed one of their re motely controlled observer c raft, a Chronomonitor, near the planet to record and to broadcast the e vents of this planet’s dying moments. In 1956 , our scientists had already experimented with the first three letters of the word, “CA Lnu tronite”, the power that caused the eventual destruction of Maldek. These three letters represent the elements cadmium, aluminu m and lithium. Had these experiments been allowed to continue un contested, the fate of Maldek may hav e become the fate of Earth. The force fields of Saturn, which are described as rings, and the asteroid b elt contains that evidence which once e xisted as a planet similar to Earth. Our own Holy Works can d etermine the date of this event. It has been stated in these works “that it caused a g reat light in the heavens and that the r ivers ran red as if from blood”; this, caused by the falling dust of Maldek as it settled n ot only in our own atmosph ere, bu t also in that of Mars. (In my early y ears, I often wond ere d why the re fere nce in the Bible to both a ‘satan’ and a ‘lucifer’, and the statement ‘oh Lucifer, how hast thou fallen.) It also caused a g reat deal of trouble to o ther planets in our solar system, especially Mars, where it affected the atmosph ere. This also coincides fairly close to the beginning of our c urre nt way o f calculating time, and might accoun t for e arly beliefs that man has only been on Earth for a few thousand years.

In 1959 , I began what I call Dream Traveling into the future with a dream of major earth changes, which repeated every night for three straight months; un til I thought I was losing my mind . It got to where I was afraid to go to sleep at night because I knew w hat would happ en. At that time I had n ever heard of any predictions or proph ecies about earth changes; and I have never e xperienced an earthq uake or any other natural disaster. I was vaguely aware of the terminology , UFO, only because one had created q uite a stir in Washington, D.C. where I was living in 1953. A coup le of years later, after taking up residence in a Middle Eastern coun try, I began to have visions that repeated, sometimes, for weeks on end . Looking back, I think someone was trying to get my a ttention. At the beginn ing o f the seventies, after moving to Michigan, I began having visions of our solar system with two sun s. Shortly a fter these visions s tarted, I met and was invited into a closed, very low-keyed group of contactees who had been working together for around twenty years at that time. I was given access to the material they had collected over a twenty-year period, and I bega n recording, first hand , information that continued to be rec eived after I joined them. I found a few refere nces to a second sun , bu t no detailed information un til we received specifics around 1975. Also, that year, upon return from a Moo n shot, one of our astronauts reported what he thought might be a second sun on course towards our solar system, bu t said it was still too far away to be sure. "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"299 In the last ten years, I have come across references from other sources speaking o f a second sun. When I heard Nancy Leder say something was being imag ed b y satellite up n ear Orion, I began to wond er if instead of a planet, this might be the second sun I’ve been looking for, or may be the prec ursor to it. QUESTION - WHAT WAS THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION RECEIVED IN 1975 Everyone who has been involved with the study o f metaphysics for any length of time knows that our planet is facing major c hanges, and that we are on the verge of going into a new density. What most are not aware of, is that the e ntire Galaxy is mov ing into a new area of space where our solar system will be exposed to new vibrations, closer to the Universal Sun. In 1975, we were told that, yes, a new sun was coming, bu t that it was s till a long way o ff; and when it enters our solar system, there are going to be c hanges in the location of our planets. Upon its arrival, we will lose Pluto a nd another planet between Mercury a nd our curre nt sun (which scientists have just briefly glimpsed), as well as satellites, for exa mple, our moo n; and also the stars will be in different positions from Earth’s view. As we become a binary sun system, the mag netic center of our system will change. So will the locations of our planets because they will have to readjust to the two sun s. This is going to make a big difference in our solar system, and especially to the people of Earth who will become a different cre ature du e to these new vibrations, which will be exposed. On the plus s ide, we will have a body of a higher density a nd hav e the c apacity to conceive greater knowledge and wisdom. It will instill a consciousness of pu re brotherly love and a much greater interest and concern for our fellowman. At that time, we will move away from the negative sides of our nature and realize how destructive these things can b e and will no longer tolerate them. If the object Nancy Leder’s group is imaging a nd calling the fabled Planet X, or Nibiru, is already inside our solar system (as of 5/13/03), it probably isn’t the second sun , bu t may be the advanced signal. One message I personally received at the e nd of the 70’s talked about a ‘flaming cross’ in our eastern sky a nd said it would p rece de the e ntry o f the sun , which would then follow close upon its app earance. (Close could mean up to a few years). "},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"300 In August, 1999 when the planets were lined up in what is called ‘the grand cross’, I thought this might be the vanguard. But if the object in the sky isn’t t he second sun , perhaps this is what is referr ed to a s the ‘flaming cross’. It is giving o ff colors as it is s treaking across s pace. I have no idea a bout the mechanics involved in b ecoming a binary system, whether the solar system is moving towards the second sun or if it is mov ing towards us. Since all energy is in forward motion, perhaps it is both. One re ference I came across in the 90’s was from Gordon Michael Scallion who said it would app ear all of a sudden as if it stepp ed out from behind S irius. Sirius is one of our closest neighbors, about 8 ½ Light Years away. I’ve always s een it coming in b elow the present sun in the e ast. (The cover of my boo k is from a ph otograph of the painting I did 30 years ago.) One of my dream travel trips into the future took me to North Carolina where it was a rain forest, and then to just beyond Kansas where the Pacific Ocean came up to. Another showed Cleveland , Ohio on the latitud e of Mexico a s it is today. When you add this altogether, you get a picture of a pole shift f rom the North Pole towards the right between 18 and 23 degrees. That would pu t North Carolina in the tropics and Cleveland on Mexico’s latitude, and the mag netic axis pointing towards the second sun . We were told that the second sun would n ot take on b rilliance un til it actually entered the solar system. One thing we can reasonably expect is that it will occur with a lot of commotion and p erhaps noise that will be terr ifying to both those who are expecting it, as well as those who are un aware. Perhaps this will be the cause of our ‘throwing down our weapons and turning them into plough-shares’, as the old p roph ecies state. WHY AR E SO MANY U FO’S AR E HERE AT T HIS TIME? We were told that the purpose for such a large visitation was for several reasons, one because of our discovery o f atomic e nergy , and our lack of knowledge in safely developing a nd using it; and because of what had"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"301 happ ened to a nother planet in our solar system, that was far advanced in technology than we are even in this day a nd age (2003). They were keeping a close e ye on us because on several occasions we had come close to destroying not only o urselves, bu t also the planet itself. They won’t interfere with what we do to each other, bu t they will not allow us to destroy the planet. Since this happ ened once in our solar system, they are determined n ot to let it happ en again. A second and very important reason, was that because our e ntire solar system was on the e ve of major c yclic c hanges of such a mag nitude, that the law governing body o f our solar system had sent out a call to o ther solar as well as galactic systems for help in making the transition. They were particularly concerned with Earth because due to o ur state of evolvement, we were totally unaware of what was to transpire. They have been attempting to make us aware for the last fifty o r so years and have been u rging us to prepare ourselves by learning to raise our consciousness and expand our thinking. They brought back the Tensor Concepts to help us develop the Tensor Centers of our brains, which will help p repare us for this transition. (I pu t these concepts together in a simple program and made it available to a large group of people over the years since the e arly eighties. It has been very helpful to many in their e ffort to raise c onsciousness.) It might surprise you to know that there are over 10 million craft in the immediate vicinity o f Earth. They have c ome from va rious planets in our solar system as well as from other solar systems; and they v ary greatly in d ensity. I wonder what our gov ernment would do if they, all of a sudd en, lowered their density to o ur r ange of vision. WHY D ID THEY C ONTAC T IND IVIDUA LS INSTE AD OF THE GO VERN MENT? In the early y ears, they did contact heads of government and offered to assist. They offered the benefit of their knowledge and technology. Their one re quirement was that we disarm. That, of course, did n ot fly with our leaders. About that time, thousands of people felt there was something special here and were meeting a nd gathering all the information they could on this ph enomenon. These visitors decided that since they had gotten nowhere with our leaders, they, after obtaining permission from their law governing bodies, bega n making contact with"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"302 the general popu lation. Most of the early comm un ications were done through electronic means s uch as s hort wave, because mind s were not developed enough to make c ontact telepathically using their techn ology. Gradually, people showing more telepathic ability were singled out and worked with to develop them as vocal channels. I hav e witnessed this process un folding as late as the seventies, bu t it was really difficult in the fifties. This was always done with the permission of the one c hosen, and they were given the option to discontinu e at any time. The first chann el my g roup was involved with had already mov ed to California by the time I joined the group , bu t I got to know the other three personally. Incidentally, the first one worked for the government on Project Blue Boo k as well as other projects the pu blic hasn’t even heard about, before he became ‘a believer’. He actually spent several hours aboard one of their scientific c raft as an invited guest. His personal story is one of the most amazing stories I have ever heard. (Also my g roup h ad b een in p ersonal contact with Van Tassel, Adamski and Williamson, three of the very earliest contactees.) Some of the material that came into my possession from these early contactees was so highly technical that it too k me years to und erstand it. Some of it I don’t un derstand even today because of a lack of knowledge in p hysics. WHAT ROLE DOES COSMIC CYC LE S HAV E IN THIS EXPECTE D TRAN SITION? It wasn’t un til the nineties that I got a go od grasp on what they meant by ‘our solar system is moving into a new area o f space’. I knew, like everyone else, that a new Age of Aqu arius was in the making. What I hadn ’t realized was that there was a change in the Cosmic Cycles that takes ov er four million years to complete. I bega n calculations from known p oints and calculated b ackwards for around 60,000 y ears. One of the points of refere nce was a prediction that the new Cosmic Golden Age would b egin ‘when man again learns to light the night’, which, of course, was the discovery o f electricity in 1879. I had b een witness to messages rec eived in 1973 o f a ph enomena o ccurring beyo nd our telescopes that was physical in nature. From m y calculations, I was able to determine that this was the midway point between the old Cosmic Dark Age and the new Cosmic Golden Age. I was also a ble to determine that it was the midway point between the Piscean Age and"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"303 Aqu arian Age, which b egan around 1933. The Piscean Age will be totally gone around 2012 to 2013 ; and the Cosmic Dark Age will be totally gone around 2079 to 20 80 . When copyright expired on Doreal’s ‘Emerald Tablets of Thoth’ and they began circulating o n internet a few years ago , I found additional verification of dates I had used for my calculations, along with a lot of information giving extra weight to the teachings we had been receiving for forty y ears or more. It’s always good to g et confirmation even on material you trust. I did the work on the c ycles in the late 90’s and , like e veryone else, was excited about the coming turn of the c entury, thinking may be something mag ical would happ en overnight. When I was finished, I was qu ite depressed for a while, because I realized from these calculations that it wasn’t going to g et much b etter until around 2018 to 2020, and that we were going to go thru a ‘lot of stuff’ before that time. We hav e actually started to mov e towards the transition, bu t I no longer expect it to o ccur instantaneously, bu t rather gradually move in that direc tion. I think it won’t happ en un til the second sun has mov ed in and taken up its final position. I don’t know how long it will take to travel thru the solar system un til i t reaches its final position. Like I s aid, I calculated the earliest time of the sun’s taking up p osition would b e 2018 to 2025 , and at the latest 2080. If what is being imag ed up in the heavens is the second sun or even the advanced signal, I could b e off in my calculations by a few years, depend ing o n h ow fast it mov es. I hope not, we need more time to prepare, bu t I am working with a time period of millions of years, so a few years is a ‘drop in the bu cket’ so to speak. If the object up there is the forerunn er, we may still have a little time to g et prepared, bu t we shouldn ’t waste any o f it. WHERE DO UFO’S COME FROM – OUTE R SPAC E - OTHER DIMENSIONS - OR INN ER SPAC E? I’ve been asked this qu estion b efore, and my a nswer is ‘ALL OF THE ABOVE’. We were told that Earth is the only inhabited p lanet in this s olar system who is s till in 3D, and that all the others exist in a finer density, which is not visible to o ur site. (This also includ es all their material possessions)."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"304 They have learned to control energy a nd can change matter into energy and energy into matter, and occasionally do this to bring their c raft into our level of sight. There are some that do o ccupy o ur frequ ency that are from other solar systems, which are working with them, and these can app ear as a cloud b y ionizing the air around their craft. Also, there are those from other areas of space that are visible to us that are of a v ery low nature, and we were told it was best not to have anything to do with them. Most of the c raft, however, that are visible to us do not come from outer space. App arently, the main bodies of sightings that are not from outer space are the ones we r eally need to stay away from. They told us not to interfere or try to contact them, or help them in any way, and that we should not pu rsue our investigation of them, otherwise, we would d raw their attention. App arently, some of them are cr eated out of the lower astral world by a force that is s oon du e to be re moved from the planet. You will find references to these beings in the Thoth material that talks about a certain energy that was overcome in ages past that was banished to the ‘shadow’ worlds, bu t which could b e c alled forth b ack into the physical world by hu mans, if they were not careful or pu rposely called them forth. These beings will no longer be able to exist in the new vibration the solar system is entering. Lucky us! This also a pplies to Earth hu mans of a v ery low nature. The new planetary vibrations will make it impossible for them to continue their e xperiences on Earth, and they will have to be re mov ed to o ther areas of space more suited to their level of evolvement. All this makes it a little difficult for hu mans in 3D to distinguish between the ‘good guys’ and the ‘bad guys’. We were told that learning to use ‘The Light’ is our best protection, and listening a nd analyzing carefully the information b eing given. (There is an article on how to use The Light listed with the other articles on Developing The Tensor Concepts.) I know I wouldn ’t ‘hop’ into the first U.F.O. that land ed in my front yard, nor would I allow or acce pt telepathic information that was not of the highest positive spiritual nature to enter my thinking. WHAT WILL T HE PLAN ET BE L IKE IF WE GET A SECOND SUN ? As we have progressed from ag e to age, many, as individuals, and even some whole cultures, have made it into a finer density - that which we"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"305 call the Fourth Dimension; while others continu ed their e xperiences in 3D.

But we will still be here in a different frequency, if we are among the fortunate ones to make this transition. IS THE GO VERN MENT E NGAGED IN A C OVER U P ABOUT UFO’S? There are two things I find curious about actions of our government. 1. If the gov ernment has no knowledge of aliens, then why did Title 14 , Section 1211 o f the Code of Federal Regulations, implemented on July 16 , 1969, make it illegal for U.S. citizens to have any contact with extraterrestrials or their vehicles? And why did it remain on the books un til April 26, 1991, when, according to NA SA it was removed, and I qu ote, ‘since it had served its pu rpose and is no longer in keeping with curre nt policy’. This law w as comm only known as “The U.S. Federal ET L aw”. 2. In the 70’s when p eople were first beginning to learn about coming major e arth changes, there was some panic stocking o f food and sup plies. I remember the government warning the popu lation that ‘hoarding’ was illegal and was s ub ject to federal prosecution. Why now, all of a sudd en und er the guise of preparing for terrorist attacks, is the government runn ing a concentrated campaign advising people to ‘stock’ up and b e prepared. If yo u go into www.ready.gov you will see all the many different categories that you should h ave to be prepared for emergencies, which they state is the same for ‘terrorists’ attacks or ‘natural disasters’. Think about it for a minu te. Our c ountry is not in imminent danger of being a ttacked in force . A possible terrorist attack would p robably be an isolated event. Even natural disasters are usually localized, not nation wide, un less tornadoes, etc. sweep across a state or several states. And where these touch down, stored sup plies are not going to help very much, because they would p robably be blown away. It doesn’t seem logical to me that they a re e ncouraging the whole nation to be prepared just for these possibilities. Do they know something the general population doesn’t know?"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"306 Now think about this. IF there were something a bout to enter our solar system, I would think NA SA would be the first to know. If civilians can chart objects moving far out into space, surely the government, with all our satellites and rockets s ent out beyond our mag netic barrier, should be aware of it. Their problem would be how to inform the pub lic, worldwide, without causing chaos and p anic. I don’t know about all of yo u out there, bu t I would like to have a little adva nced warning so that I could p repare the best way I could for such a major event, even if all I could d o was make my peace with the powers that be. If the destruction of one planet in our solar system caused so much trouble, think how much more profound the events would b e in changing the mag netic ce nter for the whole system. No wond er our cosmic neighb ors called in outside help. If the second sun comes in the direc tion I have been visualizing for thirty y ears in p roximity to o ur present sun , the mag netic pole shift will not be as great as it would if it entere d from an opp osite direction. (The pole shift would b e proportionate to the degree of separation of the two.) An opp osite direc tion could cause a 180 -degree shift, which would reverse the position of the poles. Science believes this has happ ened in the past. We have no way o f knowing when this happ ened, bu t I have a g nawing suspicion that the diminishing a nd rebu ilding o f our mag netic field has something to do with the Cosmic c ycles every four million years when our galaxy mov es closer to the Universal Sun . If this is the case, perhaps we are binary for specific periods and lose the second sun as we once again mov e away from this closer position to the Universal Sun . Again, if this is the case, we can expect to be binary for at least a million and seven hund red thousand years or more. A LOT OF P EOPLE AR E T ALKING ABOUT PLAN ET X BE ING THE RET URN OF NIBIRU . IF THEY AR E WRONG, WHAT ABOUT NIBIRU ? I think that the planet called Nibiru that so many a re talking a bout will never return. I think what the Su merian S crolls may have been talking about was perhaps the planet within our solar system in orbit around our sun b etween Mars and Jup iter, which blew itself up in early biblical days. "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"307 Our visitors call this planet ‘Maldek – The Lost Planet, and told us that it created the Asteroid Belt, settled in a fine, thick red du st on Mars, caused the rivers on Earth to run red like bloo d, and was the source of the debris in the rings of Saturn. The timing fits with the c urrent Jewish calendar way o f coun ting time (Curre nt year 5763). There’s references in the bible, which talks about a bright light in the heavens (with sub sequ ent fall-out that turned rivers red as blood), and as far as I have been able to determine, no reference to the Annu naki after that time. There are, historically, major disrup tions at the e nd of one age before the new one stand s alone, bu t these do not run in 3600 y ear c ycles. Each age is differe nt, whether it is the Prec ession of the Equ inoxes or the Cosmic Cycles. There was a major disrup tion 52,000 b.c.e. around the time Thoth migrated to Egypt. (That was two Equinoxes ago .) Another major disrup tion was about 10,000 years b.c., as a Khali (or Dark/Iron) Age gave way to a new Sat (or Golden) Age. (Both coinciding with the 3600 y ear time line of The Destroy er.) Noa h’s Floo d occurre d (according to written record) somewhere between 2261 b.c. to 1200 b.c. (There is s ome disagree ment.) This falls into a period where Treta (Silver) Age ga ve way to a Dwapara (Bronze) Age. (Again du ring o ne of the 3600 y ear passings of the Destroyer.) For that time line there is ample archaeological evidence that something impacted the planet so severely that it rocked the planet and caused the waters to spread over its s urface. (Perhaps a piece of the destroyed Maldek propelled b y the passing o f The Destroy er.) Maldek, 5,000, or more, years ago, was only a little more advanced techn ologically than we are today , bu t perhaps it would h ave been possible for them to reach Earth to mine minerals. But how could anyone have come thru the asteroid belt 250,000 years prior if it didn’t exist before approximately 5 ,800 years ago? I don’t have any trouble with the idea that a race, perhaps called the Annun aki, came to Earth and genetically engineer ed a species. It’s happ ened more than once. Since our solar system was colonized around 1,800 ,000 y ears b.c., it’s even possible they had the technology 250 ,000 years ago to make it to Earth. But if a part of the destroy ed Maldek striking Earth were the main cause of Noah’s Flood, it would explain what happened to the Annu naki and why there is no record of them"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"308 after the flood. Perhaps what people are calling Planet X is a differe nt celestial body (not the home planet of the Annun aki), which could very well be on a 3600 year orbit and p eriodically causes havoc when its orbit brings it to closer than n ormal to Earth. (Especially if its coming coincides with the c hanging from one age to a nother, as in the case of Noa h’s Floo d.) Our scientists have discovere d many o bjects in recent decades that return at predictable times. Since Thoth left Atlantis 54 ,000 y ears ago (52 ,000 b.c. to 2000 a.d.) there have been 15 cycles of 3600 y ears, which means we are very close, as Nancy Leader declares, to the re turn of The Destroyer. Not all passings bring total destruction. Hopefully, this one will not be as destructive as in the days of Noah. WHAT ABOUT T HE ZET A’S (OR GRAY A LIENS)? As far as the Grays are c oncer ned, very little of our source material refers to them specifically in this mann er. The Coun cil of the Worlds they speak about is not the same source as our information. I know that beyond the Constellation of Orion exists a dark cloud , beyond which life has evolved on a negative plane. I’m not sure where the c urrent visiting Zeta’s came from, bu t if they came from the Reticulum Net in the Southern Constellation, that would b e beyond the dark cloud . Perhaps all Grays are not from the same group or federation. But the ones who are involved with abductions and experimentation on hu mans seem to have their own agenda a nd seem to have no regard for Earth people other than laboratory experiments, not un like how w e treat test animals. What these beings are e ngag ed in angers me somewhat. It app ears that they messed up their world, genetically engineered their bodies un til emotion, compassion, digestive tracts, and sex were eliminated. Now they live in caves and hidd en places and regret what they did. They reason it’s okay to a bduct our people to breed a hybrid race more in tun e with them m entally a nd p lan to use these bodies to gradu ally incarnate into. This can only be seen as a violation of the First Law – that called ‘Free Will’ which is God given to all Man. They may have gotten permission from ind ividuals, to be used in this mann er before they were born, bu t they failed to impress that on the conscious mind s of their victims. The traumas and attacks on the psyches of these poor people are unbelievably cruel. I know I wouldn ’t have anything to do with them, and I think they a re some of the ones we"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"309 were cautioned about. But the fact remains; they have cr eated a hybrid race, and p lan to introduce them back into o ur gene pool at a later time, un less s ome other force intervenes. I would p refer to have a body for the New Age c reated in the higher levels of the Astral World, than pollute our genes in this mann er. But that’s just my o pinion. I haven’t paid any a ttention to descriptions about their c raft, and I don’t know w hat they look like, bu t I remember being told about two types of craft to be e specially careful in avoiding. One was a rec tangular boxcar shape and the other was one that emanates blue lights. The ones with b lue lights are not capable of traveling o utside of Earth’s atmosph ere. These are the beings we were told that were of a v ery low nature, and were cr eated b y dark force s in the lower astral world. They are not physical as we know ph ysical and are of a differe nt density. They have some knowledge of being a ble to lower their density, so sometimes we see them and sometimes we don’t. Another type of being that it is best to stay away from are sometimes sighted in mines in Penn sylvania, West Virginia, and at the North Pole. These are also du e to be re mov ed from the planet. They a re a form of elementals. We were told, however, that there were other elemental beings on Earth called ‘nature spirits’, which are e ntirely differe nt from the ones mentioned that are found in mines. These very positive elemental beings have to do with the c are of plant life, and are not fictional. (However, they a re not what are called the little people of Ireland .) We were told that without them, man would b e in serious trouble, and that if man believed in them, he c ould solve a lot of his food p roblems, just like they do in Findh orn, Scotland .

They called themselves the ‘Adamic’ race. They had b een on Jup iter so long that memory o f where they originally came from had been lost. The Su rvey thought that perhaps they were descendants of people who had fled from the intergalactic wars that had raged millions of years prior du ring the time of the first Galactic Empire. The Jupiterians had a v ery a dvanced society a t that time, bu t had made no a ttempts to spread out and colonize the re st of the solar system. The Galactic Survey’s mission was to locate planets that would b e suitable for MAN to inhabit. When they investiga ted Earth, they discovere d an enigma in that here , they found ALL forms of life present to be in competition with one another. Survival of the fittest seemed to prevail. Since this was not the case in all known space, this fascinated them. They studied the life forms present and made c ontact with them through the tremend ous mental powers, which they possessed. These cre atures could not tell them why these c ond itions existed. They chose an ape like cre ature and instilled them with ‘reason’ to try to help them. Then they mov ed on. Around 2,000 y ears later they returned to check on them, bu t found they had n ot evolved very much. They had learned to use cr ud e tools, bu t their mental powers had not developed as they had b een expected. The Su rvey team went back to J up iter and discussed the situation they found on Earth. The Jup iterians told them that when their ancestors first arrived in the solar system they too had considere d Earth as a planet on which to live, bu t had found the c onditions s o hostile that they decided against settling there . At the time of this visit from the Federation, colonization of Mars, Venu s, Saturn and Uranus was begun . Because Earth was so differe nt,"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"312 it was decided that only two people would b e sent to begin a colony here. A Man and Woman, volun teers, were sent to Earth. They had tremend ous mental powers. Again, MAN was present on Earth and they had children, bu t a strange thing o ccurred. The c hildren were not the mental equ als of their parents. Something strange and unexpected had happ ened. The mother planet was advised. Other volunteers were sent, bu t the same thing happ ened to their offspring. A sub-species had come about. Since they did not hav e the powers and were not the e quals of MAN (who is a physical being), they had to be c alled something different. They were called hu -man (sub -man). By this time, there were no remnants of Original Man who had come to Earth some 2 million + years earlier and had b ecome trapp ed in the ape like animal bodies which the Galactic Su rvey found on their e arlier arrival. They had b ecome un recog nizable as MAN or as having originally been from the r ace of MAN . Due to the peculiar cond itions on Earth they had totally de-evolved. It was only in the twentieth century that the discovery was made as to the c ause of the inh ibiting conditions which existed on Earth from the very beginning o f Earth’s existence. Two-million years ago they o nly knew that something was preventing life from developing normally o n Earth. Even with their mental hand icap, hu mans began a slow evolvement, and over the next 400,000 y ears bu ilt three main civilizations – Atlantis (in the Atlantic Ocean) – Lemuria (in the Pacific Ocean) and Su mer. This advancement was made primarily by the dece ndents of MAN , although they did n ot have the powers of MAN . In the meantime, trapp ed man in animal form, with reason instilled in them, continu ed to evolve along side the offspring of MAN . They were finally making progress. Then something un expected occurred. Earth was infiltrated by a race of negative beings evolved in the area of the black cloud b eyond the c onstellation of Orion.

This has happened many times, although when they were detected they were always run out of our system. Around 1,40 0,000 y ears ago they made it to Earth without being detected. Once they got within our mag netic fields, they went und etected du e to the strange conditions that existed h ere at that time. They were called Satonians, and later, after usurping control of Atlantis, called themselves Atlans. This most probably was the beginn ing o f our legends of Satan in the Garden of Eden. Their agenda was to take ov er c ontrol of Earth. They, too, had tremend ous mental powers (though n ot the e qual of MAN ), and set about controlling the mind s of the population. They bega n a “priesthood” in all three main centers of civilization with their people as priests, and used this means to control the mind s of the people. They taught each of these c ivilizations that their re ligion was the only true one and that all others were false. They wanted to create strife between them, because this would give them m ore c ontrol. When the Galactic Su rvey learned about what was happening o n Earth, they returned q uickly. They scann ed the minds of all the people on Earth, bu t they were too late. The Satonians had d one their job. The Su rvey decided to evacuate the ones who had not been contaminated, bu t un fortun ately there were only 100,000 o n the entire Earth who fell in this category. These they evacuated in one night. When the Satonians found they had b een d iscovere d and the ‘jig’ was up , they prepared to make an exit, bu t totally unexpected by the Su rvey, they didn ’t leave quietly. Instead they rapidly sent their ships around the globe un leashing horrific weapons of nu clear mass destruction b oth on Atlantis and Lemuria, as well as Su mer. The Su rvey tried to keep their craft between the Earth and the Satonian ships to protect the Earth, bu t due to the r apid action by the Satonian fleet, they managed to do a tremend ous amoun t of damage before streaking o ff t he planet in an attempt to escape. But they didn ’t get away. As they were leaving the carnage they had created, there app eared in their paths a special craft of the federation.

A flash of light from the cr aft was seen and all the Satonian ships simply disapp eared. The other craft then turned and it too was gone. The e xtreme r adiation caused b y this holocaust caused a rapid degeneration and extreme mutation to the people of Earth. The ones who escaped the destruction reverted qu ickly to savages. (According to the space information, this also caused the disapp earance of the dinosaurs, contrary to our science, which say they disapp eared sixty- five million years ago .) In addition, it brought about the Third Glacial Age. And as if this wasn’t enough, shortly thereafter, our magnetic field diminished to zero a nd reversed the mag netic poles. Mankind was aga in almost totally eradicated from the face of the Earth. Only small pockets of the population remained and these were und erground . Those who ventured to the surface were killed off by the r adiation, which p ersisted as lethal for thousands of years. This all happ ened at the e nd of the last Cosmic Treta Yuga . Cosmic Dwapara Yuga bega n around 1,296 ,000 years ago . Mankind d id get one break out of all this chaos, however. The radiation and d evastation that prece ded this era brought about a mutated human (early Sapiens), most probably from the offspring o f the second wave of MAN , that was s o favorable that it was allowed to evolve in a normal evolun tionary mann er for the most part since that time. Perhaps s cience will discover that homo-sapiens are much older than fossil records found to date, and actually co-existed n ot only with neand erthal, bu t homo-erectus as well. It could also explain why some ancient branches of the hu man species fostere d great civilizations, while other c ontemporary species were barbaric. After the Atlantean continent was destroyed, a new civilization grew on the islands that remained in the Atlantic Ocean as well as the islands in the Pacific, which was also a great continent before the destruction. Once again, MAN came among them to help them evo lve. The Satonians also put in another app earance around 60,000 b.c.e., and again caused trouble and strife.

No o ne can violate this Law as concer ns another without the ind ividual in qu estion giving his permission by o pening up to the violation. The second Law (or second distortion) is the Law of Forgetfulness. Without this Law, the catalyst for learning a nd growing would be much weaker, and our progress would b e slower. Those of Positive Polarity seek to serve others, while those of Negative Polarity seek to serve self, their agenda being to control and enslave others. These are the methods by which each Polarity progresses. The two Polarities are part of the plan of our Logos. It provides catalyst for our growth by choice throughout 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th Dimensions. There are many levels in each dimension.

When this is accomplished, 3 rd Dimensional life will return to Earth. In the meantime, those not ready for harvest from the Physical, as well as the Astral Planes, will be transferred to other areas of space/time that are expressing in the level of 3rd Dimension suitable for each ind ividual soul. Just as in the past souls have been transferre d to Earth who were not ready to g raduate on their own home worlds. There are no planets in OUR Solar System at present (other than Earth) with 3 rd Dimensional inhabitants. Perhaps this will change when Earth makes its total transition into 4 th Dimension. Perhaps Mars and Venu s are now ready to rec eive 3 rd Dimensional inhabitants once again. After all, they a re only a bout 5,000 y ears in advance of Earth at this time.

The personality that is developed while in a physical body also is not lost, it is mere ly stored in the root chakra o f the astral/soul body a s one of many that the soul experiences on its journey. The knowledge and experience of that particular personality/ego can b e called up and utilized in future lives. We are a sum total of all previous experiences. The soul, which contains the mental body (consciousness) overshadows the ph ysical body. The physical body is only a temporary housing for the soul so that it can fun ction in the physical three-dimensional world. A biological fun ctioning v ehicle is created in the physical world into which consciousness can b e transferre d. Without this transfer of consciousness the ph ysical vehicle would be nothing more than a mechanism with a motor switched off. It is the consciousness that flips the switch and activa tes the mechanism. What we call life and d eath is simply the transfer of consciousness into or out of a biological mechanism. While in the womb, soul superimposes in and around the fetus, there by breathing life into the form. When consciousness leav es the form, the ph ysical disintegrates and the soul is free d to transfer to another vehicle. It remains in the astral frequ ency un til the urge to return to the physical grows s trong. This process is what we call reincarnation. This coming a nd going continu es as long a s we feel the need to experience a physical existence. Conclusion: Birth is a transfer of consciousness into a ph ysical vehicle. Death is mere ly a transfer out of a physical vehicle to a waiting roo m. Beyond the physical, there is no death. Consciousness, held in the soul, is from the mind of the cr eator. Only the power of the Creator c an destroy the soul. Atomic e nergy is one of the powers of the cr eator. Used by man in violation of the Creator’s laws, will bring a bout the “second death” from which there is no return. The soul and all i ts experiences will be as if it never existed.

I love you - Robert This was my reply to him: Hi Son: I couldn ’t be more pleased with your re view. The book was written for intermediate metaph ysical readers. (Not necessarily for beginn ers or on the other hand for advanced metaph ysicians, although there are some advanced theories includ ed.) It was not my intention to a rgue my case and try to prove the material. The way the brothers taught us all those years was to g ive us concepts and ideas and try to make us think for ourselves. It does no goo d to present even sub stantiated factual data to someone who is not ready to rece ive it. If someone is not ready, they simply will not und erstand until they reach a certain p oint in their e volution. You’re r ight; I did p resent a lot of material in a short time. It is not a book that can be re ad one time and totally retained in the mind . A whole book could b e written on each topic c overed. (As a matter of fact, many books have been written on each topic c overed.) People who a re intere sted in this type of material read volumes on the sub jects.

As you know, I have stud ied their teachings for the last forty y ears, bu t it has only been in rece nt years that I have been able to identify their teachings as being the same in ancient writings, history a nd religions.

I do not seem to have it and I would like to v isit your site. I have always believed that the so-called ancient myths were re al facts of ancient history.

I can remember the day in 1985 when I had a ‘eureka’ about the Universal Sun, which I outlined in my book. Until I read your book I had n ever heard of this concept and I am surprised it is of ancient lore. This s entence on Page 43 intrigues me. “As our planet and its s olar system m oved farther and farther away from the Universal Sun , the source of our cre ation and existence, man on Earth sank d eeper and d eeper into darkn ess and d egradation.” Can you tell me your information source for a Universal Sun ? There is much in your book I will need to read over aga in and think about. Most of my time r ight now is going into promoting my book.
