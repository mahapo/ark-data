Kundalini yoga enhances intuitive capacities. Prabhath P is a writer , editor , integral intuitive Kundalini yoga practice should be done with the consultant, artist and spiritual healer . He is now guidance of a trained teacher . According to developing Integral Gaia Y oga. Kulwant Kaur (boulderkundalini@gmail.com), who teaches Kundalini Y oga in Boulder , CO and Los Angeles, CA, US, “Kundalini yoga is a very powerful technology that moves the Kundalini ener gy (which is coiled at the base of the spine) up to the higher centers. The third eye point is the center of intuition, and we keep our eyes closed and focused upon this point during the exercises in order to engage our intuitive sense. W ith practice, the third eye grows accustomed to staying open, and our connection grows stronger . In this practice, it is also encouraged to abstain from drinking alcohol because it closes down the third eye point.” There are many other yogic and meditative practices that strengthen intuition. Integral Gaia Y oga, which I am evolving, aims for the widening, heightening and deepening of consciousness, resulting in access to integral intuition. Earth is a living or ganism with psycho-spiritual dimensions. This Earth consciousness is called Gaia. Gaia was the Greek Earth Goddess. Intuition can be accessed through this Gaia consciousness in which humanity and all creatures of Earth are immersed. The tribals of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and birds and animals anticipated the deadly T sunami and escaped to higher land by instinctively accessing this 'Gaiafield.' © Prabhath P , all rights reserved www .envisionearth.net 04 YSR FEBRUAR Y 2008"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Intuition Network, A Thinking Allowed Inward Arc and also A wakening Intuition.

I almost wonder if there isn't perhaps like a small intuition and a lar ge intuition. The small might be the one side, just one quarter of the mind, according to the Jungian scheme. And the lar ge intuition is a more holistic sense that incorporates and synthesizes all of the human functions. That's an interesting distinction, and I think that in some ways I would relate that to the distinction I made between the intuit ion that's available through images, feelings, or the body , and the intuition that I called spiritual intuition, or what Assagioli called pure intuition, which doesn't rely on any cues at all but is simply a way of knowing which doesn't depend on sensory information. Of course in psychology most of the studies on intuition have related intuition to subliminal perception, and yet it seems evident that there are ways of knowing which transcend the five senses, and just because we can't explain it or we don't know how it happens, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. In my experience, talking to people about this topic for a number of years now , I've found that people find it encouraging and inspiring to be able to talk about their intuitive experiences in an atmosphere of acceptance.
