What does it all mean? Why am I here? What is the real purpose of my life? What will happen to me after I die? Will I return once again for another life on Earth? The solutions to these ancient myst eries are at once both Universal and timeless, having always been av ailable to mankind throughout the ages. Modern quantum physics is even now quite independently beginning to realise t he true nature of this infinite, multi-dimensional Universe of Energy and Consciousness in which we live, thus once again emphas ising there is, always has been and always will be only one ultimate reality, a Universal reality that can never be the sole cl aim of any individual, race, culture, science or religion. Over the millennia the insidious agents of creed, dogma, doctrine, national and self-interest have frequently sought, often with very considerable prejudice, hatred and violence, to suppress or destroy those who would endeavour to re veal and teach the true knowledge to mankind, thus depriving most of humanity of it s true purpose and destiny. During the last two m illennia in particular, deprived of the truth and the slave of mammon, much of humanity has steadily but surely succumbed to the increasingly detr imental effects of materialism, egocentricity, avarice, greed, prejudi ce, intolerance, discrimination and inequality, and the frenetic pac e of “modern” life in general. This has frequently resulted in wi despread misery, fear, instability, uncertainty and suffering, and a progressive moving away from The"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 13 Sources of true knowledge, and theref ore the ultimate destiny of all mankind, in turn causing people to erroneously perceive themselves as completely separat e individuals housed in a body of matter, physically separated from the Universe and from everything and everyone else in existence, o ften struggling to survive in a lonely or sometimes even hostile environment where nothing ever seems to make much sense. Many people today find themselves suffering from the debilitating effects of stress, and very often t he overwhelming feeling that their lives, reality, peace, harmony , happiness and even the most fundamental of daily needs are comp letely out of their own hands and at the mercy of other people, ci rcumstances, chance, or other intangible factors often consid ered to be far beyond their own personal control. Throughout the world we are in creasingly witnessing gross extremes of wealth and poverty, with the wealthy become progressively wealthier and the poor become progressively poorer, inevitably resulting in yet mo re stress and other psychological problems, often with feel ings of simply being unable to handle “life” anymore. During the last few decades however remarkable changes have been steadily taking place. These changes are coinciding with the very rapid rise in the popularity of the Internet and other large-scale global communications media reac hing hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. This c onvergence of factors is most assuredly no coincidence; mankind is indeed has been and increasingly moving into a new, ve ry real and pivotally important era, where Universal knowledge must and will become much more available to everyone. Today we are increasingly witnessi ng what are often considered to be “miraculous phenomena”, with peopl e from all walks of life experiencing spontaneous and sometimes even dramatic Spiritual experiences. Often following such an experience is a sincere and"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 14 dedicated seeking of true purpose, often accompanied by an overwhelming realisation that there really must be much more to “life” than the physical material world which most people still erroneously identify as “reality”. Such life changing experiences cont inue to arrive in many and varied forms and degrees, including but not limited to spontaneous Astral Projection, or “out of body experie nces”, Lucid Dreams, during near-death experiences, and very often quite simply a sudden “realisation” in the form of unmistakable inspiration or intuition received from “inner” sources. As these profound experiences become increasingly more widespread, the Internet is being used as the ideal medium with which to communicate them to ever larger numbers of people, many of whom in turn are becoming awakened to the greater levels of reality existing beyond the tem poral, physical world of matter we call the planet Earth. The conclusion of this progression of events will in all probability be realised by a long prophesied transition, a transition resulting in a globa l expansion of Consciousness encompassing all humanity, where the dogma, indoctrination and materialism of the past will eventually give way to a new direction, a direction leading to the true destiny of all mankind. Traditional sciences that have hit herto perceived the physical three dimensional Universe of matter as their only reality, are now, particularly in the field of quantum physics, rapidly arriving at the realisation that the three dimensional Universe of physical matter is but a very small component and lowe st extension of an infinitely larger, inner, interconnected and integrated reality, comprising multiple dimensions and inner states of life and “being”. Recognition is also gro wing, again especially in the field of quantum physics, that these inner dimensions of the Universe are in fact true reality, and Earth, the physical planet of matter, and indeed the entire three dimensional physical Un iverse of matter that still remains the basis of most of the sciences is but a pale reflection of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 15 the inner levels of the true realit y, Earth often being likened to a large scale illusion perceived only in accordance with the restrictions of the five physi cal senses. Quantum physics has metaphorically and most appropriately perceived the Universe as a magnificent fluid hologram known as the “holomovement”, a Universal projection of Conscious ness and Energy in the form of vibration of which everyone and ev erything in all dimensions are inseparable aspects. Science, particularly from the da ys of Newton, has generally sought to explain everything in terms of the three dimensions of physical matter when in fact these are only an extremely small subset of an infinitely greater multi-dimensio nal Universe. Science has also historically taken the view that everything, includ ing all life must have originated from matter. However, it is only when science and mankind generally begins to fully understand and accept the true nature of the infinite Universe, of all life, and of the ultimate destiny of mankind as has been consistently taught by the many cultures of the world throughout the ages, can there finally be enduring progress towards a world of peac e, plenty, harmony, health and happiness; “the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth”. In the first section of this book we will compare and contrast various sources of wisdom and knowledge fr om both the most ancient and most modern world sources. We will discuss the profound importance of this knowledge in t he context of the entire Universe, the Macrocosm, and each and ever y human being, the microcosm. We will discuss how to apply maximum ongoing benefit of this knowledge in living successfully , happily and securely with all needs fulfilled, how to progress in the inner spheres of life, and most importantly how to focus on the most sacred task and destiny of all mankind, the path of ascent as immortal Spiritual beings back to our Divine creator, the Firs t Cause, God from whence we originally came. During the course of this book we will also discuss the many dimensions of existence and rea lity beyond the th ree dimensional material world often known as “p lanes”, “realms” or “spheres”, both"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 16 from the perspective of the ancient wisdoms and of modern quantum physics. We will consider t he nature of the many beings and intelligences inhabi ting these realms including human beings, and of the great Universal laws prev ailing. We will also discuss the significance of each of our own individual lives, and the process occurring after each physical “death”. We will discover why people return to Earth time and again in inner planes of reality including deceased friends and relatives. We will finally discuss how you c an maintain absolute control over your own life, how to manifest into your life anythi ng and everything that you truly need and desire, how to create for yourself the life you have only dreamed of, how to heal yourself and others, and how to protect yourself and loved ones from dark psychic influences. Finally, and most import antly we will discover the true nature of, and how to live with the most powerful force in the entire Universe; Unconditional Love.

These senses are us ually and quite understandably accepted beyond question as the only source of sensory feedback for everyday existence in what is commonly believed to be “reality”. This is true to such an extent in fact that unless something tangibly conforms to one or more of the fi ve physical senses it is usually deemed not to exist at all, or mi ght simply be considered to be an “illusion” or perhaps simply a “figment of the imagination”. To most people the only notable ex ception to any extra-sensory existence is the perception of the “G od” or Gods of the va rious world religions and belief systems, gener ally accepted by most people without question as existing beyond the perc eption of the five physical senses. Accordingly, belief in su ch a God or Gods has become a complete act of faith, maintained only by the orthodox religions of the world. Religions endeavour to teach their congregations how to live their lives and worship their particular G od or Gods in accordance with a “belief system”, often based upon the teachings of their various “books” or bibles. At the same time , a wholly materialistic outlook of the world often causes people to th ink and live from an exclusively materialistic perspective, in tu rn resulting in a sense of “separateness” from the Univer se and indeed from each other. These factors in turn cause many people to place their primary emphasis on temporal, material objects as if they are all that is meaningful in life. As a consequence the mission of the many is to gather as many such materi al and monetary possessions as possible during the course of what is generally perceived to be an only “life”, very often in order to increase perceived levels of comfort and wealth, and, urged on by the influence of the ego to “keep up appearances” among peers, friends, neighbours, work friends, relatives and others. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 19 This situation has contributed in no small degree to the state of the world as we witness it today, with a gross imbalance existing between those who have vastly more than they could ever genuinely need for daily purposes, and those unfortunate people who have little or nothing, often having to exist each and every day in abject misery and suffering as if it were their last. With this sad state of affairs, today we often see a world where greed, dishonesty, avarice, hate and sometimes violence exists side by side with fear, poverty and suffering. For a very long time the entire world has been in the grip of a major imbalance, an imbalance that has not only been escalating over the decades but indeed now threatens t he entire immediate future of humanity and indeed the entire planet. Mankind is directly responsible for this state of affairs, bought about by the gross misuse of the very freewill granted by our Creator. A ccordingly only mankind can now reverse this situation and bring about a state of harmony, peace, happiness and balance for everyone, the “kingdom of heaven on Earth”. Although the true natur e of the Universe has been known and taught throughout the ages by many and varied sources throughout the world, all of which are hi ghly consistent and in broad agreement, it is also now being substantiated by the work of modern quantum physics, and increas ingly by other branches of the sciences as well. All areas of the sciences will surely soon have to accept the fact that true Univer sal reality is not and never can be based entirely in the familiar three-dimensional world of physical matter as has been assumed since t he days of Isaac Newton, but is rather an infinite, multi-dimensional reality, a Universe of living Consciousness of which everyone and everything without exception is an integral and equal aspect. The true nature of the Universe will certainly challenge the perceptions of most people, if for no other reason that throughout the ages there has been a prevalent misperception of a “God” who is completely separate from everyone and everything else in existence, and who “rules” over “his” three dimensional world of matter from high places."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 20 Mankind has always perceived the three dimensional Universe, and in particular the physical world of ma tter as “reality”. It will surely be equally evident to most people however that beyond the perceptions of the five physical senses there must surely be a much more substantial reality. Throughout time mankind has contemplated and attempted to define the nature of this substantial reality. Often substantial reality has been considered to be the three dimensional planet on which we live. In other cases substantial reality has been identified by, and attributed to the name of a deity or deities. But however manki nd considers its own particular concept of substantia l reality of one thing most everyone agrees; such a substantial reality certainly exists beyond the limitations of a world perceived only by t he five physical senses. Over the course of many thousands of years, from the dawn of intelligent man, the reality of the Universe has been taught throughout the world by a variety of Beings who’s mission it is to teach these matters mankind. T hese Beings range from highly advanced Spiritual intelli gences of the inner spher es of life, to great Masters, often ascended human beings who have from time to time have incarnated on Earth in order to teach mankind the Universal truths and direction required for every human being to fulfil their ultimate destiny as immortal Spir itual beings travelling the sacred path back to our prime Creator, to God. These ageless teachings, knowledge and wisdoms have been taught to many students and teac hers over the ages, who’s sacred task it has been in turn to bring thes e eternal truths and realities to the human race, that true purpose and destiny might be fulfilled. Many such students and teachers have remained in relative obscurity, steadily teaching thos e who would u nderstand and in turn influence others, in such places and in such ways as to avoid the persecution. Some of the greatest of these teachers did become very well- known and performed an invaluable service to humanity, alas"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 21 however over the millennia t hese teachings have often been drastically distorted and misunder stood, and in some cases even became the basis for orthodox, dogmatic religions. Fortunately however the truth is both one an d eternal, and over the course of thousands of years has survived in cultures throughout the world where it still lives on today, ready to finally reach a much wider section of the human race, ultima tely resulting in a global expansion of Consciousness wher e true purpose and destiny will be an integral aspect of the lives of everyone. Following is a comparison of some of the better known and more widely available sources of wisdom and knowledge originating from a diverse range of Eastern and Western cultures. These comparisons will surely highlight the profound consistency of their respective teachings, which in tu rn are now being substantiated in the field of modern quantum physics.  "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 22 Chapter 2: Definition of God Before reviewing the wisdoms of t he world the word “God” needs to be defined. During the course of this book the word “God” will be used frequently. It is most important to note from the very outset however that in usi ng the word “God” we are not in any way referring to the deity as personified and worshipped by many orthodox religions such as Christianity. The Universal God has numerous names in accordance with individual cultures a nd the way Universal tr uths are taught to followers. God has been frequently over the ages, and indeed today most appropriately referred to as; The Universe, The Source, The First Cause, The Ether, The Ak asha, The One, The All, Spirit, The Great Spirit, The Prime Creator, and by many other names. Again, this is the Universal aspec t of God Who exists, has always existed and always will exist beyond the temporal confines of space and time, the same God of which we are all integral aspects each having our own existence in th e Mind of God as individuated, immortal, Spiritual beings, the ve ry same God who is in every single one of us and we in God. Throughout this book I will principally refer to “God “ by three different names: The Source : Everything in the Universe, all Energy, vibration and life flows from The Source. Everythi ng in the Universe is an integral aspect of, and an expression of The Source. Nothing can exist outside of, or separate to The Source. The Source is at once omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresen t. The Source is everything that Is. The First Cause : The Source Energy is the First Cause of everything in the Univer se. Everything in the Universe was and still is being created by The First Cause. It was The First Cause that brought the entire Universe into Being within The Infinite Mind of The Source. The Source is The Firs t Cause, the Primary Creator in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 23 the Universe, The Macrocosm. We human beings, as expressions of The First Cause, made in the true Spiritual Image of The First Cause are co-creators within t he Universe, we are therefore secondary creators or causes wit hin our local Universe, the Microcosm, realities we create with the power of our Minds just as The First Cause creates the ultimate reality within the infinite Mind of The First Cause. God: God is The Source and The First Cause. God is a name that, although subject over the ages to creed and dogma and often even personified in a human form, is nev ertheless a name that almost everyone in the world can relate to as the Supreme Being in the Universe, and is therefore a name t hat is entirely appropriate in that context, in a Universal, non dogmatic form.  "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 24 Chapter 3: Hinduism For many thousands of years the far-East has been a very rich source of Universal practice, wisdom and knowledge, especially within the countries and cultures of India, China and Tibet, which have given rise to many philo sophies and pseudo-religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. There are also many variations and sub-traditions with in these main traditions, the overall message however remaining totally consistent throughout. Hinduism is one of the worlds oldest religions if indeed can be properly called a religion. Indeed, Hinduism cannot even be correctly referred to as a single philosophy, encompassing as it does a very wide diversity comprisi ng numerous different social and pseudo-religious philosophies, cults and sects, although all ultimately originating from a comm on origin. These in turn involve equally numerous, diverse and colour ful rituals, ceremonies and Spiritual practices. Hinduism has three main names; “Sanatana Dharma”, meaning “eternal religion”, “Vaidika Dharma” meaning “religion of the Vedas” and of cour se “Hindu” itself, the absolute origin of which is not precisely known. One theory as to the origin of th e name “Hindu” is a derivation from an ancient inscription that has been translated as meaning: the country lying between the Himalayan mountain and Bindu Sarovara, known as Hindusthan by combination of the first letter 'Hi' of 'Himalaya' and the last compound letter “ndu” of the word “Bindu”. Bindu Sarovara is called the Cape Comorin sea in modern times. The origins of Hinduism trace back to the Indus Valley civilisation dated at between 4000 and 2200 BCE Note: “BCE” is an acronym for “Before the Common Era”, previously known as “BC” or “before Christ”. Among the most sacred of all Hindu texts are the “Vedas”, the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. Rig Veda, also known as Rigveda is the oldest work, having been originally"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 25 composed around 1 500 BCE and written around 600 BCE. The Vedas contain hymns, incantations and rituals from ancient India. Another group of impor tant primary texts are the Upanishads. These are a continuation of the Vedic philosophy and were written between 800 and 400 BCE. The Upanishads expand upon how the Soul, Atman, can be united with the ultimate truth, Brahman, through contemplation and meditation as well as through the law of karma. The Mahabharata were writt en around 540 to 300 BCE and have been attributed to the sage Vyasa. They record \"the legends of the Bharatas”, one of the Aryan tribal groups. A nother very important and well-known work is the Bhagavad Gita, which is the sixth book of the Mahabharata. The “Gita” is a long and highly colourful poem describing a conversa tion between the warrio r Arjuna and the God Krishna. It is an ancient text that has become central to Hinduism and other belief systems. Another important text is the Ra mayana, a love story with moral and Spiritual themes. The Ramayana is dated to the first century CE and has been attributed to the poet Valmiki. Other important texts in the Hindu culture include the Brahmanas, the Sutras, and the Aranyakas. Although Hinduism contains many different variations and practices according to its various component traditions and regions, there are nevertheless very important Spiritual principles central to Hinduism and its various levels of teac hings. These principles are encompassed by a collection of works known as the “Vedas” which were written by a number of ancient sages known as “Vedic seers”. There are four separate Vedas, t he oldest of which is the “Rig Veda”. The Vedas are written in ancient Sanskrit, the sacred language of India, and are consider ed to be the very highest source of religious authority for most branches of Hinduism. The Vedas comprise several sections co mposed between 150 0 BCE and 500"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 26 BCE. The most ancient components of the Vedas consist of sacred hymns and prayers. Later additi ons to the Vedas include rituals associated with Vedic hymns and t he final part is the Upanishads which have formed the most important basis of the Sp iritual aspect of Hinduism and in particular of the Hindu concepts of Universal reality. Most Hindus learned their traditi ons through a wide variety of stories and plays which served to t each them the very basis of what they need to know ab out the Universe and the nature and destiny of themselves in an entertainin g, enjoyable and understandable way. Some of these stories a nd plays are massive epics still forming the basis of Hindu teachi ngs for the majority today. The Bhagavad Gita is one of these, wh ich as mentioned previously, is based around an exchange between the Hindu God Krishna and the warrior “Arjuna”, and is depict ed by an elabor ate and colourful story, ultimately describing the battle of human nature and his battle for enlightenment, the truth. The basis for the teachings of Krishna is ultimately identical to that of similar teachings from around the world, and is completely in accordance and agreement with Un iversal knowledge and wisdom of the ages as taught by almost all world traditions, and ultimately with the principles of quantum physics. Krishna teaches that everything around us and ever ything happening around us are actually all manifestations of the same one and only ultimate reality. In Hinduism this ultimate reality is called “Brahman” and is exactly the same as “The One”, “The All”, Sp irit, “everything that is”, and in the West might be regarded as t he true definition of “God”. Brahman, Universal Con sciousness, considered to be the ultimate reality, is infinite, exists beyond the five physical senses and is incomprehensible. Most ancient wisdoms of the wo rld teach that human beings are “God” in the microcosm, immortal Spirits “made” in the “true image of God”. Hinduism teaches the sa me principle in the form of"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 27 “Atman” which is equivalent to the human Soul. The Hindu culture teaches Atman and Brahman, the indi vidual reality and the ultimate reality are one. This once again comp letely affirms ultimate reality as known and recognised by many other sources of the wisdom and knowledge of the ages which teaches the microcosm, human beings, and the Macrocosm, “God” are one, and everything in the entire Universe is an inseparable as pect of everything else; there is no separateness. The Upanishads affirm this most succinctly thus: “ That which is the finest essence – this whole world has that as its Soul. That is reality. That is Atman. That art though ”. These truths are taught to the masses of followers of the Hindu traditions in the form of elabor ate stories and plays in which Brahman is a great magician who uses his magical powers to transform himself into the world. In the Rig Veda this is the original meaning of “maya”. Maya does not simply imply “illusion” as is commonly believed and often stated, but rather in this context means “power” and “might”. Hinduism therefore views the world as an ever changing and fluid manifest ation of the powerful magic of Brahman, where nothing ever stands still and everything is in a constant state of motion; this is the real meaning of “maya”. This is also exactly the same as the Un iversal principle of “rhythm” as taught within the ancient wisdom of the West and which we will discuss in more depth later in this book. Another aspect of Brahman is “k arma” which literally means “action” which is also an aspect of the important prin ciple taught by the wisdom of the West; that of “Cause and Effect”. These both teach the truth that the entire Universe is always in a constant state of movement and action, and ev erything in the Universe is dynamically and eternally connect ed with everything else. Karma, in accordance with the Hindu teac hings, represents the ultimate force of creation, The Source of al l life. The concept and definition of karma has also been associated with a more fundamental"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 28 meaning which is widely applied at a personal level; specifically the accumulation and equilibration of good and bad, or positive and negative actions in life, which actions can carry over into multiple lives. This sort of reduction of meani ng also applies to “maya” which again has been reduced from its or iginal Universal meaning as applies to the Macrocosm, to t he more personal level of the microcosm. When taken together, ma ya and karma teach that while people usually perceive themselves and everything else in the Universe as being totally separate from themselves, accordingly causing people to behave independent ly of each other rather than being as one with everything, p eople will always be subject to, and be bound by the causes and effects of karma and reincarnation. Only when people finally realise comp lete unity with the Universe in all of its aspects, and to live in total harmony with Universe and thereby never being the cause of bad effects, can people be freed from the bonds of karma, and ultima tely the cycle of reincarnation. The Bhagavad Gita states the truism of the incorrect view of most people relative to the Universe in the following statement: “A ll actions take place in time by the interweaving of the forces of nature, but the man lost in self-delusion thinks that he himself is the actor. But the man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, sees how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of nature and becomes not their slave ”. This is a profound statement indeed, quite simply meaning that all mankind is an integral part of nature, of the Universe, of The All, of God, and accordingly must always st rive to work in perfect harmony with the Universe as an integral and inseparable aspect. This is as opposed to working against the Univ erse by perceiving a state of separateness, thereby perceiving t he Universe as an adversary only to be conquered for selfish, material, egocentric purposes. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 29 The importance of these lessons are such that only those who realise and know beyond all doubt t hat the Universe, The All, God, Brahman within exists beyond t he five physical senses, and accordingly lives in total selfless harmony with the Universe thus realising Spirit withi n, can realise true per sonal peace and harmony while journeying the sacred path back to our Divine creator, The First Cause, God. There are many paths leading back to our God. The Universe and therefore God does not formally rec ognise any particular religion, methods or concepts, but rather always operates in complete, immutable, perfect harmony in accordance with teachings of Hinduism and other Eastern cultures , as well as, as we will see later, with those taught by the ancient knowledge of the West. The principle of Cause and Effect is particularly apparent in true individual progress; each effect achi eved in the direction of true progress along the path being direct ly related to a preceding cause as to how the preceding progress was achieved. Ultimately all requirements for progress are t he same, only the methodology and individual approach differs accord ing to the teachings of the particular tradition or individual Spiritual path being followed. Many Hindu’s still appr oach Brahman by means of the mediation of a large number of separate individua l deities all serving to provide followers with a point of focus, inspiration and understanding. The most popular such deities th rough which Hindu’s approach Brahman are Shiva, Vis hnu and the Divine Mot her. It can be noted that this approach to the Divine is very similar indeed to the various pagan traditions of the western world where numerous deities in for example Roman, Greek and Celtic pantheons are all ultimately considered to be equal aspects of “The One”, and therefore of the Universe. Also, particularly in pagan traditions, “The One” is approached through the mediation of both male deities and female deities, all of which are ultimately considered to be both the male and female aspects of The One, of God. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 30 This is in stark cont rast indeed to the po pular dogmatic orthodox religions of the West that erro neously consider a single deity, usually known as “God”, to be totally separate, above and beyond everything and everyone else. Both The Hindu and pagan approac hes to God or Brahman fully agree with the principle of gender in accordance with the teachings of the ancient wisdom of the West as we will see later in this section. Hindu deities are not considered to be separate from The All as is the case with the Christi an God for example, but are rather all considered to be equal and integral aspects of the one Universal Divinity known as Brahman. Shiva is one of the oldest of the Hindu Gods and is seen by his followers in many different an d diverse forms, each of which ultimately represents a different as pect of the ultimate Divinity of Brahman. When Shiva appears as the fullest aspect of the Divinity of Brahman he is known as “Mahesva ra” or “the Great Lord”. One of the most celebrated aspects of Shiva is his appearance in the form of the “Cosmic Dancer” known as “Nataraja”, who is the God of creation and destruction through his dance as the eternal rhythm of the Universe. This once again can be likened to the teaching of the Universal principle of rhythm of the ancient Western Universal knowledge. It is apparent theref ore the deities of the Hindu tradition, as followed by millions of people, are at the final analysis quite simply another means of teaching the immutable principles of the Universe through artistic rather than intellectual or philosophical means. The absolute meanings and im portance of both methods of teaching are identical therefore, and only vary in accordance with each tradition. Hinduism additionally has a strong philosophical and intellectual approach to Universal truths and r ealities, most notably through a Spiritual tradition known as “V edanta”, which is based upon the “Upanishads”. Vedanta is one of the world’s oldest religious philosophies and also one of t he broadest. Vedanta is based upon the “Vedas” which are the sacred scr iptures of India, affirming the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 31 oneness of all existence, the Divin ity of the Soul and harmony of everything in existence in the Universe. Although Vedanta is the philosophical school of Hinduism, it is Univer sal in its application and is equally relevant to all c ountries, cultures and backgrounds. The word “Vedanta” is a combinati on of two words, “Veda” meaning knowledge and “anta” which means “the objective of”. In this context Vedanta is not, in and of it self a search for knowledge in absolute terms, but is rather the search for self-realisation, and therefore ultimately of Brahman. Brahman according to Vedanta is the infinite existence, the infinite Consciousness and the infinite bliss, which is exactly the same pr inciple as the Mental Universe of the teachings of the ancient wisdom of the Western world. The term given to this impers onal transcendent reality in accordance with Vedanta is agai n Brahman, the very same Brahman therefore as is approac hed by most Hindus through the mediation and form of deities such as Shiva, Vishnu and the Divine Mother. An extremely im portant aspect of Vedanta is the truth that Brahman dwells in the hearts of people as the Divine self, or “Atman”, the ultimate reality be ing Atman and Brah man are one. Atman is the human Spirit, was never born, will never die, and is therefore immortal. In western terms, Spirit, or Atm an, was created in the true image of God, Brahman. Atman in His/Her pur est form is not subject to any human failings or of the fluctuati ons of the body or Mind, or is subject to grief, despair or ignoranc e. Atman at the purest is free from all limitations. The ultimate obj ective therefore for all paths in accordance with Vedanta, and indeed Universally, is to fully realise Atman within as Brahman. Vedanta most importantly also teaches that the only objective of all human life as manifested in the physical world is to realise and therefore manifest Divinity in a ccordance with the re ality that the true nature of all human beings is Divine, and realisation of the Divine, Brahman is our birt hright. This again is totally in accordance with the teachings of the age-old tr aditions of both the East and the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 32 West which teach that sooner or later every single person, after many lives and subsequent progre ss through the inner spheres of reality will ultimately m anifest Divinity, for the greatest truth in the Universe is the Divine nature of man. Vedanta also teaches there is ultimately only one truth, and ultimately all religions, philoso phies and traditions are indeed related to each other, all teaching the true nature of the ultimate reality. Many thousands of year s ago, long before the days of the beginnings of Christianity, t he Rig Veda stated an extremely profound reality; “ Truth is one, sages call it by various names ”. The unity of all Universal existence is one of the c entral themes of Vedanta, and like most world Spirit ual traditions have for many thousand of years taught exactly t he same realities in different ways according to the cultures and peoples. The Vedanta says that the Divinity at the very core of our Being is the very same Divinity that illumines the sun, the moon and the stars. There is no place in the Univer se where we as human beings, infinite in nature, do not exist. In accordance with the teachings of Vedanta, and indeed all true Spir itual traditions, oneness quite literally means oneness with ever ything and everyone, from the very smallest atom, molecule and sub-atomic particle to the quantum level, through mi cro-organisms, through all animal life and through all human beings, no matter how much the ego might think they might despise anot her person or life form. This is the epitome of Unconditional Love, which quite literally is truly “unconditional”. The self wit hin you, Atman, is exactly the same Self within everyone and ever ything else, no matter whether the “you” happens to be a Saint, a dog, a fly, a tree or a co-worker who the ego might find to be particularly irritating or obnoxious. As affirmed by Isha Upanishad, “ The self is everywhere . Whoever sees all beings in the Self, and t he Self in all Be ings hates none. For one who sees oneness everywher e, how can there be delusion or grief? ”. These are indeed most pr ofound words, and ones which"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 33 equally apply to every human being as immortal, Divine inseparable aspects of God, “made” in the “true image of God”. These same truths have alwa ys been taught down through the ages, throughout both the East a nd the West. Vedanta goes on to teach the profound truth that all f ear and misery arises from the sense of separation from the Universe. “ There is fear from the second ” stated the Brihadaranyaka Upan ishad. The second refers to “duality” which is the sense of separation from the rest of creation, but which is always a misperception since it implies something exists other than Brahman. There can be and is no other. The Self is the essence of the Universe, the essence of all Souls as is aptly affirmed by the Upanishads thus: “You are at one with t he Universe. He who says he is different from others, even by a hairs breadth, immediately becomes miserable. Happiness bel ongs to him who knows this oneness, who knows he is one with the Universe.” Hinduism is an ancient and very diverse culture approached by honouring many different deities by means of song, dance and ritual, and by the philosophy of the Vedanta; ultimate Universal reality in the form of Brahman and t he reality of the personal Soul in the form of Atman. All Hindu tradi tions teach the same ultimate reality; Atman and Br ahman, God and the human Soul and Spirit are one. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 34 Chapter 4: Taoism Tao is another great culture of th e Orient, based around the nature and destiny of mankind and of the Universe. Taoism teaches its followers how to progress in life, and evolve as immortal aspects of the Divine. Taoism fundamentally teaches, as with other ancient wisdoms the world, that there is an ultimate reality, the basis for everything and everyone in the Universe . The Tao can be approximately translated as meani ng “the path” or “the way”, and refers specifically to a power enveloping, surrounding and flowing through all things, living and non-liv ing alike. The Tao regulates natural processes, nourishing balance in the Universe, and embodies the harmony of opposites. The founder of Taoism is be lieved to have been Lao-Tse, 604-531 BCE, a contemporary of Confuciu s. Lao-Tse was searching for a way to end the constant tribal wa rfare and disharmony prevalent at the time. Taoism, along with Confuciani sm and Buddhism, became one of the three main traditions of Chi na. With the end of the Ch’ing dynasty in 1911, official state support for Taiosm came to an end and much of the Tao herita ge was destroyed. When the communists came to power in Chi na in 1949, religi ous freedom of all types was severely curtailed. The communist government was particularly hard on Taoism, putting Tao monks to manual labour, confiscating ancient temples, and plundering the Tao heritage. Several million Taoist monks we re reduced to a number of around fifty thousand by 1960. During the cultural revolution of 1966 to 1976, much of the remaining Taoi st heritage was destroyed by the communist government. This was in total a typical example of a government who would deny the truth of life and the Universe to its own people for no other reason t han self-interests and control. Later Deng Xiao-Ping did restore some leniency towards Taosim and other ancient traditions."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 35 Throughout the world Taosim curr ently has around twenty million followers, and has had, and continues to have a very significant impact on the culture of North America, particula rly in the areas of acupuncture, herbalism, holistic medicine, meditation and the martial arts. After the decimation of the ancient Tao culture by the communist government of China, Taoism is now making a large and increasing comeback at a time when it is be coming particularly important once again, not only to the people of China but also to many other countries throughout the world. Like other ancient traditions of the East and West Taoism is an extrem ely important source of wisdom, knowledge and teachings which ultimately no tyranny or suppression can destroy or withhol d. The truth must and will always prevail, always being available to mankind, and lik e other sources of truth and wisdom Tao survived an d will continue to survive and become stronger once again. Taoism teaches that Tao is the First Cause of the Universe. Consistent with all teac hings of the ancient k nowledge of the East and the West, it is the ultimate and most sacred objective of the followers of Taoism to become one with the Tao. A very well-known Taoist symbol is “Yin-Yang” whic h represents the balance of the opposites in the Universe. W hen Yin and Yang are equal and balanced, all is calm and harmoni ous. When either Yin or Yang becomes dominant then confusion and disarray are the inevitable result. Yin-Yang can be considered to be the same as the principle of gender as taught by the wisdom of the West as we will see later. Yin represents the aspects of the feminine, being soft, cool, calm, introspective and healing, Yang representing the aspects of the masculine being hard, hot, energet ic, moving and sometimes aggressive. However, as nothing in nature is completely positive or negative, the Yin-Yang symbol recogni ses this reality by including a small black spot in the white swir l and a corresponding white spot in the black swirl of the symbol. Yin and Yang are ultimately considered to the opposing forces for nature in which humans can involve themselves, and in so doi ng upset the balance of nature, a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 36 principle including every aspect of nature from the individual human being, the microcosm, to the ent ire Universe, the Macrocosm. Huai Nan Tzu, a philosopher of around the second century BCE said: “ He who conforms to the course of the Tao, follo wing the natural processes of Heaven and Earth, fi nds it easy to manage the whole world ”. These are certainly profound words indeed, and a reality of which everyone should endeavour to fully understand the significance. It literally means “going with the flow” of life ra ther than striving to oppose it. Most people today tend to force thei r life in the direction their ego, conscious and subconscious Minds insi st it should go. This in turn creates ongoing imbalances in the Universe that can escalate until the life of people who appr oach life in this way will be severely and negatively impacted. The entire Universe, from the very highest down to the physical world of matter is in a perpetual state of harmony and balance; anyone affecting that inherent ha rmony and balance will be surely subject to the Universal princi ple of Cause and Effect whereby personal harmony will become unbalanced; these issues will be discussed in much more detail later in this book. Living for the present moment, going with the flow of life, is often known as “going with the Tao”. Be ing in complete harmony with the Universe means in turn enjoyi ng a harmonious life. It becomes easier to manifest anything you need into your life by always living in the present moment, and with t he natural and immutable flow of the Universe, the Tao. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 37 Chapter 5: Buddhism Buddhism has become widespread throughout many Asian countries including India, China, Tibet, Nepal, Korea, Japan and Sri Lanka, as well as many countries in the western world where there is an increasing Buddhist follo wing. There are currently approximately three h undred million people fo llowing the Buddhist tradition in its various forms. The title “Buddha” derives from t he word “budhi” which means “ to awaken”. The “awakening” to which this refers is a Spiritual awakening whereby practitioners seek enlightenment, the “Buddha within”, which is analogous to discovering the truth that the Universe, God is within everyone . The person who became known as the Buddha, Siddart ha Gautama, achieved full awakening or enlightenment at t he age of thirty five years old. As with many enlightened tradition s Buddhism transcends the title of a mere religion, no t being dogmatic or or thodox in its teachings and with no rigid doctrines. Like Hin duism, Buddhism is more of a philosophy and indeed a way of life to the many of the hundreds of thousands of people practicing it t oday. Philosophy means “love of wisdom”, and the Buddhist philos ophy broadly embraces the need to live a moral life, to be Mindf ul and aware of all thoughts and actions at all times and to develop Universal wisdom and understanding. Notwithstanding be ing born into a royal fam ily with all the wealth he could possibly need, Siddartha Gautam a realised himself at the age of twenty nine years that wealth and luxury did no t guarantee, and was not a route to ultimate h appiness. After several years of dedicated searching and meditati on Siddartha Gautama finally discovered the middle path and wa s enlightened, after which he devoted the remainder of his life to teaching the principles of Buddhism, known as the “Dhamma” or “truth”, until his death at the age of eighty."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 38 Although there are many variations and tradit ions of Buddhism, the central focus is always to teach t he word of real truth. Buddhism is based upon four noble truths and the eightfold path. The four noble truths may be summarised as follows: The first noble truth: teaches that to most people life is suffering, including pain, disease and untimel y death. Suffering also includes loneliness, fear, frustration, disappointment and anger. Buddhism teaches how all of these problem s are due to the way people live, and how to avoid them. The second noble truth: states t hat suffering is due to craving and aversion. It teaches that people will suffer if they expect others to conform to their expectations. This noble truth also teaches that wanting deprives people of contentment and happiness due to always striving for more and more material gain and possessions over others. A lifetim e of craving and want ing, especially the craving to want to continue to ex ist in the current physical body, creates a powerful Energy in which people become trapped, and ultimately the result after passing is to be reborn once again in order to learn the lessons failed to be learned in the previous life. The third noble truth: states th at suffering can be overcome and happiness attained. This noble truth teaches the reality that if all useless craving and desires are se t aside, and each day is lived one at a time not dwelling on the past or an imagined future, then you will be set free and attain happi ness and contentment providing at the same for more time to hel p others. This is a condition known as “Nirvana”. The fourth noble truth: st ates that the “Eightfold Path” is the path that leads to the end of suffering. The Noble Eightfold Path consists of eight principles that may be summarised as follows: "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 39 First: “Samma-Ditthi”: complete or perfect vision. The vision of the true nature of rea lity and the path of transformation. Second: “Samma-Sankappa”: perfected emotion or aspiration. This is to maintain rightful thinking a nd attitude, liberating emotionality and acting from love or compassion. Third: “Samma-Vaca”: perfected or whole speech. Clear, truthful, uplifting and non-harmful communication. Fourth: Samma-Kammanta: integral action. An ethical foundation for life based upon the principle of non- exploitation of self or others. Fifth: “Samma-Ajiva”: proper liv elihood. Based upon correct action and ethical principles of non-exploita tion. This is the basis for the ideal society. Sixth: “Samma-Vayama”: complete or full effort, Energy or vitality. Consciously directing life Energy to the transformative path of creative and healing action, thus fostering wholeness. This is conscious evolution. Seventh: “Samma-Sati”: complete or thorough awareness, also called “right Mindfulness”. Levels of awareness and Mindfulness of everything, oneself, feelings, thought, people and reality. Eighth: “Samma-Samhadi”: full, in tegral holistic “oneness” with The Source or The All. This includ es concentration, meditation, and single pointedness of Mi nd, and the progressive establishment of the whole being into the many le vels of conscious awareness. Note, the word “Samma” means whol e, perfect, integral complete, thorough. The importance of the four noble truths and the eightfold path simply cannot be under-estimated, not only for those practicing Buddhism but indeed for anyone who genuinely desires to make true progress during this life, future lives, and most importantly"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 40 within the inner spheres of rea lity, our true home as immortal Spiritual beings on the path back to our Creator, The Source, God. In other cultures and traditions thes e principles might have different names and be taught in di fferent ways, but all ul timately lead in the same direction towards ennoblement, realisation of true Spiritual nature and ongoing progress in the Light on the path back to God. Although Buddhism is more of a philosophy than a religion, its ultimate objective is to teac h the way to enlightenment, a full realisation of self and of the whole Universe, “everything that is”. The four noble truths and eightfo ld path are the ways the Buddha put forward to achieve this based upon his own years of strenuous and arduous efforts, finally achiev ing his ultimate objective which now forms the basis of B uddhism throughout the world. In addition to the teaching and rea lisation of enlight enment through the four noble truths and eightfo ld path, Buddhism also fully recognises the “holistic” nature of the Universe being to all intents and purposes identical to that recognised and taught by the wisdom and traditions of the West, and indeed also of modern quantum physics. Buddhism teaches the “wholeness” of everything in the Universe including all life, and the methods by which to become as one with the wholeness. This is t he ultimate aim of enlightenment; once enlightenment has been achieved there are no longer any doubts whatsoever as to the true natur e of the Universe or of true purpose, and the ultimate realit y and destiny of all mankind. The Buddhist is acutely aware of the existence and nature of karma and of the continuous cycle of birth and re-birth known as “reincarnation”, all of which are discu ssed in more depth later in this book. It will become the life’s work of a Buddhist to transcend both karma and the cycle of reincarnation. By comparison with the wisdoms of the West and of Hinduism, and indeed quantum physics, Buddhism does not endeavour to teach the very nature of the Universe in depth or at a philosophical level, these are instead taken for granted as truisms to be ultimately to be"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 41 discovered by those who achiev e “Buddahood”, and therefore left to the dedicated follower of the Buddhist tradition to discover for himself by way of enlightenment or “Nirvana”. Buddhism does however teach three important Universal characteristics, namely the c haracteristics of impermanence (Anitya), of suffering (Dhukha), and “not-self” (Anatama), which are taught as always present in, or are connected to existence, and hence teach of the true nat ure of all existence. Like the wisdom of the ages of both West and the East, Buddhists fully recognise Unconditional Love as the most powerful force in the Universe, and accordingly, uncondi tional compassion and love for everything and everyone, known as “metta or “loving kindness”, are fundamental tenets of Buddhism.  "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 42 Chapter 6: The Wisdom of the West Over the millennia there have been many very great teachers of the wisdom and knowledge of the Universe, and of the true purpose and destiny of mankind, some of whom have remained in relative obscurity and others who became ve ry widely known, some even becoming legendary or the basis of ma jor, orthodox world religions. It was never the intention of course of these great teachers to become the focal point of such dogm atic, orthodox religions, or to be responsible for the indoctrination of millions of people, but rather to be the messengers of pure Un iversal truth and knowledge. Indeed it is a most unfortunate yet true fact that the creation of certain religions and their a ssociated creeds and dogmas have resulted in exactly the opposite of the intentions of the great Masters and teachers of the past. Universal knowledge has been available since long before the beginnings of the great world civ ilisations of the Middle East, and elsewhere. The knowledge was known to most ancient civilisations of the world, which for the most part are no longer visible due to apparent environmental cataclysms or the actions of man. These in turn provided future civilisations with the sacred kn owledge, that mankind should continue to fulfil its true destiny. It is generally recognised that the seat of the ancient knowledge and wisdom in the western world, the Occident, was set in ancient Egypt long, long ago; long before even before the first pyramids were constructed. The greatest of all teachers of t he time, and in the opinion of many ever sinc e, was a man known as Hermes Trismegistus who dwelt in ancient Egypt many thousands of years ago; thousands of years before Christianity and the other modern world religions ever came into being. Hermes was widely known and respected as the “Master of Masters” and the teacher of teachers such was his influence and greatness. People came from all over the world, from both the West and the East to learn Universal truths, knowledge an d wisdom directly from Hermes"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 43 himself, and accordingly much of the ancient wis dom of both the East and the West originated directly from this great man. The life work of Hermes seems to have been dedicated to the sowing of the seeds of truth regarding t he true nature of the Universe and of mankind, that they might grow, flourish and multiply over the coming millenn ia, handed down from generation to generation of teachers and students. As decades, centuries and millenni a passed, the words, wisdom and teachings of Hermes and other great Masters were kept alive throughout the western world by word of mouth and writings which were kept safe from those who w ould seek to destroy the truth. Hermes was later deified and beca me known as “Thoth”; Hermes himself being considered the mess enger of the Gods carrying his vital messages to humanity. Hermes when depicted as a God is pictured with wings attached to the sides of his helmet. Also at around the same time ther e were other contemporary great and ancient civilisations possessing the true knowledge, and which were almost certainly in direct and frequent comm unication with the civilisations of ancient Egypt. These ancient, and in many ways advanced civilisations were lost to the visible world many thousand of years ago, although some evidence still remains as to their former existence today, much more evidence will almost certainly be discovered in the future. During the years of Hermes th e wisdom and knowledge of the Universe, and of the Spiritual na ture and destiny of mankind was taught far and wide, having a most profound influence on many diverse civilisations and cultures of the time. And so it was until thousands of years later that t he advent of orthodox religions sought to destroy those who were in possession of true knowledge so vital to humanity. They did no t succeed, however there followed many dark centuries where the creed, dogma and oppression of orthodox religions became prev alent, and the ancient wisdom was"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 44 closely guarded and kept safe by the few until such time came once again for it to be made availabl e for the benefit of mankind. Of course, Hermes Trismegistus was by no means the only teacher of Universal knowledge over the mi llennia. Other great civilisations of the western world before, during and after the time of Hermes were also in possession of, and taught these ancient truths. Such great civilisations existed in central and south America including the Inca, Toltec and Maya, and in the Middle East the Assyrian, Sumerian, Anatolian and Babylonian civilisations of Mesopotamia, all of whom knew or were taught the anci ent wisdom and knowledge still existing today. Among other, and now lost and legendary civilisa tions who were in possession of, and could apparently apply Universal knowledge to great effect, include the lost legendary continent of Atlantis, evidence of which is now beginni ng to emerge from the Atlantic Ocean in various forms, and Lemuria, also known as Mu, which was widely thought to have existed in the area of the Pacific Ocean around Easter Island, the home of the famous giant statues. Many firmly believe the Atlanteans were in direct contact with the ancient civilisations of both the Americas and the Middle East, and indeed in support of this, artefacts including ancient writings in the form of glyphs have been found which link all of these great ancient civilisations together. Both Atlantis and Lemuria were thought to have been destroyed by major globa l cataclysms causing them to very suddenly sink beneath the ocean; many believe this is the basis for the Old Testament account of the great flood. It is highly probable that evidence of these ancient and long lost civilisations will soon be discover ed in abundance, at which time considerably more will be known of their cultures and links to ancient Egypt and other ancient civi lisations of the world. Many ancient teachings from a diverse range of western sources have thankfully survived to this day, having been closely guarded, maintained and taught over the millennia, and are no w being taught"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 45 more widely as the influence and pow er of the orthodox churches diminishes. All known knowledge and wisdom of the West is understandably totally consistent, and is epitom ised by the legacy and teachings originating in ancient Egypt at th e time of Hermes Trismegistus. All of the knowledge an d wisdom handed down thr oughout the ages is totally applicable to everything known about the nature of the Universe in all of its spheres of life and reality, and which fully explains everything taken for gran ted during everyday life, and also those things which most peopl e either regard as miracles, supernatural, paranormal, occult or m ystical, as well as many other “phenomena” which most people are simply not yet aware of. According to the ancient teaching s of the West, the Occident, the true nature of the Universe is described by seven fundamental principles by which everything in the Universe functions and can therefore be explained; these are the princi ples of Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity , Rhythm, Cause and Effect and Gender. All of these principles at their most complex are highly involved, and would require an ent ire book to discuss and analyse in detail. However, t he fundamental characteristics of each of these principles and their profound importance to everyone and everything within the entire Univ erse can be summarised in the following seven chapters on these im portant Universal principles. "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 46 Chapter 7: The Principle of Mentalism This principle embodies the reality that the entire Universe is an infinite living Mind and Consciousness of which everything and everyone is integral aspect and has there Being. Everything in the Universe in all of its dimensi ons or spheres therefore has its existence within the infinite livin g Mind, and which living Mind in turn might truly be called “God”, The First Cause, The Source Energy. This principle fully explains and accounts for all of the “phenomena” which people regard as “miracl es” or “supernatural” such as psychic powers, telepathy, telekinesis and many others. This principle of Mentalism also expl ains the true nature of Energy, power and matter, and why these ar e ultimately under the control of, and subordinate to the power of the Mind. Mentalism, infinite living Mind, explains why as hum ans made in the “true image of God” we can create ment ally in the microcosm just as God created the entire Universe, the Macrocosm.  "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 47 Chapter 8: The Principle of Correspondence This is another extrem ely important Universal principle, teaching the truth that there is direct correspondence between all of the planes of reality. As we will discu ss later in this book, the material world of matter is but the very lo west plane or dimension of an infinite Universe of inner, ever more subtle planes of increasing vibration, Energy and decreasing relative density. Everything in the entire Universe without exception is subject to order, otherwise there would be chaos and the Universe would collapse in an instant. This order is prevalent between all of the great planes of life whereby anyth ing occurring in one plane has in turn to be reflected in all pl anes in exactly the same degree. The Principle of Correspondence is most aptly represented by the famous axiom “as above, so below”. The principle of correspondence is also one basis fo r true Magic. We should note that by “Magic” we do not m ean the tricks performed by the so called stage magicians, prestidigita tors, illusionists and the like, but rather Magic in its truest and highest form, the name Magic being given by the Magi themselves. In true Magic, the Magician utilises Universal laws with focus, intent and Energy in order to First Cause something to manifest in a in ner sphere of reality, and which subsequently, in accordance with the principle of correspondence has in turn to manifest in the phy sical world in acco rdance with the objectives of the Magician. This is also the exact same prin ciple applying to manifestation by imagination including creative vis ualisation, to be discussed in depth later in this book. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 48 Chapter 9: The Principle of Vibration This is another extremely important Universal law, and one we will gain discuss in detail later in this book. The basis of this principle is that everything in the Universe is constantly in motion; nothing ever rests for a single moment. Vibration is in fact exactly the same as Energy, a fact which quantum ph ysics is now rapidly coming to realise and accept as being the f undamental basis of the Universe. The principle of vibration also ex plains the differences between all manifestations of matter, Ener gy, and Spirit, all of which are ultimately pure vibration, or Ener gy. Everything therefore from the highest aspect of God, pure Spirit, the very highest manifestation of vibration, all the way down to the world of matter are all ultimately degrees and manifestations of vibr ation or Energy, all within the Mind of God.  "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 49 Chapter 10: The Principle of Polarity This principle teaches the truth that everythi ng in the Universe is dual, in other words has two poles. This principle also proves there are no absolutes in nature; for ex ample when people refer to “hot” or “cold”, these are not absolut es, and what is actually being referred to are degrees of hot ness and degrees of coldness. There are therefore no extremes but rather only degrees of the same thing. North and South, East and West are merely degrees of direction. Similarly light and dark are only degrees of the same concept, the question being where would light begin and darkness end? The same principle applies to large and small, black and white, hard and soft, noise and qui et, high and low, positive and negative and so on. Another example are the concepts of “love” and “hate”, which again are only degrees of the same emoti on, with “like” and dislike” being within these two parameters. T here can be no absolute love or absolute hate, and the concepts of t hese two polarities will also vary in accordance with the percept ions of different individuals; something one person might “hate” might well be “loved” by the next person. This particular exam ple of the principle of polarity highlights the possibility for ment al transmutation, also known as “Alchemy”, whereby the hate of some-thing can be transmuted to the love of the same thing with transmutation taking place along the same polar axis. Similarly bad or negative attributes of the Soul or Spirit can be transmuted along the same axis to their corresponding good or positive attributes. The principle of polarity and therefore alchemy is therefore extremely im portant in the process of the ennoblement and perfection of every human bei ng on the sacred path back to God. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 50 Chapter 11: The Principle of Rhythm This principle encompasses the trut h that in everything there is always action and reaction taking place along the same axis of polarity. A pendulum swings from side to side, the tides of the seas ebb and flow, and on a much wider scale we witness the rise and fall of entire organisations and even nations. All of these are examples of the Universal principl e of rhythm. The entire Universe and everything and everyone within it are all subject to the principle of rhythm from the very highest to the very lowest aspects.   "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 51 Chapter 12: The Principle of Cause and Effect This principle, also known as “Causation”, is another extremely important Universal law, some would say the most important and exalted law, and one affecting ev eryone profoundly. Causation will be discussed in much more detail later in this book. The principle of Cause and Effe ct is based upon the truth that nothing in the entire Universe ev er happens by chance. There can be no such concept as “chance”, ev erything happening resulting in an “effect”, always being associated with a preceding and directly corresponding “cause”; there are and can never be any exceptions to this principle. The vast majo rity of people progress through life completely oblivious to this ex alted Universal law, ascribing everything happening to them to su ch notions as chance, luck or fortune. One of the most important aspects of Causation is karma. Karma is extremely important to everyone, and will be discussed in much more detail later in this book.  "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 52 Chapter 13:The Principle of Gender This principle embodies the truth that everything in the Universe has both masculine and feminine princi ples; this not only applies to humans, animals or other life wher e it manifests in the physical world, but to everything in creation. The principle of gender constant ly works in the direction of generation, regeneration and creat ion. Every male element includes an aspect of the female element, and likewise every female element contains a degree of male element; this is again is in full accordance with the laws of polarity where there can be no absolute male or absolute female, but rather only relative degrees of “maleness” and “femaleness”. Everything in the Universe manifests gender to such degrees as to render them predominantly male or female; this principle a gain applies to everything from the very highest aspects of the Universe to the very lowest aspects. As we will discuss later in this book , all of these Universal principles are vitally important and integral to the harmony of the Universe in all dimensions, and are accordingly integral aspects of the most important truth which everyone should know and thoroughly understand; everyone and everything in the Universe is an equal and integral aspect of God, The Al l, The Source, and therefore of each other. There is no separateness in the Universe whatsoever which brings us to the most import ant truth of all, a truth which has been taught by all civilisations throughout the ages; the truth that every single person without except ion is an immortal Spiritual being, a true son or daughter of God. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 53 Chapter 14: The Emerald Tablet of Hermes The Emerald Tablet of Hermes is an extremely important and very ancient text, documenting by m eans of an inscription on a green stone tablet the nature of the Universe, and ho w the Universe came into being. Although the tablet is “emerald” it is thought to actually be a green stone such as jade. The Emerald Tablet was originally thought to have been discovered by a person named “Balinas”, who subsequently wrote down the entire text as inscribed on the stone in the ancient Syriac language from which it has since been subsequently translated by several people in various different languages. The Emerald Tablet is not only very important from the point of view of describing the process of cr eation and the nature of the Universe, a process that is fully supported by many other independent sources including incr easingly quantum physics, but is also the basis of Alchemy which, contrary to popular belief, is not necessarily the transmutation of base metals into Gold as legend presumes, but rather refers to the ennoblement of the Soul and Spirit on the path of perfection. Following is the 12 th century Latin literal tr anslation of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes: “ True without falsehood, certain most certain What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like that which is above. To make t he miracle of the one thing. And as all things were made from the contemplation of The One, so all things were born again from one adaptation. It’s Father is the Sun, its Mother is the Moon. The Wind carried it in its womb, the Earth breastfed it. It is the Father of all wor ks of wonder in the World. It’s power is complete. If cast to Earth, it will separate Eart h from Fire, the subtle from the gross."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 54 With great capacity it ascends fr om Earth to Heaven. Again it descends to Earth, and takes back the power of the above and below. Thus you will receive the glory of the distinctiveness of the World. All obscurity will flee from you. This is the whole most strong st rength of all strength, for it overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates all solid things. Thus the World was created. From this comes marvellous adaptations of which this is the procedure. Therefore I am called Hermes Thrice Crowned, because I have three parts of the wisdo m of the whole World. And complete is what I had to say about the work of the Sun. These are most profound and important words, which, although written with highly symbolic mean ing can be explained as follows: “ True without falsehood, certain most certain” : The text of the Emeral d Tablet starts by a ffirming that everything that follows is Universally true and accurate, and applies to “everything that is” without any exception. “ What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like that which is above. To make the miracle of the one thing”: This statement affirms the entire Univ erse in all spheres of reality is not separate in any way whatsoever, but is rather a continuum from the very highest aspect of “The One”, “The Source”, the “First Cause”, down to the physical worl d of matter. This phrase also affirms the continuum of the Un iverse is equally effective and integral in all directions, abov e and below, below and above, all working in complete harmony as an inseparable aspect of the whole. This is in accordanc e with the Universal Law of Correspondence. The word “miracle” does not mean miracle in absolute terms, but rather worki ng in complete harmony with the Universe, the results of which mi ght well seem like miracles at"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 55 times, but rather are in absolute terms the application and workings of immutable Universal laws. “ And as all things were made from the contemplation of The One, so all things were born again from one adaptation.” This again is a most important statement affirming the entire Universe is a “Mind world” from which everything originated, and is held entirely within the infinite Mi nd of “The One”, of God. It also affirms the entire Universe was cr eated by the contemplation, or meditation of “The One”, and is therefore a projection of, and contained entirely within the Mind of “The One”. This statement also confirms theref ore everything in the Universe is an integral aspect of everything else in the Universe and therefore of “The One”, all mirroring the power of, and following the power of “The One” by adaptation of the pr ocess of following “The One”. “ It’s Father is the Sun, its Mother is the Moon.” This is analogous to th e creative process whereby the sperm of the father seeks the egg of the mother , the constant cycles of the Sun and the Moon representing the rhythm of the Universe and infinite creation. “ The Wind carried it in its womb, the Earth breastfed it ”: In this statement, “wind” is analogous to the Universal as opposed to the physical element of Air, which is the mediator of the Universal elements of Fire and Wate r. Wind or Air as a mediation of Fire and Water therefore represent s the forces involved behind the process of creation, ultimately resulting in the final Universal element of Earth in the creati on process; Earth representing solidification. Earth nourishes the creation thereby providing for independent form and existence as can be clearly witnessed by the presence of the physical world of matter. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 56 “ It is the Father of all wo rks of wonder in the World” : Father represents the Prime Creator, The One, The All, the First Cause, the Quintessence of the f our elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth, the Ether, often known as “God” from Whom the aforementioned processes originated. It is particularly important to note this statement also confirms the creative process was carried out by “The One” as an act of full, ultimate, infinite Consciousness awareness within the Mind of The One, within which all the Universe ex ists as infinite living Mind and Consciousness. “It’s power is complete. If cast to Earth, it will s eparate Earth from Fire, the subtle from the gross” : This affirms the power of Consci ousness of The One is absolutely complete in every aspect. It goes on to say the forces involved, Fire, Air, Water and Earth which or iginally acted in a “downwards” manner thus creating the Universe in all of its spheres commencing from the highest aspect of The One, eventually reach the lowest levels, the physical world of matter whereupon there is a reversal of the forces involved back once again towards The One. This results in a separation of force from form, thus leaving in place the physical aspect of the Universe in the form of solidification, whereby the Fire of creation is separated from the solidification of the Earth, thereby separating the “subtle”, the inne r worlds, the Astral and Mental planes from the “gross”, the physical Universe of matter so familiar to everyone. It should also be noted that while the Emer ald Tablet and sources generally talk in terms of “hig her” and “lower”, The Source, The First Cause, God is at the very c entre of all creation, the innermost Source of Energy, while the physi cal space-time bound reality, the material Universe is the oute rmost Energy level forming the “epidermis” of the Universe. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 57 “ With great capacity it ascends fr om Earth to Heaven. Again it descends to Earth, and takes back the power of the above and below. ” This tells us that conscious awareness of The One releases itself from the solid aspect of Earth, the physical Universe, and returns upwards once again through the cont inuum of vibration, Energy, back towards the highest aspect of The One, The Source, sometimes known as the “Godhead” from whence it originated. As this process occurs, Con sciousness brings with it the experience of “capacity” or “wisdo m”. This is also analogous to the destiny of mankind in the micr ocosm whereby each new individual experiencing a first ever life in the physical Universe is a direct result of the original descent from the Logos, The Source, God of a “spark” of Spirit, an aspect of G od, which will then unite with a human embryo resulting in a new, individual life, the beginning of an individual, immortal Spiritual being. It is important to note that Spirit has always existed in the “Eternal Now” but does not become an “i ndividual” or “i ndividuated” with physical, Astral and Mental bodies until the time of the very first physical incarnation. The destiny of every single per son therefore, as with the very process of creation itself, is to first descend to the Earth and then to rise again back to the highest aspect of The One, our Divine creator, during th e process of ennoblement and perfection; the ultima te meaning of life. This statement then goes on to tell us that the powers, the Consciousness of The One then desc ended a second time to Earth integrating all aspects “above and below”, thus finally resulting in a fully aware force infinitely uniting the “above” with the “below” as integral aspects of the continuum of the entire Universe, from the very highest to the physical world. “ Thus you will receive the glory of the distinctiveness of the World. All obscurity will flee from you ”:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 58 This confirms that as a result of the processes thus involved, with force descending into form during t he original act of creation, and form then acting upon itself with Consciousness once again ascending into a formless state. Finally the force thus self-realized once again descends back into form in which to consciously express its Self, thereby receiving the “glory of the distinctiveness of the World”, and thus receiving the Light (distinctiveness) whereby t he dark (obscurity) will be expelled; “flee from you”. “ This is the whole most strong st rength of all strength, for it overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates all solid things ”: This confirms that through the act of creation as previously described, the Consciousness of T he One is “whole”, complete and of infinite strength, and with the abi lity to work without restriction in all directions of the continuum of the Universe from above to the below and below to the above at any level of density and vibration, and in particular the power to surpass any “upwards” travelling entity. This statement also affirms t hat this infinite power is similarly unrestricted in the downward moti on towards the physical Universe, whereby it can inhabit the lowest vibration and the highest density of matter. This also confirms the truth that The One, God exists in everything and everyone, and accord ingly everything and everyone in the Universe is pure conscious awareness, often known as Spirit. “ Thus the World was created” : This confirms by this process of force descending into form thus realising self-awareness, follow ed by another cycle of creation, followed by a further descent into fo rm, this eventually results in the physical “world”, or more specifica lly the entire physical Universe of matter in the space-time reality. It should be noted that science only recognises the physical aspect of the creation of the Universe, often known as the “big bang”, but is as yet largely unaware of the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 59 Divine forces of infinite and ulti mate Consciousness involved that started this entire creative proc ess; the very highest and most incomprehensible aspect of all, The One, God. “From this comes marvellous adapt ations of which this is the procedure ”: The “marvellous adaptations” refe rred to here is the physical Universe of matter, the physical World known to everyone that is indeed a marvellous adaptation of The One. It should be noted that beyond the physical Universe everythi ng consists of subtle Energy in the form of vibration, and physical matter simply does not exist. Therefore by comparison the physical Universe is indeed “marvellous adaptations”. David Bohm, eminent physicist, very aptly describes the physical Un iverse as “frozen light”. Everything and everyone in the Un iverse, including the physical Universe, contains the Light of The One, the physica l Universe thus created becoming the seed of the futu re ultimate self of The One, and thus the creative act. Human beings and all other life within the physical Universe must work while in physical form within the physical world of matter as mirrored powers of the “one thing”, causing “marvellous adaptations” as opposed to the “miracles of the “one thing”. Working within the physical worl d of matter humans therefore “adapt” the physical world, or Un iverse, and which adaptations are mirrored ultimately as an aspect of the “one thing”. Physical Consciousness, or awar eness, or Spirit of the human being is an example of “force” within the “form” of the human body, with which we develop the future se lf by the process of perfection and ennoblement as it ascends t he Divine path back to the Prime Creator from whence Spirit first came. “ Therefore I am called Hermes Thrice Crowned, because I have three parts of the wisdo m of the whole World ”:"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 60 This statement is not intended to be a self-proclamation of greatness on the part of Hermes but rather represents the trinity of the levels or aspects of the cont inuum of the Universe; physical, Astral and Mental. This specifically refers to the physical, Astral and Mental levels of Energy, of vibr ation within the continuum of the Universe and the corresponding bodies within each human being, specifically the physical body, the Astral Body also known as the Soul, and Mental Body also known as the immortal Spirit. The final part of the statement affirms that this is a Universal level of knowledge or experience. “ And complete is what I had to say about the work of the Sun” : This final statement affirms the testimony of Hermes as to the creation and true nature of the Universe. Hermes Trismegistus, Hermes the Thrice Crowned, was indeed a true symbolic “messenger of the Gods”, of the advanced Spiritual beings of the inner spheres of reality, in br inging this most sacred knowledge from the inner spheres for the benefit of all mankind. “The work of the Sun” affirms that this is a ll an ongoing and active process within the glorious continuum of the Un iverse, the “Sun” representing the Divine creative process.  "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 61 Chapter 15: The Kabbalah Kabbalah is a philosophy and tradition originating in ancient Judaism, long before the beginni ngs of Christianity and the orthodox churches. It is an important western source of Universal wisdom and principles based upon age-old knowled ge originating from intelligences of the inner spheres of life and reality. Kabbalah can be highly complex, but at its most basic level it represents the wisdom to realise the Divine within. The Kabbalah sometimes refers to t he “inner dimensions of reality”, which are in fact exactly the same as the “i nner dimensions of reality”. When viewed from a Universal perspect ive, the physical world of matter with its lowest vibrat ions and highest density is the outermost aspect of the Universe, analogous to an “outer skin”, an “epidermis”, and God is the innermos t, at the centre of all creation existing at the very highest vibrat ion and lowest density of all. Divine Energy radiate outwards pervading the whole Universe. Kabbalah most importantly teaches that in order to move inwards closer towards God, The Source, it is first necessary to understand the stages and nature of the continuum of creation of Universal reality. This commences with an understanding of how all creation originally occurred, and continues to take place within the “Eternal Now” of the infinite mental Universe of Consciousness, Consciousness and vibration, of which we are all integral aspects. In the beginning there was only “The Source”, God, the “Eternal Now” existing beyond all space and time. The book of “Genesis I” symbolically and mystically chronicl es the creation and formation of the Universe in the beginning, a process which is also documented in another related holy text kn own as the “Sephir Yetzirah”, the “Book of Formation”. This w hole process of creation was symbolically put into motion by those well-known words “let there be light”, “fiat lux”. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 62 It should be mentioned that when ancient texts refer to “The Word”, “in the beginning was The Word, and the word was with God, and the word was God”, this does not mean a spoken word as commonly understood by pe ople by way of communicating by word of mouth. “The Word” is actually a conscious act of creation on the part of God, involving the issuing fo rth of vibrations in the form of colour, sound and other Divine manifestations of vibration, most of which are beyond the comprehensio n of humans living in the physical world, and resulting in highly complex Energy patterns forming the basis of all creation. The entire continuum of the Univ erse is vibration and therefore Energy. Nothing exists outside of Energy. Creation is an ongoing and infinite process, always involv ing vibration, Energy, the very fabric of the entire Un iverse. The Source, God is pure Energy, often known as “Spirit”, and everything in the Universe. “The All” is therefore ultimately pure Energy , existing as an aspect of, and emanation from within the infinite Mind of The All, The Source, of God. Judaism originated with Abraham who devoted his entire life to realising God within himself. Duri ng the course of his life many secrets of creation were made know n to him by the intelligences of the inner spheres of rea lity, and therefore ulti mately from God. The very first and most important wo rk of the Kabbalah, the Sephir Yetzirah, the Book of Formation, is attributed to Adam himself. The basis of the philosophy of K abbalah, the method in which it teaches its Divine wisdom, is to describe and explain symbolically the 32 paths of wisdom, all of wh ich are symbolic aspects of the ultimate act of creation. Thes e 32 paths are based around an important symbolic structure know n as “The Tree of Life”, which directly represents all of the inner spheres of reality from the Astral worlds to The Source, The Firs t Cause, God, from where all creation commenced and continues. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 63 The Tree of Life consists of ten “Sefirot” which are considered to be “Divine lights” acting as consci ous channels of creation, and the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. These together symbolically represent the “building blocks” of creation, permutations of which are used by God to create the entire continuum of the Universe of Energy. Kabbalah has a long and conti nuous tradition and philosophy spanning the millennia, and which did not suffer from the constant and often self-serving biased retr anslation and reinterpretation as with other popular religious books or bibles. Around 100 CE Rabbi Sh imon Bar Yochai was granted permission from intelligences of the inner spheres to reveal, discuss and teach the complexities of th e Kabbalah. This result ed in a work known as the “Sefer Hazohar”, the “Zohar”, the “Book of Brilliance”. Over one thousand years later anot her famous Rabbi, Yitzach Luria, discovered, while deeply study ing the Zohar, that there were even more inner dimensions to the Kabbalah that were not immediately apparent within the Zohar . This resulted in the great works of the Arizal, which explains the complexities of the interplay between all of the factors involved in the act of creation, and the secrets and purpose of the Soul. These mysteries are discussed in considerable depth in the texts of the Arizal. Two hundred years later a person by the name of Ba’al Shem Tov also known as “Besht” revealed yet another totally new and much deeper aspect of the Kabba lah. This resulted in the “Kabbalah of the Besht”, also k nown as “Chassidut”. The great importance and significance of Besht is to not only focus on the various stages of creation, but to also bring into the focus the individual Soul and Spir it, the ultimate Divi ne Light of God, the same primordial Divine light as has always been present before, during and after all creation, and which Divine light will always be omnipresent in the Universe, being infinite and eternal. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 64 The ultimate meaning of Kabbal ah is exactly the same as the ultimate meaning of the knowledge and teachings all of the worlds great cultures of both the West and of the Eas t; specifically that each and every human being as an i mmortal Spirit, made in the true image of God, is an equal partner in the creative process of the Universe, as God in the microcosm. This is in full accordance with quantum physics, and conforms to all known Universal Laws, and in particular the law of Cause and Effect. The ultimate destiny of ever y human being is to achieve the opportunity of re-unity with God through the process of ennoblement, perfection and the full realisation of God within. The “true image of God” does not, as widely believed imply God has a human form after which everyone is fashioned, but rather means the immortal Spirit. As we will discuss in depth later in this book, everyone should know the absolute truth that we all cr eate our own reality, no one else creates our individual realities for us. Whatever we are as individuals is precisely what we have created for ourselves, our own reality, a reality t hat is not fixed, is in finitely fluid and can always be influenced in the desired di rection in order to achieve anything we truly need or desire. As we will see later in this book, the central importance of this principle simply cannot be understated. It should once again be noted the word “God” is not the same meaning as “God” in the orthodox, dogmatic religious sense, but rather the representati on of the Ultimate Divinity, The Source, The One, The All, The All in All, The First Cause, The Prime Creator, Spirit, The Primordial Light, Ever ything that Is, and the numerous other names by which the cultur es of the world approach the Divine. In Judaism and therefore Kabbalah, the true name of God is said to be only known by a very few, and must never be spoken. The true,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 65 ineffable name of God is ther efore often represented by four ancient Hebrew letters, together known as the “Tetragrammaton”. The letters of the Tetragrammat on, originating from ancient Hebrew, are “YHVH”, sometimes written “IHVH”, pronounced “Yod, Heh, Vahv, Heh” or “Yud, Heh, Vavh, Heh”. Judaism generally avoids writing down any name of God lest it be later treated with disrespect in any way. In Judaism and Kabbalah God therefore has many alternative names, for example “Adonai” which literally means “Lord”. When writing down the word “God”, Judaism usually represents this word in written form as “G-d”, again so the written word cannot la ter be altered or treated with disrespect. The “Tree of Life” of the Kabbalah consists of a total of eleven “Sefirot” or “kingdoms” often know n in Kabbalah as “vessels”, each of which represents a connected c hannel of Divine Energy. From a symbolic perspective each Sefirot is also analogous to a particular attribute. There is usually considered to be ten Sefirot, as “Keter” and “Da’at” are considered to be the same, each representing a different dimension of the same God force. The Sefirot, together with their respective analogous attributes are as follows, descending from the highest to the lowest: “Keter”; Crown; is the first and the highest of the ten Sefirot, and corresponds to the super-conscious realm of experience. Keter is represented by a crown repr esenting an aura around the Consciousness. Chochmah; Wisdom; is the first pow er of conscious intellect within Creation. Binah; Understanding; is the sec ond power of conscious intellect within Creation. Da’at; Knowledge; is the third and final power of conscious intellect within Creation."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 66 Chesed; Loving Kindness; is the firs t of the emotive attributes within Creation. Gevurah; Might; is the second of the emotive attributes within Creation. Tipharet; Beauty; is the third emotive attribute within Creation. Netzach; Victory; is the fourth emotive attr ibute within Creation. Hod; Splendour; is the fifth of t he emotive attribut es with Creation. Yesod; Foundation; is the sixth of the emotive attributes within Creation. Malkut; Kingdom; is the seventh and final emotive attribute within Creation. Sequentially from Keter down to Malkut the Sefirot together represent the various stages of the creative process of the Universe, whereby God generated from the very core of His/Her own Being the progression of creat ed realms culminating in the infinite Universe. Note; this is exactly the same process as independently described by the Emerald Tablet of Hermes. It is and is also the true solution to the origin of the “big bang” as sought by astronomers and astrophysicist s, except for the fact that the origin of all creation, The Source, is Divine, and the physical Universe rather than originating within the confines of the three dimensional Universe as current ly supposed by science, actually originated beyond all space-time in the very highest dimension of God, The Source, The First Cause. According to the Kaballah, The primordial Light of God progressively manifested dow n through sequentially lower dimensions, levels of Energy, vibr ation, analogous to the realms of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 67 the ten Sefirot, until finally achievi ng material density in the form of the physical Universe, as the rate of Energy, vibration, became low enough to manifest in the form of physical matter. Again, Quantum physicist David Bohm most appr opriately described the physical Universe of matter as “frozen light”. The interaction between the ten Sefi rot, realms or dimensions of reality is depicted in the Kabbalistic tree of life by a network of connecting channels or “tzinorot”, wh ich serve to illustrate the flow of Divine Energy. Following is a short descrip tion of the meaning of each of the ten Sefirot. It should be noted that the Tree of Life and all it represents is extremely complex, and could easily be the subject matter of an entire large book. Each Sefirot of the Kabbalah consists of both an external as well as an internal dimension of realit y. The external dimension is associated with its function in the process of creation. The internal dimension is associated with the hidden “motivational force” inspiring the activity of that parti cular Sefirot of creation, and serves to describe how it manifests in the individual Soul. “Chassidut therefore describes the inspirational force behind each Sefirot while the individual names of the Sefiro t describes the Divine effect of each of these individual powers upon creation. The Kabbalah also describes t he actual stages of the entire Creative process, beginning with the very highest, The Source, God, the primordial Light, all the way down to the physical world of matter. These stages can be summarised as follows: Or Ein Sof: “God’s infinite Light”. The ten stages of God’s Infinite Light. Sod Ha’Tzimtzum: “The secret of Contraction”. The three stages of the secret of Contract ion, the “removal” of God’s infinite Light. "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 68 Adam Kadmon: “Primordial M an”. The two stages of Adam Kadmon. God’s specific will and plan to em anate the Worlds, the Lights emanating from Adam Kadmon. Akudim, Nekudim, Brudim: “Binding, Points, Connection”. The tree stages of “vessels” originating from the lights t hat emanated from Adam Kadmon. Keter D’Azilut: “The Crown of Emanat ion”. The eight stages of the rectification process of the World of Atzilut, beginning with the rectification of it’s Crown. Olam Ha’Atzilut: “The World of Emanation”. Ten stages of the World of Atzilut, the exclusive Consciousness of Divine unity. Worlds of ABiYA: Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiya. Four stages, which emerge out of the infi nite Light of God. The last of these, the Worlds of AbiYA; Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiya, are extremely import ant in the understanding of the mechanism of all creation from the perspective of K abbalah. Atzilut is the world of Emanati on, Beriah is the world of Creation, Yetzirah is the world of Formation and Asiy ah the world of Action. All of these emanate from the Div ine, primordial Light of God, the Prime Creator, the First Cause, result ing in the sequential process of creation, ultimately culminating in the Astral worlds and the physical Universe as is known to science and mankind generally. Again it is important to note t hat this sequence of events, the creation of the multi-di mensional Universe, is exactly the same as that detailed completely independently by the words of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes. The detail behind each of these stages of all Creation would justify a complete book in its own right, but suffice it to say that the foregoing does give a very compr ehensive overview of the creation of the Universe in accordance with the Kabbalah."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 69 Notwithstanding the Hebrew names and descriptions which are necessarily used, the description of the creation and nature of the Universe in accordance with the Kabba lah is still also completely in accordance with other world wisdom s and knowledge of the ages, but like the wisdom of other cult ures is simply expressed and documented in such a way as is appr opriate to the particular culture or tradition. Ultimately however there is only one truth, and which truth has been known and taught to mankind throughout the world since time immemorial, and the Kabbalah does, without doubt support most other ancient works orig inating in the inner spheres in detailing the origins a nd nature of the entire continuum and glory of the multi-dimensi onal Universe, in all of its spheres or planes of reality from the very highest of T he Source, The First Cause, God, down to the world of matte r, the physical Universe.  "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 70 Chapter 16: The Wisdom of Quantum Physics From the second half of the seventeenth century until the very late nineteenth century, the mechanistic model of the Universe, largely in accordance with the work and theories of Isaac Newton, dominated most scientific thought and direction, and in particular the various branches of physics. This Newtonian view of the Universe was accompanied by t he general and popular orthodox concept of an archetypal, patriar chal God, Who is completely separate from the Universe, ruling from above by t he imposition of Divine laws in accordance with th e various world religions and their books or bibles. It is this strictly inflexible, mech anistic, three dimensional view of the Universe, a very popular and c onvenient view of everything, that suited the concepts and aspirations of most people very well indeed, and which accordingly comp letely dominated all scientific thought until the early tw entieth century, and indeed still dominates scientific thought even today. The Newtonian model of the Univ erse and the popular perception of “God” was indeed so convenient for all branches of science, religion and for the population at la rge, to challenge it was largely unthinkable; the popular consensus bei ng if it appears to work it is best to leave it well alone. Over two centuries of such thought has unsurprisingly and progressively resulted in the prin ciples of most sciences through to today being rooted firmly in t he Newtonian three dimensional, mechanistic model of t he Universe and its fu nctions, which became the basis and driving force behind all scientific thought. Many areas of science, even now in this early twenty first century, still think exclusively in terms of atoms, molecules and perhaps sub-atomic particles as forming the basis of solid three dimensional matter, which in turn is generally believed to constitute the physical world and physical Universe so familiar to everyone, and as is perceived and experienced by means of the five physical senses."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 71 The first three decades of the tw entieth century began to witness radical challenges to the hitherto traditional basis of science. Two emergent theories, those of relati vity and atomic physics began to shatter the traditional Newtonian vi ew, and therefore the basis for the prevailing scientific view of the Universe. The fundamental concepts of absolute space and ti me, of solid particles, and the causal nature of physical p henomenon could no longer be sustained by the new emergent theories of physics, and in particular those of one particular man, Albert Einstein. In 1905 Einstein published two articles, one of which was his special theory of relativity, and the other, most significantly, was a new way of looking at electromagnet ic radiation, which was most importantly a pre-cursor to what would become the quantum theory, ultimately arrived at twenty years later by a team of physicists. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, space is not three dimensional and time is not a s eparate entity, both of which are extremely important realisations , and also unbeknown at the time confirms the true nature of the Un iverse as has always been known and taught throughout the ages. Einstein postulated th at both space and time are connected by a fourth dimensional continuum know n as “space-time”. Accordingly space and time could no longer be considered to be separate from each other as was previously commonly believed in accordance with the then well established Ne wtonian concepts of absolute space and absolute time. The theory of relativity arrives at the extremely impor tant realisation that mass is a form of Energy. A gain, this realisation is in full agreement with the wisdom of the ages, which has always taught that the Universe in all of its dim ensions, or spheres is in fact pure Energy, or more specifically Ener gy in the form of vibration at progressive degrees originat ing from The Source, and progressively descending down to the physical world of matter."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 72 During the early part of the twentieth century scientists were observing atoms as they were a ffected as a result of being bombarded with x-rays. This in turn led to another famous scientist, Ernest Rutherford, bombarding at oms with alpha-particles which led to the then astounding discovery that rather than being solid, as traditionally believed, atoms were in fact comprised of vast regions of space in which extremely small particles known as electrons moved around the centre of t he atom, the nucleus, bound by forces. Soon after the discovery of this “planetary model” of the atom, it was further discovered that the number of electrons in the atoms of an element determined the chemical properties of the element. This later became the basis for the periodi c table of elements as is still used today in modern chemistry. It also came to be understood how interactions between atoms resulted in chemical reactions fo rming molecules and therefore the many chemical compounds known to science today. This resulted, very significantly and importantly in the realisation that the principles of chemistry could be entirely explained in terms of the laws of atomic physics. It would la ter also become apparent, as the ancient wisdoms of the world hav e always taught that matter, whether in a form which is readily apparent to the five physical senses, or in the form of molecule s, atoms or sub- atomic particles, is at the final analysis ultimate ly pure Energy in the form of vibration, the very same vibrati on of which every one and everything in the entire Univer se in all spheres are an integral and inseparable aspect, integral and inseparable aspects of the very highest vibration and manifestat ion of Energy of all God, The Source, The First Cause. In the 1920’s an international group of scientists came together to progress these discoveries. This eminent team incl uded Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenburg, Paul Dirac, Erwin Schrodinger, Wolfgang Pauli and Louis de Broglie. This group of dist inguished scientists worked"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 73 together on the then emergent field of the exploration of sub-atomic particles. The work of these physicists in th e area of sub-atomic particles was faced with paradox after paradox as t hey came to realise from their experiments that nothing could be ex plained in terms of traditional physics. The real breakthrough eventually came when they eventually set aside their traditio nal knowledge and way of thinking, and viewed these recently discovered phenomena in a completely new way. As Werner Heisenburg sa id, “they somehow got into the Spirit of the quantum theory”. These revelations initially came as quite a shock to these distinguished scientists because t he concepts of quantum theory were not at all easy to accept after years of high-level involvement with the Newtonian inspired traditional principles of physics. This was particularly evident when the r ealisation came, due to the work of Ernest Rutherford, that atoms act ually consist of vast regions of space in which extremely small par ticles move. The physicists were now able to further postulate that even these sub-atomic particles were not solid in and of themselves . This led to the beginning of the extremely important realisation that molecules, atoms and sub- atomic particles far from being solid, are actually pure Energy vibrating at extremely high but varying frequencie s. This further led to the realisation that sub-at omic particles have no meaning whatsoever as separate entities, but rather displayed an intrinsic oneness with the entire Universe. By the 1930’s, scientists were reaching the position of believing they had finally discovered the building blocks of matter, and in particular that atoms consisted of protons, neutrons and electrons; the sub-atomic particles. As experiments proceeded and became progressively more sophisticat ed, more and more sub-atomic particles were discovered. By 1935 six such particles had been discovered, and by 1955 eighteen particles had been discovered. Modern science has since identifi ed the existence of over two hundred sub-atomic particles."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 74 The theory of relativity of Albert Einstein also had a profound effect on the concept of matter around the time of the early discoveries of sub-atomic particles. The relati vity theory clearly demonstrates mass is not related to substance, but is rather a form of Energy in and of itself. Energy however, being dynamic in nature, is associated with activity, vibratio n. The mass of a particle being directly equivalent to a certain am ount of Energy proves the particle cannot be considered to be a stat ic object, but rather involves Energy, or vibration, which in turn constitutes the mass of the particle. These discoveries and theories have been pivotal to the entire understanding of quantum mec hanics and quantum physics to the stage it had progressed, and formed the basis for considerable future ongoing work in these import ant areas, which are taking the entire range of sciences to new levels, and in turn to a new understanding of the true nat ure of the Universe. A further and extremely import ant breakthrough in the quantum sciences arrived due to the work of physicist David Bohm, a protégé of Albert Einstein. David Bohm is the physicist who first realised the entire Universe ca n be metaphorically likened to an infinite, magnificent hologram of which everyone and everything is a constituent component. It is wort h noting as this point that any fraction of a hologram also reflects the totality of the hologram as a whole, which also accordingly refl ects the reality that everyone and everything in the Universe is an in tegral aspect of the whole, of God. As previously mentioned, David Bohm also most aptly referred to the physical Universe of matter as “frozen light”. David Bohm attended Pennsylvani a State College where he became fascinated by quantum ph ysics and began to study the work and discoveries of the pioneers in this area. One of the most important discoveries of quantum physics is that an individual electron can manifest eit her as a wave or a parti cle, a characteristic of all subatomic particles, and al so includes frequencies that were"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 75 once thought to only manifest as wa ves, such as light, gamma rays, radio waves and x-rays, all of whic h can alter form from waves to particles and back to waves again. Physicists came to believe these particles should not be classified simply as waves or particles bu t as a single, all encompassing classification, which came to be known as “Quanta”. Most importantly, scientists came to agree the entire Universe is made of Quanta. “Quanta” constitutes the primordial Light as has always been known and taught by the wisdom of the ages. It is very interesting to note how t he various pioneers in the field of quantum physics are, even by this stage, inexorably arriving at a wide range of conclusions confirming the integral and inseparable nature of the Universe, facts that have been taught around the world for many thousands of year s by the teachers of the most ancient knowledge. One of the discoveries that proved to be most astonishing to physicists was the observation that the only time Quanta ever manifest as particles is when peopl e are actually looking at them. The significance of this realisat ion alone is extrem ely profound in terms of the understanding of the ma terial world and of all creation. The wisdom of the ages has alwa ys maintained and taught the physical world of matter is nothing but an illusion, only perceived by most as “reality” due to obs ervation and experience by the mediation of the five physical se nses. Quanta, now an established scientific fact, clearly demonstrat es the sensory illusion of the physical world, which is in effect only the reality of the people actually experiencing it through t he mediation of the five physical senses, and is not the reality of t he inner spheres of life, or indeed of ultimate reality. The discovery of the characteri stics of Quanta further underlines the extremely important fact t hat everyone without exception creates their own reality; an ex tremely important truth to be discussed in depth later in this book. Also, again as we will see"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 76 later in this book, these factors equally apply to the inner worlds, the inner spheres or di mensions of reality including the Astral worlds to where people will tr ansition after physical death, and where anything can be manifested as an instant reality through the focussed powers of the Mind in the form of imagination. The Astral and inner dimensions or spheres of reality exist at a much higher level of vibration or Energy than the physical world, and accordingly Quanta of Energy, identical to vibration or Light in the Universal sense, are much mo re easily influenced by the power of the Mind; the inner spheres of life being “Mind worlds”. Physicist Nick Herbert likened the behaviour of Quanta to “a radically ambiguous and ceaselessly flowi ng quantum soup”. Nick Herbert most profoundly goes on to observe “humans can never experience the true nature of quantum realit y, because everything we touch turns to matter”. David Bohm was particularly inte rested in the observation relating to the strange state seemingly existing between apparently unrelated subatomic event s, an area most scientists had hitherto seemed to disregard. This disregard was due in part to the views of physicist Niels Bohr who maintained that if subatomic particles only came into existence in the presence of an observer, it is also meaningless to speak of a parti cle’s properties before they are actually observed. David Bohm was meanwhile pursui ng his work in quantum science, becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the views of his peers in these areas and in particular those of Niels Bohr and his interpretation of quantum physics. Later, David Bohm, still not satisfied with the prevailing situ ation surrounding the theories of quantum physics, wrote a paper on the subject with view to increasing his own under standing, copies of which he sent to both Niels Bohr and Albert Eins tein for their opinions . Niels Bohr failed to respond, but Albert Einstein sugges ted they meet at Princeton University where they were both lo cated at the time in order to discuss the paper of David Bohm. Ov er the course of time these"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 77 great physicists met frequently in or der to discuss the whole area of quantum physics, and gained considerable mutual respect in the process, both men benefiting gr eatly from these meetings. In due course David Bohm published a work entitled “Quantum Theory”, published in 1951, and hailed as a classic. David Bohm himself however later became increasingly disenchanted with the theories he had put forward in his own work and continued searching for a better way to describe reality. During the course of the next few years he continued his work, constantly finding himself at odd s with the theories of the highly respected physicist Niels Bohr. Among the issues in question was that of Cause and Effect, where David Bohm postulated that any particular effect could have an infi nite number of possible causes behind it. David Bohm’s position was based on the assertion that any particular effect was the result of a cause, and in turn the cause was an effect of a further preceding cause and so on, and accordingly no single Cause and Effect relationship can be separate from the entire Universe as whole. Once again this is totally consistent in every way wit h the teachings over the ages, in particular of the Univer sal principles of Caus e and Effect and of karma. Over the next few years David Bohm continued to refine his theories and research into the field of quantum physics, looking more and more deeply into the m eaning of the “quantum potential” he had discovered, and notwithstandi ng his radical departure from traditional Newtonian based theories upon which most of traditional science was and is still based. One of the most important aspects of his quantum theories was that of “wholeness”, which, probably unknown to him at the time has also long been known and taught by the teachers of the ancient wisdoms for many thousands of years. By the late 1950’s, David Bohm had moved to E ngland where he continued his research at Bristol University as a research fellow"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 78 where he met another research student, Yakir Aharanov. Working together they discovered another im portant example of non-local interconnectedness when they found that under the right circumstances an electron can sens e a magnetic field in an area where there would otherwise be no chance of finding the electron. These findings became known as the “Aharanov-Bohm effect”. Unfortunately, notwithstanding t he fact that this phenomena has been proven time and again in subs equent experiments by several different scientists, many scientist still do not believe it to be possible even today, preferring to remain with the traditional Newtonian models of physics with which they already feel so comfortable. To his immense credit, and the future integrity of all areas of science, David Bohm stood firmly by his work, stating most appropriately, “ in the long-run it is far more dangerous to adhere to an illusion than to face what the actual fact is ”. The “illusion” to which he refers is the illusion under which most of science was still operating based entirely upon tradit ional Newtonian th eories, and to which much of science still steadfastly adheres even today. As David Bohm continued his resear ch, his attention moved to the matter of “order” where he began to realise there are different degrees of order, and accordingly so me things were more ordered than others. This led to the realis ation that there are an infinite number of “orders” in the Univer se, indeed a whol e hierarchy of orders, and accordingly in the cont ext of the Universe as a whole there was positively no disorder; t he Universe always consisting infinitely as a perfect hierarchy of orders from the very highest to the very lowest order of matter. Again this realisation is fully supported by the ancient wisdoms of the world, which have always taught the nature of the Univer se has to be ordered by Divine perfection, otherwise the entire Univ erse in all dimensions would instantly collapse into chaos. David Bohm later experienced a major breakthrough in the progress of his theorie s when watching a television program where"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 79 a demonstration was being shown consisting of a large transparent container with a rotating cylinder connected to an external handle. This container was filled with gl ycerine, suspended in which was a single drop of ink. When the handle of the drum was turned the drop of ink appeared to disper se throughout the glycerine and seemed to disappear completely. However when the handle of the drum was turned back in the opposite direction, the droplet of ink reappeared, collapsing upon itself once again thus reconstituting as the original drop of ink precisely in its original form. David Bohm immediately realised the signifi cance of this when he wrote: “ this immediately struck me as being very re levant to the question of order, since, when the ink drop was spread out, it still had a hidden order that was revealed w hen it was reconstituted. On the other hand, in our usual language, we would say that the ink was in a state of disorder when it wa s diffused throughout the glycerine, this led me to see that new notio ns of order must be involved here ”. This resulted in a major breakthrough in realisation and thinking for David Bohm, enabling him to bring together the various threads of his previous thinking and theorie s in quantum physics with very considerable force and clarity; it was the beginning of his “holographic” perspective of th e Universe, and a new method by which “order” could be understood. Like the metaphor of the ink drop in the cylinder of glycerine, it became highly evident to David Bohm that the Univer se possesses complete orders which can be either folded or unfolded, only t he latter of which is the more immediately apparent. The folded or ders are still a completely integral aspect of the order of the Universe as a whole, and therefore also of unfolded orders in the totality of order, thereby illustrating the complete order of the Universe in all its completeness and perfection. This in turn led inexorably to the realisation that t he Universe could, in and of itself, be likened to an infinite flowing hologram which he termed the “holomovement”. This again is totally consistent with the teachings of the ages of the principle of rhythm. Everything fr om the very highest to the very lowest ultimately flows from the infinite Mind of The Source, The"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 80 First Cause, God. Nothing ever rests in the Universe, everything is always flowing and in motion, wh ich is completely apparent in accordance with the theories of David Bohm, folded or unfolded orders revealing the order and perfe ction of the Universe as a whole. During the early 1970’s David Bohm published his first papers on the “holographic universe” which event ually led to the publication in 1980 of an extremel y important, and indeed ground-breaking book entitled “Wholeness and the Implic ate Order”. This book not only crystallised the life work of Davi d Bohm in the field of quantum physics to that juncture, encompa ssing and integrating all of his previous work over many years, it was also a brand new and highly revolutionary way of perceiving t he reality of the Universe in scientific terms. One of David Bohms most startling conclusions was a fact that has always been taught by the wisdom of the ages, specifically the truth that everyday life that most people call “reality”, is in fact nothing more than an illusion, a holographic projection of the multi- dimensional Univer se as a whole. On a deeper level is an infinitely la rger reality whereby the entire Universe, including the physical world perceived by people with the five physical senses as their own particular “reality” including all objects and manifestations of the material world, actually exist as individual units of a hologram, each of which is also identical to the hologram as a whole. David Bohm calls the level of r eality perceivable by means of the five physical senses, the physical Un iverse as the “explicate order”, the unfolded order, and he calls the deeper level of reality, the enfolded aspect of the Universe, the “implicate order”. As we will see later in this book, the Univ erse does indeed have many levels of reality beyond those merely a pparent to human perception by the mediation of the five physical senses. This also explains the fact that the Universe is constantly in motion and manifesting as an"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 81 infinite number of “foldings” and “unfoldings” o ccurring between the implicate and explicat e orders. The very ex istence of a deeper order also explains why real ity becomes non-local at a sub- quantum level. David Bohm also further demonstr ates the Universal reality of “wholeness”. Everything in the Universe is constituted by the seamless holographic material of the implicate or der, and therefore cannot properly be view ed in terms or parts or separateness. These realisations again are fully consis tent with the anc ient knowledge that teaches the entire Universe is a projec tion within the Mind of the “The One”, or “The Whole”, a mental Universe of infinite Consciousness where ever ything in the Univer se is an integral aspect of everything else in the Universe; accordingly separateness simply cannot exist. This is also fully supported by Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity stating space and time are not separate entities, but are rather components of an in finitely larger reality known as the “space-time continuum”. David Bohm extends this to include the realisation of the fact that everything in the Universe wit hout exception is a continuum, including space-time and implic ate and explicate orders. Most people today, including most of the sciences view their own “reality” purely at the explicate level, the ph ysical level, thereby giving rise to the illusion of separateness, so metimes known in the East as “duality”; one of the major reasons why the human race is in the state it is today. Everything is a seamless aspect of everything else, and even the implicate and explicate orders ulti mately blend into each other to include the ultimate whole. Once again, this same reality has always been taught by the ancient wisdoms of the world throughout the ages, affirming all spheres of reality from the very highest vibration and lowest dens ity of the First Cause, The Source, God, down to the very lowest vibr ation and highest density of the physical world of matter, are a seamless continuum of Energy, vibration. Most importantly the t heories of David Bohm are also in"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 82 complete agreement with the wis dom of the ages when he realised the fact that most people vie wing and treating the world as fragmented and separate is not only directly responsible for the misdirection of much of science today, but is indeed responsible for most of the social problems curr ently facing humanity. David Bohm further stated that continuing to fragment the world into parts could ultimately lead to extinction; an extremely important and justified observation. These are major reasons why mankind absolutely must sooner rather than later come to understand the true meaning of reality, its purpose and ultimate destiny, and t hereby the very meaning of life. This also emphasises the fact that whenever man harms or destroys anyone or any part of the environment whatsoever, whether it is another human being or any creat ure, however large or small, a tree, any flora or fa una at all in fact, or indeed any aspect of nature or of the natural order of the world, he thereby equally destroys a part of himsel f. The importance and significance of this profound truth simp ly cannot be understated. David Bohm also most importantly recognised Consciousness as a more subtle form of matter. The ent ire Universe is “mental”, and is in reality infinite Consciousness. Be cause the Universe is not static, but rather a perpetual state of movement and action, David Bohm began to use the word “holomovement” in order to more accurately describe the dynamic nat ure of the Universe. Because everything in the Universe is an integral as pect of the same “holomovement”, David Bohm believes the rela tionship between matter and Consciousness exists deep in the imp licate order rather than at the level of the human perception of reality, and is ther efore present in the various degrees of the fold ment and unfoldment of matter. As we will see later in this book, thought itself is Energy in the form of degrees of vibration, and can therefore directly influence other Energy in order to bring abou t non-physical and subsequently physical manifestations. Thought is an aspect of individual Consciousness which in turn is an integral aspect of Universal"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 83 Consciousness, and accordingly thought is an integral aspect of the implicate and the exp licate orders. Con sciousness therefore pervades everything in the Universe. David Bohm realised that dividing the Universe up into living and non-living, animate or inanimate is completely meaningless. Everything in the Universe is an inseparable aspect of everything else, interwoven and enfolded into the fabric and totality of the Universe. David Bohm also unknowingly agreed with the ancient wisdoms in stating that everything in the Universe is life to some degree, even those things appeari ng to be solid and inanimate to the perception of the five physica l human senses such as a stone, a mountain or a grain of sand. He said life and intelligence exists not only in matter, but indeed in t he fabric of the entire Universe. Like a hologram, every single cell in a human body contains the entire Universe, as does every flow er, every rock, every flake of snow, every grain of sand, indeed every atom. Mankind and everything else in the Universe can indeed therefore be likened to an infinite, magnificent hologram or holomovement, projected from the infinite Mind of our Prime Creator, “The First Cause”, “The Source”, “The All” , “Spirit”, “God”. As the work of David Bohm progr essed, he came to realise the metaphoric hologram, or holomovement, only provided a limited view of the implicat e order, and to penetrate more deeply he later developed a causal interpretation of the quantum field theory. Primary physical reality is assum ed to be a continuous field, and discreet Quanta are viewed more in terms of a secondary symptom. Therefore inst ead of taking a particle as a starting point the field is accepted as a fundamental reality. Also at the same time rather than viewing quant um potential as infl uencing a particle, Bohm postulates a “super-quantum” potential acting on a field. Now the super-quantum potential assumes responsibility for the perception of discreet Quanta, thus creating the appearance of a particle in its Energy state causing it to behave as if it was constituted by discrete elementary particles, implying wave-particle"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 84 duality is an effect of the s uper-quantum potential on the continuous field. This later leads to the theories presented in a book published by David B ohm in 1987 entitled “Science, Order and Creativity”, where he puts forward the theory that above and beyond the implicate order there is also a super-implicate order, which postulates that in acco rdance with quantum field theory the implicate order is the field itself, and it is the super-implicate order that has the super-quantum potential. This in turn leads to the conclusion that the particle it self is no longer a fundamental concept, as the primary realities ar e in fact the implicate and super- implicate orders. In the super-implicate order a particle does not exist except as a creation of the Mind or as a secondary symptom that can be perceived by instruments. What is actually pr esent here then is the holomovement consisting of a c ontinuously changing quantum field of the implicate order, and the supe r-quantum potential of the of the super-implicate order, the particl e, the explicate order being a discontinuous ripple effect on th e super-quantum potential of the field, thus providing for the exis tence of the second implicate order. It becomes apparent theref ore that if a sec ond implicate order exists, there could also be a potentially infinite number of successive inner implicate orders above the first and second implicate orders, giving rise to a whole hierarchy of such inner super-implicate orders. The effects of these inner super-implicate orders would be progressively more subtle, and well beyond the range of measurement by any human instrumentation. We should again note at this st age that the ancient knowledge of the world has always taught and fu lly supports the existence of a hierarchy of successively inner and more subtle super-implicate orders, often known as “planes”, “realms” “spheres”, “worlds” or dimensions”. An excellent ancient illustration of the hierarchy of super-implicate orders is “the Tr ee of Life” of the Kabbalah as previously discussed, where each S ephirot would be equivalent to a super-implicate order. Simila rly, the various planes of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 85 correspondence which will be discussed later in this book are also super-implicate orders, all existing beyond the explicate order of the physical world of matter. As the order of these super-implicate orders, planes or spheres of reality become progressively more in wards, the “Ether” or “fabric” of these planes becomes progressi vely finer and therefore more subtle with increasing vibrati on and reducing density. The more inner the plane or super-implicat e order, the more readily the Quanta of the Ether are influenced by the Mind. As we will see later in this book, everything created in the Universe is created first by means of the powers of the im agination of the Mind, one of the most powerful forces in the Univer se, which influences the Ether at a inner, less dense level, to subs equently manifest the object of the thought or imagination at progre ssively lower levels until it materialises into the physical worl d as something observable by the five physical senses. This is the basis of Magic or manifestation, and indeed as we will also see late r, the entire Universe came into existence in this way, thus creating the hierarchy of super-implicate orders, or planes, all originatin g from, and contained within the infinite Mind of The Source, The First Cause, God. David Bohm’s theories therefore postulate an ultimate reality comprising a dynamic holomovement with three fundamental levels of manifestation; the explicate order, or what is considered to be physical “reality”, the implicat e order and the super-implicate orders. The realms of the implicate and hierarchy of super-implicate orders comprise absolute reality, the remainder, for the most part consisting of the expl icate order, the physical Universe including the planet Earth which is considered to be an illusion, only existing in accordance with the limited perceptions the five physical senses. David Bohm therefore goes on to speak of an “eternal order” that is neither static or permanent, and is in a perpetual stat e of creation. As the eternal order progresse s down through the succession of implicate orders, when it reaches a level of im plicate order bordering on the explicat e order, it enters the realms of time, and"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 86 becomes manifest in t he temporal realms of the Etheric plane and in turn the physical world where it then becomes subject to the three dimensional effects of space and time. The quantum potential, super-quant um potential, implicate and super-implicate orders are the names given to the realms beyond the perceptions of the five phy sical senses and are therefore invisible to humans, but which for David Bohm, as with the teachings of the anci ent wisdoms of the world, represents true reality, with the implicate and super-implicate orders being the primary structure, with the explicat e order of the phy sical Universe being the superficial appearance, or illusion, often known in the East as “maya”. Unfortunately the mainstream scienc es, very much steeped in the Newtonian three dimensional view of the world of matter, still for the most part refuse to acknowledge the existence of the inner spheres of reality, notwithstanding the global ly consistent teachings of the ancient wisdoms of the world a nd the compelling and pioneering work of David Bohm in these areas of quantum physics; truly a case of out of sight, out of Mind on the part of modern science. By denying the existence of these in ner, true realities or dimensions simply because they cannot be observed or measured by physical instruments, empirically based sci ence can still justify to itself continuing to work within the confines of the unreality, the illusion of the three dimensional world of matter, without ever having to concern itself with the true ultimate reality. This really highlights the absurdity of the countless billions or trillions of dollars being spent on the exploration of the tempor al, physical Universe, when true exploration of the real Universe , our real home, costs absolutely nothing, and space and time are no barrier. The future and destiny of all manki nd is not to be found within the three dimensional Univ erse, but rather in the inner spheres of reality beyond the temporal illusion of space and time. As we will discuss later, exploration of the i nner spheres, realms or worlds, is"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 87 within the abilities of everyone a nd always has been. Exploration of the reality of the Universe by means of Astr al and Mental projection and other natural ab ilities is the future, the immense money being spent on space explorat ion being better distributed to those on Earth who most need it now. David Bohm later began to consider the position of Consciousness relative to the implicate order and thus stated: “ Consciousness is much more of the implicate order than is matter ”. He also concluded: “ Deep down the Conscious ness of mankind is one. This is a virtual certaint y because even in the vacuum of matter is one; and if we don’t see this, it’s because we are blinding ourselves to it .” Here yet again David Bohm has arrived at a profound conclusion that has always been known an d taught throughout the ages; all humans, like all life itself, share a common Consciousness at a inner level, specifically at the level of the group Consciousness of the human Mind, and wh ich level is equivalent to a super-implicate order. It is this super-implicate or der of the plane of the collective Consciousness of the human Mind that explains many “phenomena” often regar ded as “supernatural” such as telepathy, telekinesis and numerous other “psychic” phenomena. The work of David Bohm and his holographic view of the Universe in no way represents the totality of the ongoing work in the field of quantum physics. However, in m any respects his achievements can be rightly considered to be a culm ination of a lifetime of work in the field of quantum physics and quantum mechanics, all of his theories having been rigorously tested against all known principles of quantum theory as well as in the laboratory. David Bohm approached all science not merely as an academic endeavour, but much more importantly as a quest fo r the absolute truth, failing to be influenced by the traditional Newt onian views of the Universe prevailing during his time, and alas still prevails today. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 88 David Bohm also remained true to his discoveries notwithstanding pressure from the more academ ic and theoretically inclined members of his profession. The result of his life’s work is not only a very definite direction for the entire field of the quantum sciences which cannot, and in the fullness of time most certainly will not be ignored, but also brings quantum physics and quantum mechanics together in a most harmonious manner with the inner knowledge and wisdom as has always been known and taught to mankind throughout the ages. David Bohm’s work into quant um physics and quantum mechanics also realised and affirmed a single ultimate reality; the true nature of the Universe. Time will inevitab ly show the Universal explicate, implicate and super implicate orders of David Bohm and the holomovement, will eventually have mo st profound implications for humanity which all science will quite simply have to accept sooner or later, thus proving conclusively the Universe rather than being a vast and disparate multitude of separately interacting particles of matter, is in reality a magnificent unbroken completeness, a continuum, an infinite flowing movement of Energy, vibration, the holomovement. David Bohm also conclusively dem onstrated there is absolutely no real evidence in the world of tradi tional three dim ensional science supporting the view of a fragm ented, disparate Universe of separateness. One of t he greatest legacies of David Bohm and his work with physics and the quantum sciences, is that he never restricted himself simply to l aboratory data or accepted mere theoretical methodology. He was always motivated by an absolute passion for truth which transcended all else, and was never influenced by the views and opinions of those who were still content to work within the confines of the traditional Newtonian perspective of science, or those who sought fame based on superfluous foundations. His work and discoveries over many years encompassed a tremendous depth and breadth over a very wide spectrum of physics and quantum physics theories and methodologies, resulting in a convergence of modern quantum"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 89 physics and the wisdoms and knowledge of the ages, thus emphasising the truth of our ultimate reality. David Bohm also fully recognised the appalling and deteriorating effects of the prevalent worl d view of separateness and the fragmented collective human Co nsciousness when he said: “ What is needed today is a new surge that is similar to the Energy generated during the Renaiss ance but even deeper and more extensive; the essential need is for a loosening of rigidly held intellectual content in the tacit infrastructure of Consciousness, along with a melting of the hardness of the heart on the side of feeling. The melting on the emotional side could perhaps be called the beginning of genuine lo ve, while the loosening of thought is the beginning of the awakening of creative intelligence. The two necessarily go together. ” These are indeed most true and most prophetic words, as will surely be seen by all in the fullness of time. In addition to explaining the tr ue nature of the Universe and of reality, quantum physics, even at the most fundamental and non- mathematical level also fully explai ns the reality as experienced on a daily basis by all life, whether consci ously or otherwise, profoundly affecting the reality of every single person without exception. Quantum physics illustrates how ever ything in the Universe, in all dimensions of life and reality ultimately consists of “Quanta” of Energy, vibration. This Energy no t only pervades and is integral to everything in existence, it is also “living” Mind, living Consciousness. Everything in the Un iverse therefore has its being within this infinite intelligent Energy. Everything is an aspect of this infinite intelligence, every person, every animal, every tree, every star and every planet, and every micro-organism, however small, is ultimately an equal aspect of the very same Energy; there is no s eperatedness except as an illusion"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 90 created by the ego and five physical senses; we and everything in the Universe without exception are one. Because the Universe is infinite intelligence of which we are all integral aspects, Quanta of Energy are influenced by the Mind; thought also being pure Energy . Whenever you look at a possession such as a house, a car, a television set, they are in fact nothing more or less than an arr angement of Energy, or Quanta, ultimately created by thought pr ocesses of the Mind. If these objects were to be inspected very closely, it would be apparent that they are not solid at all but ar e rather compos ed of Quanta of Energy vibrating and mo ving at extremely high ra tes in an out of the object being observed. Nothing can exist permanently unless it is observed because it is Mind that controls and shapes Q uanta of Energy, and without that focus of the Mind the Quanta would once again become a “potential” for something else. If for example everyone in the world were to cease observing the world and everything in it, by ceasing to focus on it’s perceived existenc e, then everything would cease to exist. There would be no thought Ener gy to maintain the illusion of its existence anymore. This is wh y the Earth and everything it comprises, as well as the entire three-dimensional Universe is referred to in some cultures as “maya”, and illusion. The Earth and physical Universe are indeed an ill usion and a grand scale, and will one day be realised as such by all mankind once evolving beyond the illusion of the physical Universe. Quantum physics completely confi rms this by recognising that something can only actually come into “existence” when it is observed. Of course “existence” is a term relative to the five physical senses; everythi ng that exists now has always existed and always will exist, it is only the illusion of form that changes in response to thought, Mind. When so mething is observed, Quanta come together to form sub-atomic par ticles, and in turn atoms, then molecules until finally something m anifests in the physical world as"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 91 a localized space-time event that can be observed by the five physical senses. This process is the very basis of how each and every person creates their own reality. Every si ngle thought, as Energy, directly and instantly influences the quant um field causing Quanta in the form of Energy to arrange themselv es into a localised, observable event, object or other influence. This in fact is also the basic of true “Magic”. The magician, and those who understand and are in harmony with Universal laws are c onscious creators, whereas most people are unconscious creators, always constantly creating their own reality by their own thoughts, but never realising, usually ascribing everything to such notions as “luck”, “chance” and “fortune”. Conscious creation is also the basis of the Law of Attraction, which will be di scussed later in this book. People might ask “well how do things seem to be real, tangible and solid”. The behaviour of Quanta can be likened to a reel of film. When the reel of film is played, thousands of frames of individual images are passed over a light pr ojector and onto a screen, thereby giving the illusion of a solid moving scene. Quanta operate in exactly the same way. Countless Quanta of Energy are constantly moving in an out of an area of fo cus, coming together to appear to the physical senses as a solid object. Like the movie however, this is only an illusion that has been c onstructed from much smaller components. In the case of the mo vie the visual image is created by the influence of the projector mechanism whereas in the case of objects appearing to be solid the ill usion of a physical object is perpetuated by the Mind; specifically by the act of observing it. When you arrive home and expect an object in your house to be there, it will be there by virtue of that expectation and observation. As we will see later in this book, understanding these extremely fundamental and import ant factors is the way towards always consciously creating the reality y ou desire, and to never attracting anything into your reality anything you do not desire. Quanta never,"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 92 ever differentiate between the desir ed or not desired, they merely respond to and obey thought. Everything in existenc e therefore, everythi ng that can be observed is a result of a mental focus, a decision at some level of Consciousness that it should be ther e. Without that level of focus and expectation that something exists, it simply could not exist. This applies to things that we have never seem before as well; i.e. when we go shopping. When we take a trip to the shopping mall for example there are thousands of “t hings” that we have never seen before. They exist as a conscious creation of someone else. When we observe that creation it becom es a part of a consensus creation that in turn perpetuates its existenc e. Reality can either exist at a personal level or a consensual level; i.e. if enough people believe that something exists, for ex ample a park, and focus on that existence, then it will continue to exist in accordance with the consensus expectation. If people cease to focus on the object the Quanta become less concentrated and the result is decay until the object no longer exists at which point the Quanta of Energy that originally comprised it have di ssipated back into the Universe. The great Astral worlds, often known as the “the beyond” or “the afterlife” are the consensus cr eation of mankind, based upon perceptions learned during a physi cal existence on Earth. So the Astral worlds include every possible consensus reality for every culture, race and tradition that exists, has ever existed and ever will exist relative to the Earth concept of “time”, all created by the Mind. Each culture, race and society has its own “belief” of what everything should look like, so when people pass on from any particular Earth culture, tradi tion or belief system, including dogmatic religion, they naturally create with the Mind an environment in exact accordance wi th those expectations. This can be at a group level where entire cities, towns, villages and other environments are created by the consensus group Mind, fashioned after their equivalent on Earth, and individual realities, homes and"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 93 other possessions are created on an individual level in accordance with the focus of wishes and desires. The Astral worlds exist at a much lower density, higher vibration aspect of the Universe than the ph ysical world of matter, and as a result Quanta, Energy is influen ced much more easily and quickly, to such an extent in fact that thoughts manife st as their observable equivalent immediately however lar ge or small. This results in instant creation of any desire. There is only set of immutable laws in operation and they apply to all planes of life and reality. The same laws apply in the physical world where everyone still creates their own reality, but due to the much higher density and lower vibration of Energy prev ailing within the physica l world it takes more focussed thought Energy of the Mi nd over a more protracted period of time before it can manifest as an observable physical reality. The continued existence of the creation depends on the degree of ongoing focus. If a house was created it will continue to exist for as long as the creator, or a consensus group focus on it and provide the Energy for its continued existence. The same applies to the entire physical world, but due to the much higher density, the process requires more and sustained concentrated thought. This of course is an important reason we are here, to learn how to control our thoughts and therefor e our individual reality. Only when these and other important lessons have been learned can true Spiritual progression be attained beyond t he cycle of reincarnation. The entire Universe is “infinite in telligence”, existing in the Mind of The Source, The First Cause, G od. Energy, Quanta are therefore also intelligent, being ultimately controlled by the Mind of God. Not only are Quanta capable of making dec isions, they also know what decisions other Quanta are maki ng anywhere in the Universe due to the inseparable and integrated nat ure of everything in creation. Everything is connected by this same ultimate, infinite, Divine intelligence, the very same intelli gence of which we are all integral aspects and in Who’s image we are made. "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 94 In quantum terms, Quanta can al so be regarded as “packets of probability”. Every Quanta of E nergy has a potential to be anywhere at any time, and can be in fluenced by thought or other Quanta. For example, if you wis h to meet someone for the first time, that person has the potential to exist anywhere in the world. When you make the decision to meet with this person in a particular place and then subsequently do so, that person no longer has only potential, he or she has actually manifested as a physical reality into your life in accordance with the mutual will of both people. Once your meeting has concl uded, the person will leave and become a potential person once again relative to your own physical reality. Quanta, including those of which you are constituted are not bound by space or time. Quanta are spaceless, timeless and exist everywhere concurrently. The Source , The First Cause, God is at once omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent, and Quanta are a fundamental aspect of God in W hom we have our Being. We therefore as aspects of the Universe, The Sour ce of God are also boundless, spaceless and timeless beings existing concurrently everywhere in the Universe. We have no limits, no boundaries, no specific point of existence, these are all illusions created by the ego and the five physical senses and the fact that most people are focussed entirely in the physical world which they continue to observe and regard as reality. Ever yone is an integral aspect of the same Mind-field, much bigger and more powerful than most people can possibly realize or have the capacity as yet to comprehend. We already have everything in the Universe; infinite abundance is our heritage! All anyone has to do is to bring the object of their desires into their local observab le Consciousness and reality by focussing on it. Ask and it is given; instantly, always, no exceptions. Everyone already has all wealth imagi nable, all that is required is to bring it into individual reality. T here is no poverty in the Universe; everyone is infinitely wealthy if they did but realise it. There is absolutely nothing that we cannot be, do or have. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 95 The Universe conceptually consists of illusions of the “observer” and the “observed”. In this way the Universe, The Source, God, evolves experientially having both the capacity to observe and be observed, as do all individuations of God in cluding human beings all of whom are such expressions of God made in the same true Spiritual image. The observed is meaningless without an observer, and likewise the observer is meaning less without being observed. It is therefore by this process of in dividuation that the process of the observer and the observed is perpetuated, and evolution, expansion and growth infinitely continues. The entire Universe of which we are integral aspects is a vast expanse of Energy vibr ating at different rates from the lowest vibration of matter to the highest vi bration of The Source, The First Cause, God. The illusion of separat ion is perpetuated by virtue of the way in which Mind perceives and decodes these vibrations. So “things” only exist because we ob serve them and our Mind decodes the vibrations of the Energy of the “thing” being observed. Without this observation, the “thing” being observed cannot exist, except as a probability within the vast expans e of Energy constituting the Universe. So everything in the Univ erse is a probability of existence until such time as it is observ ed and its Energy is decoded by the Mind, at which point the probability becomes an actuality while it is being observed, after which it becomes a probability once again. Everything within the Universe is in the direction of life, evolution and growth, nothing ever stands still or fails to evolve; this is the Law as it applies to all levels. By the process and individuation and thereby the perpetuation of the ill usion of the observer and the observed, growth can continue, but both are required. There can be no growth without the observer and the observed, because there would be no basis upon which to l earn and therefore to evolve. It has also been demonstrated by quantum physics that there are an infinite number of parallel “wor lds”. This is concluded by the observation that Quanta have the potential to be in any parallel"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 96 existence, but once observed in one locality the same Quanta will not be observable in other localities. However, at the quantum level ev erything is “non-local”, and therefore beyond space and time everything can and does exist concurrently as an infinite number of parallel realities. This gives rise to the “holographic” model of the Universe as postulated by David Bohm and other physicists. It is this holographic model of the Universe that explains parallel realities, and mo st importantly at the same time how we concurrently exis t as aspects of all realities as one with The Universe, The Source, God. As body, Soul and Spiri t, our Ultimate Reality is infinite Energy and intelligence beyond the boundaries of space and time as a true Son or Daughter of God, ex isting infinitely and concurrently across the entire Universe in all s pheres of life and reality. Our localised reality is simply our point of focus, our point of conscious awareness, which, for most people, for the ti me being, is within the physical body; most people still erroneously perceiving themselves as completely separate individual peopl e, housed in a body of flesh. Only when every one begins to fu lly understand their own nature as infinite Spiritual be ings of the magnificent multi-dimensional Universe can the human race turn back towards its true purpose, to evolve back to the First Cause, The Light, God. From time immemorial the greates t teachers who came to Earth to teach mankind these realities all m ade the point that we “came from the light”. The “light” to which they refer is not some physical light, but rather the Light of The Source, The First Cause, of God. In that context, as Energy and integral as pects of The Source, we are all Light; beings of The Light. The nearer to The Source we reach, the more we experience the glories of The Light unt il finally reaching, and having the potential to reunite with The Source of The Light, and to once again cease to be existed as an indivi duated Being, but rather to be at One with"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 97 God. This is the ultimate meaning of life, our ultimate purpose, Our Ultimate Reality.    "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 98 Chapter 17: The Wisdom of the Ages As can be most clearly witnessed from the collective knowledge and wisdoms of the many and va ried countries, culture and traditions of the World, both of the East and of the West, taken together with conclusions of quant um physics, the basis of all philosophies as to the creation and nature of the Universe, the true purpose and destiny of all manki nd and how mankind fulfils that destiny, are extremely similar, diffe ring for the most part only in the ways they are taught in accordance with the many and varied cultures and traditions. This wisdom and knowledge has been so similar and consistent over the course of many thousa nds of years, well pre-dating the indoctrination of the modern dogmatic, orthodox religions, it must surely be evident to most people t hat these factors simply cannot possibly be in any way considered to be a coincidence. Although the many cultures of the world have acquired true Universal knowledge fr om original and quite separate sources dating back many, many thousands of years, the inner sources of knowledge have always been, are, and always will be ultimately working with those incarnate in the physical world for the ultimate progress of all mankind. The reas ons will be clear; if mankind is indeed to fulfil it’s true, ultima te, Divine purpose and destiny, it clearly needs to fully understand t he real nature and truth of that purpose and destiny, the truth of it’s own Divine, Spir itual nature as aspects of God, and of the glories of the Spir itual worlds awaiting everyone which will be experie nced by each and every person during the onward journey through the inner spheres of life. It is directly due to the lack of su ch awareness, we see the world of today that has been heading into the darkness, driven by the insidious forces of creed, dogma and materialism, compounded and fuelled further by the very negative Energy these forces generate. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 99 The age-old cultures teach people Universal and Spiritual truths based upon everything from deep ph ilosophies all the way through to colourful stories, plays, ritual s and practical exercises. All of these traditions ultimately teach exactly the same ultimate and absolute truth, the tr uth that all human beings without exception are true Sons and Daughter s of “God”, of the Supreme Being, our Prime Creator who has many names according to the many cultures and traditions of the world. All traditions teach the truth that we are all, as indeed is everything and everyone in the entire Univ erse inseparable and integral aspects of God, and ther efore there really is no separateness in the Universe. All traditions teach the true meaning of life, and how life should be lived for the ultimate good of all humanity, of the planet and of the Universe. The wisdom of the West symbolically sets out in considerable detail how the Un iverse in all dimensions was originally created, and the Universal principl es prevailing in all spheres of life and reality. Modern quantum physics being a sci ence deriving its information primarily by experimentation, t heory and practice, does not, yet at least seek to explain the actual meaning of the Universe as it relates to everything and every one, but rather puts forward scientific theories and perspecti ves as to the structure and characteristics of the Universe in logical terms. However, although the scientific approach and phraseology is vastly different to that of the ancient wisdoms and cultures of the world and is approached from a completely different directi on, the conclusions to the extent quantum physics has progressed so far are remarkably similar if not identical to the ancient kno wledge, notwithstandi ng having been arrived at completely separately. Quantum physics has determined fo r example the ent ire Universe, including the physical Universe is comprised of Energy vibrating at progressively higher rates. Quantum physics is also acknowledging the fact that the familiar physical world of matter is not true reality at all, but is rather an elaborat e “illusion” perceived only when"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 100 experienced by means of the mediation of the five physical senses, and the way the Mind decodes Energy , and it is in fact the inner states of Energy and vibration, al so known as spheres, worlds or planes that are indeed tr ue reality, a fact always known and taught by the ancient wisdoms of the world from time immemorial. David Bohm after a lifetime of work in the field of quantum physics, also inexorably reached the realisat ion that the entir e Universe from the very highest to the very lowest can be likened to a grand holographic projection, the holomovement, origi nating from the very highest, God, The Source, The First Cause, descending down to the physical world of matter of wh ich everything and everyone in the entire Universe is an integral and insepa rable aspect. Further, each and every discreet aspect of the Universal hologram includes precisely the same detail as the hologram as a whole. This once again is identical to t he ancient teachings of the world that teaches that we and everything and every one else are cont ained within The All, God, The Source Energy, an d equally The All, God, The Divine is within everything and everyone el se, and that we are all Sons and Daughters of God, made in the true Spiritual “i mage” of God. Nothing whatsoever can exist separat ely from the ultimate whole of the multi-dimensional Universe. At the final analysis, areas of quantum physics to the extent it has progressed to date are, whether realising it or not, pu tting forward exactly the same concepts and conclusions as the wisdom of the ages as to both the true nature of the Univer se and the relationship of everything and everyone within the Universe, that of a totally integrated multi- dimensional continuum of reality, of Energy, of vibration, of which everything and everyone is, always has been and always will be an inseparable and Divine aspect. Throughout the ages theologians and many others have attempted to ascribe qualities to the inner nature of G od. These however can only be regarded as feeble attempts by human Minds to grasp the secrets and nature of the infinite. Such efforts must fail, have always failed and always will fail. Some theologians and religions"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 101 have even attempted to ascribe typical human characteristics to God, even going as far as to in clude such extreme, shallow and negative human traits as jealou sy, anger, caprice, desire and need to be worshipped, desire to receiv e offerings, flattery, praise and many other such typically human egotistic characteristics. These perceptions simply do not and can never do justice to the true and infinite nature of God, the Supr eme Creator and Master of the Universe. God is immutable; not subject or open to any sort of change. Indeed there is nothing to which God could ever change to or could possibly have ever previously changed from. God cannot be divided, added to or subtracted from in any way, and can never be increased, decreased, diminished or become lesser or greater than Him/Her Self. God is “Infinite Li ving Mind”, the ultimate Mind, the Macrocosm in which everything and everyone has its existence. The human Mind, the microcosm is an extension and integral aspect of the ultimate Mind, God, and is a creator in the microcosm just as the ultimate Mind, God creates the entire Universe, the Macrocosm. Infinite Living Mind” then is the li ving “essence” of which everything and everyone in the entir e Universe in all of its spheres or “dimensions” are a completely integral and inseparable aspect. This living essence has been known from time immemorial as “Spirit”. Many ancient and modern as well as remote cultures throughout the world have always fully recogni sed Spirit. As we will discuss later, “Infinite Living Mind” also fully explains the so called “phenomena” which are very often regarded by people as “miracles”, “supernatural” or “paranormal”, including such “phenomena” as clairvoyance, remote viewing, telepathy, telekinesis, divination and many others. When placed in context these so called phenomena immedi ately become recognised and known for what they truly are; completely natural aspects of the mental Universe of Conscious ness and Energy, and accordingly no one should be at all surprised when these “phenomena” occur or are caused to occur."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 102 The Universe and everything and ev eryone contained therein is a mental creation of, and maintained with in the infinite living Mind of God. It can be justifiably stated therefore that everything and everyone in existence is an “idea” in the infinite Mind of God, a God who has the unlimited capacity to hol d an infinite number of “ideas” within His/Her Mind. The question might then arise however, as something can never be created out of nothing, from what could the infinite Mind of God have created the Universe? Some might speculate God created the Universe out of Him/Her Self. This however simply cannot be the solution because we already kn ow that God cannot be added to, subtracted from or otherwise divided in any way. How then could God have created the Un iverse? The ancient knowledge tells us the entire Universe, the Macrocosm is a mental cr eation within the Infinite Living Mind of God, in exactly the same way as human beings, the microcosm, made in the true image of “God”, create mentally with our own individual Minds. So again, everything and everyone in the entire Universe is maintained as an “idea” within the infinite Mind of God. The human Mind is therefore a microcosmic reflection and integral aspect of the Macrocosmic Mind of God. This view of the Universe is also entirely consistent with the holographic view of quantum physics. A hologram is ultimately a projection where each of the parts is equal to the whole, and the w hole is also equal to all of its parts, which in turn is completely consistent with a projection of the Mind. It is most important to understand however while considering this, that only the very lowest aspect of the Universe, the physical world in which we live is comprised of physical matter. The physical world is still however an illusi on. It does of course s eem very real indeed to human beings experiencing the world as a perceived reality through the limitations and mediation of the five of the five physical senses, however on a Universal sca le the physical world of matter"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 103 is indeed an illusion. Ea stern philosophies often refer to the illusion of the physical world as “maya”. Quantum physics has also demonstrated “Quanta” only come into existence when actually observed, which is equally true of the physical world of matter which only really exists when observed through the mediation of the five physical senses, the Energy of which being decided by the Mind. Within the true realities of the inner worlds or “planes”, everything is instantly created by m eans of the imagination. God is the Ultimate Mind, the Ultimate Creator, and t hus created the entire Universe, the Macrocosm in all of its spheres , the physical, Astral and Mental worlds in His/Her infinite Mind, in exactly the same way as man creates in his or her own Universe , the microcosm in his or her own Mind. These might at first seem like difficult concepts to understand, but later in this book we will see exactly how we all create and control our own realitie s both in the physical world and the inner worlds, in exactly the same way as the ultimate reality of the entire Universe wa s created within the infinite Mind of God. There is no difference between the means of creation by the human being, the microcosm and God, t he Macrocosm, merely being a matter of scale. At the most f undamental level t he entire mental Universe and therefore “God” is pure vibration, Energy. As Spirit, immortal Sons and Daughters of God, we are all manifestations of that very same Energy and are al l therefore individual, immortal aspects of “God”, the very highest manifestation of Energy, vibration. Spiritually we are all made in the true image of God. As can be seen from the following aphor isms, the diverse religions of the world, notwithstanding their other doctrines have always been in full agreement with this percept ion of “God” whether they choose to accept it or not: Christianity: “ The kingdom of heaven is within you ” Islam: “ Those who know themselves know their God ”"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 104 Buddhism: “ Look within, t hou art Buddha ” Vedanta, part of Hinduism: “ Atman and Brahman are one ” Note: Atman is individual consci ousness and Brahman is Universal consciousness Upanishads, part of Hinduism: “ By understanding the self, all this Universe is known ” Yoga, part of Hinduism: “ God dwells within you as you ” Confucianism: “ Heaven, earth and human are of one body ” And finally a quote from the Chri stian bible which highlights this truth very well: “On that day, you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you ” -- John 14:20”  "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 105 Chapter 18: The Wisdom of the Inner Planes In addition to the ancient wisdoms of the world as received and taught over the course of many thousands of years, and much more recently the conclusions of modern quantum physics, the same knowledge is constantly being obtained and c onfirmed from beings of the inner spheres just as it has always been from time immemorial. Thousands of people are now actively pursuing Astral Projection, visiting the Astral worlds and obtai ning knowledge at first hand from the beings and vast record sources ex isting there. Others are able to employ Mental projection in order to make contact with, and obtain information from high Spiritual intelligences who’s task it is to progress the developm ent of mankind. There are many such intelligences specialising in every possible aspect of the ongoing evolution and progression of humanity. Yet other people are now, from alter ed states of Consciousness and meditation accessing the vast and infinite sour ce of all Universal knowledge known as the Akashic Record. In addition there are thousands of people receiving information and confirmation of the inner truths and realities by many other means and in many different situations, all of whic h is happening incr easingly frequently in this early twenty first century. It should be readily apparent therefor e that it is no longer necessary to rely upon “belief systems” and books of questionab le origin.

Energy is vibration; human beings consist entir ely of pure Energy in the form of a physical body, even though the human body and physical surroundings might appear to be solid in accordance with the five physical senses. How can this be? Matter compri ses smaller units known as molecules, and still smaller units known as atoms. Yet smaller still we find sub-atomic particles which in turn are made up of still finer particles and so on, until the ultima te constitution of anything is of pure Energy vibrating at specific rates according to individual characteristics. From The Source , The Prime Creator, God, down to the densest of matter there ar e an infinite number of modes of vibration. This is also now one of the basic accepted principles of quantum physics with the discovery that sub-atomic particles are ultimately not particles at all, but are rather progressively more subtle forms, until ultimately consisting of vibration, pure Energy and units of probability. This Energy is also known as “Li ght”. This is not the light commonly known in the physical Universe as for example emanating from The Sun, but rather the Pr imordial Light from wh ich everything in the Universe was created, lives and has its Being, the Primordial Light of God. As observed by quantum physicist David Bohm, the physical Universe of matter can be considered to be “frozen Light”. So how do we reconcile this wit h multi-dimensiona l reality? We need to look at vibration much mo re closely in order to understand this. Most people know sound for ex ample is vibration, and a very powerful vibration at that. Loud noises cause windows and other"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 108 structures to vibrate, and indeed a s ound of a high enough pitch or amplitude can cause fragile objects to shatter completely. The frequency range of perception of the ear of the average human is from around sixte en thousand vibrations per second, up to around forty thousand vibrations per second. Moving up the vibrational scale we reach electric ity at around one bi llion vibrations per second. Moving up the vibrat ional scale further still we encounter heat at two hundr ed billion vibrations per second. Further up the scale the spectrum of visibl e colours vibrate in a range of around five hundred billion vibrati ons per second, and yet higher still is the invisible spectrum of colour including infra-red and ultra- violet. And so we can move fu rther progressively up through the levels of vibration, still manife sting as Energy known to science, until we reach the higher levels where we encounter x-rays which vibrate at around two trillion vibrations per second. As we progress up still higher in the scale of vibration we reach levels which do not manifest any characteristics known yet to modern science, and are therefore largely st ill ignored, overlooked or deemed not to exist at all; in other words vibration is often deemed by science to be finite as it pertains to the physical world and can be measured by scient ific instrumentation. However the reality is very, and fundamentally different. It is erroneous to conclude that progressively higher levels of vibration do not exist, simply because they cannot be observed or measured by science. Vibrating at speeds completely beyond the comprehension and observation of science are the inner dimensions of the planes of co rrespondence, The Great Astral, Mental and Spiritual planes. Ultimately, if something were to raise its vibrations to a high enough leve l it would rejoin The Source, God, The First Cause, and this indee d is the same ultimate destiny of every human being, each constantly raising vibrations of the Soul and Spirit by virtue of t he process of perfection, ultimately realising the potential to achieve vibratio nal harmony with God, at which"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 109 point the vibration of the Spiritua l body of the individual would be approaching that of God. In addition, all life manifesting at any level of the continuum of the Universe vibrates at a level being exactly equivalent to the plane or sub-plane they occupy, but each at the same time exhibiting characteristics providing all forms of life in the Universe with unique individuality. It is due to the fact that a Soul or Spirit body of a human being vibrates in harmony, at the same rate or frequency as the plane, sphere, dimension being occupied, that everythi ng seems, and indeed is totally solid and real. This of course also applies to the physical world, which is also a rate of vibration, as is every human being and indeed all forms of life and everything else existing in the physical Universe. Everything is Energy and ther efore vibration. Everyone and everything therefor e “tunes” into the pl ane, world, sphere, dimension, corresponding to their own unique vibration. This is analogous to television or radi o whereby although there are thousands of programs all being broadcast into the Ether concurrently, it is only usually possible to tune into one such program being broadcast at its ow n particular frequency at any one time. Beyond the confines of the physi cal world of matter, frequency of vibration, Energy is t herefore the means by which all life manifests and exists within its own unique, i ndividual, corresponding level, or plane and state of reality. This also fully explains why humans, and indeed all forms of lif e upon passing on to the Astral worlds after the “death” of the physical body fi nd a world which is every bit as “solid” and “real” as the physical world; in fact the Astral worlds are much more “solid”, and more “r eal” and vibrant than the physical world, and this becomes progressively more the case with the ascent to the ever inner spheres . The higher the level of Energy, the finer are the corresponding vibrations, and accordingly"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 110 everyone and everything within that le vel of Energy or vibration will be much more “finely tuned” with i t. Physical matter by comparison, being at the lowest level of Ener gy and vibration is extremely coarse. So everything in the Universe, The All, God is in a perpetual state of vibration, up to and including The Source E nergy Who exhibits a level of vibration of such an infi nitely high degree and of such intensity that He/She can almost be considered to be at rest. Such levels of vibration are far, far beyond any current human comprehension. This can be conc eptualised on the physical plane by observing spoked wheel from a sideways perspective, spinning ever faster. The wheel soon achieves such a rate of rotation as to appear stationary and not spinning at all, its spokes appearing to be invisible to the physical senses of the human eye. As discussed earlier, science now re cognises the fact that the “phenomena” with which everyone is so familiar such as heat, light, temperature and magnetism are all but differing degrees of vibration, each exhibiting unique characteristics, and each of which everyone can readily recognise and experience by means of the five biological senses. Modern scienc e however is nevertheless still struggling to fully explain such important characteristics as cohesion, molecular attraction and a ffinity, and in particular the very force keeping everything rooted firmly on the ground, thereby preventing things from floating off into space; the force of gravity. Vibration plays an extremely important part in the everyday lives of everyone by way of normal thinking processes and states of being. Thought’s, emotions, desires, te mperament indeed any mental state of Mind or being are all ul timately degrees and aspects of Energy as vibration, as of course is thought itself. This is just one reason why in the collective plan e of the human Mind thoughts can, often unwittingly or even intentiona lly be projected, and can affect other people by the proce ss of induction. These are major factors in so called “paranorma l phenomena” which peop le recognise as “telepathy” and other forms of Mind power. It is also the reason why"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 111 a persons “mood” can affect thos e around that person, a “mood” simply being an energetic state of vibration. It is a most important fact that every single thought, every single state of Mind and every single emoti on is each characterised by its own unique vibration. In the physical world of matter these vibrations and “thought forms” are not readily apparent to the physical senses, however as we wil l see later in this book, in the infinitely finer degrees of the As tral worlds and beyond, thoughts and thought forms can actually be seen to be inst antly created and projected, and which thought forms will persist in accordance with the level of Energy with which th ey were originally projected. As we will also see later in th is book, those who understand these laws of vibration an d mentalism can exercise a high degree of control over their own individual thought processes, thus gaining a high level of control over their own states of Mind, moods and emotions. In the same way, a pers on who is well practiced in these disciplines can also affect the Minds of others by applying the same laws; very often people do this without even realising it. On the Mental plane therefore, and in part icular on the pl ane of the human Mind, people produce thought Energy, vibrations which can effect themselves and the peopl e around them either unintentionally or at will. It should be pointed out that conscious and effective use of these abilities can usually only be acquired by the means of dedication and practice over some period of time, although there are a very few people in ex istence who can command these powers as a natural abili ty, often from birth. The principles we have discussed so far will explain many of the so called “phenomena” that have been demonstrated over the ages by the great Masters, Adept s, Guru’s and others, often considered to be “miracles”. All these people are really doing is to consciously control completely natural Universa l laws, and in pa rticular, in the case of physical manifestations, t he law of vibration, in order to alter or transmute one form of Ener gy, vibration, into another form of Energy, thereby altering the fo rm of physical objects. This would"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 112 appear as miraculous to those w ho have yet to fully comprehend the law of vibration, and indeed comprehend a ll Universal laws, but yet is an ability that everyone has the potential to realise.   "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 113 Chapter 20: The Law of Cause and Effect The law of “Cause and Effect”, sometimes referred to as “Causation”, is an immutable Un iversal law, encompassing the principle that nothing in the Universe can ever happen by chance. For everything that happens, in other words for every effect, there is always a corresponding cause pr eceding it without exception. The principle of Cause and Effect is and always has been widely accepted throughout the ages as a mo st exalted Universal law, and one always to be totally respected. To not fully accept the laws of Causation would be to suggest that everything happening in the Univer se does so by pure “chance”, “luck”, “fortune”, or even by some other equally intangible random factor; a notion which is clearly completely unthinkable! Nothing but nothing ever occurs by chance or as a random occurrence, every single action or effect has an underlying cause; there are no exceptions to this, ever. If this were not the case the entire Universe would instantly collapse in to a state of utter chaos in an instant. There has often been confusion when considering the law of Cause and Effect. How for example can one “thing” be the cause of, or the “creator” of a second “thing” people might ask? In fact this is an entirely erroneous way of viewi ng this law, because no “thing” actually “creates” any “thing” else. Cause and Effect deals rather entirely with a whole series or chain of events, one following the other in perfect succession. In this context an “event” may be defined as something occurring as a direct result of a preceding event, and is therefore part of a flow of such events, all of which ultimately originate directly from The Source, The First Cause, God. Therefore there is always, without except ion, a relationship between any specific event and everything preceding it, and subsequently everything that follows . A graphic example of the laws of Cause and Effect would be to c onsider your own very existence. If a certain male had not met a ce rtain female some hundreds of thousands of years ago, way back in the earliest times of mankind,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 114 then you simply would not exist today in human form. The cause in this particular case is the ma le and female getting together and reproducing, and subsequently you along with countless millions of other people are the corresponding effects many millennia later. You are not therefore merely a product of chance. Absolutely every action we take, even every single thought, has its corresponding effect whether it is instantly, the near future as measured in Earth time, or the di stant future; there are absolutely no exceptions to this immutable Universal law of Cause and Effect. It is due in part to the lack of th is knowledge that most people have no control over their own exis tence on Earth, and accordingly exhibit very little true freedom. P eople are swept along with events in accordance with the laws of Cause and Effect, from day to day, always being influenced by situations, other people and other factors. People might well protest at this assertion claiming they are indeed free to “do as they please” . Indeed they are; all are blessed with freewill, but in actual fact how many people really do exhibit the results of such freewill? Yes, t hey are free to “do what I want” or “do as I please”, but the questi on still arises, what makes people “want”, and to “do as I please”? These “wants” and “pleases” are actually all relative. What c auses someone to “want” to do a particular thing in preference to another, or “please” to do something else? The “wants” and “p leases” are therefore entirely dependant on each other. Those who can control their own lives are never carried along on a tide of “wantings” and “pleasi ngs”, but rather exert genuine, conscious will and focus in order to proactively determine precisely what they need to accomplish, and accordingly to set about creating the corresponding causes k nowing they will result in the corresponding desired effects. Th is then becomes a predetermined act or cause rather than simply a part of a chain of random events existing around most people. Most people are carried along in life from the moment they are born, swept through the “game of life” as paw ns on a chessboard."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 115 People are influenced by, and are obedient to families and friends, the wills of others, their environ ment and many other factors, all continually sweeping them along wit hout any sort of conscious will or control over their own futures. People simply do things because “it is the way things are done”. C ause and Effect is prominent in these situations, each person unwittingly enacting the effect of a preceding cause without th inking twice about it. People remain oblivious to this la w and the inexorable influence it exerts upon their own lives. We will see later in this book how this law can be put to positive effect, so rather than merely being a pawn in the game of life, anyone can become a king or queen, with total control over the “game”. This is not to say that a person with such control is no longer subject to the immutable law of Cause and Effect, but are rather now making conscious and positive use of this law. So there is no such thing as “ch ance”. The principle of Causation, the law of “Cause and Effect” is always present and always in operation, both in your life and everyone else’s life, effect following cause in perfect, immutable sequenc e. Nothing but nothing ever happens outside of the Law, and equa lly importantly nothing ever acts contrary to the Law. Mankind should never be a pawn to these laws, but should rather master and work with them in providing for genuine needs, and most im portantly for the ultimate destiny of every human being, the ascent back to our Divine Creator. Those who understand and practice these laws will discover the inner will always prev ail against the outer in perfect immutable succession, until finally taking refuge in the Law itself, “and laughs the phenomenal laws to scorn”. Again it must be stressed; Causation, the law of Cause and E ffect, is a most exalted law, which every person without exception should understand and master, as one day ev eryone surely will. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 116 Chapter 21: The Elements We have already discussed how t he entire Universe consists of vibration from the very highest vibration of The Source, The First Cause, God, to the very lowest vibrations comprising the physical world of matter. We have also discu ssed how all vibration is Energy and how vibration can manifest an unlimited number of unique characteristics. Another name fo r The Source, The First Cause, God, is the “Ether”. This is not necessarily the Ether referred as recognis the medium of Energy in which everything in the Universe exists in the form of vibration. Be fore the Universe came into being there was only The One, The Source, God. The very beginning of the creation of the Univ erse within the Mind of The One is symbolic ally identified with those well-known words “ Let there be Light ”, Fiat Lux! At that poi nt the entire Universe was thus created within the infinite Mind of God, God then became The First Cause for the Universe and The Source of everything that Is. And so it was then that entire magni ficent Universe in all of its spheres came into being. It should also be noted this does not only apply to the physical Universe according to science wit h its “big bang theory”, or indeed as interpreted by religion as wri tten in Genesis I, but it rather applies to all the Great Planes of lif e from the very highest vibration of The Source, The First Cause, God, descending all the way down to the physical world of. Matter This process symbolically began with “The Word”. “The Word” is not the same as a word in t he form of physical language as is commonly understood, but rather the s ending forth of vibrations of Energy within the Mind of God, in the form of images, giving rise to the constituents of the Ether, and ultimately givi ng rise to the creation of the entire Universe in all of its glorious realms of life and reality, again, all by imagination in the infinite Mind of God. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 117 Everything is the Universe is t herefore an “idea” within the infinite Mind of God, created by the infini te imagination of God in the Macrocosm, just as we, as Sons and Daughters of God, made in the true Spiritual image of God are creators of our own reality, the microcosm in the same way as God created the entire Universe, the Macrocosm. As inseparable aspects of God, there is no difference at all between the creati on by God or any aspect of God; Mind, concentration and imagination are Universal creative forces through which everythi ng has its Being. The Ether is symbolically compris ed of the four “elements” from which everything in existence in t he entire Universe in all planes of life came into being upon The Word; these are the elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth, of which the Ether, The Source, Spirit, God, is the very finest, the Quintessence of the others, the primordial Light. It should be made clear from the outse t that the elements are not in any way separate from Energy or vibration, but are rather configurations of Energy and vibr ation, each element having its own unique characteristics in accordan ce with the Energy configuration of which each element comprise s. The elements can therefore be considered to be “building blocks” of Energy. Each element, as a configur ation of Energy, influences corresponding Energy just as a ll Energy has the capability to influence any other Energy, as with thought Energy for example. In this way the elements, under the in fluence of the infinite Mind of God, are Energy buildi ng blocks configured duri ng the initial act of creation, and in the form of Energy contributing to the sustaining of the Universe in all of its realms of glory. It must be stressed once again from the very outset that these are not the commonly recognised fire , air, water and earth which everyone is so used to in the material world; in other words fire as in flame, water as in rain, the air we breath or the ear th in which we sow seeds, but are rather the Univer sal attributes of configurations of Energy that are analogous to them, having similar although non- physical characteristics."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 118 Everything that has ever been and ever will be created was as a direct result of the interaction between the Energy configurations, the vibrations of these four Univ ersal elements. The characteristics of each the four Universal Ener gy elements are as follows: The Element of Fire : The first element to descend from The Source, The First Cause, God was the element of Fire. The fundamental Universal attributes of the element of Fire are light, heat and expansion. Al l of creation began with these Universal attributes radiating an d expanding from The Source outwards to the very outermost levels of Energy at which point the physical Universe was formed. The Emerald Tablet of Hermes is an ancient account of this process. It follows therefore that everything without exception in the entire Universe in all planes of life contains the Universal element of Fire. In accordance with the Universal pr inciple of polarity, the Fire element, as with all of the elements is bi-polar, in other words has two poles that are respectively ac tive and passive in nature. The active or positive pole is creativ e and the passive or negative pole is destructive. As well as the Universal attributes of the Fire element as relates to the Macrocosm, the Fire element, like the other three elements, has a profound influence over human beings, the microcosm. As already mentioned, everyt hing in the Universe contains all four elements and human beings are most certainly no exception to this reality. These four elements with t he fifth, the quintessence of the elements are present in the Energy comprising the physical body of matter and also present within the Energy, Astral and Mental bodies which will be discussed in more detail later in this book. The action and balance of the elements in the subtle bodies, and most notably the Astral Body, the Soul, has a very considerable influence over the emotions, tem perament and all other mental attributes of human beings. In additi on, imbalances in the elements will often result in a physically manifesting illness, usually"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 119 diagnosed by doctors as originati ng from a physical medical origin. Of course is is not possible to fu lly cure such ailments by physical means, but rather to only mask t he symptoms. In accordance with Universal laws, and in particula r the law of Correspondence, all diseases first originate in an inner body before manifesting in the physical body as a physically observ able illness. As we will discuss later in this book, this knowledge is used in the process of Holistic healing which brings about the cure in the inner body originating the disease in order for the cure to then manifest in the outer, physical body in the form of an observable physical cure of even the most serious conditions, some of which cures are deemed to be “miraculous”. The elements also correspond to the five physical senses through which the physical body experiences the physical world. The Astral Body, or Soul, experiences the physical world through the mediation of the five physical se nses, and is a primary reason why the Astral Body or its intermediar y Energy, or Etheric Body are in turn so fundamental to the balan ce and well-being of the physical body. The Energy body is the Energy interface between the physical body and the Astral body, t he Soul. Again, this is also a basis of most Spiritual and Energy based healing. In the Mental Body, the immortal Sp irit, the Fire element gives rise to the emotional attributes of Energy, might and passion. It is ultimately the Mental Body, the immort al Spirit that ac tuates the five physical senses through the mediati on of the inner senses of both the lower Astral and physica l bodies thereby enabling the perception of the senses involved. The Fire element, in recognition of its fundamental property of expansion is also known as the “ele ctric fluid”. As we will see later, the “fluids” are a very import ant aspect of the Ether in the propagation and maintenance of the Universe. The Element of Air : The next element to descend from The Source during the creation of the Universe within the infinite Mind of"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 120 God was the element of Air. Air is not a true element in the same way as Fire and Water, but is nev ertheless fundamentally important to the balance of the Universe. The function of the Air element is to act as a Universal Energy mediator between the elements of Fire and Water element. In the course of this mediation the Air element acquires characteristics of both Fire and Water, and in particul ar the attributes of warmth from Fire and moisture from Water. These are Universal Energy attributes, configurations of Energy present in all planes of life. The Element of Water : Water was the third Element to descend from the The Source, The First C ause, from God. The element of Water has exactly the opposite proper ties to those of Fire, its Universal Energy characterist ics being principally those of contraction and coldness. As with all of the elements Water also has its two polar opposites the actions of which are vital to the great Universal scheme of things. The active, or positive pole of the Water Element is nourishing, preserving, and life givi ng, while the negative pole is decomposing, fermenting and di spersing. The Fire and Water elements are inter-dependant on each other, being equal and opposites from a Universal polar perspective. The Water element represents the So ul, the Astral Body. Just as the Fire element is also analogous to the Electric fluid, the element of Water is analogous to the “Magnet ic fluid” in recognition of its fundamental property of contraction. The Element of Earth . Like Air, Earth is not a true element but is rather the result of the interaction of the other three elements, Fire, Air and Water. The main characterist ic of Earth is the property of solidification. As this occurs the Earth element assimilates the other three elements from whic h it is constituted t hus providing them with a solid form. It is due to the activities of the elements during this process that the material Universe of physical matter came into"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 121 being during the great act of crea tion, along with t he physical world attributes of measure, space, wei ght and time as they are known to science and people generally. All created life came into being then as a di rect result of the interaction of Energy analogous to the properties of Fire, Water and Air expanding from The Source, The First Cause, God, eventually resulting in the physical, solid Un iverse analogous to the element of Earth. Again, the Earth element has, lik e the other elements, unique characteristics of vibration or E nergy, and is not therefore merely the actual physical Earth of solid matter as constituted by the elements at the lowest level of Energy vibration and highest density. It is also important to note that we are not merely referring to the planet “Earth”, but rather to the entire physical Universe as known to science, the creation of which is analogous to the “big bang” theory of the astrophysicists. Science is constantly seeking the origin of the “big bang” in the physical Universe. However, as we will discuss later in this book, science will never find a single orig in within the physical Universe for the “big bang” and therefore the origin of the st art of creation, because in the beginning the Univ erse was created out of and by The Source, The First Cause God beyond the confines of space and time, a place where all exists in the “Eternal Now”. So the descent of the element s occurred beyond space and time, expanding through the Et her with progressively lower vibration and increasing density, un til finally resulting in so lidification in the form of the physical Universe as obs erved by science and everyone else by means of the five physical s enses. As previously mentioned, quantum physicist David Bohm very aptly referred to the physical Universe of matter as “frozen light”, which indeed it is; the primordial Light of t he Ether, The Source, God, “frozen” in the density of the lowest vibration of Energy and manifesting as the physical Universe."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 122 It should once again be noted that the elements are all components of the Ether and therefore also of vibration the characteristics of which they still retain, so the soli dification process analogous to the Earth element is still subject to the la ws of vibration, which in turn is why all matter is ultimately constituted of sub-atomic particles, atoms and molecules of unique proper ties, together giving rise to the chemical elements and compounds as recognised by science. In the beginning it was when Universal E nergy including that represented by the elements expanded outwards to such an extent that the vibrations slowed to fo rm the sub-atomic particles, atoms and molecules of which all ph ysical matter comprises. Again however, chemical element s should not be confused with the Universal Elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth, and neither should they be confused with the ph ysical fire, air, water and earth of the same name. The Universal elements, like the entire Universe in all spheres of life and reality are configurations of Energy influenced by the power of Mind, ei ther the infinite Mind of God during the great creation, or of human and other beings in the microcosm. The “big bang” theory is to scientists as Genesis I is to religion. The story of Genesis, like almost all of the biblical accounts is very deeply symbolic, intended for those who would understand its true meaning. Unfortunately, over the millennia, these accounts have all been interpreted and translated in material terms, and the true meaning has long been subsumed by creed and dogma. Genesis is an account of the greater act of creat ion in all planes of life, and not merely of the physical planet Earth as is generally supposed by orthodox religion. This concludes our analysis of the four Universal elements and of vibration, Energy, of which ever ything and everyone in the Universe in all spheres of life and reality without exception is constituted. One of the key principles in the health and well-being of all tetrapolar life, that is to say life wh ich is constituted from all four of"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 123 the elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth is in the maintaining of a fine balance of the Energy and vibration of the elements. In the Astral worlds there are vari ous degrees of beings existing in the form of a configuration of Ener gy comprising a single Element, some of which beings are fairly advanced in nature including such creatures as are more commonly a ssociated with “fairy tales”, and some of which are much more basic in nature. The more basic beings of the single elements are known as “elementaries” when they exist in the Astral planes, an d “elementals” when their principle habitat is within the Mental planes. Despite their comparative simplicity, these beings are neve rtheless very important in the grand Universal scheme of things. We will discuss these and the more advanced beings of the single elements later in this book. In summary, the Universal elements of Fire, Air, Water and Earth are configurations of Energy t hat are analogous to their Earthly recognised counterparts, and eac h of which exhibit unique characteristics, forming Energy building blocks within the Universe. These elements not only exert a pr ofound effect over human beings at all levels, but also withi n the Universe as a whole. Many human diseases are a direct result of an imbalance of the Energy of the elements within the inner Energy, Astral or Mental bodies, and which in turn manifest in accordance with the Law of Correspondence within the ph ysical body as a physically observable ailment. The elements also have a profound effect on human characteristics such as emotion, and many other a ttributes at the mental level, and give rise to psychological imbalances and sometimes an observable mental illness. Equilibr ium of the elements within the human body is a fundamental aspect of the ongoing process of evolution and perfection that is the ongoing mission and destiny of every single human being without any exceptions.

Balancing of the elements comprisi ng the human being at all levels is therefore extremel y important for progre ssion, a fact that everyone should not only be fully awar e of, but also to integrate into ongoing life, processes that will be discussed later in this book where we discuss the ex tremely important iss ues of creating your own reality, and controlling your own destiny, all of which are ultimately within every Son and D aughter of God by virtue of the infinite powers of the Mind.   "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 125 Chapter 22: Vital Energy All life is sustained by means of “Vital Energy”, the “Life Force” pervading the entire Univer se in all dimensions or planes of life and reality. This unseen Energy, an Energy that has not yet been formally identified or measured by the three dimensional world of science, has many names according to the various cultures, traditions, practitioners, healers, and esoteric orders who are aware of and make use of its presence. Such names for Vital Energy include “Prana”, “Chi”, “Ki”, “Psi ”, “Ruah”, “Breath of Life”, “Bioplasma”, “Manna”, “Life Force” , “Orgone”, “Odi c Force”, “The Force” and often, and most appropriat ely, simply “Vital Energy”. In fact Vital Energy with all of its names is still fundamentally the Universal Energy from which all things are made and are integral aspects; the Energy of The Source, The First Cause, of God. Vital Energy is not therefore a differ ent type of Energy, but rather another name for it. As so many people involved with hea ling refer to this influence of Energy as “Vital Energy” we will hi therto refer to this life force as “Vital Energy” being a most appropria te and accurate description of the nature of this force in all of its names in the context in which it is applied. So Vital Energy is still the very same Energy that pervades the entire Universe from which all things originate, but in this context can also be regarded as a “Spiritual substance”, the food of all life in all spheres of the Universe. In the inner spheres, the Astral and Spirit worlds, all life is sustained by the “breathing” and “absorption” of Vital Energy as part of an entirely natural process performed subconsciously, much as humans and other forms of physical li fe breathe air. In fact all earth life, including humans “b reathe” in Vital Energy through the mouth as part of the normal respiratory process, and also, although subconsciously and usually without awareness, through the pores"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 126 of the skin. Although this is an entirely natural, automatic and unconscious process, it is nevert heless absolutely “vital” for the sustenance of all life, without which, life, including human life simply could not exist being an aspect of the same Universal Energy from which all life originated and is su stained from The Source, The First Cause, God. Vital Energy has many powerf ul and sometimes wonderful characteristics when applied in the direction of healing. A particularly important branch of “a lternative medicine” is known as “Pranic Healing” which is well-k nown in eastern countries, and is now becoming increasingly prac ticed around the world as its healing powers are more widely recognised. As we have already mentioned, the human body, being comprised of pure Energy, is also dependant on Vital Energy in order to maintain it, and this also applies to the subtle Etheric, Astral and Mental bodies. When a person becomes ill, although the illness usually manifests as a physical problem, for example as headaches, lethargy, pains and m any other such symptoms, the origin of these ailments is very often not within the physical body itself but rather within the “Ener gy Body”, often known as the “Etheric Body”. Such ailments c an be caused by a wide variety of situations as we will discuss later in this book, many of which can respond, often dramatically to Pranic Healing. The process of Pranic Healing in a ll of its variations involves the accumulation of Vital Energy by a Pranic Healing practitioner, who then directs that accumulated Energy towards the location within the Energy Body of the ailment of the patient. The Energy Body has several main “centres” which are vitally important. These centres are mystically known as “chakras” in eastern terminology. There are seven main chakras, each of which has a very specific purpose, and all of which are c onnected to the wider and vastly complex energetic syst ems of the subtle Energy Body. Bioplasmic disturbances in any part of the Energy Body and in particular a"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 127 chakra or other Energy centre, wil l usually manifest as a physically observable illness. Of course, and quite understandably, doctors will attempt to treat these illnesse s by physical means by the use of medicines, surgery, therapy and so on, but in fact t he only real and enduring cure is entirely non-physica l in nature, being firmly rooted in the Energy Body of the patient. In these cases, no amount of medicines or surgery wil l bring about a cure. We will discuss Pranic Healing in more detail later in this book. Another “alternative”, well-known and often highly effective form of treatment is Acupunctur e. This is an ancient but increasingly popular Chinese procedure whereby sharp, very fine needles are inserted at critical points of the physical body, but which points actually correspond to important Energy points within the Energy Body. The needles are not therefore affecting physical nerves as some doctors might suppose, but are rather acting upon the balance and flow of Vital Energy within the invisible Energy Body, thereby bringing about relief or often a complete cure. Acupuncture is a highly skilled profession whereby a detailed knowledge of the Energy Body, its balancing points or “meridians”, and of Vital Energy itself, known as “Chi” in China, is required. Acupuncture also makes use of t he principle of polarity, where Energy points can be subject to opposite poles of balance know as “Yin”, the negative polarity, and “Yang”, the positive polarity. Another well-known and extremely popular exercise in Chinese cultures involving Chi, pronounced “chee”, is known as “Tai Chi”. Tai Chi exercises balance the flow of Vital E nergy around the body, thereby facilitating a better st ate of health and well-being. Yet another form of healing making us e of Vital Energy is known as “Reiki”; a Japanese word meaning qu ite literally “Universal life- force”; “Rei” meaning Un iversal and “Ki” meaning “life force”. Reiki, like most forms of Energy based heal ing, can either take place with the patient in the same physical room as the Reiki practitioner, or at any distance. Distance is most cert ainly no barrier to any form of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 128 healing making use of Vital Energy, as it fully conforms to the Universal laws as previously discussed, and accordingly neither time or space are relevant to, or form any sort of barrier to the use of Vital Energy for healing. Vital Energy is also the force behind many esoteric and psychic abilities. These abilities are not func tions of Vital Energy in and of themselves, they rather conform to the Universal laws relevant to the plane upon which they manifest as Energy vibrating in harmony at that level. Vital Energy is litera lly the Energy or driving force that adds “potency” and therefore e ffectiveness to the operation involving Universal Energy. Generally speaking, the more Energy behind an energetic operation, the more instantly effective it is likely to be, although always in complete accordance wit h the Universal laws, principles and planes relevant to the operati on, as well as the abilities and experience of the practitioner.  "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 129 Chapter 23: Psychic “Phenomena” In recent years in particular, so called “psychic phenomena” have become increasingly more high prof ile, due in part to well-known psychics such as Uri Geller, an d the increasing appearance and popularity of psychics on television. The recent revelations of the use of “Remote Viewi ng” by the secret services of various governments has also brought psych ic potential very much to the attention of the world. The most notable remote vie wing situation was a program instigated by the Unit ed States government k nown as “Stargate”. This was a covert “information gathering” operation whereby “remote viewers” sitting at a desk in a quiet room were able to obtain often very accurate information about anything or anyone, completely regardless of the physi cal distance or time involved. In addition to remote viewing, most people have heard of psychic abilities such as telepathy, tele kinesis and divination by means of tarot cards, runes and many other such instruments. Most people will also be aware the multitude of personal “psychic services” on offer today, on the Internet in pa rticular. Although psychic abilities are not strictly necessary in ever yday life, as people progress on the great Spiritua l path such abilities are quite likely to arise spontaneously with Spiritual growth. This certainly does not necessarily imply that those pe ople who already have psychic abilities are Spiritually more advanced than anyone else, but rather some people were born with such abi lities that have been with them all of their lives, and other people have developed such abilities through many years of practice . The following chapters are a summary of a few of the be tter-known psychic abilities. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 130 Chapter 24: Remote Viewing There are various methods of remo te viewing including Ganzfeld, Outbounder or Beacon, Associativ e, Coordinate, Controlled or CRV, Extended or ERV and Sc ientific or SRV. Although all of these methods vary, remote viewing in general terms can be defined as the ability to obtain information on an object or “target” in a remote location across both space and time as it relates to the physical world. Distance and time are t herefore no barriers to remote viewing; the object or event can be anytime in the past, present or even future relative to the physical Universe. Remote viewing is broadly speak ing a controlled shifting of awareness performed from t he normal waking state of Consciousness, unlike many other psychic abilities often requiring a state of trance. Humans, as we wil l discuss later, are all part of a collective Mind existing beyond the limitations of physical space and time. Anyone who is focussed into this “dimension”, “plane” or “state”, which is a level of Energy or vibration, either permanently or temporarily, can potentially proj ect their Consciousness anywhere within time or space in an instan t. Remote viewing works therefore by means of the “remote viewe r” projecting, or tuning their Consciousness into this spacel ess and timeless aspect of the Universe. The remote viewer is then able to obtain information in accordance with “coordinates” they have been provided with by the “tasker”. These “coordinates” are not the sa me as those for example on the grid reference of a map, but ar e rather a group of random numbers created by the “tasker” and assigned to the “target”, i. e. the place or situation from which the remote vi ewer is to obtain information. The remote viewer therefore has no prior knowledge whatsoever of what or where, the remo te viewing target will be. This prevents the possibility of the remote viewer subconsciously including their own interpretation and bias to the information being sensed. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 131 In this spaceless, timeless en vironment, the remote viewing coordinates are associated with the target by the tasker, and are all the remote viewer requires in or der to obtain information from the designated target. It should be pointed out however that the term “remote viewing” is somewhat mislead ing in that there is usually no “visual” aspect to this ability at all. The remote “viewer” rather receives “impressions” from the target, a sort of intuition, and very quickly writes these impression s down in a type of symbolic shorthand as fast as they are received.   "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 132 Chapter 25: Telepathy Telepathy may be defined as the tr ansference of t houghts from the Mind of one person to the Mind of another person, or several other people, usually subconsciously, but in the case of those with high telepathic abilities can also be in tentional. Telepathy often occurs spontaneously whereby a pers on might suddenly receive a “thought” from someone standing nearby, and might even respond to that though verbally much to the surprise of the originator of the thought. This happens much more o ften than people might realise, but very often such received thoughts are dismissed as a “figment of the imagination” originating in the Mi nd of the person who “received” the thought. There are people who can communica te telepathically over great distances and with complete a ccuracy. Space and time are no barriers to telepathy, as the comm unication process is taking place upon the Mental Plane beyond the c onfines of space and time, and is therefore instantaneous , being a projection of Energy in the form of vibration. Although telepathy is an ability that can be learned, there are people who inherently exhibit a very high level of telepathic ability, as sometimes happens in the case of identical twins for example. It should be noted that when a person passes from this world at the time of physical death, all communi cation in the inner spheres of life, the Astral and Spir it worlds takes place by means of telepathy, in other words by thou ght transference in the form of words, images and symbols. In the level of the As tral planes where most people arrive after physical “death”, communi cation is almost the same as telepathic communication would be on the physical plane, but as a person progresses to the inner planes of life, telepathic communication becomes much more sophisticated and “compressed” so that vast amounts of information can be transferred between two or more beings almost instantly as “packets” of communication. This is a subject for discussion later in this book, but such communication in the inner planes is almost"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 133 entirely symbolic, a sort of “p icture language”, and therefore “language” in the form of words simply does not apply. Likewise, languages spoken in the physical wo rld are not relevant, and are no barrier to communications in the inner spheres of life. Everyone in the Astral and inner worlds can therefore communicate regardless of the country or even pl anet from which they originated. Among humans still living on Earth, the physical plane, telepathy can be much more subtle than the transfer of words or even sentences, and people can, and frequently do influence each other at a much more subconscious level. For example when a person is in a good mood, that mood can be transferred to people around him or her, or even at a great dist ance. Whole crowds of people can influence each other in this wa y, and it can often be noted that whole families or groups of office workers might be feeling happy or depressed at exactly the same ti me, or any one of a number of other states of Mind. This is a more subtle but nevertheless important aspect of telepathy , where emotions are being transmitted rather than in tentional communications. So how exactly does telepathy work? There are several laws in operation here conforming in particu lar to the great Universal Laws of Mentalism and Correspondence. We already know from the principle of Mentalism the entire Universe is mental in nature, being infinite Mind and Consciousness, with everyone being a seamless part of the whole. An infinite possible number of direct lines of communication are therefore possibl e. It should be noted at this point that as thought transference is a mental process, it takes place between the Minds of two or more people up on the Mental plane. From the Mental plane a thought is then transmitted to the Astral Body through the Mental matr ix, and finally to the physical human Mind through the Astral matrix where it is interpreted in the form of native language. Again, these communications are still Energy that is vibrating, trans mitted and subsequently received by one or more people who are “in tune” with the same Energy vibrations."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 134 This then is a brief overview of the inner workings of telepathy. Everyone will routinely communicate in this manner upon departing the physical world and ent ering the Astral and late r Spirit worlds. It is also quite likely however that as the human race further evolves, telepathy will become increasingly more common as a means of communication in the physical level of the Earth life system as well.   "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 135 Chapter 26: Karma We have already discussed the Univ ersal principle of Causation, Cause and Effect. Later we will discuss the very important subject of reincarnation and its signifi cance to all human beings. Karma operates within the laws of Caus e and Effect. For every “bad” or negative action an equally “bad” or negative result will occur, and for every “good” or positive action an equally “good” or positive result will occur. Of course in accordance with the principle of polarity there is no such state as “absolute bad” or “absolute good”, but rather only degrees of “badness” and “goodness”. Every deed or “cause” will theref ore bring about its corr esponding “effect”, the degrees of which are completely relative. It should also be noted that Cause and Effect and therefor e karma is still a function of Universal Energy and vibration. Karma literally means “action”; it is important to note however that an “action” need not only be physica l, but can equally be a thought; a bad thought will cause a corres ponding bad effect at the Mental level, and a good tho ught will cause a corresponding good thought at the Mental level. This is al so in accordance with the laws of Vibration and Mentalism whereby a thought is a cause in the form of vibration, in other words of Energy, yielding its corresponding effect on the level of Energy and vibration of the Mental plane. Although the entire Univer se is subject to the immutable laws of Cause and Effect, the aspect of C ausation known as karma is of fundamental importance. In order to progress along the path of perfection though the Astral and great Spiritual planes on the journey back to our Creat or, it is vital that all bad attributes and deeds are equilibrated, that is to say balanced, transmuted and cancelled completely. Due in no sm all part to a general lack of the understanding of the laws of ka rma, many people continue through their lives causing bad effects, or bad karma, usually without realising it. There is simply no escape from ka rma; sooner or later karma has to be equilibrated within eac h and every person. Fully"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 136 understanding the laws of karma will therefore not only assist on the path ahead, but might also save often considerable pain or discomfort, either in this life or in a future life. Within the multi-dimens ional reality of the i nner spheres, all lives are sequential; that is to say ther e is no such state as a “previous life”, “this life”, “the next life, or “t he life to come” or “the life after that”, but rather all lives are expe rienced as a fully integral aspect of the Universal continuum beyond the space-time level of reality, where the individual Spirit is immortal. Each “lif e” is therefore, in reality, a temporal, physical manife station of the Soul and immortal Spirit, whereby some “time”, as m easured in physical terms is spent in the physical world living within a temporal physical body of matter. Such “time” has no meanin g however in the context of the Universe and eternity. There is no time limit to which karma conforms. Sowing a “seed” of karma creates a certainty that at some point in the future as measured by physical time, the seed will sprout, grow and bear fruit as a corresponding and equal effect. This point in the future might be the current physical life, the next physical life or any future physical life. It is even possible t he “effect” might manifest between physical lives while living in the Astral world if the cause can be equilibrated within the Astral planes. Not only can the creation of a “caus e” be physical or purely mental, even a physical cause has a mental origin, but it can also be either conscious or subconscious. The s ubconscious can therefore create numerous causes without r ealising it, the effects of which still have to be carried, fully accounted for and equilibrated. As we will see later, it is therefor e extremely important that both the ego and the subconscious be controlled in order that they do not cause hidden karmic events. It is not only humans who are s ubject to the laws of Cause and Effect and therefore karma, everyt hing in the entir e Universe is subject to these laws, every person, every animal, fish, insect,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 137 plant, mineral, indeed everyt hing and every being are equally subject to this law on their ow n existential level, there are absolutely no exceptions, it is The Law. As mentioned earlier, even our per sonal thoughts are subject to karma. So, for example if a perso n thought badly of someone else, thereby sending out aggressive, vindictive or other negative vibrations, then one day those same vibrations will without doubt return to the originator, thereby c ausing them to react in the same way. This also works on the ph ysical level whereby if someone were to do or say something resulting in a negative action against someone else, then inevitably that same action would return sooner or later causing the originator to suffer the same effect as the original cause. There is a sayi ng highly appropriate to karma; a person can be “their own worst enemy”. Individual karma can be accumulated over many lifetimes, so when a “bad” thing happens it will not be by mere “chance” or due to “bad luck”, notions which are impossible in the Universe in accordance with the law of Cause and Effect, but rather as a result of some previous equally “bad” cause, a cause which might even have originated many lifetimes ago. According to Hindu philosophy there are three levels of karma. The first level of karma is called “Sanc hita karma”. Sanchita karma is caused by a past situation still awai ting its corresponding effect or reaction. This is in effect then “latent” karma. The next level of karma is the le vel of past causes including those from past lives, the effects of wh ich are still manifesting in the current, temporal lifetime. This type of karma, called “Prarabdha Karma”, is a manifestation of karma shaping the current lives of people. The third level of karma is known as “Future karma”. Future karma is where the causes are being created in the current temporal lifetime, but which will manifest in the future, either later in the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 138 current lifetime or other wise in a future lifetim e as its corresponding effect. Another aspect of karma needing to be considered is that a sequence of “effects” do not necessar ily occur in exactly the same order as the corresponding sequence of the causes that gave rise to them. This is largely due to the possible differences in the magnitude of the original cause, and therefore the first opportunity to become a corresponding effect. A large karmic event, a cause, might not be able to equilibrate it self as a corresponding effect until much later in a lifetime, or i ndeed very often not until a future lifetime. On the ot her hand, a small karmic event, a thought for example, might well yield a corre sponding effect within seconds, minutes or hours of the original c ause. There are no hard and fast guidelines to this, the only cert ainty being the law of karma will inexorably exert itself thr oughout and beyond space and time; everyone should know that no per son whatsoever is beyond this law. Everyone should therefore always be c onsciously aware of karma and live accordingly, always ensuring no bad actions or thoughts are allowed to occur. It should be stressed at this point that karma is not a punishment and reward system. Everyone is provi ded with the free will to do as they please, the significance of which being that everyone must be equally held responsible for their own actions. This is not a court of justice type scenario, but rather only the immutable law of Cause and Effect unfolding perfectly throughout space and time and throughout all spheres of life and reality. As the well-known and highly appropriate saying goes: “as you sow, so shall you reap”. Proble ms arise when people do not understand or choose to ignore th is immutable and exalted law. People, ignorant of the laws of Cause and Effect and of karma, keep on sowing negative seeds thr oughout their lives, remaining completely oblivious to the fact that one day sooner or later the price will have to be paid by means of the corresponding negative effects in the same order of m agnitude, which effects might take"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 139 many lifetimes to equilibrate. On the other hand those who fully understand these laws will always be most careful and diligent about what they think, say and do, in order to ensure no seeds of negative karma are sown, and will onl y sow the seeds of positive karma that will accordingly be of equally positive benefit in the future. The importance of conscious living, being constantly Mindful of all thoughts, actions and of the moment, will be discussed fully in the final section of this book. People who create negative karma for themselves over many physical lifetimes often wonder why negative things are happening to them in their current physical lifetime. They will typically say things like “what have I done to deserve this”, or “why is it always me that has the bad luck”, or “why don’t other people suffer like I have suffered”, and so on. Such people tend to blame everything and everyone except for the true guilt y party; themselves. In reality until such people come to fully understand these great Universal laws, as one day everyone surely will, and to always live by them, they will continue to create negative karmic c auses which will in turn continue to create the corre sponding negative karmic effects for many lifetimes to come, until ev entually all karma has been fully equilibrated. Karma is a very important aspect of individual evolution and progression back to The Source, The First Cause, God, Who is absolute perfecti on, and Who must therefore be approached by absolute perfection as characterised by the Energy and vibration of the Spirit of each individual person. Karma, although an aspect of the great Universal law of Cause and Effect, is also a “tool” for learni ng. We incarnate into the physical world to learn, evolve and to equilibrate karma. As we will discuss in the next section of this book, th is planet Earth is not our true home; it is not reality, the entire physical Univer se is not reality. Our true home as immortal Sp iritual beings is withi n the great Spiritual worlds, including the great Celestial and Cosmic planes of life, beyond the Astral worlds. Life in the physical world is therefore intended to learn the lessons r equired in order to be able to progress to our true home, the glories, splendours, peace harmony"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 140 and Light of the Spiritual worlds, and accordingly karma is one of our greatest teachers. Like all teachers, karma should be afforded the greatest of respect. Those who do not learn these lessons will continue to suffer at the hands of ka rma for day after day, year after year, lifetime after lifetim e until such time as any particular lesson is finally learned. Much more could be said about karma, but suffice it to conclude this subject by emphasising once again the that law of karma provides ongoing valuable opportuni ties to learn lessons, evolve and create good things in life. It is not intended to be a system of punishment, implying an emotional basis that simply is not the case, but is rather an immutable aspect of the balancing of Universal cosmic laws as applies to mankind, the microcosm, the very same laws applying to t he Universe as a whole, the Macrocosm. Nothing but nothing can or does exist outside of these laws that exist to evolve a st ate of perfection of everyone and everything in the Universe. The ent ire Universe is in a constant state of evolution, and karma, a fundamental aspect of the law of Cause and Effect is fundament al to that evolution. Again, everyone shoul d always at all times be completely conscious of karma, positive as we ll as negative, in living day to day lives, and always with an eye on the true meaning of life, our ultimate reality and destiny, as we journey relentlessly along the sacred path back to our Divine Creator. "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 141 Chapter 27: The True Nature of “God” Many of the belief systems of the western world are based upon Christianity and Judaism, with Isla m being prevalent in the Middle East, and Hinduism and Buddhism pr evailing in the Far East. Of these Islam, and in particular Christ ianity in all of its forms rely heavily on the words of their respective books or bibles. A major problem faced by the worl d today however is that many people still live their lives by the lit eral word of these ancient books and by the word of the churches and their representatives, words which are still accepted without question as being the tr uth. Often of course this is also the result of strong, historical family beliefs and traditions, which people genera lly accept and follow without question, usually out of trust and re spect. In other cases, the very high profile of the or thodox churches has l ed people to believe these churches must represent reality, and ther efore people have looked no further for the truth. Accepting a dogmatic or thodox religion is a ve ry convenient way of incorporating a packaged belief system, with the comfort and convenience such a belief system o ften provides.

We can conclude this section wit h the following observations of “God”. The true God does not conf orm to a popular visions of an elderly, stately looking gentleman with a white bear d, adorned in long flowing white robes sitting on a golden throne flanked by Archangels while managing the affa irs of, and judging mankind. The true God is not tyrannical, benevolent or vengeful, and does not exhibit petty human characteristi cs such as jealousy, caprice or anger. The true God does not need or desire to be worshipped or to receive offerings, and is most cert ainly not influenced by flattery or praise. The true God is neither demanding, vengeful or vindictive, and does not rule the Universe from high places as if He/She were a monarchy with the human race as subjects, casting down judgements and punishment s at will for perceived transgressions. The true God does not punish people for failing to believe in Him/Her, for failing to attend a church or failing to accept Jesus as their saviour. This same true God does not in any way require intermediaries or “go betweens” to be positioned in the physical world between Him/Herself and “common man” in order to interpret, represent and convey the “will” of God. No such intermediary has, has ever had or ever can have the ear of God, or indeed possess any other sort of special connections or relationsh ip with God. No such self- appointed representative of God can possibly k now “God’s will” or accordingly convey such “will” to the people, and neither can such intermediaries convey the wishes of the people back to God."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 143 Above all God is neither separate from the Universe or from anyone or anything within the Univer se. God is at once Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent; every human being, all life and everything within the entir e Universe has its bei ng within the infinite Mind of God, and God is within every human being, all life and everything in the entire Universe. Everyone is a totally e qual and integral aspect of God, the supreme Universal Consciousness, The S ource, The Prime Creator, The First Cause, Who in turn is the same absolute, total and complete perfection every single human being is striving to achieve during the course of the journey of evol ution along the Divine path back to God from whence we all originated, of Whom we are all an integral and equal aspect and to Whom we will return.

I would like to commence this sect ion by emphatica lly stating an extremely important truth whic h everyone should know and understand beyond any possible doubt: There really is no such state as “death”. What many people believe to be the finality of “death” is in fact no more and no less than the transition from one state of life and reality, that of th e physical matter, to a state of life of a vastly finer density of the Un iverse, often known as the “Astral planes”, sometimes referred to as “the beyond”, the “fourth dimension” or the “afterlife”. What they are called is of no consequence however, the fact is they do exist and for a time becomes the new home for people departing physical life, before either returning for another life on earth or progressing to the inner spheres of reality, the Mental planes, the Spirit worlds. We will discuss the nature of the Astral planes later in this book, but first we will look at the process erroneously known as “death”. We are all multi-dimens ional beings, each of us having numerous “bodies” corresponding to our many states of “being” within the multi-dimensional Universe. These very broadly consist of the physical body, the Etheric or Energy Body, the Astral Body and the Mental bodies. We have numerous Mental or Spirit bodies, all relating to the infinite degrees and states of vibrat ion, density and being, ranging from the very lowest to the very highest. The Astral Body is often referred to as th e “Soul” and the Mental Body the immortal “Spirit”. It is the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit that is “made in the true image of God”, not the physical body as many suppose. God is pure Spirit, and ultimately every single person exists as pure Spirit beyond all concept of form. The seat of our very “being” or Consciousness is within the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit. The Astral Body, the Soul, actually co nsists of both the conjoined Astral and Mental bodies, and is theref ore can be more accurately referred to as the Astra-Mental Body. These subtle bodies are composed of Energy, vibrations, t he nature of which is completely"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 146 unique for everyone, each indi vidual possessing a unique Energy signature by means of which they can be uniquely identified. Within the inner spheres of reality, t he Astral and Mental planes, people exist at the level of vibration of the Ether that is exactly equivalent to the level of vibration of their Astral and Mental bodies respectively. The level of vibrati on of the Astral and Mental Body depends in turn upon many factor s, including but not limited to individual degree of ennobl ement or perfection, degree to which the ego has been transcended, realisation of Spirit or “God” within, degree of unresolved karma, and most importantly the realisation of the most powerful force in the Universe; Unconditional Love. So what actually happens w hen people experience physical “death”? The circumstances upon wh ich people arrive at the end of their current physical existence obv iously varies very widely, and can range from very sudden death, for example resulting from an accident or sudden illness, thr ough death as a result of a long illness, to natural death as a result of old age; and of course there are numerous possibilities in between. Regardless of the precise circumst ances prevailing at the end of physical life, what follows is subst antially the same in all cases. At the instant where the physical body ceases to function, a large amount of Vital Energy is transf erred to the Etheric Body, also known as the Energy Body. The Etheric, or Energy Body also includes the Astral and Mental b odies. The Etheric Body will then, in many cases become the new “t emporary” body of the recently “deceased” person. Sometimes however the recently deceased person will transition directly to the Astral worlds. What happens next again varies from person to person and circumstance to circumstance, but is usually in the range of the following possibilities. Those who do not transition directly to the Astral worlds will, im mediately after physical death, find themselves very much “alive” in their Etheric Body. A person after “death” can often fully observe everything happening around them, including all people present. In fact what the person is “seeing” is not their"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 147 actual physical surroundings, no l onger having any physical senses and existing a a much higher rate of vibration and lower density as compared to the actual physical worl d, but is rather a very close Etheric “reflection” of those su rroundings; but to all intents and purposes they seem identical. If other people are present, for example doctors, the person might well see and hear himself or herself being pronounced “dead”. The “deceased” person can then, if desired, stay and watch what happens to their “old body”, observe the actions of the people present for example doctors, nurses and relatives, or may decide to immediately go elsewhere. It should be noted that in this much finer state of existence as pure Energy, it is quite possible to travel anywhere in the world or indeed t he entire Universe in an instant, literally at the speed of thought. T he Etheric plane is a Mind world, an extension of the Astral planes and the Universe as a whole, and therefore existing beyond the boundaries and restrictions of physical space and time. The “deceased” person often remains very close to the physical world while the level of Etheric Ener gy in their Etheric Body remains sufficiently high. They will very often make the most of this opportunity to visit and say goodby e to family and friends, and perhaps to visit their old home and fa vourite places they particularly enjoyed in physical life. Of course, living people cannot, with the exception of psychics and clai rvoyants, usually “see” the “deceased” person, and usually any attempt by the deceased person to communicate with living people will fail. Very often the “deceased” person will also attend t heir own funeral, not only to see all family, friends and other peopl e they knew in physical life gatherer to pay their respects, but al so to realise the finality of the end of that particular physical life on Earth. The deceased person can make the decision to transition to the Astral worlds at any time simply by desiring and willing it to happen, and by thinking of being t here, but only if they realise the possibility exists. Otherwise the transition wi ll usually take place naturally"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 148 once the supply of Ether ic Energy is depleted, and the dense Etheric Body will dissipate, giving way to the finer vibrations of the Astral Body, naturally enabling a tr ansition to the appropriate level of the Astral planes in accordance with the level of perfection of the Soul, and the level of vibrations of the person generally. This will determine which part of the Astral planes they will naturally migrate to, most decent people transitioning to the mid-Astral worlds which, as well will see later in this book, are remarkably similar to the physical world that has been left behind. The other extreme occurs when a newly deceased person transitions directly to the Astral world almost immediately after physical “death”. Sometimes they wi ll be aware of their physical death, but very often the first th ing a deceased person will be aware of is a “tunnel of light” into whic h they are pulled at great speed. In other cases the scenery will simp ly fade away from the physical world and “melt” into the Astral world almost seamlessly. Irrespective of how the deceased person arrives in the Astral world, they will never be alone. Other Astral residents, frequently previously deceased relatives a nd friends, will o ften be there to greet them and to help them to settle into their new home. Very often the newly deceased person will arrive at, or be taken to a place in the Astral world which is effectively a “reception area” for newly arrived Souls. There they will be met by a host of helpers with the task of assisting new arrivals to settle in to their new Astral home. Such helpers specialise in al l manner of cases, and are able to assist with the transition proce ss regardless of the circumstances surrounding physical death. There are bi llions of people living within the Astral world, having previously experienced life from the past, present and future of Earth. Every eventuality is fully accounted for, and no person is ever left alone in the Astral worlds after physical death. For most decent people arriving at the mid-levels of the Astral worlds, those who have led a “normal” life and had no strongly held beliefs, in particular religious beliefs, the environment is always extremely"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 149 peaceful and harmonious but otherwise quite similar in many respects to the Earth environment fr om whence they just arrived. If the physical death was sudden, violen t or due to some self-inflicted disorder such as alcoholism, or the person was ill for some time before physical death occurred, t here will be the Astral equivalent of hospitals with doctors and nurses, people who might well have been doctors and nurses in a previous life on hand to assist. Very often, because the Astral worlds can appear to be almost identical to the physical world in appearance, some people simply do not believe they have actually “died”, and therefore cannot understand what has happened. Such people can become most bewildered and confused and might requi re attention by specialist helpers until they can come to terms with their new state of existence in the “afterlife” of the Astral worlds. Another situation requiring a great deal of care from Astral specialists are the cases of child ren, infants and babies who leave the physical world before their time. In these situations there are the equivalent of specialist nurse s and carers on ha nd who will look after the child until he or she is old enough to join a family in the Astral worlds. There are many such families who will gladly take on the responsibility of looking after children who arrived before their own parents. Older children will usually join a family as soon as they have come to terms with t heir new reality and home in the Astral worlds. Children can usually adapt to their new life in the Astral worlds much more quickly than adults, largely because they had not yet been fully indoctrinated into the ways of the physical world. Younger children might well feel at home in the Astral worlds almost immediately as it has not been very long since they originally left the Astral or Spirit worlds to be born into the physical life which they have recently departed. Such children will therefore still be of an age where they can still vividly remember their previous life in the Astral or Spirit worlds. To such infants their stay on Earth was nothing more than a ve ry short adventure, often with"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 150 a specific purpose in their own in dividual evolution and progress on the path. Upon arriving in the Astral worlds most people settle in to their new home very quickly indeed, and s oon create a new “life” for themselves. They will, sooner or late r, completely lose interest in the physical world and their prev ious life associated with it. However, people living in the Astral worlds c an, and very often do “visit” the physical world whenever they feel the need to, often to visit loved ones left behind. Ther e are numerous cases of bereaved family and friends suddenly feeling the “presence” of their loved one, and in these cases it very oft en really is their loved one visiting for a time from the Astral worlds. It should be mentioned that “deceased” people living in the Astral worlds will often watch over thei r loved ones still living in the physical world, guiding them by means of inspiration, and protecting them from inner dan gers whenever possible. Because the Universe is infinite living Mind, thought is a very powerful primary Energy, and it is therefore relatively easy for people in the Astral worlds to influence the Minds of people still living in the physical world. Such influence can suddenly arrive in the Minds of people on Earth as intuiti on, inspiration or ideas, the recipient of such thoughts believing them to be their own thoughts and ideas. Pets, such as cats and dogs, can very often sense the presence of their deceased owners in a very powerful way. It is also possible for people living in the Astral worlds to visit family and others in their dreams. This happens much more often than most people realise. Dr eams of meeting deceased people are often very real indeed, and such contac ts should always be noted, taken very seriously and any messages remembered. Everyone in the physical world leaves their body at night while in deep sleep, and Astral residents sometimes take th is opportunity to meet with their loved ones “face to face” in the As tral worlds, such meetings often being remembered in the morning as a vivid lifelike dream. Again, these meetings are often very real indeed and should always be"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 151 remembered and all messages received well and truly noted. Sometimes important information is passed on this way, as well as reassurances that the “deceased” person is very well, happy and content in their new Astral home. Although it is perfectly natural, and to a reasonable extent healthy to grieve for a deceased loved one, it is most important to realise these people are not really “dead”, and have not t herefore in any way ceased to exist. The loved one is now living in what is actually a truer reality than the physical wo rld. Assuming they are living in the mid to high Astral worlds, or within the Spirit worlds, they will be experiencing an existence of pure love, light, bliss, peace and happiness on a level beyond the comprehension of most people still living on Earth. One of the benefits of Astral Projection, which will be discussed in detail later in this book, is the ab ility to visit and explore the Astral worlds and to meet deceased lo ved ones and friends. To Astral projectors death holds no absolut ely fears whatsoever, with the absolute knowing, bey ond any doubts whatsoever the glorious life waiting after the final re lease from the confines of physical life on the physical plane in the restrictions of a physical body. As we will also see later in this book, everyone in the Astral worlds lives at the same level, the same realm, sphere or plane as people who were of a similar nature in the physical world; similar characters, beliefs and in particula r level of Spiritual development. In the mid-Astral worlds wher e most decent people, probably around fifty percent or more transiti on after physical death, there is no work, no money, no unhappiness, but rather complete peace and happiness, everyone living together in perfect harmony. People, who in the physical world were disruptive in any way, will be living in the lower Astral worl ds with like Minded, similarly disruptive people, thus always pres erving the complete peace and harmony of the inner Astral worl ds. Of course everyone always has the opportunity to evolve from the lower Astral worlds to the inner Astral worlds once they have learned their lessons, and have"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 152 attained a vibration that will enable them to co -exist with others at the same higher level of vibration. People who have left the physical world of matter have been liberated once again, and will live and re st for a time in the Astral and Mental worlds before returning to Earth once again if necessary to begin a new physical life. Friends, relatives and loved ones should celebrate this joyfully ! Death, however sad, tragic or unexpected means the li beration of a Soul from their physical body to the inner worlds of existence where they will be with like-Minded people. Although people still living in the physical world regard those living in the Astral and Spirit worlds as “dead”, to those people who passed on to and our now living in the Astral and Spirit worlds it is the people still living in the density of the physical world, with all of the trials it brings who actually appear to be “dead” by comparison, dead to the splendours, glories, peac e, harmony and liberation of the inner worlds, to which every single person will transition sooner or later. “Death” should never be feared. It is something to anticipate when the time comes as a completely natural aspect of individual evolution, and a transition to glori ous worlds of pure harmony, bliss and beauty, inhabited by like-Mi nded people, where none of the hardships, trials and misery that is so prevalent on Earth exists. The transition of passing to the inner, Astral worlds is a joyous time, a time for celebration. "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 153 Chapter 29: Animals after Passing Many people, most unfortunately, st ill believe human beings to be so superior to animals that anim als should not enjoy the same status, either during physical life or after passing on. This is an extremely unfortunate and erroneous perception, due for most part to the still very egocentric attitude of much of mankind today, in believing human beings to be t he superior creatures of the Universe, and also often due to t he dogma of orthodox religion. Indeed it should be noted that most religions will, even today still not even acknowledg e equal status of female human beings to their male counterparts, much less to members of the animal world. This perceived superiority of humans over animals has also, very unfortunately indeed been exacerbated by to the way humans perceive and therefore treat animals generally. This includes using animals for food, labour, entertain ment, hunting, and of course as pets. Pets of course are generally treated very well, and are usually loved and often respected by their human companions, and which level of love and respect is shared equally by the pet. This perception of th e status of animals should be viewed and understood much more deeply both from a Universal perspective, and also from a historical, physical perspective. In terms of the grand Universal scheme of things, all life without any exception whatsoever is a completely equa l aspect and expression of God. The meaning of the words “God m ade man in his own image” has been drastically misunderstood and misinterpreted by both the creed and dogma of ort hodox religion, and al so by the human ego generally, being deemed to mean liter ally that humans physically look identical to the personified God. Humans accordingly believe they hold some sort of special pos ition in the Universe, all other forms of life being subordinate to the human race. However, the true “image” of God is pure Spirit, the very same pure Spirit of which everything and ev eryone, including all animals are equal aspects, and all are therefor e equal aspects of The Source,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 154 The First Cause of God. From a physical perspective most humans still view animals as inferior and subordinate, accordingly causing many humans to treat and perceive ani mals in this way. The reality is however that no animal life whats oever is in any way inferior to human beings, animals simply being different aspects and expressions of God, differing onl y in terms of appearance, abilities and priorities. Humans for the most part, still be ing governed by the ego, perceive all life relative to human life as bei ng inferior. In fact as all humans will discover after eventually evolving to much higher levels of Spiritual life, to the much more advanced Beings of the inner Spiritual levels of lif e and reality, mankind t oday is by comparison, equivalent to what humans on Eart h now perceive to be the very lowest forms of single celled organi sms. To these advanced Beings of the inner spheres of life, earthly man seems barely capable of even any sort of thought processes. And yet these inner Beings do not in any way whatsoever perceiv e earthly man to be inferior or subordinate in any way, but rat her perceive earthly man with Unconditional Love, as equal aspects of God who are simply further down the path of the evol ution of the individual, immortal Spirit of the journey back to The Source, The First Cause, God. All animals are theref ore equal to human beings, equal aspects of God. The progression of animals after physical death is therefore no different to that of humans, all being relative and specific to each individual type of animal spec ies including human beings. All animals, like humans are Spiri t, and accordingly, like humans survive the death of the physical body. For all those who mourn the passing of a beloved pet, please be absolutely and completely assured your pet is safe and we ll, and is enjoying the peace, harmony and happiness of the inner worlds. Please also be absolutely assured your pet and will not forget their human companions. Just as humans w ho have passed on to the inner worlds frequently visit loved relatives and friends w ho are still living in the physical world, so too do animals."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 155 Your pet might not be any longer by your side in a physical body, but your pet will most assuredly still be with you in Spirit, just as he or she was with you before passing on to the inner worlds. Your pet will still maintain exactly the same love, trust and loyalty as they ever did in physical life, and will c ontinue to express that from the inner worlds. Different species of animals pr ogress in different ways after physical death. Animals who were particularly close to humans in physical life, for example dogs, cats, and other pets, assume a special affinity to the human Spirit, elevating and enabling them to retain a higher level of individu ality and closeness to their human companions. We are advised by inner Spiritual beings that animals who were not particularly close to humans, for example so called “wild” animals, continue to surv ive after physical death within a group Soul of their own species, in a very similar way as they did in fact during their physical life on Earth, continuing to exist often as part of a herd or group animal Mind. There is a vast amount of evidence to prove the continuity of life after the physical death of animals, and particularly pets. During séances for example pet cats and dogs frequently appear before their human companions who are pr esent at the séance, during which they make every possible effort to make their presence known. Just as with human Spirit communication, the way in which the pet makes it’s presence known can vary considerably, but which includes making its usual char acteristic noises in the case of the “direct voice” method of communication, to brushing against the human companion with his or her Etheric animal body, to even fully visible materialisation. All of these methods of Spirit communications will be discussed in much detail later in this book, but suffice it to say for now they include animal Spirit s just as much as human Spirits. Other animals who are still physically living, can also “see” or perceive deceased animals with t heir natural inner Spiritual abilities, and very often can and do r eact to the Spirit of the animal"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 156 in exactly the same way as th ey did when the animal, often a companion, was still physically aliv e. Cats and dogs often have the highly developed psychic abilities that most humans have lost over time, as will be discussed later in this book, and “seeing” their former living companions, pets of the same human during physical life, seems perfectly normal. Pets are never alone after passing from the physical world. Apart from their ability to visit human companions whenever they wish to do so, they are also often bef riended by a human Soul within the Astral worlds who will happily look after the pet on behalf of the still living human companion. This is exactly the same situation as occurs when a child passes on befo re his or her parents; there are always plenty of people within the Astral worlds who will look after children and pets alike. Very often during a séance a Spirit will appear accompanied by the pet of one of the members of t he séance, and which Spirit will provide complete assurance that t he pet is being very well looked after. Very often, as previously mentioned, the pet wil l also make its own presence felt in various ways. Pets do not need formal séance conditions in order to do this. Very often a pet having passed on can make his or her presence felt in varying ways while visiting their human companion. These ways can vary anywhere between a “feeling” of a presence, to actua lly “seeing” the animal very briefly while in a psychically receptive state of Mind, to, as has often happened, actually physically heari ng the animal, sometimes very clearly indeed almost as if he or she where still physically alive in the same room. People who have some degree of psychic or clairvoyant abilities can also very often see their deceased pet just as if they were still physically living. You can be absolutely sure t herefore that pets, and indeed all animals transition to the Astral worlds, to the “heaven” worlds just as humans do, and not only will they remain constant friends and companions after passing, they will also be waiting, that upon the passing of their human companion both will be reunited once again."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 157 As we will discuss later in this book, Unconditional Love is the most powerful vibration, Energy, force, in the Universe, a force keeping Spirits of both humans and animals alike together. The love between an animal and a hum an companion is totally unconditional, and does not dimi nish when the time comes for physically passing from the physica l world to the next stage of life, as will happen with all ani mals and humans alike sooner or later, just as later all loved ones, ani mal or human will be reunited once again in the harmony of the Astral worlds.   "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 158 Chapter 30: Ghosts A “ghost” is a person who after ph ysical “death” is attracted, and stays very close to the physical worl d. This attraction to the physical world motivates and enables the “ghos t” to draw Etheric Energy from their surroundings at will, t hus keeping them grounded in their Etheric Body rather than making t he full transition to the Astral worlds. The reasons for this appar ent preference of “deceased” people are many and varied. Very often a person simply cannot accept the fact they have “died” and no longer have a physical body. Such a person quite simply continues to live in their usual familiar environment, often their house as if nothing had happened, bel ieving themselves to be still living within their familiar physica l body. Such a house is often considered to be “haunted”. In other cases the person is so engrossed and attracted to the material things and habits they enjoyed so much during physical life, they simply cannot stand the thought of leaving those physical addictions behind. Such addictions might include power, drink, drugs, food, sex, or otherwise quite simply the trappings of a very material life. In other cases the person might be harbouring guilt over some aspect of their past life, lingering around seeking to reconcile and correct the situation, which of cour se is simply not possible in their non-physical state. Sometimes a ghost is simply a newly deceased person who is frightened by their unfamiliar circumstances and does not want to move very far. Other recently deceased people might wish to stay close to their loved ones, believ ing erroneously that remaining close to the physical world is the only way to accomplish this. In other cases the “death” of the person might have been particularly violent, due to a murder for example, and in cases such as these the deceased person can become trapped in a “loop”,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 159 continuously enacting the sequence of events leading up to his or her untimely death. In other cases the death might ha ve been extremely sudden, as for example with an accident, murder or heart attack, in which case the person quite simply does not realise they have passed on. Frequently such a person will attemp t to communicate with other people in the physical world, in part icular medical people, relatives and close friends, and simply cannot understand it when those people seemingly take no notice of them whatsoever, not responding to any comm unication attempts. The Etheric plane is an extension of the Astr al plane and therefore space and time as we know it do not exist. Some “ghosts” will therefore play out exactly the sa me sequence of events leading up to his or her physical death, potentia lly for eternity until finally such a Soul can be rescued. Such resc ues are often carried out by people residing in the Astral wo rlds, or sometimes by Astral projectors who are still based with in the physical world. The Soul will then be escorted willin gly to their new home in the Astral worlds where they can finally come to terms with their new situation. Sometimes a person trapped at the level of the Ether ic plane close to the physical world will eventually a rrive at their ow n realisation of the reality they are no longer living within a physical body. Others will come to realise the folly of t heir actions in remaining close to the physical world and of the reasons keeping them there. Such a Soul will then willingly make the tr ansition to the Astral worlds of their own freewill, often without an y assistance, simply by deciding to do so and raising their vibrations. When the Soul of a deceased per son remains in a particular locality, a house for example, the Soul is known as a “ghost”, and the location inhabited by the ghos t is considered to be “haunted”. To a physical person living in a “haunted” house the “ghost” will often seem to carry out exactly the same series of actions every time it makes an appearance, often at the same physical time of day or night, for example “stepping” on a creaky floor board,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 160 walking up the stairs, rattling door handles, mo ving items around, and even switching lights and other electric appliances on and off. This is possible because the Etheric Body is already relatively dense by comparison to the inner As tral and Mental bodies, and a ghost can sometimes achieve the necessary density approaching that of the physical world by ab sorbing large amoun ts of Etheric Energy from their surroundings, suffi cient to influence the density of physical objects. There have been numerous cases th roughout history where ghosts have actually been “seen” with t he physical eyes, often as a billowing white shapele ss cloud, or sometimes even in the form of a cloudy human shape. This is possi ble due to a particularly high concentration of a substance in the physical location where the “ghost” is seen known as “ectop lasm”. Ectoplasm is produced by the Energy Body of living humans, and is normally exuded as a completely natural process of liv ing. All humans living in the physical world continually exude ec toplasm to some extent. Many mediums, particularly during a s éance, are able to produce high or very high concentrations of ectopl asm, often with the assistance of the Spirits present, and very oft en the “sitters” present at the séance also produce ectoplasm under those same conditions, thereby creating the ideal situati on for Spirit communication and even full materialisation to take pl ace. We will discuss this in more detail later in this book. Usually the concentration of ectoplasm in any particular location is not particularly high, especially in relatively new buildings. There are buildings however such as ve ry old houses, and in particular buildings where many people congregat e over long periods of time, for example theatres where the concentration of ectoplasm is much higher than normal. In such circ umstances the Ether ic Body of a “ghost” can interact directly wit h the high density of the white coloured ectoplasm, t hereby bringing about a par tial or even a full manifestation in the form of a vi sibly discernible “apparition”. "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 161 Although ghosts are very real they are almost always completely harmless. A ghost is after all quite simply a totally normal but deceased human being living within a more subtle body, but after having experienced physical “death”, for some reason they become “trapped” in the lowest part of the Etheric plane closest to the physical world. A ghost can very often be assisted by people still living within the physical world who are expert in t hese matters. Such help is often performed by Astral projectors who can actually meet the ghost “face to face”, or by psychic mediums or clairvoyants who can “see” and often directly communicate with the deceased person. Ghosts are also very frequently helped by people living within the Astral worlds who specialise in “Soul retr ievals”. There are whole bands of people living within the As tral worlds who specialise in rescuing Souls who are trapped either near the physical world, as in the case of a ghost, or within a lower Astral plane such as a “belief system territory”. This process is known as “Soul retrieval”, and broadly involves bringing the Soul from the low level where they have been trapped, back to their new and rightful home in the Astral worlds. There is also another class of “ghost”, a person who was very religious during physical life, and who unfortunately becomes trapped near to the physical world due to the complete misinterpretation of, and adherence to passages written within the Christian bible, and in particular the following on: “Behold: I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep but we shall be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on in corruption, and this mortal should put on immortality”. So when this corruptible shall have put on"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 162 incorruption, and this mortal shal l have put on immortality, shall be brought to pass the saying that is wr itten, Death is swallowed up in victory”. -- 1 Corinthians 15: 51-54 It is highly ironic indeed that a passage in the bible intended to teach the truth of what happens at the time of physical “death” should cause so much potential misery to so many recently deceased people. Those who feel strongly about these words and have misinterpreted them will upon their physical death usually wait with their lifeless body for an Ar changel to arrive and blow a “trumpet”, thus signifying their “right ” to proceed to “heaven” if it is judged their life has been a “good” one. This, to the recently deceased person is what they belie ve to be their own individual “judgement day”. Of course the Archangel never arrives and the unfortunate deceased person continues to wait close to their body potentially for eternity. This is one reason why there are so many “haunted” cemeteries. The strength of belief in this passage in the bible is usually sufficient to allow the deceased person to draw sufficient Etheric Energy to maintain themselves in an Etheric state very close to the physical world potentially indefinit ely. These unfortunate people become what are known as “ghosts”, often “haunting” the cemetery where their physical body has been la id to rest. However, these people can be and very often are rescued by Astral projectors or other people still living in the physical world, or by the people living within the Astral worlds specialising in “Soul retrieval”. As previously mentioned, it really is most ironic indeed that this passage from the bible can potentially cause so much misery to some deeply religious people afte r their physical “death”. The words actually describe the true mystery of what happens at the time of physical death, and are evidently intended to remove the fear of this completely natural process thus: “Behold: I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep but we shall be changed.”"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 163 This confirms quite simply that there is no such thing as “death”, and rather than a final “end”, we will “be changed”, in other words transition into another more subtle form to another life; Life in the Astral Body. “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.” The “trumpet” referred to in this part of the pass age is a symbolic trumpet and not an actual musical instrument. It symbolises the “trumpet” of liberation, in this ca se the liberation of the Soul from the physical body. These words go on to reiterate that a person shall rise as the same person from the physica l body, and be “changed” to the Light body; the Astral Body. “For this corruptible must put on in corruption, and this mortal should put on immortality, shall be br ought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swal lowed up in victory”. This implies the corruptible physical body, in other words the temporal body so prone to physical harm and the person who inhabited that mortal ear thly body shall become immortal in his or her inner Spiritual bodies. This underlines once again one of the most fundamental import ant truisms; every si ngle one of us without exception is an immortal Spirit, an integral aspect the Great Spirit, The One, made in the true image of God. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 164 Chapter 31: Reincarnation Reincarnation is truly one of the greatest of mysteries confronting mankind. Do we really reincarnate, in other words return to Earth for further “lives” on Earth? If so , how many times? Why do we reincarnate at all? Do we have an y choice? And many such similar questions very frequently arise. “Re-incarnate” literally means to “come back in the flesh, “carne” meaning “flesh” in Latin. Reincarnation is indeed very real, with people returning to Earth out of choice potentially many, many times over the course of thousands of years. The precise number of times a person will choose to return to Earth, and ov er how long in terms of physical time will vary considerably from individual to individual depending on desir ed and actual Spir itual progress, the need to equilibrate karma and various other factors. In order to understand reincarnat ion we first need to understand the true destiny of mankind. Each and everyone one of us from the moment of our very first “life” on Earth, our very first “incarnation”, has the most sacred mission to ulti mately return to, and potentially reunite with our Divine Cr eator, The First Cause, God. This is the true and ultimate meaning of life. U pon reaching this most exalted and sacred stage in our Spiritual ev olution, we will all have the option of either relin quishing our individuality and merging with God, an act often known as “Unity”, or retaining our individuality for as long as we wish to do so. Those who choose to retain their individualities at these highest and mo st exalted of levels are “God people” residing in the very highes t, most glorious Cosmic spheres of life, usually concerning themse lves with the ongoing evolution of other beings of planets a ll over the Universe. So where does reincarnation fit into this equation? The physical world, in our case the planet Ea rth can be likened to a kindergarten, and the very highest spheres of rea lity, the Cosmic spheres can be likened to post graduate University. It goes without saying that no one can attend University without first having progressed through"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 165 all necessary levels of primary an d higher education, thus achieving the necessary qualifications and levels of attainment. The inner spheres beyond the physical planet Earth are “Mind worlds” where anything desired can become an instant reality. We will discuss this in more detail later in this book. Also in the inner spheres of life, everyone is at ex actly the same level of personal evolution, and life is extremel y peaceful and harmonious as a result. Wonderful though these inner spheres surely are, they are not however an environment where im portant lessons, so vital for evolution to the inner spheres of life can be easily learned. These initial lessons require the characteristics and density of the physical world of matter in order to be effe ctive. As we a ll know only too well, the planet Earth is populated by people with an almost infinite number of characteristics; te mperaments, characters, egos, personalities, beliefs and so on. At the same time the Earth is a physical environment where everyt hing appears to be solid to the five biological senses and therefore requires direct physical interaction. Everyone on Earth lives within a so lid material body subject to the rigours of the physical environment, not the least of which is health, the need for food and shelter and in teraction with other people. The physical Universe is a school of learning where ever yone must first attain the necessary degree of per fection in order graduate and progress to the inner, more blissful , glorious spheres of life beyond the Astral worlds, which we are told the glories of which are way, way beyond the comprehension of ear thly man. Only when such a level of perfection and ennoblement is achieved can true progress be made on the path back to God. Again it must be stressed that ther e is ultimately no avoiding this progression of events; it is the ab solute and most sacred destiny of every single individual who is living on Earth now, ever was living on Earth and ever will live on Eart h in the future without any"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 166 exceptions; a process which c ould take aeons upon aeons as measured in earth time. Each separ ate lifetime on Earth adds to the pool of experience and knowledge r equired in order to progress to the inner spheres and to transc end the cycle of reincarnation. Each life and experience on Earth provides a vehicle of expression and personality, the sum of which in the inner spheres contributes to the total individuality. Memories of all lives on Earth and beyond are “stored” perpetually in a inner body, the “Causal body” within the causal sphere of the Mental planes of the Universe, the Ether, often known in the Far East as the Akasha. Having attai ned a certain level of evolution on the sacred path, full details of a ll past lives will ultimately be revealed. By that time the less ons of numerous physical lives on Earth will have been learned and int egrated into the causal body of the immortal Spirit within the Akasha, and the path of evolution back to our Prime Creator, The Fi rst Cause, God can continue. Each individual lifetime can be likened to a facet of a diamond. The full sparkling diamond with all of its many facets represents the entire self, the individual, wh ile each facet of the diamond represents each separate life. A diamond has many facets, the total of which constitutes the whole glittering gem. Each lifetime will add a new facet to the diamond until t he whole diamond is ultimately complete in all of its sparking splendour. Life, individuality, continues then in the inner spheres of life and reality as a complete glistening diamond, becoming ever brighter, more perfected and more beautiful as the ascent back to God progresses. Throughout all lives, everyone will reta in individuality, full conscious awareness and all other fundamental attributes of the immortal Spirit such as intelligence. Each physical life however results in a new personality and a correspondingly new Astral Body or Soul and Etheric Body; only the Spirit, “made in the true image of God” is truly immortal. It is quite possible to reincarnate as male or female regardless of gender in the prev ious physical life on Earth."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 167 Reincarnation is not a random process; eac h and every person will use their own freewill to select th eir next life on Earth, most closely corresponding with the oppor tunities that will present themselves in order to learn those valuable le ssons required for progression and to equilibrate karma. It is then for each and every individual to make the most of that particular lifet ime by living a life of complete awareness, creating own realit y and making the most of the valuable opportunities as they ar ise. If any particular lifetime is partially or fully wasted as very often still happens, then if further progression is desired, and everyone without exception must progress sooner or later, it will be necessary to return again to Earth for a similar lifetime, with similar circumstances arising in order to learn the necessary less ons for progression and evolution, and to equilibrate karma. This is just one reason why everyone should have full conscious awareness of the ultimate significance and importance of each individual life on Earth, and to make the very most of it, not wasting the opportunities of a physical lifetime due to lack of awareness, materialism, and allowing the ego to retain control. Everyone knows from personal ex perience just how hard and sometimes seemingly highly unjust life can be. Physical existence depends on basic material things such as the need for food, shelter and warmth. During each life, every one interacts with a wide variety of people, often in the course of obtaining the money with which to purchase the things required for ph ysical existence. Physical life in general places before people thes e fundamental obstacles and many more, all of which need to be fully recognised, faced and overcome. During the course of each lifetim e everyone is presented with all manner of trials, tribulations , challenges, situations and temptations, all of which are val uable lessons sent in order to potentially assist in ultimate progr ess on Earth. Unfortunately, very few people at this time recognise these valuable lessons for what they really are, and simply a scribe them to such notions as"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 168 “chance”, “luck”, “misfortune” or any number of other such dismissive explanations. In order to progress, and agai n, absolutely everyone without exception simply must progress sooner or later, all life situations must be recognised both as valuabl e lessons and op portunities to equilibrate, in other words “pay-off” karma. As previously mentioned, it is very difficult ind eed to achieve these things in the inner spheres of life where ever yone is at the same level of progression, and the density of ma tter does not exist and therefore provide any sort of obstacle. In the Astral worlds, also known as the “desire worlds”, everything desired can become an instant realit y without the nee d for work or money, unlike the physical worl d where physical requirements usually have to be obtained by physi cal means. As we will see later however, all needs in the physical world can also be realised by following the appropriate method of manifestati on; everyone without exception creates their own reality. This applies just as much in the physical world as it d oes in the inner worlds. The lessons everyone needs to learn include transcendi ng of the ego, balancing of the inner, subtle bodies, the Soul an d Spirit, and the development of the Divine “spark” of “God” within until it becomes the very brightest Light and the very highest vibration, to fully realise God within. Selfless service to the human race is also extremely important, as is living in harmony with the most important and powerful force in the Universe; Unconditional Love . Every single situation without exception presenting itse lf in life should be considered to be a most valuable opportunity for personal evolution, and we should all acknowledge these opportunities and be genuinely grateful when they arise. No opportunity for personal evolution and progression should ever go unrecognised or wasted. Unfortunately in this day and age most people still prefer to complain, blame others and genera lly carry on through life with a material and often selfish outlo ok, whereby everything revolves"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 169 around temporal material possessions, and in satisfying the relentless demands of the ego. One day , whether it is in the current or a future lifetime, every single person without exception must awaken to the certain realisatio n of the true purpose and value of their own life in the material world, and to live each and every day accordingly. This realisation might well take some people many hundreds or even thousands of years of incarnations into physical life as measured in Earth time, ju st as many people have already taken many, many thousands of year s to reach the current stage in their own personal evolution along the path back to God. The vast majority of mankind has yet to r each such realisation, and thus continue to live their lives often st ill believing their cu rrent “life” is the only life they will ever get befor e being sent to either a “heaven” or “hell”. Such people often st ill display all of the same characteristics of materialism and ego so very detrimental to both themselves and to mankind generally. Just as many Spirits currently in incarnation have lived numerous previous physical lives over aeons of time, yet others are being born today into their very firs t life having been given the most precious gift of a sacred Divine spark of Spirit from our Creator, thereby assuring, one day in the future they too will become a God person assisting in the great and infinite Universal plan. It is believed to be possible to not only reincarnate to the planet Earth, but indeed as a being on one of t he many other life sustaining planets in the Universe. All life is Spirit, equal aspects of God, our Pr ime Creator, The Source, and therefore the human c oncept of “aliens” or “extra- terrestrials” really does not exist. It might well be that an incarnation as an individual on another distant planet might be appropriate for progression rather than a life on Earth. Likewise it is believed many Spirits originating fr om distant planets also incarnate as Earth humans in order to gai n that particular ex perience. The whole meaning of incarnation throughout t he Universe is for individual evolution in order to facilitate on ward progression through the inner"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 170 spheres of life and reality, all of wh ich lead ultimately to the very same God, irrespective of which pl anet a being was originally born. Once a person achieves such a stage in their Spiritual evolution as to understand the true meaning of ph ysical life, they will gladly, joyously and enthusiastically em brace it, and begin to learn the lessons and the opportunities pr esented to balance karma, to create their own reality and to evolve. Later, after the current physical life is over residing once again in the inner spheres of life, people often soon welcome the opportunity of a further period time in Earth life in order to be blessed with, and make the mo st of the many valuable opportunities presented for further Spiritual growth and evolution. Many people however are content to remain in the Astral worlds for some considerable time as measured in Earth terms, preferring the peace, harmony and stress free life as compared to physical life on Earth. Nevertheless, even if it ta kes aeons of time as measured in Earth time, each and every Soul without any exceptions will eventually realise the need to evol ve and progress, and will use their own freewill to in carnate on Earth or another planet as often as is necessary to facilitate further evolution. Many people might ask whether they have any control over reincarnation, specifically whet her it is by pure chance who and where they incarnate next. As we already know there is no such notion as “chance” in the Univer se, “chance” being completely contrary to Universal laws. As we also know, everyone has been given the Divine gift of freewill. Many will be happy to learn therefore people do indeed determine the exact circumstances of their next chosen life on Earth or another planet. The reason for this is it is necessary to enter a phy sical life presenting precisely those environments, situations and opportuni ties required in order to learn vital lessons and balance karma. New lessons have to be learned and karma equilibrated. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 171 The Soul, immortal Spir it and Higher-Self exist in the inner spheres of life beyond space and time, and wi ll therefore know exactly what sort of life they need to choose for themselves for the next time around on Earth in order to progress. They will choose the precise location in the world where they will be born, who their parents will be, what sort of life they will be presented with, even the circumstances of the next physi cal death. It should be mentioned while many people complain about thei r “lot” in life, they actually chose their “lot” for themselves of their own freewill, and accordingly rather than complain ing about their own circumstances they should determine the reasons for choosing that particular life and accordingly make the most of it by learning the valuable lessons they chose to co me to Earth to learn. Of course, until people begin to understand these realities, they will continue to stumble through life, complaining about everything that does not agree with their status and ego, and of their lack of “luck”. It is not until such a person eventually passes to the Astral worlds once again will they s ee and understand the true meaning of the life just past, and accordingly have the opportunity to reflect upon any opportunities not taken, by which time of course it will be too late thus necessitating a further life on Earth, hopefu lly to take advantage of the lessons presenting themselves the next time around. Those who already accept reincarnat ion as the reality it is have many questions. One of the most frequently questions often asked is “how long do we live within the inner worlds before returning for another physical life”. The answer to this question is the timescale varies enormously from person to person. The first fact of which everyone needs to remind themselves is that time does not exist within the inner worlds from whic h a person will be reincarnating. Therefore time is a completely er roneous factor in this context. As time is meaningless in the inner worlds, such an important decision as reincarnation will be taken based upon a review of the past physical life, and therefore of the specific lessons needing to be learned the next time around. This involves a life where the"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 172 appropriate temporal parents, circumstances and opportunities can be arranged. In physical Earth terms, the time elapsing between incarnations might be as short a matter of days or as long as thousands of years. Again howev er, a person incarnating has absolutely no such concept of time in the inner spheres, rather only a knowing and an arranging of t he next Earth life whenever appropriate. As with many things it is the cyn ical nature of mankind to demand proof of everything, and reincarnat ion is no excepti on. Many people are most unfortunately still under the influence of the churches which have taught si nce around the 6 th century CE when reincarnation was officially remov ed from the church doctrine, that reincarnation does not exist and everyone lives only one physical life before being sent to either “heaven” or “ hell” depending on their beliefs and devotion to the church, God and Jesus and whether they have “accepted Jesus as their saviour”. As mentioned previously, this became the policy of the church around the 6 th century CE in order to maintain control over their own congregations by means of inst illing fear; no member of the congregation relishes the prospect of going to “hell” or “eternal damnation”. Others quite understandably make t he point that if they have indeed lived so many previous lives why can’t they remember those lives now? This is of course an excellent question, and one that should certainly be addressed before proceeding. Memories are not permanently stored in the physical brain. The physical brain is simply an organic interface between the physical body and the inner bodies, where memories of the current life are temporarily stored for physical recall. As already mentioned, memories of both the current, past and indeed future lives are all stored in our causal body existing within the causal s phere of the Ether, Akasha, of God. The organic brain can be li kened to a super-computer, responsible for controlling t he physical organic body, and also acting as a filter and “receiving stat ion” for thoughts or iginating from"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 173 the inner spheres, and in particular those originating upon the Mental planes of life and reality. As previously discussed, in addi tion to the external shell, the physical body, everyone also has an Etheric or Energy Body, an Astral Body also known as the Soul, and Mental bodies, the immortal Spirit. Humans are multi-dimensional be ings with bodies existing concurrently in all spheres of Energy and vibration of the Universe, from the physical, to Etheric, to the Astral and to the Mental, Celestial and Cosmic planes, all the way to The Source, The First Cause, God. A thought or iginating in the Mental plane in accordance with the laws of Ment alism as described in the first section of this book, is first received by the Mental, Spirit body where it proceeds through the M ental matrix connected to the Astral Body and from there through the Astral matrix connected to the Etheric and physical bodies w here the thought arrives and is received in the Consciousness. As previously mentioned, the organic brain can, in the context of receiving thoughts and ideas, simply be likened to a receiving apparatus, a television set for exampl e. Just as a radio or television is designed for receiving radio waves, the physical brain has the function of receiving “Mental waves” in the form of vibrations, and by nature of its design f ilters out everything that is not required, so there is no interference and therefore lack of clarity. If this were not the case humans would know the deta ils of all past and future lives and would therefore be deprived of freewill, and accordingly the ability to progress. This is true because instead of living spontaneously based upon physical life circumstances as they arise, a person would be heavily influenced by all past and future lives , and rather than the learning lessons as they are presented, the person would endeavour to re- live and compensate for the other liv es, and no real progress would be made as a direct result. Th is does not mean however we incarnate without the benef it of past lives; t he lessons have to be based upon something. The solution to this is within the realm of"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 174 the subconscious Mind, which as the name suggests exists beneath the level of normal conscious awareness. The subconscious might be regarded as both our friend and our adversary in life. As a friend it w ill work relentlessly to realise our wishes when those wishes are im pressed upon it, but as our adversary the subconscious Mind will constantly strive to drive us to do things we should not do, and t herein is a challenge; to control the subconscious Mind. It shoul d be mentioned that the subconscious Mind is extremely powerfu l, being the vast majority of the Mind, the conscious Mind bei ng only a very small proportion of the total. Clearly then, being conscious and in control of the subconscious Mind is most important. Very often people most wisely wish to cease an addiction or other harmful habit such as smoking, drinking alcohol, the wrong foods etc., and it is the subconscious Mind together with the ego that will relentlessly urge the person to continue with the habit. It is possibl e to enlist the assistance of a hypnotist to help for example to gi ve up smoking. The hypnotist is actually addressing the subconsci ous Mind and reprogramming it to “suggest” the person is a non-smok er. Mastering the subconscious Mind is extremely important for pr ogression, and is a subject that will accordingly be addressed later in this book. It should be mentioned it is infinitely better fo r a person to becom e the master of their own subconscious than to rely on the services of a hypnotist. Also, as the Higher-Self has full knowledge of all past and future lives, the Higher-Self can and always does therefore provide guidance and direction w henever appropriate. This is why it is so important to recognise communications from the Higher-Self and always to act upon them immediat ely and without exception. The Higher-Self can influence the subconscious as well as conscious Minds, and will do so whenever t he need rises including in the course of Spiritual evolution. Ultimately the immortal Spirit is not concerned with previous “lives” or personalities, all such lives being a single co ntinuum of the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 175 immortal Spirit beyond the physica l confines of space and time, and all are therefore important aspects of the totality comprising each individual; the real essence of the immortal Spirit ultimately concerned with the process of ennoblement and perfection and therefore progress along the sacr ed path back to our Creator. There is very considerable evidence as to the truth of reincarnation. Many thousands of people have experienced recollections or “flashes” of a previous life or “lives” through various circumstances, for example dreams, when facing lif e-threatening situations, or by past-life regression methods. To look at the latter cases first, people who understand rein carnation are often curious, usually for various personal reasons to discover who they were in previous lives and how and where they lived and even “died”. There are several ways of retrievi ng knowledge of past lives, either alone or with assistance. Those who are skilled at meditation and trance techniques can often invoke an altered state of Consciousness and then “ask” questions regarding previous lives. In an altered state of Consciousness a person is connected to the inner states of reality within the Astral and Ment al realms where this information can be more readily accessed either directly, for example through the “Akashic record ”, or by raising Consciousness to the level of the causal body where all informati on regarding past lives is stored. The assistance of a Spiritual being, usually within the Astral realms can also be requested, who can access the required information on beha lf of the past-life seeker. In this case a request is made by means of tho ught, and the Spiritual being, often known as a “guide”, will communicate the answers by intuition or telepathically. This can and often is carried out over many sessions in order to establish a very good picture of past lives. For those not having the necessary meditation or trance skills to obtain past life information for themselves, an alternative is to seek the services of a genuine hypnotist for past-life regressions who can bring about the necessary al tered state of Consciousness and ask the appropriate questions. In th is case, the hypnotist is really"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 176 carrying out exactly the same proce ss as the self past-life retriever in a trance state, except that the subject under hy pnosis will not usually be aware of what transpi res during the session. Past life information retrieved will usua lly have been recorded on a recording device for the subject to listen to afterwards. This entire process is known as “past life regression”. Children are particularly excellent at recalling past lives, often even in a normal state of Consciousness. The reason for this is because it has not been too long since they were last living within the Spirit worlds where the information, particularly of the memory of the most recent life was vividly known. When a child is born to begin a new life, they are subsequently indoc trinated into the physical world by being continuously taught to use and rely upon the five physical senses by parents, relatives, nur sery teachers and others. As this process of indoctrination contin ues and the child becomes older, the child’s contact wit h the Spirit worlds gradually fades until with most people the memories usua lly become subsumed deep below the level of normal waking Consciousness. Children up to the age of seven y ears, and certainly before the age of five years usually still have close contact with the inner realms of life in normal waking Consciousne ss, and indeed frequently interact with their friends and other beings in the Astral worlds during the course of play. Of course adults a ssume their children are simply “pretending” to play with “make be lieve” or “imaginary” friends, but very often in fact these friends are very real indeed. Likewise children are often so much in touc h with their previous “life” they have problems distinguishing it from their current physical “life”. Children will often talk of their “o ther mummy” or “other daddy”, or their “other house” or “other friends” or “other school”. These are most certainly not the fantasies of a child but are rather, particularly to the child, very real and vivid me mories of their previous life which they still strongly associate with their current, new physical life. Some children have quite extraord inary natural memories of past lives and in particular of the most recent past Earth life. Some of"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 177 the most remarkable situations arise when chil dren spontaneously start speaking in a foreign language or “speaking in tongues” as the situation is often referred to, and which languages they could not possibly have learned from anyw here on Earth duri ng their present life. Sometimes these are very anc ient languages and dialects that are now and have long been extinct, and accordingly no longer spoken in the modern world today, only being known to historians. In other cases children can descri be their previous homes and lives in very considerable detail, includi ng the town or area in which they lived in their previous life, thei r home, family, friends and often much more specific detail. Someti mes a child will say to a parent “please can we go and visit.....” and then mentions a specific name completely unknown to the parents. Sometimes children will ask if they might be taken on a journey to their “other home”. There are numerous such examples of children remembering past lives in considerable detail, and I am quite sure many reading this will readily relate to similar sit uations with your own children. There are many documented cases where a child has reincarnated very soon after the end of their pr evious life on Earth. In some cases there are even people still living from the time of the previous life of the child, and which p eople can completely verify the accuracy of the information being provided by the child. There are researchers who have devoted a considerable amount of their own lives to the research, and verification of reincarnation and past lives and in particularly of children. Probably the most well- known and respected of all past life researchers is Dr. Ian Stevenson, who is very widely recognised as a most important pioneer in this field. Over the course of 40 years Dr . Stevenson, who has an impeccable standing and reputation and is ve ry highly respected, has meticulously researched and documented more than three thousand cases of children’s past life memories, collectively presenting irrefutable proof as to truth of reincarnation and the remarkable accuracy of children’s past life recollections. In all of"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 178 these cases the children were able to recall past lives spontaneously and in considerable detail and clarity without any prompting whatsoever, and without being subjected to any form of hypnosis. In each case of a child’s past life memory recollections, Dr. Stevenson has methodically docum ented all of the statements associated with the past life provided by each child. He identifies the deceased person t he child remembers being previously and then takes whatever action is necessa ry to verify the facts of the deceased person's life matching t he child's memory. Dr. Stevenson is so thorough he even matches bi rthmarks and birth defects to wounds and scars on the deceased, all verified by medical records. His strict methods systematically rule out all possible \"normal\" explanations for t he child’s memories. A dramatic example of reinca rnation involving a person who physically died and returned very s oon afterwards was in the case of a Turkish bandit. This involves a boy who claimed he was formerly a Turkish bandit, who when cornered by the authorities shot himself through the lower ja w in order to evade capture. Medical examination of this boy, the reincarnation of the bandit, highlighted a large mark in his jaw where the bullet would have entered in his previous life, and there was also hair missing from the top of his head where the bulle t would have emerged. A witness to this incident is still alive today and was able to confirm the precise details as given by the boy as to how he took his own previous life. Many people, including sceptic s and scholars alike, agree these cases offer the best evidence yet for reincarnation. Dr. Stevenson's credentials are impeccable; he is a medical doctor and had many scholarly papers to his credit before he began his past life research. Dr. Stevenson’s work is quite rightly considered to be vitally important among his peer s. It is believed the cases researched by Dr. Stevenson are key to widespread acceptance of reincarnation in the West."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 179 Dr. Stevenson is absolutely meticu lous in his research, apparently taping interviews with up to 25 wi tnesses for each individual case. His researchers checked medi cal records and compared the character of the child being resear ched in the current life with the character of the person they were in the previous life. It should be noted that “individuality” is an aspect of the immortal Spirit, and therefore the nature of a person’s individuality, in other words who they “are” remains infinitely constant. In numerous cases the child can point to a birthmark or ma rks associated with the way their previous “life” ended with witnesses and records fully supporting those circumstances. If only more people knew of thes e scientifically documented cases of reincarnation by a highly re spected person then they might be much more likely to seriously listen when their own young children begin to speak of, \"when I died before ”, or of their “other mummy”, “other daddy”, “other “friends” “ot her home” or “other school”, as well as many other aspects of their previous life. Children very often still have very high connections with the inner spheres of life from wher e they recently arrived and of most recent past lives, and should therefore be taken very seriously indeed when they speak of these thi ngs or simply appear to be “pretending”. It is t he lack of being taken seriously that usually causes the child to doubt him or herself, sometimes becoming self- conscious or even guilty about their past-life memories as a result. Eventually and most sadly, chil dren after several years of indoctrination into the physical world and not being taken seriously when they talk of previous lives , experiences and interactions with the inner spheres of life, lose the connections with both the inner spheres of life and realit y and with their recolle ction of past lives. It should be mentioned at this point t hat every single person is always intended to maintain the connecti on with the inner spheres, true home that is indeed true reality. It is the lack of these connections on the part of most people, and therefore the r ealisation and knowledge of the true, inner spheres of life, that has contributed in"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 180 no uncertain terms to the state of the world today, thus highlighting the importance of the work of Dr. Stevenson and others who are continuing similar most important research. We will now take a closer look at just a few examples of past life recollections by children. Reincarnation Case 1: This first case involves a young girl who at the age of three years was able to recall considerable details of her previous life. So detai led was the information sh e provided that Dr. Stevenson was able to locate the family of the girl in her past life. It all started when the family was travelling approximately 100 miles from their home. The girl suddenly pointed and asked the driver of the car in which they were travelling at the time to go down a road to “my home”, saying they “could get a better cup of tea there”. Soon afterwards she started to rela te numerous details of her past life associated with her previous fam ily living in this home, including her previous name and that she had two sons. The little girl also provided a very wide range of high ly accurate information regarding the precise details of the home incl uding its location relative to other landmarks in t he area, and numerous ot her details regarding the interior, details which she could not possibly have known any other way. The little girl said she had died after experiencing a pain in her throat. Some years later, news of this case reached a local professor, a paranormal researcher who subseque ntly interviewed the girls “previous” family at great length. The family confirmed every single detail of what the little girl had previously st ated including that she had died very suddenly leaving b ehind a grieving husband and two young sons. The two families lived one hundred miles apart and had certainly never heard of each other previously. This is only the beginning of this remarkable situation. Some time later, members of the girl’s prev ious family journeyed to the town where she now lived in order to test her memory. The girl"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 181 immediately recognized her former brother and called him by his pet name. The girl then went ar ound the room looking at each man in turn; some she identified as m en she knew from the town in her previous life who had accompani ed the family and some were strangers to her. She then came to the man who was her husband in her previous life. The girl lo wered her eyes and looked bashful in the tradition of the religion they shared, and then spoke his name. The little girl then went on to correctly identify her son from her past life, despite numerous efforts by the boy to mislead her, none of which efforts were successful. This was by no means the end of this extraordinary situation. The girl later visited the home of her previous life and provided numerous highly accurate, and very often little know n details about her home, her previous family and her life. Many of these details would have been impossible to know unless she was actually who she claimed to be in her previous life. The two families became very close, and the previous family of the little girl accepted her as part of their own family just as in fact she had been in the previous life of not too many years before. Reincarnation Case 2: This Dr. Stevenson case involves a young boy who at the age of two and a half years old suddenly began to talk to his parents about his “other life”. His memories were very specific saying he had previously been the owner of an electrical appliance shop selling TV’s, radio’ s and other similar products. He knew his previous name and that he had a wife and two children, all of who’s names he was also able to recall. He was also able to recall the end of his previous life in great detail, specifically how he had been shot, cremated and his ashes thrown into the river. Note; this is in accordance with the prev ious section of this book where we discussed what often happens immediately after death. A “deceased” person can remain in t heir Etheric Body close to the physical world for quite some time, until the supply of Etheric Energy is exhausted. This provides the deceased person with the opportunity to visit loved ones and friends, as well as observing the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 182 destiny of their physical body. Acts of love and remembrance do not therefore go unnoticed by th e deceased person and are very much appreciated, providing much comfort. The boy’s parents did not take hi m seriously at first, but his behaviour puzzled them and he often behaved as if he was not part of his current family at all. He would tell his parents he was homesick and that he wanted to go back to his home. He became so insistent about this he even ro lled up his clothes and threatened to leave home. The elder brother of the boy decided to check out his brother’s claims for himself. He travelled to the town named by his younger brother and soon found a radio shop that was being managed by a lady, a widow who’s husband had been shot some years previously. This lady was understandably curious , and decided to travel to meet the family of the boy to in vestigate further. When she arrived, the boy, who was outside of the home shouted to his parents his “other family” had just arrived. When both families were together for this most unusual meeting, the boy stunned the widow, his wife in his previous life, by recounting full de tails of a family outing to a fair in a neighbouring village where he had bought some sweets, an occasion only the widow and her husband, now re incarnated could possibly have known about. The boy also amazed his wife of his previous life by accurately describing where he had buried some gold in a hole in the home. Later it was arranged t he boy would travel to the town where his former wife lived. As a test the widow arranged for her sons, previously the sons of the boy, to be playing in the neighbourhood with many other childr en of the same age. Up on his arrival he was immediately able to pick out his former sons from the crowd of children. He also recognised the changes that had been made to his former shop after his death."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 183 Later the boy recalled the full circumstances of his “death”, how he had been shot in the head while sitti ng in his car after arriving home from work. The autopsy report, which was filmed, confirmed he had indeed been shot in t he head and had died as a result of a bullet wound to the temple. The autopsy showed the exact size and location of the entry wound and also of the ex it wound on the opposite side of the man’ s head. It was later decided to shave off some of the boys hair around the region of the fatal wound inflicted in his previous life. The boy had a birthmark at exactly the same location as the bullet entry point of exactly the same size and shape as the bullet that killed him in hi s previous life. He also had a second birthmark on the opposite side of his head corresponding with the exit point of the same bullet. This case later attracted so much interest that it was presented in court in order to conclusively prove the boy was indeed the reincarnated former husband of the wi dow. As a result of this case a professor at a major University was quoted as saying that due to the police involvement “this is one of the best documented cases of reincarnation he had ever seen.\" Reincarnation Case 3: This is a case from the portfolio of Peter Ramster, a psychologist and past life regression expert of Sydney, Australia. In 1983 he produced a television doc umentary in which four women from Sydney who had never befor e left Australia, gave details under hypnosis of their past lives. Then complete with television crews and equipment they were taken to the other side of the world. One of the subjects, until then a staunch sceptic, was a lady by the name of Gwen McDonald. She remembered a life in Somerset, England that would be impossible to obtain from a book, but which was subsequently confirmed in front of witnesses when she was taken there. "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 184 After she was blindfolded and taken to a particular place in Somerset, when the blindfold was re moved she was able to find her way around perfectly. She was able to correctly point out in three directions the location of village s she had known in her former life. She was able to direct the film cr ew to various destinations far more accurately than the maps they had with them. She knew the location of a waterfall and the place where stepping-stones had previously been located; the locals confirmed the stepping-stones had been removed about forty year s before. She pointed out an intersection where she claimed there had been five houses; enquiries proved this was indeed accurate; the houses had been demolished some thirty years pr eviously. One of the demolished houses had been a “cider house” as she had claimed. She knew the names of the villages as they had been two hundred years ago even though the names do not appear on modern maps. People she claimed to have know n were proved to have existed, one of whom was listed in the name s of the regiment to which she apparently belonged. She knew many local legends, all of which were confirmed by Somerset historians. She correctly used obscure West Country words that were no longer in use and in fact did not even appear in dictionaries. In Sydney she had described carvi ngs that had been in an obscure old house twenty feet fr om a stream in the middle of five houses located about one and a half mile s from Glastonbury Abbey. She knew the local people called Gl astonbury Abbey “St. Michael’s”, a fact only proven by reading an obscure two hundred year old history book not available in Austra lia. She was able to draw while still in Sydney the interior of her Glastonbury house, which was subsequently proven to be comple tely correct. She described an inn on the way to her house that was indeed found to exist and was able to lead the team directly to the house, now a chicken shed. After cleaning the floor they disco vered the stone carvings she had referred to in Sydney. The locals came every night to quiz her on local history, and she knew the answers to all of the questions"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 185 asked including for example a pr oblem with a big bog where cattle were being lost. These are just a few of the very numerous such cases of reincarnation documented by Dr . Stevenson, Peter Ramster and other dedicated researchers bas ed upon cases gathered from all over the world. One of the common factors, as with the first two cases described above, is that reincarnation apparently took place relatively soon after the end of the previous physi cal life. This would account for the extraordinary detail and clarity demonstrated by these people in remembering their previous lives that had taken place only a matter of years before. There are numer ous, possibly many millions of such cases of past life recollection which have simply never been documented. In many or even most of these cases the parents of the child recounting a previous life would simply ascribe the child’s claims as mere “fantasy”, “mak e believe”, or the product of an “over-active imagination”, and acco rdingly not take the child seriously. There might well be m any other situat ions where the parents do in fact take the child seriously but prefer to keep the knowledge of their child’s recollections to themselves. In conclusion, we can justifiably say that not only can reincarnation be proven to be very real indeed, but is also an integral and very important aspect of the evolutio n of human beings on the ongoing journey back to our Creator. People will return to the Earth possibly numerous times over the course of many thousands of years in order to achieve such a state of perfection, ennoblement and mastery that lessons on the physical plane are no longer required. Graduation can then finally take pl ace from the kindergarten of the planet Earth, to continue ongoi ng education and progress in the inner schools, the inner planes of lif e and reality, th e great Spiritual worlds leading to the Celestial and Cosmic spheres and eventually the return to our Divine Creator , The First Cause, to God. "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 186 Chapter 32: Suicide Suicide is without doubt one of the most tragic situations, not only for the shocked and bereaved love ones left behind, but also for the person who felt so compelled to ta ke his or her own physical life. When a person takes their own life, contrary to what they might believe at the time, they do not e scape from anything at all except the physical world, at which po int any chance of resolving the problems from which they sought refuge are lost. The actual problems in all of their original magnitude are still brought with the person to the Astral world where t hey will be fully remembered, and still have to be fully faced and reconciled. Bereaved friends and relatives, whil e coping with the grief of their loss, are left agonising and confused as to why their loved one felt so compelled to undertake this s eemingly final act. Frequently they will feel guilt, believing they mi ght have been able to do something to prevent the tragic situation if only they had been more diligent, listened, and watched for the “signs”. However a Soul who takes their ow n life has done so of their own freewill regardless of the circumstanc es prevailing at the time, and often the focus of the deceased person might well have been on suicide for quite some time. When a person focuses sufficiently on something, anything as we will see later in this book, the focus will sooner or later inevitably manifest as a reality unless the focus is changed which it can be at any time . Only the person involved can change their own individual focus, em otions in situations such as this, especially where their int entions and wishes are unknown to everyone else. Tragic though these sit uations are, unless it is known beforehand a person is thinking in terms of taking their own life, and has been so for some time, there is usually nothing at all that fri ends, relatives or anyone else could have done to prevent it. The reasons for suicide are many and varied, but as already noted these events have been mostly sadly increasing in frequency over"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 187 the last few decades due to the current state of the world and humanity in general. Only when mankind understands the true meaning and purpose of each life on Earth and of his or her true destiny and the true desti ny of all mankind, can these tragic events such as suicide cease to occur. When a person takes their own life it is extremely important for family and friends to realise t hat grief and emotions can have a most profound and detrim ental effect on the trans ition of the Soul of the deceased person to the Astral worlds, their new home. The greater the grief and em otion projected by those left behind, the more difficult it will be for the Soul to fully transition to their new home. The Soul of the person w ho has “passed on” will receive the full effect of these emotions and will know exactly what family and friends are thinking and experienc ing. Such emot ions although entirely understandable will wei gh heavily on the Soul of the deceased person, often bringing about intense emot ions of guilt and regret. This in turn will sometimes cause the Soul to remain very close to the physical world effectively as a “ghost”, rather than transitioning to the Astral worlds. Even when the Soul does successfully transition to the Astral world, strong emotions emanating from t he people left behind will be felt in an intense and direct way, thereby exerting a pr ofound and usually negative influence, often making the transition very difficult indeed. Bereaved family and friends should therefore always send the most positive and intense feelings possible of understanding, compassion and above all Pure Unconditional Love, in the knowledge their loved one really is “alive”, safe and happy in their new home, and really does love the people left behind. The need for stability is particu larly important for the newly deceased person in the case of suicide. Oft en when a person takes their own life they sinc erely believe before and at the time that it is the end of everything. They believe they will escape the physical world forever, together with all of t he trials, tribulations and misery they perceived as the r eality of daily “life”. In accordance with the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 188 religion or “belief system” of the per son, they will ant icipate either a complete escape into oblivion, thereby ending everything, or they might go to “heaven” for all eternity. The reality however is very differ ent indeed as the person will soon discover. As we have already discussed, memory is not a function of the organic brain. All memori es of all lives past present and future are eternally stored in t he causal body of each individual being within causal spher e of the Ether, the Ak asha, The Universe. When transitioning to the Astral worl d there will therefore be full and vivid memory of every aspect of the previous life, memories that will be much more vivid than they were while still inhabit ing the physical body. People in the Astral worlds have a full understanding of the meaning and purpose of the physical life left behind and can review the experiences, the lessons learned or not learned and karma balanced, all of which are absolute ly necessary in order to begin the process of planning for the next phase of individual evolution including the next physical life on Earth if appropriate. The next incarnation might take place very soon after arriving in the Astral world as we have already seen from the previous examples, or on the other hand might not o ccur for many hundreds or even thousands of years as measured in Earth time. The choice is always that of the individual in accordance with the rate at which they desire to progress and Spiritua lly evolve, but sooner or later evolve everyone must in acco rdance with the destiny of all mankind. As we will discuss later in this book, there will always be people who complete their “kindergar ten education” and never need to return to Earth again. This might not however apply to those who took their own lives if their “mission” on Earth was not fully completed, and therefore the lessons of that particular life not completely learned. The only solution for such people is to return to Earth once again in order to complete the mission necessary for their ongoing evolution. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 189 The newly transitioned Soul who t ook their own life before their mission was complete will be fully aw are of this fact, and the fact they have now lost a most valuable opportunity to resolve the very problems and situations c ausing them to take the decision to “call it a day” on Earth. There is absolute ly no escaping t hese lessons and responsibilities; the Soul who took his or her own life will often feel deep regret for the val uable opportunities missed, lessons they failed to learn and the karma they failed to balance. As one Soul who recently arrived in the Astral world having took his own life said to a person who was visiting by Astral Projection: “I now realize that I suicided bec ause there were things I couldn't deal with, emotional things, things between myself and others. I was in so much pain. That pain didn't go away after I killed myself, and I now realize that the one thing I need to resolve the pain, is hanging from the rafters in the garage”. This unfortunate Soul, as with a ll Souls who terminate their own physical lives prematurely for em otional reasons, can now very vividly see every aspect of t he true purpose and meaning of his previous life, and therefore of a ll of the valuable opportunities missed. The person quot ed above now knows only after it is much too late that there is nothing he can really do to correct this situation from his new home in the Astral world. The Soul who commits suicide before his or her mission has been completed therefore has but one option; to return once agai n to Earth in order to hopefully completely fulfil his or her objectives next time around. Although suicide seems tragic and caus es considerable grief for all those involved, the bereaved left behind can gain much peace in the knowing their loved one is completely safe within the Astral worlds, is contemplating his or her past life, and will ultimately progress onwards in the course of his or her personal ongoing evolution. The deceased person will often visit loved ones frequently although their presence might not be felt, and will endeavour to help by means of inspiration whenever it is"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 190 appropriate to do so. The deceas ed person will also often visit loved ones left behind on Earth in their dreams. People who learn Astr al Projection, as discussed later in this section will have the ability to ac tually visit their deceased loved ones and thereby gain the first hand knowledge and certainty they are indeed safe, well and secure in their new home, and return with messages for those loved ones in the physical world. Above all, although temporarily separated by physical death, it is very important for all concerned to know beyond doubt there really is no absolute separation between peopl e in the physical world and people in the inner worlds, but rat her merely different states of being at differing vibrations and density, and one day everyone will be reunited in Love onc e again in the inner spheres or life and reality.  "},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 191 Chapter 33: The Inner Bodies In addition to the physical body wit h which of course everyone is most familiar, there are also a number of much more “subtle” bodies existing at much higher levels of vibration, and which bodies are usually beyond the range of perc eption by means of the five physical senses. These subtle bodies are infinite in nature, existing multi-dimensionally beyond the lim itations of space and time. In broad terms, these inner bodies may be defined as follows. The Etheric or Energy Body: The Etheric Body is the densest of the inner, subtle bodies, and as we have already discussed is often the main body inhabi ted immediately after physical death. The Etheric Body, often known as t he “Energy Body”, is a highly complex bio-energetic system including seven main energetic centres often known as the “chakras”. The Energy, or Etheric Body effect ively acts as a “transformer” or “interface” between the physical body and the inner Astral and Mental bodies being responsib le for, among other important functions, mediating the vastly differing vibrations between the physical and inner bodies, and most importantly for facilitating the flow of the life sustaining Vital E nergy from the Universe to the physical body. The Astral and inner bodies do not require such an interface or transformer having the ability to “br eath” Vital Energy directly. The Energy Body is theref ore absolutely vital for almost every aspect of the health and well-being of th e physical body, and indeed most illnesses manifesting as physical ailments or diseases originate from imbalances within t he Etheric, Energy Body. We will discuss the subject of heali ng in much more detail later in this book, but suffice it to say for now that the various methods of healing which focus on the Energy Body have often proved to be extremely effective, often bringing about cures considered by most to seem “miraculous”. For exam ple there have been many cases of"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 192 cancer deemed by doctors to be totally “incurable”, completely and permanently cured by healing techni ques focussing on the Energy Body. The Chakras : Within the Energy Body is a series of extremely important energetic centres oft en mystically known as the “chakras”. The word “chakra” is Sanskrit for “wheel” or “disk” signifying any one of the seven main Energy centres located within the Energy Body. Each of these Energy centres also corresponds directly to a major physical ner ve ganglia, or gland, connected to the spinal column. In addition, the chakras also correspond to the many levels of Consciousness, Sp iritual connection, developmental stages of life, colours, sounds, body functions, and much more. The Energy Body, the chakras, the aura and all functions associated with these aspects of the Energy Body form part of a major subject in and of themse lves, and indeed are the subject of many good books and articles specialising in those areas. Here nevertheless is a summary of t he seven major chakras of the Energy or Etheric Body starting fr om the highest chakra relative to the physical body. The Crown Chakra : This chakra as the name implies is located around the crown of the head, and re lates to Consciousness as pure awareness. The Crown chakra is our Divine connection to the inner realms of reality, to a timeless, spaceless place of all- knowing. When well developed this chakra brings us knowledge, wisdom, understanding, Spiritual connection, and bliss. The Brow Chakra : This chakra is locate d directly between the eyebrows and is often known as the “t hird eye”. It is related to the ability of seeing, both psychica lly and intuitively, being closely associated with “clairvoyance” or “clear seeing”. A clairvoyant can perceive, usually visually within the “Minds eye” inner realms of reality beyond the physical world, par ticularly the Astral worlds, and can also perceive things in the physical world beyond the reach of the normal five physical senses."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 193 Thousands of years ago everyone had a highly developed brow chakra thereby enabling the people of the time to maintain full contact with, and awareness of the inner realms of life and reality. Over the course of tens of thous ands of years however, as mankind has become increasingly focussed upon the material world of the five physical senses, the percept ion and use of the brow chakra has steadily diminished to the point where it is unf ortunately largely unknown and unused today. It is however quite possible to redevelop the brow chakra to the level of clairvoyance and other related abilities, as we will discuss later. The Throat Chakra : This chakra as the name suggests is located in the region of the throat and is related to communication and creativity. By means of the throat chakra the world is experienced symbolically through vibration, fo r example as the vibration of sound representing language. It is also therefore the chakra of “listening” to the inner realms by means of the more subtle vibration of communications. The mediumship ability known as “the direct voice” involves physically audible, often even loud communications from the Astral worlds utilising ectoplasm in conjunction with the throat chakra as the gateway to produce the “Spirit voices” which can be physically heard, often ve ry loudly and clearly without any special equipment. The Heart Chakra : This is the middlemost of the major chakras and the lowest forming part of t he upper triangle of chakra’s associated with connections with the inner realms. This triangle of chakras encompasses the crown, brow and heart chakras. The heart chakra is related to love and is also the integrator of opposites in the psyche; the Mi nd and body, male and female, persona and shadow, ego an d unity. A healthy heart chakra allows people to love deeply and unconditi onally, feel compassion, and enjoy a deep sense of peace, contentment and centeredness . The heart has always been a symbol of love in many cultures, often depicted by a representation of a physical red heart in a characteristic shape. Emotions people associate with the physical"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 194 heart, in particular love, are actually originating from the heart chakra of the Energy Body, and not from the physical heart organ itself as most people might suppose. The Solar Plexus Chakra : This chakra, often known as the “power chakra” is located in the region of the solar plexus or navel. It rules personal power, will and autonomy as well as metabolism. When healthy, the solar plexus chakra brings Energy, effectiveness, spontaneity and non-dominating power. The solar plexus chakra is also connected with the Ether, known as the Akasha in far Eastern cultures, and is a receiver of intu ition from the Spirit worlds and Higher-Self. Many people will recall occasions when they have thought about something and have instantly received a strange feeling in the area of the lower st omach as a direct result. People often refer to having such experienc es as having a “gut feeling”, a “sinking feeling” or other sensation in the area of the stomach. This is a inner communication by way of intuition and impressions originating in the i nner realms or from the Higher-Self, and is a confirmation or warning about a thought within the Mind. It can therefore be a positive “gut feeling” or a negative “gut feeling”. Whichever type of feeling it is , the person experiencing such a feeling would do very well indeed to take full heed of the feeling and therefore message received, and proceed accordingly. The Sacral Chakra : This chakra is located around the region of the groin, and is related to the water element and therefore to emotions and sexuality. It connects people to others through feelings, desires and sensations. Ideally this chakra brings to us fluidity and grace, depth of feeling, sexual fulfilment and the ability to accept change. This is also the chakra of sex ual desire and physical reproduction. The Root Chakra : This chakra is located at the base of the spine. It represents the Earth el ement and is related to survival instincts, to the sense of grounding and connec tion to the physical body and world. Ideally this chakra also brings the possibilities of good health, prosperity, security, and dynamic presence. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 195 The Aura : This is the Energy field produced by the Energy or Etheric Body and can be observed by people who have the ability of “auric sight” or clairvoyance. Auric Energy fields are highly complex and very fluid, being influenced not only by health and vita lity, but also by the mood of a person. As moods change so then does the appearance of the aura. The complex Energy fiel ds of numerous strengths and colours can be likened to an open book of the life and evolutionary status of an individual; not hing at all can be hidden. The Aura is also an extremely a ccurate indicator of Spiritual attainment. Highly Spiritually evolved people will be instantly recognisable by a vivid, clean, dy namic aura, the most prominent feature of which is in an intense bright golden yellow area extending from and around the crow n of the head. Sometimes the aura can be so intense it can ev en be viewed by peo ple not usually possessing the ability of auric vision. It is also this intense golden aura around the head of highly Spiritua l person that gives rise to the so called “halo”, as often for example depicted around the head of Jesus or a saint. As discussed previously, after the physical body “dies” the deceased person will usually, but not always, find themselves in their Etheric or Energy Body. Lat er, after the Etheric Body has exhausted its supply of Etheric Energy, the pr imary body will be the much finer Astral Body, the Soul, which also includes the integral Mental, Spirit body. In due course once a person has satiated his or her own desires within the Astral words, a process that can vary enormously in time from pers on to person depending on how materialistic, self-centred and ph ysically focussed the person was during life on Earth, the Astral Body “fades” giving way exclusively to the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit, the aspect of a human being made in the true image of “God”. "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 196 Chapter 34: The Astral Body, The Soul After a person passes from physical Earthly life and has often spent some time in the Etheric Body li ving close to the physical world, they will usually proceed to make the full transition to the Astral world, the next home and first st age of a much greater and truer level of existence and rea lity. In order to reside in the Astral worlds it is necessary to inhabit an Astral Body of exactly the same level and degree of vibration and densit y as the corresponding level of the Astral realms, until reincarnat ion into a new physical life, or progression onwards to the Spirit worlds takes place. The Astral Body also known as the “Soul”, is also most appropriately known as the “des ire body”. Usually when a person first arrives in the Astral worlds they still think and express themselves in exactly the same mate rial terms as they did while still physically living on Earth. They will for example still think in terms of food, houses, cars, physical appear ance, recreati on, and indeed everything they were used to and familiar with before passing from the physical world. These earthly , material desires are largely driven by the ego and a lack of understanding of tr ue purpose and ultimate destiny; the true meaning of life. This is also the very reason that the mid-Astral worlds are so similar in appearance to the physical world having been cr eated by the Minds of humans based on what they have been used to during physical life. Humans create those things they believe they need, desire and feel most comfortable with. This then is the main reason why the Astral Body is usually known as the “desire body”, the body with which all mundane earthly, material and often desires of greed are fulfilled. It is not possible to progress to the true Spirit worlds or indeed to evolve further along the path until all physical, earthly and material desires have been completely satiated and purged, and seen as the illusions they really are. This process of realis ation might only take a very short time as measured in Earth terms, or might take hundreds or even thousands of years depending on how materialistic, selfish and"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 197 egocentric the person was while livi ng in the physical world, and how they choose to pursue those passions in the Astral world. Many people, at first at leas t, believe upon passing from the physical world that the Astral wo rld is their true home which they often think of as “Heaven”. Eventually however, everyone without exception must arrive at the realis ation that, like the physical world, the Astral worlds exist at the lowest levels of the Sp iritual reality of the Universe, and are simply another aspect of the ongoing learning process, including in pa rticular the true realisation of material desires for what they rea lly are. As previously mentioned, the “heaven” of the Astral wo rlds are based entirely upon the human concept of “heaven”, in turn based upon material things. If the physical world, the planet Ea rth is kindergart en and the Astral worlds are the primary school reception class of the Universe, still a very long way indeed from achieving graduation from university with full honours. The true “Heaven wo rlds” are the Sp iritual worlds of the Mental, Celestia l and Cosmic planes, not the Astral worlds as many might presume upon arriva l based purely upon a material focus, and indeed as many psychics living on Earth still do believe. The Astral worlds therefore exis t as a transition zone between the physical world and our true home, the glories and splendours of the Spirit worlds where onward progr ession on the ascent back to our Divine Creator continues onwards. Every person has a unique Astral Body comprised of vibrations, Energy. The balance of the element s, a person’s character, ego, temperament, beliefs and many other individual factors, will be reflected in the composition of the Astral Body and its unique Energy signature. Just as the bonding “fluid” between the Astral Body, the Soul, and the physical body is the Astral matrix, the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit is connected to the Astral Body by means of the Mental matrix. It is through the Mental matrix that all communication and thoughts are ultima tely received from the inner planes of life. "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 198 Human beings are endowed with fi ve senses corresponding to the four Universal elements, Fire, Ai r, Water and Earth, and also the Akasha, the Quintessence of the four elements. These elements are not the same as the fire as in flames, air as in wind, water as in rivers or earth as in soil of physical world, but are rather the symbolic Universal attributes anal ogous to them. These five senses are mediated through the Astral Body. While still living in the physical world the Astral Body receives sensory feedback directly from t he corporeal senses of physical body by means of the mediation of the Astral matrix. Ultimately the seat of the senses with which we experience reality is the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit, which in turn receives sensory feedback from the Astral Body by the means of the mediati on of the Mental matrix. The unique characteristics of the Astral Body, the Soul, are determined by the constitution and vibration of the Electric and Magnetic fluids, and the element s within the Energy field constituting the Astral Body. Again, the Electric and Magnetic fluids are not fluids as in physical terms, but rather the Universal representation of them being manifestations of Energy with specific characteristics. The character of a person is therefore in accordance with the balance of the Electric and Magnetic fluids and the balance, or equilibr ium of the elements. We will discuss later in this b ook the importanc e of elemental equilibrium in the context of ongo ing progress. The characteristics attributable to each of the elements comprising the Astral Body, the Soul, and which therefore manife st in the physical body as the corresponding attributes co mprising the personality and characteristics of a person are as follows: Fire Element: this element is responsible for the choleric temperament, manifesting itself in the positive or active polarity as, for example, activity, enthusia sm, eagerness, determination, bravery, courage and creat ivity. The Fire Element can also include"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 199 manifestations of the following negat ive characteristics; voracity, jealousy, passion, irritability, ar gumentativeness, lack of moderation and many others. Air Element: this element is responsible for the sanguine temperament, manifesting itself with in a person with characteristics including the following: the positive or active aspect of Air gives rise to diligence, joy, kind-heartedness, lucidity, freedom from worry, cheerfulness, light -heartedness, optimism, liveliness, independence, watchfulness, trus tfulness and many other such positive attributes. The negativ e aspect of Air includes such characteristics as being easily o ffended, disdain, gossip, lack of resilience, cunning, talkativeness, dishonesty and fickleness. The Water Element: This element gives rise to the melancholic temperament. The positive, active character attributes of Water include respectfulness, mercy, modesty, humility, seriousness, fervour, intimacy, comprehensi on, meditation, compassion, tranquillity, forgiveness, tenderne ss and many other such positive attributes. The Water element can also manifests itself within the Soul with negative, bad a ttributes, including indifference, shyness, lack of interest, being uncompromising, idleness and many more. The Earth Element: This element is responsible for the phlegmatic temperament in human beings. In its positive, active manifestations, Earth gives rise to attributes including respect, endurance, circumspection, determination, seriousness, firmness, conscientiousness, thoroughness, punc tuality, reserve, sense of responsibility, caution, sens e of purpose. The negative manifestations of character attri butable to the Earth element include shallowness, carelessness, di sdain, indifference, lack of responsibility, bashfulness, tardi ness, ponderousness, idleness, lack of reliability. The basic overall attributes, temperament and character of a person while living in both the ph ysical and Astral worlds will be determined by the balance of the elements and the actions of the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 200 Electric and Magnetic fluids withi n the Astral Body, the Soul. The Soul is the seat of the charac ter and accordingly dominates while living both in the Astral and physical worlds. This is one reason why the general population are seen to hav e so many varied characters and temperaments until such time as they can learn to tame the ego and balance the elements and fluids, a process of ennoblement of the Soul so vital for the ongoing progress and individual evolution of every single person. The complete energetic emanation of a person due to the vibration of the elements and the fluids c an be observed by means of the Aura. The balance of the element s gives rise to colours and degrees of such an intensity depending upon the character and temperament of the person in a ccordance with their level of elemental equilibrium and perfection. As mentioned earlier in this book, the Aura can be observed in the physical world by a person who is trained to see auras, an ability often known as “auric vision”, or by a person who is clairvoyant. A highly Spiritually evolved person will exhibit a very clean, bright, vivid, balanced aura, while those who are elementally unbal anced or are not particularly evolved, or exhibit negative, b ad characteristics will display a “muddy” coloured aura. The balanc e of the elements will vary slightly from day to day accord ing to moods etc., and which can observed by the behaviour of the person and the observable characteristics of the aura. "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 201 Chapter 35: The Mental Body, The Immortal Spirit The Mental Body, the Immortal Sp irit, is the aspect of a human being “made in the true image of G od”. The physical Etheric and Astral bodies are only the transient outer garments, shells for the Spirit body. Like the Astral Body , the Mental Body, the immortal Spirit, is also directly under the in fluence of the four elements that descended in the beginning from the Ether, the Akasha. The element of Fire is the fier y aspect of the Spirit and is responsible for will. The element of Air is responsible for intellect. The Water element manifests in the human being as life and feelings. The Earth element is r epresented by the unification of Fire, Air and Water, and is therefor e responsible for the individual “I” Consciousness of the human being. The highest aspect of the immortal “I”, the Ether or “Akasha” principle, manifests in humans as belief in its highest aspect, and the instinct for self-preservation in its lowest aspect. The four Universal elements and the Akas ha principle together then constitute the “I”, the individuality, the immortal Spirit “made in the true image of God”. In terms of t he elements, we can also expand their influences within the immort al Spirit, the Mental Body to include the following attributes. Fire is responsible for Energy, mi ght and passion. Air is responsible for memory and the power to judge and differentiate. Water is responsible for conscience and intu ition. Earth is responsible for egotism and the instincts for se lf-preservation and propagation. Just as the Astral Body forms it s link, the Astral Matrix, with the physical body through the electrom agnetic fluids of the Astral planes, the Astral “Od”, the Mental Body is in turn linked to the Astral Body by means of the M ental matrix formed out of the electromagnetic fluids of the M ental planes, the Mental “Od”. The Mental matrix is the most s ubtle form of the Ether, the Akasha, regulating and maintaining the activi ties of the Spirit within the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 202 Astral Body. It is the electrom agnetic properties of the Mental matrix that are responsible for the transmission of thoughts and Consciousness to the immortal Sp irit from the Mental planes. The Mental planes are the spher es and origins of thoughts and ideas. A thought begins as an idea in the Mental planes and then develops into a “thought form”. This thought form is then in turn conveyed first through the Ment al matrix and then through the Astral matrix where it is rece ived by the conscious Mind as a thought appearing to originate in t he Mind. It can clearly be seen therefore that, contrary to the views of the sciences, all thoughts and ideas originate in t he highest aspects of the Mental planes and not from within the org anic brain as is popular ly believed. Likewise, as previously mentioned, memories are “stored” in the causal Mental Body, the aspect of the immo rtal Spirit having its existence within the causal sphere of t he Universe, Ether, the Akasha. The organic brain is not therefore t he seat of Consciousness, being rather a mediator, interface or fi lter between the inner bodies and the planes in which they reside, and the physical body. This is a reason why Astral and Mental proj ection is possible as we will discuss later in this book. It is equally clear therefore that the organic brain of a physical human being is not the originator of his or her own thoughts, and the organic brain is not the Mind. Humans can rather be likened to a “receiving station”, receiving all thoughts from the world of ideas of the Mental planes through the Mental matrix, the Astral matrix and finally the organic brain. Everything in existence that humans believe to be a result of their own intelligence or ing enuity has actually been taken from the world of ideas of the Mental planes where they already exist, have always existed and always will exist beyond space and time within the “Eternal Now”. The ability and likelihood of receiv ing any particular thought from the world of ideas of the Ment al planes will always be in accordance with the circumstances in which a person exists within"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 203 the physical world. For example, a scientist will tend to attract scientific types of thoughts and ideas, a technologist will receive technical thoughts and ideas, an artist will receive artistic thoughts and ideas, and so it is for everyone, accounting for all possible circumstances in which thought processes occur. It should be mentioned that each abstract thought is composed of a particular pure element, in turn providing the thought with its unique characteristics. We have alread y discussed the effects of the elements on thoughts, but suffice it to say there will symbolically exist “fiery thoughts”, “airy thoughts”, “watery t houghts” and “earthy thoughts”. Thoughts can also contain a combinat ion of one or more elements, and accordingly such t houghts can also symbolically be predominantly electric, magnetic or electromagnetic in properties. All thoughts, like everything else in the Universe in all spheres are ultimately pure Energy, and therefore in addition to the predominant element manifesting a uni que vibration. It is these vibrations that give each thought its own unique c haracteristics. In the inner realms of life thoughts can be actua lly seen to take shape as they are created by the Mind. Not much more need be said about the Mental Body. Suffice it to say once again and most importantly, the Mental Body, the Spirit, the immortal “I” is the aspect of human beings truly “made in the image of God”, and unlike most concept s of this fact according to religions for example, the true image of God is formless, infinite and Divine, a perfect reflection of the Divine nature of mankind. Ultimately it is the immo rtal Spirit alone having freed itself from the materialism and egotism of the ph ysical world and the desires of the Astral worlds continues the onward ascent along the sacred path back to our Divine Creator, The Source, G od. Again it should be mentioned here that when we talk of “ascent” this is really an inner journey, with the physical worl d at the outermost limits, the solid epidermis of the multi-dim ensional Universe, with The Source, The First Cause, God at the very centre."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 204 Having transcended the cycles of reincarnation the immortal Spirit continues the journey ever inwards towards The Source, The First Cause, God, through the outer and then mid and inner Mental planes, through the Celestial planes and on to the Cosmic planes where finally the ultimate and most sacred opportunity can be finally realised; unity with our Creator, God.   "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 205 Chapter 36: The Higher Self The Higher-Self can be thought of as an aspect of the immortal “I”, the most Divine spark of a hum an being closest to God. The Higher-Self is sublime and has the full benefit of all lives and experiences, past present and future , and is infinitely wise. Being connected with everything in the Univer se that “is”, at all levels of reality, full access to the Higher-Self is most sought after by those consciously on the path and by t hose pursuing other Spiritual disciplines. It should be noted from the outset that the term “Higher-Self” should more correctly be “Inner-Self”. However, as the term “Higher-Self” has been so widely used and under stood, we will c ontinue with its use in this book. It is very impor tant to keep in Mind however that the physical world and therefor e our physical bodies are the outermost aspect of the Universe ex isting at the lowest rate of Energy vibration, and the highest density, and The Source, The First Cause, God is at the very cent re of all creation, existing at the very highest Energy vibration, encompassing the highest vibration of Unconditional Love. We theref ore journey inwards towards God, and our “Higher-Self”, our “Inner-Self” is an aspect of us that exists at a much higher level of Ener gy vibration and therefore much closer to God to whom our Highe r-Self, our Inner-Self is Divinely connected as with every aspect of our Being. The Higher-Self can for example pr ovide intuition to assist in circumstances where understanding, answers, clarification or guidance are needed and cannot be obtained by any “lower” means. The Higher-Self provides the highest level of connectedness and influence within the Universe in all spheres, and is therefore most im portant in any matter requiring any sort of unrestricted Universal connection su ch as that ideally required for manifestation for example. Not much more need be said about the Higher-Self, but suffice it to say that achieving and maintaini ng contact with the Higher-Self is"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 206 considered to be one of the very highest priorities. The Higher-Self being sublime, and a most Divine aspect of each human being, is the most reliable and trustworthy source of ongoing inspiration, knowledge and guidance.   "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 207 Chapter 37: The Physical Universe of Matter When most people think about “the Universe” they often think in terms of the observable Univer se of planets, solar systems, galaxies and other celestial bodies. Th is is the Univer se that can be perceived by use of the five ph ysical senses, optical equipment such as telescopes, and by scienti fic equipment that measures the Universe in other ways such as by the use of r adio telescopes and other equipment that measure frequencies within the range of the electromagnetic spectrum, withi n the capabilities of such equipment. Science even today tends to make the assumption that if it is not measurabl e by scientific equipment or the five physical senses then it simply does not exist at all. In fact the physical Universe represents only a very small percentage of the entire Universe as a whole, the majority existing at levels of Energy vibration fa r, far, far beyond the measurement capability of current scientific inst ruments. Beyond the limits of the measurement of current scientific instruments are increasing Energy levels of vibration, wh ich although are not measurable are nevertheless just as real and just as solid to the Beings existing at these Energy levels. For example, upon passing on from t he physical world at the time of the transition errone ously known as “death”, a person is in reality transitioning from the high density, low vibration environment of the physical word, to a much finer le vel of life, existence and reality existing at a much higher level of vibration. As we will discuss in much more detail in the next chapt ers of this book, the level to which people transition after passi ng on is widely known as “the afterlife or “the beyond ” or often the “Astral” plane or worlds. Upon arrival within the Astral worlds subsequent to the transition from the physical world, people find vast, very real, vibrant, dynamic worlds populated by billions of Souls, all of which are not only at least as solid and “real” as the physical world, but in fact much more so. Matter, by comparison with Energy that has not"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 208 differentiated into matter, is very crude due to its much high density and much lower relative levels of vibration. Throughout the Universe everything is relative to Energy and vibrati on; that is to say we perceive, experience and pr ogress relative to the Energy level or “plane” at which we are fo cused and at which our Astral or Mental, Spiritual body vibrates, th e vibrations of both the body and the Energy level of vibration be ing in total balance, harmony and resonance. The physical world of course does seem very solid and real to people living in the physical world, because like the physical world itself the bodies of people are comprised of physical matter, equipped with physical senses with which the physical world is experienced. After passing on a person exists with an Astral body, often known as the Soul existing at a much higher level of Energy and much lower level of density than the previous physi cal body. The level of the Astral worlds to which a pers on will transition after the process erroneously known as “death” will al ways be exactly the same level of Energy as that of the Astral body, and therefore as with the same comparative Energy levels of the physical world, everything will be perceived as being very solid and “r eal”. In fact, as previously mentioned, due to the much finer le vels of Energy of the Astral worlds without the restrictions of matter, everything is so “solid” and “real” that many people initially do not realize they have actually passed on to the next phase of life, believing themselves instead to be still within their physical body in the physical world. This is particularly true when the transiti on to the inner levels has been sudden. So everything in the entir e Universe is experienced in absolute harmony with the relative le vel of Energy an d vibration at which it exists. The Universe in its entirety may be considered to be spherical like a planet, with The Source, The First C ause, God at t he very center, existing at the very highest vibrat ion and very lowest density, progressing outwards though progr essively higher density and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 209 lower levels of Energy and vibration until finally reaching the physical world of matter forming the “shell” of the Universe. Energy can be considered to be “ light”, not physically observable light but the Divine Light of The Source, true Light in the form of Energy, the Light of God. Quant um physicist David Bohm was absolutely correct when he made t he observation that the physical Universe is actually “frozen light”. This can be likened to the process of water freezing. As wa ter gets progressively colder the molecules comprising that water pr ogressively slow down as they vibrate at lower rates of Energy of which they ultimately comprise, until eventually the Energy vibrat ion of the molecules becomes too low to sustain the water as a liquid at which point the water freezes and becomes ice. The physical co mposition of the ice and the atoms and molecules that comprise it are exactly the same as when it existed as water, the only difference being that that as ice the Energy that ultimately comprises that water or ice is now vibrating at a much lower level. Exactly the same principle applies to the existence of the physical Universe within the greater Univ erse as a whole. As Energy vibrates at a progressively lowe r rate and density increases as a result, there came a point during t he initial creation of the Universe where the vibrations of Energy became too low to be sustainable in its usual fine free Energy form, and therefore differentiated into particles of various increasing si zes, ultimately manifesting as matter, the physical Universe as observed by science and people on Earth generally. Science still seeks the origins of the Universe, the so-called “big bang” within the physical Universe itself. Of course they will never find the origins of the “big bang” anywhere within the physical Universe. The “big bang” commenc ed with The First Cause, The Source, God at the very center of all Energy progressing outwards in a totally uniform manner until t he entire physical Universe was formed at the same time at the beginning of creation."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 210 The true origin of the Universe therefore does not exist and cannot exist at a single poin t within the observable Universe, but rather commenced with The Source, The Fi rst Cause, with God at the very center of creation at the ve ry highest level of vibration of Energy of all, expand ing outwards until eventually the levels of vibration where such t hat Energy “froze” to form the physical Universe of space and time, concepts that do not exist within the Eternal Now of the greater Univ erse beyond the physical world. As the physical Universe is spherical, it has no beginning and no end. As with Earth theref ore it would be entirely erroneous to think in terms of “the end of the Universe”. As with travel on Earth, if we were able to travel in straight line within the physical Universe we would eventually arrive back at exactly at the point where we originally started. So speaking of “traveling to the ends of the Universe” is as erroneous as seek ing a specific, physical place in the physical Universe where all creat ion started with the “big bang”. The physically observable Universe in which we live for the time being is only one of a potentially infinite number of “parallel” Universes, both physical and non-physical, all existing concurrently. This is possible due to the fact that everything in the Universe is ultimately pure Energy, and such concepts as “dimensions” do not really exist except to the limit ed perception of the human senses. Parallel Universes exist at all le vels of the Energy spectrum, not just the lowest aspect where E nergy differentiates into physical matter. Science even now is beginn ing to realize the possibility of these parallel Universes when su ch “phenomena” as “black holes” were discovered. The entire Universe, including the physical Universe is maintained in a stat e of perfect harmony by The First Cause, The Source, God. In the context of the physical Universe therefore the same balance needs to exist in order to maintain perpetual harmony. Physical Univ erses are balanced by the opposite characteristics of matter and anti-matter which although are configurations of Energy at similar levels of vibration and density, have opposite physical char acteristics of the particles of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 211 which they are constituted. This also fully supported by the findings of quantum physics. These infinite physical Universes are inter-connected by Energy tunnels sometimes known as “w ormholes”. Wormholes are conceptually gateways, or tunnel s between the physical Universes of matter and anti-matter. So tr aveling through a wormhole would result in the arrival within a par allel Universe of anti-matter, and then traveling through a further worm hole would result in arriving at a further parallel Universe of matter. In this way an infinite number of parallel physical Universes ar e sustained in perfect harmony within the greater Universe of E nergy, Mind and Consciousness. The word “dimension” is also erroneous. Ultimatel y everything in the Universe without any exceptions is pure Energy differing only in configurations of that Energy as influenced by Mind. Everything within the Universe from The Sour ce, The First Cause, God to the physical world of matter is in absolutely inseparable aspect of everything else, of that very same Energy without exception. These most important realities will be fully discussed later in this book. Governments of the world are cu rrently spending va st amounts of money on exploration of the ph ysical Universe at a time when millions of people in the world are suffering from disease, famine, war and other situations. In fact the destiny of every single human being is not to travel within the re strictions of the three dimensional Universe of matter, but to travel inwards through the glories of the greater Universe on the sacred path back to God. It is the ultimate destiny of everything in the Univ erse, including every human being to evolve back to The First Cause, The Source, God; the true meaning of life. True exploration therefore is not about the observable, physical Universe, but rather the about the magnificence, splendours and glories of the infinite Universe of Energy, Mind and Consciousness as a whole; our true destiny as sons and daughters of God, made in the true Spiritual image of God, ra ther than to be restricted to the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 212 ephemeral physical Universe, obser vable and experienced only by means of the physical senses, the exploration of which is meaningless in real terms, and serves no real purpose whatsoever aside from academic interest. Beyond the restrictions of the physical body, as with Astral or mental projection beyond the physi cal body, abilities within the capability of everyone as we will discuss later in this book, the entire physical Universe can be ex plored at will, traveling quite literally at the speed of thought. People who do Astral projection can and do travel anywhere on Eart h in an instant, travel to the moon including the far side of the moon, travel to other planets, solar systems and galaxies, and of c ourse most importantly of all travel inwards to the inner Energy levels and vibrations of the Astral worlds. Beyond the physical constr aints of the physical body a person is a true explorer of the Universe, personal existence and of ultimate destiny. While mankind continues to focus exclusively upon the physical Universe as an only perceived reality, no tr ue progress can be made. Only when mankind underst ands that the physical Universe is ephemeral, nothing but an illusion perpetuated by observation and interaction of the physical s enses, is therefore not absolute reality, and is rather only a temporary home provided for the purposes of ongoing evolution back to The Source, The First Cause, God, and that the true destin y of mankind is inwards to the glories of the inner E nergy levels rather than “across” the physical Universe, will true long-term progress be made. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 213 Chapter 38: The Planes of the Non-Human Mind The great planes of life include all levels of existence from the physical world of matter to The S ource, The First Cause, to God. Although science might well refer to these planes as “dimensions”, and others might collectively refer to them as “the beyond” or even “heaven” or “the heaven worlds”, they are more usually referred to in the broadest terms as the physi cal plane, the Astral planes and the Mental planes. The Mental planes also include the inner Celestial and Cosmic planes. A “plane” in addition to a dimension, is also often referred to as a “realm”, a “sphere” or a “world ”. It should always be remembered however that although this termi nology is used in order to accurately describe the various levels of life characterised by these planes, the entire Universe is actua lly a continuum of vibration and therefore of Energy and density, from the highest of The Source, The First Cause, God, down to t he world of physical matter; there are no distinct points at wher e one plane ends and the next one begins. The All truly does include “All”, everything that “is” in the entire Universe, a Universe that is God. Before discussing the planes of the non-human Mind we should first of all take a look at the va rious level of planes specifically associated with the physical world of matter constituting the planet Earth. The plane of the physical world of matter can be divided into seven sub-planes; three planes of matter, a plane of “Ethereal substance” and three planes of Energy, all of which are respectively sub- divided into seven further sub-planes of life. The first of the main physical planes of matter includes all forms of solids, liquids and gases so very familiar to everyone and in particular the sciences. "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 214 Moving upwards, the second plane of matter includes much more subtle forms of matter also recognised by science. These most notably include radiant material s such as Radium and other radioactive substances. The third plane of matter consists of a much more tenuous forms of Energy, the existence of which are not formally recognised by science. This is the plane of the “Ether” pervading the entire Universe, the medium in which waves of Energy such as electricity, magnetism, heat, light and radio waves travel. It should be noted that the Ethereal plan e does not actually include these Energy, but is rather simply a medium in which they can propagate. Above the plane of the Et her is the first plane of Energy. This is the fourth of the physical planes. Th is plane comprises all ordinary forms of Energy well-known to everyone, including heat, light, magnetism, attraction, cohesion, gr avity and chemical affinity, as well as other forms of Energy not yet formally accepted or named by science. The next inner plane of Energy includes inner forms of Energy that for the most part have not yet been identified by science. It is within this plane that various forms of mental and psychic phenomena propagate. The highest plane of Energy and t herefore the highest of all of the physical planes comprises Energy so highly organised it can include many of the characteristi cs of life. These finer Energy are far in advance of anything even remotely currently recognised by science. They are regarded as Divine powers and are well-known and utilised by advanced Beings ex isting far beyond the levels of the advancement of most human bei ngs of today, Beings who are as Gods by comparison to earthly man. Moving on to the planes of the non-human Mind, t here are six of these planes, the seventh being t he plane of the human Mind itself. The first and lowest of these planes is the first plane of the mineral"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 215 Mind. Before progressing, we s hould remind ourselves once again that everything in the entire Univ erse is a continuum, an integral aspect of The Source, The First Cause, of God. Although minerals are not usually regarded as “intelligent” as such by comparison with man and other forms of organic life, they are still nevertheless life forms in the context of Spirit, Th e Source Energy of the Universe, and for example possess an individual aura just as does any other aspect of Spirit. The first plane of the mineral Mind contains all entities widely recognised as minerals, chemical s, rocks and so on. We must be Mindful of the fact we are talki ng about the “Mind” of minerals here, and not merely the molecules, atom s and sub-atomic particles of which they are materially constitut ed. It can be said with justification we are referring to the aspect of these minerals, and indeed of every level of life in these planes, that is in reality their Soul. Although most people will not have considered the possibility of minerals actually possessing a Soul and being capable of thought as such, they do nevertheless still exhibit their own likes and dislikes, attractions and repulsion s and many other such individual characteristics. In the context of t he Universe it can also be said the emotions and feelings of minerals and the inner forms of life within all of these planes only differ by degrees relative to each other. Again, all manifestations of minera ls is ultimately in the form of vibrations of Energy. The next plane moving upwards is the first and lower plane of the elemental Mind. Elementals are invi sible to science and man to the five physical senses, but occultists and others can and do actively interact with these elemental be ings. This lowest class of the elemental Mind exhibits a level of intelligence between that of the mineral Mind on the one side, and the plant Mind on the other. Moving up the scale to the third level we reach the plane of the plant Mind. These planes and all of their associated sub-planes contain all of those beings fo rming the kingdoms of the plant"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 216 worlds. Evidence plants indeed possess a Soul and their own unique vibrations are by virtue of the fact that plants have been shown to respond favourably to si nging and music. It has frequently been demonstrated for example by singing to a plant, or playing music, the Soul of the plant rece ives the corresponding vibrations of Energy to which it responds po sitively by thriving and becoming more healthy and vigorous. Humans can and often do respond to singing and music as well of course , the vibrations of which can often profoundly influenc e the Energy, the vibrations of moods, emotions and other mental attributes. A series of experiments carried out in 1966 demonstrated conclusively that plants are capabl e of intelligent though processes when a researcher, Cleve Backster , an expert with lie detector equipment, connected a lie detector to a Dracaena plant, also known as a “Dragon tree”. He wanted to see how long it would take for the leaves to react when he p oured water on the plant’s roots. In theory, a plant will increase its conductivity and decrease its resistance after it absorbs water, and the curve recorded on graph paper should have gone upward. But in actuality, t he line that was drawn curved downward. When a lie detector is connected to a human body, the pen records different curves according to the changes in the person’s mood. The reaction of the dragon tree was just like the undulation of human mood swings. It seemed that it was happy when it drank water. Cleve Backster also wanted to see if the plant would have any other reactions. According to past experience, Backster knew that a good way to elicit a strong reaction fr om a person is to threaten that person. He then thought of burning the leaves that were connected to the lie detector. With this thought held in his Mind, and even before he went to fetch a match, a strong positive curve rapidly appeared on the graph paper. When he arrived back with a match, he saw that yet another peak had appeared on the curve. The plant had perceived that there was a good chance that it could be bu rned, and through the lie detector"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 217 exhibited the emotion of fright. If he showed less inclination to burn the plant, the reactions of the plant as recorded by the lie detector were not so strong. If he merely pretended to take action to burn the leaves, the plant had almost no reactions whatsoever. The plant was therefore full capable of disti nguishing true intentions from false ones. In a further experiment Cleve Ba ckster decided to test how well a plant can recognize things as well as people. To do this he selected six students, blindfolded them and a sked them to draw lots. One of the choices was to uproot one of t he two plants that were present for the experiment and to destroy it by treading on it. This person was to carry out this alone, and none of the other students knew who had actually drawn this task. By proceeding in this manner only the remaining plant would know the identity of the murderer of the other plant. The remaining plant was then connec ted to a lie detector and each of the students was asked to walk by the remaining plant that had witnessed the murder of the ot her plant. The plant showed no reactions to the five students w ho had not been involved with the destruction of the other plant, but when the student who had murdered the other plant walked by, the remaining plant that was connected to the lie detector show ed an extreme reaction on the lie detector recording. The plant was able to identify the exact person responsible for the destruction of its friend. This demonstrates extremely well t hat plant life, like all life and indeed everything in the Universe are an inseparable aspect of the same infinite Mind, Consciousne ss and intelligence of The Source, The First Cause, of God. Human beings, still totall y steeped in the material world and personal ego assume that just because a plant does not appear to have a physical br ain, or a mouth or any other animal characteristics that they are “unintelligent” or simply “inanimate”. Nothing in fact c an be further from the truth. The human brain is not the real Mind any more than physical parts of a plant or a mineral are real Mind even though they share the same"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 218 Energy and are observable at t he level at which they can be perceived. All Mind is focussed within its own Energy plane, in the case of plants the plane of the plant Mind, but at t he same time because everything in the Univ erse is an inseparable aspect of everything else in the Universe at a quantum level, then all aspects of the infinite Mind of God are capable of instant communication through the individual Mind and the Univer sal Mind. This is why everything in the Universe, plant, animal or mineral has intelligence, and can communicate through the medium of the same infinite Universe of Energy, Consciousness and Mind of which we are all an integral aspect within the Mind of God. On a quantum level this is proven by virtue of the fact that any pair of Quanta in the entire Universe in all of its Energy levels of vibration can instantly co mmunicate with each other. Moving inner still to the fourth leve l, we find the ne xt plane of the elemental Mind. These are a more advanced class of elemental with a level of Mind situated in between those of plants and animals. Entities existing at these levels can exhibit the characteristics of both. The next plane with its associated sub-divisions is the plane of the animal Mind and comprises the Minds of all members of the animal world so familiar to everyone. Not much more can or need be said about the animal Mind, but suffice it to say that these sub-planes contain all levels of lif e from the most basic of animal life including single celled organisms at the lowe st aspect, to the most advanced animal life at the very highest aspect. The highest level of these planes would include levels of Mi nd just below that of the human Mind, and might for example include primates. The next and sixth le vel moving upwards is the highest plane of the elemental Mind. The intelligence of these beings is between that of"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 219 the animal Mind and the human Mind. The highest levels of beings existing in these planes can exhibit semi-human intelligence.   "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 220 Chapter 39: The Planes of the Human Mind Moving beyond the planes of t he non-human Minds we reach the final and highest plane, the plane of the human Mind. Like all planes, this plane also has se ven sub-planes corresponding with the level of Spiritual evolution achieved by individual human beings on the path back to our Divine Creat or, The Source, God. Again, these planes are levels of Energy , vibration, corresponding to the levels of vibration of the human Mind. By “Mind” we do not mean “brain”, but rather true “Mind” in the Spiritual sense. The average human being today has reached the fourth level within the planes of the human Mind. Only the most advanced of humans have transcended this level to reach t he fifth level of the planes of the human Mind. It should be noted that it has taken mankind millions of years to achieve these levels, and it will take many humans many more years to atta in the sixth and seventh level planes and onwards and upwards to the even gr eater planes of life, in accordance with Spiritual awar eness, evolution and attainment of each individual. This is a major reason why no person should delay their own ongoing progress. We are advised however there are races in other parts of the Universe who have transcended thes e levels before us and have progressed onwards to the inner spheres of life. We are also advised some races have already evolved back to the First Cause and achieved the potential of unity with God, t he ultimate potential of all mankind and the true meaning of life. Human beings of Earth we are advis ed, are so far the fifth race in the Universe to have set foot upon the sacred pat h. There are however a few highly advanced human Souls who have already evolved well beyond most other human beings, having advanced to the sixth and even sev enth sub-divisions of t he human plane, a few having progressed even further still to the inner and more glorious Spiritual planes of life and reality."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 221 Within all of these levels or plan es of life, each in dividual life-form can also exist within its own uni que “group Mind”. We can observe the behaviour of many classes of creatures in nat ure belonging to the same “group Mind”. For example, vast shoals of fish or flocks of birds can be observed to appear to behave as a single, unified Mind when instantly changing direct ion completely as one, thereby appearing to exhibit the characte ristics of a single entity. The fact is however, although they might well only appear to be individual entities as observed at the physical level, in other words the plane at which they are ph ysically observed to exist, these creatures really are effectively behaving as a single entity, as a single collective Mind at the level of the mental plane of the animal Mind at which they also exis t, and therefore can be physically observed to behave as one as a single entity. Humans, having greater abilities of the Mind and being at a higher level in the great planes of life, do not overtly behave in exactly the same way as the creatures in the examples mentioned, having been endowed with more individualit y and exhibiting more freewill and powers of individual thou ght. Nevertheless, the group human Mind most certainly does exist, and accordingly humans can and frequently do influence each other upon the plane of the collective human Mind. It is at the level of the group human Mind that some psychic abilities occur, incl uding for example telepathy. A very graphic and obs ervable illustration of the group Mind in “higher” level animals can be observed by the “hundreth monkey effect” as reported by biologist Ly all Watson in his book Lifetide. This experiment took place on a Japanese island where researchers fed sweet potatoes to Macaque monkeys. This was a new, not previously encountered staple food for these monkeys. The monkeys liked the sweet potat oes but did not like the sand covering the potatoes fr om the beach. Soon one monkey started to wash the potatoes in the sea to remove the sand and also to add a desirable salty taste. In due course more and more monkeys on the"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 222 island copied the potato washing habi t of the original monkey. Very soon the same action was being practiced spontaneously by the entire Macaque monkey community. A critical mass of monkeys washing their sweet potatoes had been reached. Notably, very soon thereafter, whole communities of Macaque monkeys on other totally unconnec ted islands taking part in this experiment spontaneously began t he practice of washing their sweet potatoes in the sea, ev en though there was no possible connection or communication between the Islands and their respective communities of Macaque monkeys. This is a more dramatic and conclusively observ able example of the “group-entity Mind”. The group Mind gives rise to, and makes possible many so called “phenomena” that we will discuss in more detail later in this book. Humankind entity, the “higher” state of the human Mind as opposed to its physical counterpart bound by the physical five senses, normally dwells in a multi-dimensi onal reality where space and time do not exist. Accordingly, what are normally perceived as individuals at a physical level are actually all different aspects of one single aspect of realit y; the “Humankind entity” or “plane of the Human Mind”. Like all “planes” in the Universe, the plane of the Human Mind is a level of Energy, vibration shared by all human beings who have attained that level. Although humans and ot her entities remain as individuals throughout the multi-dim ensional continuum of the Universe, from the physical world to the very hi ghest levels, they also share a common plane of Mind or Conscious ness according to the type of entity and the level of evoluti on of the entity. Currently, as mentioned before, mo st humans therefore share the level of Energy, vibration corresponding to t he fourth level of the plane of the human Mind. This principle applies to all levels of all of the classe s of “entities” from the very lowest to the very highest. Only “The Source”, God,"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 223 The First Cause therefore has a comp lete “view” of all classes of entity below Him/Herself. The concept of the “group entity” has been referred to throughout the ages. Plato discussed transcendent invisible “forms” which cause physical manifestation in the physical world. The eminent Swiss psychologist Carl Jung concluded humans share one “collective unconscious” which li es deeper than the unconscious of each individual. This collective unc onscious, or “group entity”, was further supported by Jung when he also noted that the same symbols, myths, fairy tales and si milar traditions could be found in several geographically diverse cu ltures, even though no physical communication or other connection could possibly ever have ever occurred between them. Each class of entity existing at t he multi-dimensional level exists within the Energy and vibration continuum of the multi-dimensional Universe outside of the temporal confines of sequential space and time. The humankind entity already includes all humans existing now, have ever existed and ever will exist. It can be noted that this is the solution to the very comm only asked question “how are new Souls created out of nothing”, in c onsideration of the fact the world population is greater today than ever it was in the past? The solution to this mystery in fact is that these Souls have always existed as Spirit beyo nd the confines of physical space and time in the “Eternal Now”, and accordingl y are not “new” Souls at all. These Souls are quite simply inca rnating into the temporal space and time bound world of physical matte r from the eternal continuum of inner multi-dimensi onal realities where they have always existed as Spirit, an aspect of the Great Spirit, God. It is only when a human be ing incarnates for the first time that a “unit of Spirit”, an “aspect of God”, descends from the Logos into the form of an unborn child, at wh ich point the human becomes and remains an individual human being. Here in the physical world, erroneously referred to as “real ity”, humans can only perceive a three dimensional existence in accordance with the five physical"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 224 senses. However, from its multi-dimensional perspective, the Higher-Self of an individual can perceive all possible inter- relationships, possibilities and potentials completely beyond the comprehension of human beings li ving exclusively from the perspective of the physical world. Accordingly, the “Higher-Self” of each individual has full access to the multi-dimensional continuum of reality, and can therefore whenev er required or requested to do so provide its physical counterpart with extremely valuable guidance based upon w hat it can perceive beyond the confines of the temporal space-time environment. We can conclude by also noting that as we are all members of the “humankind entity”, this also ex plains the phenomen a baffling so many people today such as ce rtain forms of telepathy, manifestation, pre-cognition and many other so called “psychic phenomenon”, which in fact are nothing more than completely natural workings of the Universe in accordance with the Universal laws we have already discussed. Finally, we must again note that although ever yone is a member of the “humankind entity” on the pl ane of the “co llective human Consciousness”, everyone is also equally and ultimately a member of “The All Entity”, and we are a ccordingly all immortal Sons and Daughters of God, Spiritually “made” in the true image of God.  "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 225 Chapter 40: The Astral Worlds Having previously discussed the various Universal planes of life from a general perspective, and al so the processes occurring upon the “death” of the physical body, we can now take a much more detailed look at the Astral worlds, also known as the Astral planes, Astral realms or Astral spheres, sometimes also known as “the beyond”, “the afterlife” or the “four th dimension”, to which people will transition soon after leaving the physical world. Before discussing the more detail ed characteristics of the Astral worlds as relates to human beings, we should first consider the more general aspects of these planes of life and reality. It should be noted that the Astral word s are in effect the “f ifth dimension”, with the length, width and height of t he physical world being the first three dimensions and time bei ng the fourth dimension. As with all planes in the mult i-dimensional c ontinuum of the Universe, the Astral planes are density degrees of the Universe, The Source, God. The Astral pl anes are therefor e fundamental to the creation of everythi ng that exists, has ever existed and ever will exist in the physical world of matte r in accordance with the principle of correspondence, “as above so below”. Everything existing in the material world must therefore first exist in the Astral world. As we will see later, this is the basis for all manifestation, and therefore of all creation in the material world. The Astral planes are therefore also a reflection of everything that has ever occurred in the material world, is occurri ng now and ever will occur in the future, again in accordance with the Universal Law of Correspondence, “as above, so bel ow, as below, so above”; the “future” being relative to the temp oral concepts of the measurement of time as perceived within the three dimensions of the physical world. The Astral worlds are also the sphere of vibrations in which light, sound, colour and rhythm, and thus all life and everything ever"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 226 created, and ever will ever be created has its origin. As mentioned previously, nothing can exist on Earth without first originating in the Astral worlds. The Astral worlds are therefore an emanation of the Eternal without beginning or end, and are therefore timeless, spaceless and infinite. Most esoteric and occult traditions as well as organisations involved with the practice of “Spiritualism” usually consider the Astral worlds to be the “the fourth dimension” , “the beyond” or sometimes the “afterlife”. As discussed previously however there really is no such concept as “this life” and the “next life”, or “this world” and the “next world”, which is why “death” as people generally understand it quite simply does not exist, except as a fear in the Consciousness Mind of most humans. As we will discuss later, learning t he ability of Astral Projection will remove the fear of death comple tely, providing first-hand evidence of the reality of the Astral worlds and the continuity of life beyond the confines of the temporal ph ysical shell of body. It should be noted once again however that it is this very lack of understanding of the illusion of “death” that has contributed in no small part to the state of the world as we witness it today. Most people, being completely unaware of their own immortal, Divine nature, live each life as if it was the only chance they will ever get to “exist”, and therefore as a direct result become steeped in the material illusion of the world of the five physical senses. When mankind finally re-discovers these realities, people will waste no opportunity to do everything they need to do of their own freewill in order to progress to the glories of the “heavenly” spheres of life, glories that are far and way be yond the comprehension of most people still living on Eart h, worlds which are in deed true reality, our true home as Spiritual bei ngs as opposed to the physical illusion of Earth and indeed the entire physical Universe. The Astral worlds are home to a ve ry wide variety of inhabitants in addition to humans. There are many beings and intelligences that have never incarnated on Earth, and wh o’s task it is to assist in the"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 227 evolution of mankind on Earth. There are also the beings of the single elements, many of which form the basis of earthly “fairy stories”. There are also the more simple beings of the elements known as “elementaries” which are much less advanced, but nevertheless do exhibit a degree of intelligence and have their role to play in the grand Universal scheme. Also living within, or visiting the Astral worlds are a very wide variety of beings of all levels and intelligences, most of which are beyond the comprehension of earth ly man, including beings originating from other planets in the Universe. We will discuss some of these beings in more detail later in this section, but suffice it to say for now that in the Astral worlds there are many degrees of Energy, of vibration at which life exists, everyone and everything existing at a particular degree of vibration exhibiting similar characteristics. In the mid-Astral worlds, at the le vel of vibration where most decent people currently find themselves after physical death, existence is one of peace, harmony and tranquillity, often in very stark contrast to the previous existence within the physical world of the Earth life system. These Astral worlds also seem much li ghter, solid and “real” than the physical world, whic h by comparison seems to be a very dull, murky, oppressive place indeed. As previously mentioned, there ar e many levels of vibration and comparative density of the Astral worlds, all of which exhibit their own unique Energy. A human bei ng, indeed any being will after physical death automatically trans ition to the most appropriate Astral world, most closely ma tching his or her own particular vibration, ego, temperament, char acter, and most importantly the beliefs and attitudes of the person at the time of physical “death”. If a person is open-Minded and fully understands the process erroneously known as “death”, and a ssuming their previous life has been a normal and decent one, they will effortlessly transition to the light, peace and harmony of the mid-As tral worlds. More Spiritually advanced people will transit ion to the inner Astral worlds where"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 228 conditions are even more blissful and beyond the comprehension of most people still living in the physical world of matter. Let us now take a closer look at the various levels of the Astral worlds, the Astral planes in more detail. Before doing so however it is important to once again stress there are no actual definitive borders or boundaries bet ween the various Astral planes. The entire Universe from the The Prim e Creator, The First Cause, God is a continuum, consisting of vibr ation, Energy, from the very highest level of The Source down to the very lowest of the physical world of matter. All Astral planes form an integral, lower aspect of this vast and infinite Energy continuum. It should also once again be noted w hen we talk about the “inner worlds” of the Astral and Mental planes, the Spirit worlds, these really are inner worlds or planes relative to the physical Universe. The multi-dimensional Universe can be likened to a sphere with the physical Universe being the outermost and thinnest layer and which can be likened to a “skin”, and epi dermis, an outer “shell”, within which sphere everything else in creation exists with The Source, The First Cause, God at the ve ry centre of creation. Indeed, quantum physicists David Bohm most appropriately referred to the physical Universe of matter, the outermost aspect of the multidimensional Universe, as “fro zen light”. The physical Universe is indeed “frozen light”, the very lowest vibration and highest density manifestation of Energy of the primordi al Light of God from Whom everything was created in the beginning. As human beings are Spiritually m ade in the “true image of God”, and therefore of the Un iverse, each finer, subtle body of a human being, the microcosm, are also “inner bodies”. The physical human body, as with the Universe as a w hole, the Macrocosm, is the outer shell, and each successive body, the Etheric, Astral, and Mental bodies are all progressively finer, more subtle inner bodies, existing at progressively inner levels of vibration and lowe r density, being equivalent to the level of the Un iversal continuum, in other words the sphere, world, plane, dimension at which they exist. This is why"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 229 meditation and similar disciplines are considered to be forms of “inner exploration”.    "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 230 Chapter 41: The Lower Astral Planes The lower Astral planes are what might well be considered to be the “hells” in accordance with th e “heaven” and “hell” concepts of religion. The lower Astral planes ar e not actually “down below”, as in “beneath the Earth” as those who would believe in the concept of “hell” popularly believe, but are rather the ve ry lowest vibrational levels of the Astral planes. These levels are still “inwards” relative to the Universal continuum than the physical world of matter. It should also be emphasised that there is no such entity as “satan”, “lucifer”, or the “devil” ruling the lower levels of the Astral worlds in a place called “hell”, and neither have the people who currently exist at the lower levels of the Astral worlds been sentenced to any form of “eternal damnation”. T hese once again are all controlling doctrines of religion in seeking to exert control over their congregations by means of fear. The lowest levels of the Astral planes are inhabited by people who led a particularly dark, “evil” existence when living in the physical world. Such people might include mu rderers, rapists, criminals, terrorists, some dictators, and all those who otherwise lived a violent, hate oriented life on Eart h. After death, as previously discussed, a person will automatica lly migrate to the plane where “like attracts like”, corresponding with the vibrations, beliefs and other characteristics of the Astral Body. Murderer s will therefore find themselves in a dark, dank, oppressive, misty, hate and fear filled world, a world that is a refl ection of their own vibration, their personality, temperament and characteristics, and which world will generally be inhabited by other murderers of like character. In this “murder world”, the residents will spend most if not all of their time striving to murder other people, and who will of course in turn be striving to murder them. There might well be hundreds of thousands or even millions of such murderers from Earth’s past, present and future in any particular lower Astral “murd er world”, all engaged in these same dark activities . The same situation exists in a multitude of similar worlds, where people of similar dark"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 231 characteristics will exist at the sa me plane of Energy and vibration, all endeavouring to exert their influence over the other residents as a continuation of thei r dark lives on Earth. In the Astral worlds it is of course impossible to physically harm anyone in the absence of a physical, material body. These people of the “murder worlds” can theref ore spend potentially all eternity murdering others and in turn themselves being murdered over and over again, until they eventually learn their lessons and can progress. There will be many such “murder worlds” in the lower Astral planes, consisting of virt ually every type murderous culture and circumstance existing today, ever existed in the past and ever will exist in the future of the ph ysical world of Earth. These people will always find themselves in exactly those conditions which most closely matched their previous dark, “evil” lives on Earth, conditions completely necessary in order to eventually allow th em to learn the lessons necessary in order to rais e the vibrations of their Astral Body in order to progress to inner planes, or very often to reincarnate for another life on Earth in order to live the sort of life necessary in order to balance karma and thereby transition to inner Astral worlds upon the next physical death. So in these lower Astral worlds murderers will continue to murder each other, robbers will continue to steal from each other, rapists will continue to rape each other, gangs will continue to fight each other, warmongers will continue to wage war on each other, oppressors will continue to oppress each other and so on, all in their own particular level of Energy and vibration of the lower Astral worlds, each of which is analogous to a particular type of “hell”. These lower Astral worlds completely reflect the character and level of vibration of their residents in accordance with t he Universal Law of Correspondence, and w ill therefore, as mentioned before be typically dark, damp, cold, mist y and oppressive environments, with swamps, waste lands devoid of beauty, dark shadows, trees without leaves, and many other such characteristics, all of which most accurately reflect the dar kest aspects of the people living"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 232 there. These dark worlds woul d most certainly seem like “purgatory” to these people, but ar e in fact “hells” they have created for themselves as a reflection of their own vibration, characters and dark lives previously lived on Earth. Contrary to religious dogma however, none of these people are stuck in these dark Astral “hell” worlds for eter nity. They will remain there regardless of how long it ta kes as measured in Earth time until they can finally come to realise and understand the significance and negative effect s of their past lives upon themselves and other peopl e, and therefore the im pact it is exerting on their current situation, and are fully prepared to take the necessary actions required in order to progress. They must first fully understand and directly ex perience the true and precise degree of fear, hate and suffering wh ich their previous physical lives inflicted on other people. Then and only then can they reconcile their current situation and resolve to return to Earth for another physical life with the intention of becoming a better person next time around, and thereby ac hieving progress on the path. Such a person can also start to balance the considerable karma arising from their previous dark existences and actions. These people might for example actually choose to live their next life on Earth as a victim, in order to expe rience similar degrees of suffering as endured by their own victims dur ing their previous life on Earth. If and only if they succeed in being a decent person during their next physical life, after the next physical death they can then progress to the brighter, more ha rmonious levels of the Astral worlds where they can then begin to learn the next lessons allowing further progress to even inner levels still. No human being, regardless of how ev il they might have been in an Earth life or lives is ever condemned to these dark, “hell” like lower Astral worlds forever. Everyone has the fundamental right granted by our Creator, and by means of the very freewill possessed by every human, to resolve problems and progress to the inner spheres of life. No matter how very dimly the Divine spark flickers in"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 233 people inhabiting these lowest, dark Astral worlds, the spark can and eventually will glow brighter as progress is made, even if such progress takes aeons as measured in physical time. Even the most evil people that have ev er walked the Earth can and eventually will progress to the inner Astral worlds and beyond on their own path back to God, such is the ultimate destiny of the entire human race.   "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 234 Chapter 42: The Belief System Territories Due to the strong, widespread involvement by people with the various religions or “belief systems”, we should certainly discuss what might happen to such people after passing on from physical life on Earth. As previously discussed, when a person leaves their physical body at the point of physical death, a nd after often spending some time within the Etheric plane close to Earth, they will usually make the full transition to the Astral world which will become their next home. The level of the Astral worlds in which a person will find themselves after the transition from physical life depends very much upon the many factors prevailing at the po int of physical death. As we have previously noted, two of the biggest influences will be the level of Spiritual attainment and the overa ll character of the individual, especially during the years just prior to passing on. Factors involving the character include the ego, general attitude towards other people, attitude towards material things, degree of selfishness or selflessness, willingness to be of selfless service to others, and numerous other such individual c haracteristics. These in turn influence the equilibrium of the As tral Body, and most importantly therefore it’s state and level of vibration, de nsity and balance. The level of vibration and density of t he Astral Body together with the beliefs a person holds in the year s immediately preceding physical death in turn determines the highest level of the Astral worlds in which a person can initially exis t after the transition following physical death. Most average, decent people with no particular higher level of Spiritual attainment, and with what might be vi ewed as an average sort of character and with no parti cular closely held beliefs, will arrive at the mid-Astral worlds which are remarkably similar to the Earth life system they recently departed. They will be attracted to a community consisting of the ty pe of environment and culture of people with which they are most familiar and comfortable with in everyday physical life. They will usually soon feel most at home"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 235 after making the inevitable adjus tments to compensate for the unique characteristics of “life afte r death”, in particular the fact the Astral worlds are “Mind worlds ” where the Mind, thought and imagination has a profound influence on the way in which they perceive and experience everything. There are however various levels of the Astral worlds located between the “hell” like lowest As tral planes and the much more peaceful and harmonious mid-Astr al planes. These lower planes have often been described as the “belief system territories”. Although the belief system terr itories do not have the same absolute “hell” like qualities of t he lowest Astral planes, they can nevertheless seem like a “hell” to people who transition to these territories after physical death, and become trapped in the Energy of that particular level of vibration. Many people at the time of t heir passing still maintain very deep religious or other strongly held bel iefs, a part of which includes a definite concept of what will happen to them a fter they “die”. Such people have very often been practicing their particular religion or “belief system” all their lives, a nd accordingly their beliefs have become very deeply seated in thei r psyche or Soul. These people after passing on often find themselves in a lower level of the Astral worlds in an environment that is a complete reproduction of the religion or belief system they prac ticed and were so influenced by on Earth. The people living in a nd ruling these belief syst em territories have over the course of past, present and future time as measured in Earth terms, created entire worlds in which everything revolves around the absolute devotion to a par ticular belief, and in the case of religious beliefs often ruled by those who were the heads of their churches during physical life. Alt hough life in these worlds can be pleasant, tolerable at least to those who are so religiously inclined, in no way are they comparable to the serenity of the mid-Astral levels and inner Astral worlds, where everyone has the complete"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 236 freedom of choice to do as they please in an environment of complete freedom, peace and harmony. The main focus of the inhabitant s of the religious belief system territories are their churches and an absolute unconditional devotion to the religi on prevailing in thes e worlds. There are “worlds”, levels of vibration for ev ery type of religion, belief and cult. We are advised the people who live in these belief system territories initially believe they are indeed in “heaven”, a religious heaven, and are quite c ontent to continue to live a devoted religious existence within these worlds, comple tely oblivious to the realities, freedom and splendours of t he inner Astral worlds. As in the physical world, the l eaders of some of these “religious worlds” maintain a very close control over their “congregations” by for example threatening to have t hem “cast them out into the darkness and wilderness” if they do not conform to, and live by the rules set out by the belief system leaders. These threats are similar to the threats of being cast into “ hell and damnation” of the religions on Earth. To those who initially fi nd themselves in such a world but having later seen it for what it really represents, being unable to leave these belief systems territories can indeed seem like being trapped in a “hell” world, a religious hell. Sooner or later, as with the lower “hell” worlds, t he residents of the belief system territories begin to see the reality of th eir situation for what it really is, and eventually de sire to escape the environment in which they have become trapped in order to progress. Fortunately the residents and beings of the inner levels of the Astral planes are fully aware of the situation of those who are trapped in the lower planes including the belief system territories, and always remain vigilant and ready to help and to guide them wherever possible. It should also be menti oned that there are la rge bands of people in the mid to high levels of the Astral worlds who are actively involved with assisting those trapped in t he lower levels should such assistance be appropriate, and is not against the freewill of those"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 237 people. Such is the way of life in t he Universe in all levels, spheres and realms of life and rea lity, the inner always assisting the lower in the great ascent back to our Creator. Due to the law of freewill, a helper from a inner level of the Astral worlds cannot offer or endeavour to assist someone in a lower level unless they specifically request such assistance either directly or indirectly. Like all communications in the worlds beyond Earth, such a request or plea for help will be sent in the form of a focussed telepathic thought that will be received in the inner worlds. Once this thought request is received, helpers from the inner Astral worlds can then descend to the lo wer vibration and higher density of the belief system territory in which the person was trapped in order to rescue them, and lead t hem to their new home in the peace and harmony of the mid-Astral worlds There are many such belief system territories in the lower Astral planes corresponding to the many diverse beliefs and religions that have ever existed, exist now and ever will exist in the future of Earth time. Beliefs do not necessarily need to be strictly religious in order for a person to become trapped in one of these lower Astral belief system territories. Any sort of strongly held belief or concept, particularly relating to what at person believes wil l happen to them after physical death will be sufficient to attract the person to a plane or world which matches their particular belief. Like all of the lower Astral worlds however, people can and usually do sooner or later escape or are rescued, and can progress to the world of their rightful abode where they will no lo nger be trapped by their belief, and can progress while enjoyi ng the harmony, peace and splendours of the i nner Astral worlds. It therefore simply cannot be emphasised enough the tremendous importance of understanding before physical death the true nature of the inner realities, the process of physical death and afterwards, and in particular in not holding to a strongly held belief before passing on to the Astral worlds. In physical life the objective should always be one of complete Sp iritual awareness, living life"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 238 accordingly, and remaining totally open to the inner spheres of reality awaiting after physical death. It is never too late in physical life to make the effort to discover and understand these greater realities, and in particular to diss olve any strongly held belief, be it a religious belief or otherwise. Failur e to do so might well result in being “trapped in a belief” after pa ssing on, at which point it becomes much more difficult to escape from and transcend that belief while living in an envir onment surrounded by people who are also trapped and living within the same belief. Those who know the peace and harmony of the inner Astral levels and beyond would never allow themselves to become trapped in a “hell” like belief system of the lowe r Astral planes. This is one of the major benefits of Astral Projection as will be discussed later. Those who before physical death travel to the Astral worlds and can accordingly see and experience the conditions and environments for themselves, would never allow themselves to become trapped within the potential hell of a belief in the lower Astral worlds.  "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 239 Chapter 43: Lower Level Astral Entities There are a very wide variety of bei ngs inhabiting the Astral worlds in addition to humans and other more advanced forms of Universal life. These beings can exhibit a very wide range of intelligence, characteristics and purpose in acco rdance with their position in the grand scheme of things, often exis ting as members of a single element of Fire, Air, Water or Earth. One of the most basic Astral bei ngs of the single elements, is known as an “elementary”. An elementary can be consciously created upon the Astral planes by a person living in the physical world who is experienced in these matters. Such a being thus created can then be endowed with a certain leve l of intelligence and abilities in order to carry out specific tasks upon the Astral planes for its creator. It should be mentioned straightaway that the laws of karma still very much apply in these cases, and should a person create an elementary for negative purposes there will most surely be a karmic price to pay. Similarly if an elementary is cr eated without the necessary degree of control over it, and it subsequently causes harm to others in any way, then t he creator of the elementary will again be karmically responsible for his or her own creation. Nevertheless, elementaries c an be and often are created for positive use in the Astral planes such as for psychic defence and many other purposes. Elementaries can maintain themse lves from human vibrations, and usually have a finite lifespan, the extent of which can be predetermined by its creator who will usually have “programmed” the elementary to “dissolve” itse lf, usually either after a certain period of time or by m eans of a telepathic comma nd. It is also quite possible, and indeed it quite o ften happens for people to create an elementary without knowin g they have done so. This can occur for example when a person thinks or obsesses about something persistently over an extended period of time. Such thoughts can"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 240 result in a resilient thought form, larvae or elementary being created at the level of that thought upon the Astral planes. Another form of basic Astral bei ng is known as a “phantom”. A phantom is created when one or more people think intensively enough about another person, often a recently deceased person who is the subject of considerable grief and mourning, and who is accordingly thought about persistently. These phantoms are often semi-intelligent, and usually take upon exactly the same appearance and characteristics as the deceased person. Very often psychic mediums make contact with these phantoms believing them to be the actual Soul of a deceased person, and accordingly become completely convinced they are in fact communicating with the real Soul of the deceased pers on. In turn unfortunately, the medium often convinces bereaved relatives that they are in communication with the Soul of their deceased loved one, and all manner of deception can then occur, albeit usually unwittingly. This is one important reason why a p sychic medium should never be relied upon unless the medium has impeccable credentials and proven psychic ability. This is also another reason why people should learn Astral Projection in order to visit deceased people directly within the Astral worlds , therefore havin g no doubts as to the authenticity of the experience. Eventually, once people cease mour ning and intensively thinking about the deceased person, the phantom will lose its source of emotional Energy and eventually di ssolve back into the elements of the Ether, the Akasha of its own accord. A further class of very basic Astral being known as “l arvae” are also brought into existence on the lowest levels of the Astral planes by the intensive and often repetitive emotional thoughts of humans. Larvae will endeavour to maintain t hemselves from the vibrations and emotions of people, and will usually s eek people who are generating high levels of intense emotions or passions upon which to feed. Larvae can therefore be c onsidered to be a sort of “Astral parasite”."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 241 Although only of very low level intelligence and characteristics, larvae nevertheless have a definite survival instinct satisfied by feeding from strong human emotions originating in the physical world. The survival instincts of larvae can be so strong they will often seek a person upon which to “p sychically feed”. They typically do this by locating a human who is su sceptible to the particular type and intensity of passions and emoti ons they require in order to continue to exist, and then to caus e and stimulate these emotions or passions to arise in their victim. In order to grow stronger the la rvae continually arouse increasingly inner levels of emotions and passi ons within the host, the vibrations generated from which they then feed from within the Astral planes. This situation can also feed u pon itself, the more intense the passions invoked in the human hos t, the stronger the larvae will become, and it is even possible that eventually whole swarms of such larvae will be attracted to the person which can in turn lead to much more severe emotional or psychological problems for the victim. Astral larvae attacks like this are certainly not uncommon, and unfortunately in the physi cal world they will us ually be diagnosed as a psychological problem usually treated by means of drugs and various behavioural therapies, but which of course unfortunately do not heal the root cause of the pr oblem; larvae attachments in the lower the Astral planes. The only way a person can free themselves from such a situation in the long -term is to consciously cease the passions and emotions from whic h the larvae are feeding, thus depriving them of the mental vibr ations, the food they require in order to exist and survive. Only when medicine and in particular psychiatry and psychology recognise s these causes and treatments and those of the numerous other forms of psychic attack, some of which will be discussed later in this book, can a patient be most appropriately and effectively treated in the long-term. There is yet another broad class of lower Astral life that can be considered to be higher than an elementary known as “schemata”."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 242 Among the classes of schemata are particularly well-known varieties known as “incubus” and “succubus”, sometimes wrongly identified as “demons”. Incubus and succubus thrive on sexual Energy and the passions, emotions and vibrations associated with such Energy. These entities will endeavour to arouse strong sexual reactions in their victims by creating strong sexual sensations. The more the victim enjoys and even welcomes and encourages these sexual urges and sensations and demands ever more satisfaction, the stronger the incubus or succ ubus will become along with its attachment to the host human being. Unfortunately many people become so involved with the pleasures derived from these entities, usually not knowing what or where they actually are, that the situation often pr ogresses to become an unshakable habit or addict ion. The only way a victim can remove a schemata is to summon sufficient self-control and will power, as with any addiction, in order to strongly resist the urges the entity is endeavouring to generate. Only then, thus deprived of the sexual Energy, will the schemata leave and possibly seek another victim of its own accord. There are a very wide range of ent ities and beings in the lowest Astral realms, some of which are harmful and many of which are not. Everyone should be aware of the presence of such beings due to the possibility of psychic attack and other such unwelcome influences. "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 243 Chapter 44: The Mid-Astral Worlds Most decent people having completed their most recent life in the physical world will soon transition to the mid levels of the Astral worlds or “planes” as they are o ften known. The Astral worlds at these levels are clean, pure, we ll organised, extremely harmonious and peaceful; the perfect place of rest in fact after the trials and tribulations of a physical life in t he Earthly world of matter. Lakes, rivers, forests, parks and numerous other delightful, peaceful and restful environments are all availa ble for the enjoyment of mid- Astral residents. The mid-Astral worlds are very si milar indeed in many respects to the most pleasant aspects of the physical world having been created by people in acco rdance with their percept ions of what the ideal world should look like based upon experiences in the physical world. The people of the Astral wo rlds have therefor e re-created the physical world within the Energy leve ls of the mid-Astral spheres of life and reality by imagining and fo cussing what they believe it should look like. People at this stage of development are still very much focussed on materialism, and therefore see an ideal world consisting of the same material things they are comfortable with, desire and above all often never could experience in the physical world. In the mid- Astral everyone can have anything they desire, and hence this level of the Universe is often k nown as the “desire worlds”. This is a perfect situation becaus e those arriving to the Astral worlds having passed on from t he physical world will find an environment that matches their expe ctations perfectly. If this were not the case the shock of arriving in the true Spiritual worlds, even with all their glories would be far too great. The Universe ensures that everyone arrives in the most appropriate level of the Universe in accordance with their vibration, which is in turn a perfect match with the vibration of the level of the Universe, in this case the mid- Astral worlds in which they will live until sooner or later making the"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 244 transition to a inner level, or ve ry often re-incarnating on Earth for another physical life. The principles of Correspondence , Causation and Attraction are highly evident within the Astral worlds with “lik e attracting like”; an immediate effect resulting from ev ery action. Everything created as a thought in the Mind can manifest instantly, including negative thoughts as well as pos itive thoughts; new Astral residents soon learn to think in a positive and constructive manner. Residents will be attracted to like-Minded people of similar characters, desires, aspirations and other life factors. People who were honest, sincere and friendly on Earth will therefore tend to find themselves attracted to, and in the presence of people of like nature in the Astral worlds. Within the mid-levels of the Astral worlds are numerous realms consisting of all cultures from the past, present and future of Earth, therefore irrespective of which co untry, culture or tradition a person experienced on Earth, there will always be a corresponding environment awaiting in the Astral worlds. No person is left isolated after passing on to these Astral worlds with like always attracting like. There is a place for everyone without exception. The usual trappings of the material world such as the need for money and therefore work do not exist in these mid-Astral worlds; there is quite simply no need for them. These are “Mind worlds” where everything desired can become an instant reality simply by imagining and willing it to exist. T here are no limits to these powers of instant manifestation, the onl y notional limits being extent and powers of desire and the imagina tion and the Energy and emotion projected behind it. If a person desire s a new home, be it a castle, a mansion, a fortress, a hut or ev en a tent, it can be manifested instantly. If a different style, interi or or furnishings are later desired, it is simply a case of imagini ng the new design, projecting and willing it to become a reality, and it will instantly become so."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 245 The same principles apply to ever ything within the Astral planes which again is why collectively the Astral worlds are also known as the “desire worlds”; people who liv e within the Astral worlds still think very much in terms of Eart hly material things, not yet fully comprehending the inner realities and true pur pose awaiting them in due course, realities that hav e nothing whatsoever to do with material things and desires. There are people who even erroneously believe the Astral worlds are “home” such is the similarity to the material world. In fact the Astral worlds, like the physical world, is only a temporary transitional home on the wa y to our true home, t he Mental planes in all of their levels, the true worlds of Spirit. The true Spirit worlds are more glorious than anyt hing the physical or Astr al worlds can ever be, but can only be attained after t he density of the material desires of the Earth and the Astral worlds have been completely satiated and seen for the illusions they truly are. Although newly arrived Astral resi dents usually find themselves in very familiar surroundings at first of the type they were used to on Earth, they are still free to explor e the vast and limitless worlds and realms existing at these levels and sub-planes providing they are still broadly within the their own vi brational plane of existence, and density of the Astral body. These areas might consist of vast metropolitan like areas, towns, villages or simply very small communities, all separated by wider spaces but still containing areas of interest. Initially the sheer vastness and limitless array of realms, environments and variety of beings living there can be absolutely overwhelming for new arrivals. There are creations, areas, and ranges of colours and sounds existing far beyond the comprehension of the earthly Mind. To the new arrival the mid- Astral worlds can indeed seem like “heaven” where everything desired can become an instant realit y, and where total peace and harmony prevails in idyllic worlds of beauty far beyond the comprehension of those living on Earth. Indeed o ne problem with"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 246 the mid-Astral worlds is that t he residents are often so happy with their “home”, they accept it as reality rather than realising their greater destiny of ascent to the inner, non-materialistic realms, the worlds of Spirit wher e the great ascent back to God continues. This ascent cannot progress until all material desires have been fully satiated. Within the Astral worlds travel is accomplished in an instant merely by thinking about where to be, whether it is travelling to a particular place or to meet a particular per son, simply by imagining to be already there. There are numerous people in the Astral worlds, both humans and other beings, who are only too happy to act as guides. The Astral planes are absolutely vas t, far more so than the physical Universe of matter, infinite, and wondrous, and include realms far beyond earthly comprehension until actually witnessed at first hand. The content and constitution of the Astral worlds have not only been created by beings and intelli gences who have originated on Earth, but also from every other planet in the physical Universe containing high level life. Everything imaginable is available to the residents of the Astral worlds and more; theatres, music halls, restaurants, huge libraries, technology, gardens, in fact everythi ng that exists, has ever existed or ever will exist on Earth, as well as much more that has never existed on Earth exists within t he Astral worlds. Everything a person could possibly need is availa ble, no Soul ever being alone unless they desire to be. These ar e reasons why to many people the Astral worlds are indeed “Heav en”, until of course they progress to the still greater wonder s of the inner Spiritual realms of life which will in turn seem like Heaven by comparison to the Astral worlds. The outer cannot usually comprehend the glories of the inner states of life and reality. Beings existing in the inner Energy levels of the Universe, the inner Astral and all of the Mental pl anes can consciously lower their vibration to visit any level of the Universe that has a lower vibration."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 247 Advanced beings therefore often “de scend” to the level of the Astral and even physical worlds in order to assist mankind with its evolution to inner levels of rea lity. Many such advanced beings can be encountered in the Astral worlds, such beings including advanced human beings such as Ascended Masters and also non- human beings such as those known as “Angels” or the beings of the analogous planetary spheres. It should be mentioned that these great non-human beings are vastly powerful Spiritua l intelligences all of whom have a purpose in th e grand Universal order, and many of whom have the task of assisting mankind. As the great journey inwards cont inues the inner is ever more glorious than the outer; one reason wh y individuals strive to attain ever higher states of perfection, and accordingly ever inner and more glorious levels of the Spir it worlds on the journey back to ultimate perfection, to God. It should be mentione d that in the absence of a physical body, earthly needs such as eating, drinking, washing, breathing, sex and any other bodily needs and functions are simply not required or applicabl e. However, to maintain the absolute stability, harmony and balance of these Astral worlds all of these earthly functions and activities can still be experienced according to the needs and desires of each individual. Everything available and possible in the physical world is also possible in the Astral worlds and much, much more, but of course without earthly physical limitations. Although clothing isn’t necessary due to the lack of ph ysical weather and environmental conditions such as wind, rain and physical temperature, most people still adorn themselves with clothing simply for appearance and perceived comfort, and of course as a matter of habit. Needless to say, like everything in the Astral worlds clothing can be changed in an instant. Although tem perature does not exist, being an attribute of the physical Univer se, the “climate” is nevertheless always optimum for complete comfort. As mentioned previously, the Astral worlds are the “desire worlds” where residents still think and expr ess themselves in physical,"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 248 material terms. It is not until all material possessions are seen as the illusions they really are can true progress be made to the inner spheres of life and rea lity. Some people are so materialistic in their thinking that this process can take hundreds or even thousands of years as measured in Earth time including many physical incarnations. Some people, in par ticular those more Spiritually advanced, already recognise the illusory nature of the Astral worlds for what they really are, and might simply take a short, welcome rest in the Astral worlds befor e moving straight on to the inner Spiritual realms of life. As material desires are satiated and realised for the illusions they truly are, the desire to move on and progress to the increasing glories, peace and harmony of the inner spheres of reality becomes ever stronger. As this happens the Astral Body becomes increasingly less dense with an increasing vibrational rate as the density of materialism is shed. Reaching this stage, a person will joyously and naturally leave the Astr al worlds to make the transition to next realm of reality, and to continue to progress and evolve on the great and most sacred journey back to God.  "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 249 Chapter 45: The Inner Astral Worlds Not much need be said about the inner Astral worlds which transcend the materialism so charac teristic of the lower planes of life. It should be mentioned that many people still regard the inner Astral worlds as the “higher” Astr al worlds. Where this might be true from the point of view of Energy vibration levels, it is again most important to know that travelling to “higher” Energy vibration is actually to travel inwards relative to the physical world and not upwards or higher. Here people have for the most part finally satiated and reconciled their most basic, earthly material desires as the illusions they really are, and are resting in a place of peace, light, harmony, splendour and bliss of a magnitude beyond t he comprehension of those still residing in the lower As tral worlds or on Earth. These inner planes are much more natural with an environment that can often be likened to the most idyllic summer’s day imaginable, with mountains, rivers, woodland and other areas of great peace and beauty, permeated by intoxicating fragrances of flowers and a wide array of peaceful sounds, the sounds of water trickling through streams, of children playing, and of the wind gently whispering through the trees. These inner levels of the Astral wo rlds have been called many things over the m illennia, including “Heaven” and the “Summerland”. The inner Astral worlds are the last stop on the way to the true Spirit worlds which are ever more glorious, peaceful and blissful the nearer they are to The Source of the primordial Light. These are the realms and beyond people truly aspire to in the great ascent along the path back to God, and a major motivation for ongoing Spiritual progression. Once experienced there will be no desire to return to the materialistic mid-Astr al or physical worlds. Of course for many people the mi ssion on Earth in the physical world has yet to be fully accomplis hed and the time will come to return to Earth in order to learn further lessons and to equilibrate"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 250 more karma, all necessary for further onward progression and evolution. Having experienced the inner Astral worlds and beyond, the next time a Soul departs the physi cal world for the Astral worlds once again, they will remember life in the inner Astral worlds and will want to leave behind the materia lism of the mid-Astral worlds as soon as possible. Such is the way of progression on the great ascent to our Creator, every Spirit aspiring to the inner and more glorious levels of life. No person should ever fear “death”. The most recent stay on Earth at an end, the next phase of immortal life is one to be looked forward to with great joy, happiness and antic ipation as an opportunity to progress nearer to God.  "},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 251 Chapter 46: Fairy-Tale Creatures There are a very wide variety of bei ngs inhabiting the Astral worlds at all levels in addition to hum ans and other advanced forms of Universal life. These beings exhibit a very wide variety of characteristics and purpose in acco rdance with their position in the grand scheme of the Un iverse, often existing as members of a single element of Fire, Air, Water and Earth. There are particular classes of these inner beings of the single elements that are actually extremely well-known to everyone, and in particular to children who enjoy hearing stories about them; stories often known as “fairytales”. The beings featuring in these “fairy tales” are actually very real indeed, but live in the Astral worlds rather than in the physica l world as most people suppose. There is a very large array of t hese “fairytale creatures” of the Astral worlds, some of t he most well-known ones being: Salamanders: beings of t he pure element of Fire. Sylphs: beings of the pure element of Air. Undines: also known as mermaids, beings of the pure element of Water. Gnomes: beings of the pure element of Earth. In addition, other beings instantl y recognisable to most people include fairies, often al so known as faeries or fay folk, satyrs, wood nymphs, water sprites and numerous other such delig htful beings. All of these creatures have their own place in the grand Universal scheme of things, often being involv ed with aspects of nature in the physical world. Although usually invisible to the fi ve physical earthly senses, those with Astral or clairvoyant vision c an often see these beings at will. People who live withi n the Astral worlds or travel to the Astral world"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 252 by Astral Projection, which will be discussed in depth later in this book, can easily see, and interact wit h these delightful Astral beings of the elements. Fairy stories originally came about because thr oughout the ages people with no natural psychic ability to perceive the in ner realms of life have experienced a spontaneous “vision”, where the psychic senses which are latent in most people have suddenly and temporarily become activated. Th is can happen much more easily and more often than most people might believe. If a person is “mesmerised” by a scene, it might for example be a scene in a forest clearing, a beauti ful meadow, a view by the sea, a mountain vista or a sparkling lake, it becomes possible to see these wonderful Astral creatures. This happens when the physical senses including vision become “paralysed” by the scene while focussing intently on the scene, causing an altered state of Consciousness often known as a “trance” condition, characterised by a slowing down of brainwave frequencies. When this situation occurs a person can then “see” beyond the “v eil” separating the material world from the Astral worlds and into the realms inhabited by these “fairytale creatures”. For example, a person standing on t he deck of a cruise liner might be staring intently out to sea at the seemingly endless expanse of shimmering water, and then all of a sudden see a mermaid. This person might well later doubt what they saw, and would most probably be afraid to tell other people about the ex perience, but there is no doubting at all what t hey actually saw, albeit only transiently, was a very real mermaid going about its usual activities in the Astral worlds but close to water in the physical world with which they are associated th rough the element of Water. Undines, or mermaids, are ther efore beings of the Universal element of Water and therefore tend to be “seen” in the regions of the earthly counterpart in accor dance with the Universal Law of Correspondence. The same might happen in a woodland setting, where fairies or faeries or fay fo lk as they are known from more"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 253 ancient sources can be seen flitti ng around a winding stream. In a forest wood nymphs might be seen, or even a unicorn standing in a clearing. Around hillsides and other such “earthy” areas gnomes might be seen going about their busy lives. Although all of this might seem lik e something from one of the great fairy story books with which we are all familiar as children, these stories have a very real origin indeed, the result s of people from cultures all over the world over the millennia actually seeing these beings for themselves, writing ab out them, eventually becoming the fairy tales so fondly told today to the great delight of children everywhere. These creatures abound in folklore all over the world, and what is known to some people as a “fairy ”, “mermaid” or a “gnome” in one part of the world is known by a completely different name elsewhere. Nevertheless, these cr eatures most certainly do exist and have been very widely “seen” throughout the ages, with stories told and folklore written as a direct result. As with all Astral beings these are “Etheric” creatures which, like everything else in the As tral worlds, have no ma terial or solid form and are therefore “seen” in a ccordance with the psychic perceptions of the observer. Thes e beings can take on any size and shape they desire at any time. Over the ages people have formed very detailed perceptions as to what these fairy tale beings look like, probably based on the firs t written accounts and the many sightings related by word of m outh. Undines, or mermaids, will therefore be seen as human type beings with fins and flippers instead of legs. Fairie s will be seen as small, human type creatures with small wings with which they f lit around and hover over flowers, water and other features in nature. Gnomes are usually seen as small men and women busily going about their work, sometimes carrying a lantern or other worki ng implements, wearing a tall cap on the head. Male gnomes will o ften be perceived with a long beard, and wearing the familiar tunic as pictured in fairy tales. Much more could be said about the existence and work of these"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 254 wonderful Astral beings, but suffice it to say they are very real indeed and have their ow n position in the gr and Universal scheme. Children, often until the age of five years old or so are still very tuned into the Astral and Spirit worlds and also have a much higher degree of natural clairvoy ant and psychic abilit y than older children and adults. From the moment of bi rth children are indoctrinated constantly by parents, relatives a nd others to make full use of their five physical senses, and are oft en discouraged from playing with “imaginary friends”. The fact of th e matter is, these friends far from being “imaginary” are very real i ndeed to the children who really can “see” and interact with them; another reason why children enjoy hearing “fairy tales” about their little friends so much. It is indeed a great pity that ch ildren having been in doctrinated from an early age to use the five physical senses to the exclusion of their inner senses are often told to stop “imagining things”, and eventually lose contact with the greater reality of the Astral worlds and of all the wonderful beings resi ding there. In this new era we can at least hope children will be encouraged from the earliest possible age to continue to use their inner senses in addition to the lower earthly physical senses as was always the case in bygone times, thereby always maintaini ng connections with the inner realms of reality and the bei ngs existing there at will. "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 255 Chapter 47: The Mental Planes As with the Astral pl anes and the physical world of matter, the Mental planes, also known as the Spiritual planes, first came into being when the four elements Fire , Air, Water and Earth descended from The Source, The First Cause, from God. Like the Astral and physical planes, the Mental planes are therefore also density degrees of the Akasha, the Et her, the Quintessence of the elements. These planes includ e the highest and most exalted realms of Spirit, the Cele stial and Cosmic planes. The Mental planes are the hom e of human beings who, having satiated their material desires of the Astral worlds have subsequently transitioned to the level of the Mental realms equivalent to the vibrations and dens ity of their Mental, Spirit body. The Mental realms are the true Spirit worlds, places of Light, restfulness and bliss, the ideal rest ing place for the immortal Spirit after physical and Astral lives, until the time arrives to move onwards once again in the ascent back to God. Just as in the Astral worlds, everyone residing within t he Mental worlds are on exactly the same level of Spiritual development. In addition to human beings, the M ental worlds are inhabited by thought forms, also beings known as “elementals”. Elementals are very similar to the elementaries of the Astral planes, and similarly are brought into being by the process of intensive, concentrated and often repetitive thinking. It is through this process of intensive thinking that the elemental receiv es a degree of intelligence from the psyche of the person who created it, and with it an instinct for self-preservation. The main difference between a thought form and an elemental is that a thought form usually has one or more ideas as its basis, whereas the elemental is usually the result of a single intensive repetitive thought. Elementals along with the Spir its of human beings and other advanced beings and intelligences of the Universe are the main"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 256 residents of the Spirit worlds, the Mental planes. As in the Astral worlds, within the Mental worlds, being the spheres of thoughts and ideas, everyone will see their own thoughts together with the unique characteristics of those t houghts, manifest and take shape instantly. Over the ages considerable in formation has been gathered about the nature of the Spirit worlds, much of which has been channelled from Spirits residing within various inner spheres of life. One of the most extraordinary examples of th is occurred in t he 1930’s when a large amount of very detailed information was received from Arthur Conan-Doyle shortly after his own passing to the Spirit worlds. Arthur Conan Doyle channelled the c ontents of entire books directly from the Spirit worlds through t he mediumship of Grace Cook of White Eagle Lodge. One of these books, still available today is entitled “Arthur Conan Doyle’ s Book of the Beyond”. The full account of how this re markable situation came about is also detailed in the book, but suffice it to say his main mission was to inform mankind of the glories of life awaiting in the Spirit worlds, and in particular the Mental and Celestial planes existing beyond the Astral realms. Arthur Conan Doyle also details what happened to him immediately afte r his own physical “death” , his arrival in the Astral worlds and the efforts required to transcend the density of Astral worlds in order to reach the worlds of Spirit. On 18 November 1931, Arthur Conan Doyle conducte d one of his quite lengthy channelled sessions during which he relayed to the attended sitters detailed inform ation about t he glories and splendours of the Spirit worlds in which he now lives. His opening statement was as follows: “ I find myself in an unspeakably beautiful heaven-world at this time. I desire above all to bring this rea lity home to my friends”. “The true conception of life in the Spirit worlds has yet to dawn on man”. On 6 January, 1932, Arthur Conan Do yle also had this to say: "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 257 “Neither pen nor brush can paint the beauties of t he heaven-world. Man glimpses but faintly the wonder s of the Spirit ual life, and but few there are who, by inspiration and act ual contact with high Spiritual spheres, catch fleeting visions of the glory of these lands”. Arthur Conan Doyle pr ovided many more vivid insights into the world of Spirit, the Mental planes through which each every one will travel on the ascent back to our Creator. The words of Arthur Conan Doyle are ec hoed and reiterated by numerous other channelled sources, a ll of whom talk of the glory, light, peace, bliss and harmony of these Spirit worlds.   "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 258 Chapter 48: The Celestial and Cosmic Planes The Celestial and Cosmic planes include the most exalted spheres of life, the highest levels of the Mental planes, the Spirit worlds, inhabited by the most advanced human and other beings who have transcended all of the levels of th e Astral and lower Mental Planes. The beings residing at these levels include the, as yet very few human beings who have achieved this level of evolution, and also include other wonderful being s who have never been human. Once a human reaches this leve l of evolution along the sacred path, the need for reincarnation as a matter of necessity is left well and truly behind. Although there are many different names for these levels of life depending on the many cultures and traditions describing them, we will refer to them as they are often known; the “Celestial” and “Cosmic” planes, t he Cosmic planes being the very highest of all before The Source, our Divine Creator God to Whom we are all returning. It is a difficult matter indeed to de scribe the greatness of the exalted Beings residing in these worl ds. We are advised however their powers are far beyond the comp rehension of human beings still existing at the Earthly level of development. It is also said these levels of life are the abode of Beings who are as high above mankind is today as mankind is in tu rn to the very lowest levels of animal life on Earth and even of miner als. To the exalted Beings of these high Spiritual planes, mankind might often appear to be hardly even capable of any thought processes, the great Minds of these advanced beings transcending human beings by degrees totally incomprehensible to earthly man. Again it should be stressed however t hat this is also the very same destiny for each and every hum an being. One day everyone will reach these levels of greatness and go on to journey to still inner levels. Such is the destiny of all mankind and the very reason each and every person should know and fully understand these vitally important realities so fundamental to the true meaning of life. Every"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 259 single day is yet another opportunity to make valuable individual progress on the path, and most importantly to also assist with the progress of others; no such opport unity should ever be passed by. The seven minor planes of th e Great Spiritual Planes include Beings referred to as Angels , Archangels and demi-Gods. On the lower Spiritual Planes dwell Bei ngs recognised as Masters and Adepts. Above them exist the Great Angelic Hierarchy. Above them still are Beings so high in the scale of Universal life they might in all sincerity be called “Gods”. Such exalted Beings are far beyond the comprehension of hum an Minds, and “Divine” is a word most certainly applicable to them. Again, everyone should know it is also the destiny of all mankind to ultimately aspire to these levels of greatness over the course of aeons of time. The Beings dwelling at these levels, and in particular within the Celestial levels of life, take a great interest in the evolution of mankind, while the Bei ngs of the Cosmic levels involve themselves in the affairs of the entire infinite Universe with it’s countless galaxies, suns, planets, planes and realms, the inner Beings always helping lower in the great onwards ascent on the return to our suprem e Creator, to God. These Beings have from time to time intervened in the history of Earth affairs, leading to numerous legends, beliefs and traditions. Many ancient cultures have described “Gods” descending from the “heavens” bringing great know ledge, wisdom and teachings, and yet even the very highest of these Be ings are still but individuations of, and held within in the infinite Mind of The Source , of God, our Prime Creator, but who have of their own freewill elected not to enter into a state of Unity with G od in order to help humans and all other beings in the Universe in the continuing upward ascent through the great planes of life. Little more need be said about t he Mental planes including the Celestial and Cosmic realms, the highest planes of life. Most people will during the course of the great ascent back to our"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 260 Creator revisit the physical worl d numerous times, living a new physical life in order to realise the opportunities of learning the valuable lessons required in order to learn, progress and evolve back to God. After each physical life after passi ng on from Earth each and every person will be once again reunited wit h the Astral worlds, but will sooner or later progress onto the Spir it worlds of the great Mental planes. Eventually, after the appropr iate degree of perfection has been achieved, the immortal Spirit will move onwards and upwards through the great Celestial planes where finally freed from the cycle of reincarnation will continue t he ascent through these “Heaven worlds”, the splendours and glorie s, the love, light, beauty, bliss and harmony of which we are advise d by the Beings of the these inner spheres of life and realit y are beyond the comprehension of most people until, sooner or later the level is transcended.   "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 261 Chapter 49: The Angelic Hierarchy Having discussed mankind and the lo wer forms of life of the Astral and Mental planes we should now take a look at these most Divine Beings of the inner realms, the Angelic Beings. Almost everyone will have heard of Angels, often depicted with wings and known by such names as Raphael, Michael, Gabriel and Auriel. “El” quite literally means “of the Divine” as for example in “Elohim”, and Divine these Angelic beings surely are. Almost all cultures and religions of the world recognise the Angelic hierarchy to some extent. The Angelic hierarchies dwell in t he highest realms of Universal life, never having incarnated into human form in the physical world, having evolved along a completely different evolutionary path to human beings. Although these Beings are often referred to as “Angels”, this is another human per ception, Angels being in fact very powerful Spiritual intelligences that are not actually human like in appearance, this being yet an other human construct based upon the way human senses perceive the high Energy of these Beings. Angels are often associated with the astrological symbolism of the planetary spheres. This is yet another human construct, a symbolic representation of the levels of Energy density and vibration in the Universe. It should also be me ntioned however that there are no Energy “levels” as such, the entir e Universe being a continuum of Energy originating at The Sour ce, The First Cause, God, and extending out to the physi cal world of matter. It should be mentioned however that both Angel s and humans, like all forms of life and in fact everyt hing else in creation are still all equal aspects of The Source Energy , our Divine Creator, of God. Just as every new human Soul in carnating on Earth for the very first time is brought into being as an individuated Spirit when the Divine spark of Spirit is sent forth from the Logos to descend into the form of a new human being, so too did all Angel life in the"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 262 beginning, all sharing the same kins hip of Spirit bet ween all life and of our Creator. Angels, althou gh never having incarnated into matter and occupying a inner place in the great planes of life, are still very much involved with t he well-being and progress of all mankind. Angels have followed a different but nevertheless parallel line of evolution to human beings and i ndeed all other such life in the multi-dimensional Universe. Although only dwelling in the Celestial spheres and beyond, Angels can and frequently do descend to the lower spheres of life whenever the need arises in order to carry out specific missions within the Mental or Astral worlds, and even indeed within the physical world of matter. Angels are not usually however able to draw very close to any person in the physical world unless the person has absolute cont rol over all emotions, ego, and all other aspects of character. The Angelic hierarchy have an ex tremely important role in the evolution of the Univer sal grand scheme of thi ngs, not the least of which is in assisting the progress of all hu mans, not only on Earth but on planets all over the Universe . It is the ultimate destiny of every single human being to evolve to such levels of greatness as to be considered “God-people”, wo rking alongside the Angelic hierarchy in assisting life evolving on other planets, just as other such highly evolved beings including Angels are constantly, but often subtly assisting with the ongoi ng evolution of mankind and life on Earth. As with all beings of the spheres inner than the physical Universe, Angels have no fixed form or app earance and are always “seen” in accordance with the perceptions of the person “seeing” them in the presence of the very powerful leve l of Energy and Consciousness of the Angel. For many centurie s artists have depicted Angels as humanoid type beings, very often with wings, glowing radiantly from head to foot, wearing long robe s and sometimes holding various artefacts. One person for ex ample might see an Angel as possessing wings and another might see the same Angel adorned"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 263 in a white robe surrounded by radiant white light without any wings at all. Regardless of how Angels are perceived by means of the inner senses however there can be absolutely no mistaking the sheer magnitude of the strength of presence and high level of Consciousness of these beings, radiating power, Love and Light. Angels have no fixed formal hier archies or names, all being an integral and equal aspect of the Universal scheme of things. Any level at which an Angelic Being ex ists will be on exactly the same basis as the level at which any other being exist, and that is in accordance with the level of vibrat ion of Energy of the Spiritual body relative to The Source. Over the centuries however Angels have been given names and formal hierarchies by human beings simply for the purposes of convenience and better understanding. Man has therefore over the years chosen to define several “l evels” or “degrees” of Angels organised in accordance with their perceived responsibilities in the grand scheme of things. These or ganisations of Angels are variously described as the “Angelic Hierarchy”, “Angelic Hosts” and very often even “Choirs of Angels ”. The term “Choirs of Angels” very often brings to the Mind of people the traditional concept of a choir, where Angels are perceived to be holding song books, standing in rank and singing to sounds of heavenly music. There are various ways in which t he Angelic hierarchies have been described over the years by vari ous traditions, which being human constructs are neither right or wrong. A typical human defined Angelic hierarchy might for ex ample be structured as follows: The Seraphim: These are considered to be the very highest members of the Angelic hierarchy, existing very closest to God. These Beings are considered to be responsible for the radiation of Unconditional love and positive Spirit, and are also associated with Divine holy knowledge and wisdom. This hierarchy is perceived to in clude Micheal, Seraphiel, Jehoel, Metatron, Kemuel, Auriel and Nat haniel. The popular perception of"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 264 the appearance of these Angels is of beings with six wings, two of which would be used for “flying”, a completely erroneous concept in the inner spheres, and the other four for the veiling of their faces for reverence. These Angels are al so often depicted standing on winged heels. Metatron is often considered to be one of the very greatest of the Angelic hierarchy, an Angel who is particularly close to God, a messenger Angel who is also considered to be a Divine link between God and humanity. The Cherubim: These are considered to be the Angels or Spirits of harmony, and are often known as the “Spirits of the air”; they are also perceived to represent Divine wisdom. This Angelic hierarchy includes Gabriel, Cherubiel, Ophaniel, Raphael and Zophel who from around the 16 th century were often depicted as chubby looking children, “cherubs” with wings and winged heels. Before the 16 th century they were often perceived as Beings with the head of a child, and the body of a bird. The Thrones: This hierarchy incl udes the Angels of Justice, the Spirits of “will” who li ve in the essence of the symbolic astrological sphere known as Saturn. This has nothing directly to do with the physical planet of Saturn but is merely analogous to it. The Thrones supervise judgement for individual karma and for humanity as a whole and are also depicted as the record keepers of the sacred Universal laws repr esenting the “will” necessary to administer Divine justice in the Universe. The Thrones, which include the Angelic names Orifie, Raziel, Zaphkiel, Japhkiel and Baradiel ar e often perceived with scales of justice and a bouquet of flowers, standing on red winged heels and seated upon lofty golden thrones. The Dominions: These are also per ceived as Spirits of wisdom and knowledge and also bring teachings by intuition. They reside in the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 265 analogous sphere of Jupiter and r epresent the superior power of wisdom against physical strength and egotistical forces. This hierarchy includes Zadkil, Muriel, Hashman and Zacharel and are perceived as having human s hape and wearing a triple crown to signify their position over ph ysical form. They can also be perceived to be carrying a scept re and holding a cross and/or sword to symbolise the balance bet ween the Universal active and passive forces. The Virtues: This hierarchy are responsible for freedom of choice and dwell in the essence of the analogous planet ary sphere of Mars. These Angels watch over the centres of freewill and provide the tools needed along the sacred path back to God in order to make choices, learn Spiritual lessons, and to overcome karmic debt. This Angelic hierarchy works with the thrones to bestow grace and rewards on those who have overcome trials in their physical lives and include Uzziel, Gabriel, Michae l, Peliel, Haniel, Babiel and Tarhishiel. The Virtues are often perceived as having four blue, feathered wings and sparkling armour. They are also often perceived as carrying a sceptre, axe, spear, sw ord and shield for protection. These instruments are symbolic of t he need to move forward in life with Unconditional love, even in the face of fear or battle. The Principalities : This hierarchy dwells in the essence of the analogous sphere of Venus and are responsible for the protection of people regarded as im portant on Earth. This hierarchy includes Auriel, Raphael, Raguel, Micheal, Gabriel and Remiel. These Angels are perceived to have human form and clad in armour. They are also s een to be carrying a sceptre, lily flowers, palm leaves and a cross. "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 266 The Archangels: These are the ru ling Angels, Spirits of Fire inhabiting the planetary essence analogous to Mercury. These Angels are directly associated with God, standing in readiness to carry out Divine decrees for humans. This hierarchy consists of Michael, Raphael, Raguel, Auriel, Sariel, Remiel and Gabriel. Since the 14 th century Archangels have been seen to be clad in white linen, and sometimes perceived as carrying feathered pens and scrolls. The Angels: These are the messenger Angels who also govern the nature Spirits. They dw ell in the essence of the astrological Moon sphere and are seen as the guar dians over all of humanity. These Angels involve themselves with the everyday life of the planet Earth and are a direct gate way for information, knowledge and communications between mankind and The Source, The Prime Creator, God. There are literally billions of Angels and who are often perceived to have a human type body with wi ngs, clothed according to the Earthly country, tradition or cultur e with which they are associated. In conclusion, all Angels are Div ine Spiritual beings of Light who work very closely within the Energy of God, dwelling in the inner realms of life having followed an al ternative evolutionary course to human beings, and who are instantly recognisable by their very high and powerful levels of Energy and vibration, existing at levels of the Universe with a correspondi ng high vibration. Those Angels closest to The Source, The Prime Creator, God existing at the very highest and most powerful levels of Energy and vibration of all. All Angels work both for the good of all humanity and indeed for the good of the entire Universe, includ ing all life on all planets. Although mankind over the centuries has traditionally felt the need to place Angels into convenient hierarchies and give them names in accordance with their perceived tasks and status, in reality they all"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 267 work in unison for the ultimate g ood of humanity on all planets of the multi-dimensional Universe. The names and hierarchy of the Ange lic hosts are entirely notional, and simply a human originated wa y of depicting these Divine beings. Different cultures and traditi ons will have different ways of naming and depicting Angelic beings d epending on their own perceptions. The above described hi erarchy is therefore fairly typical of the perception of the Angelic hierarchy across various cultures on Earth, and should not be taken as definitive in any way. It should also once again be noted that the symbolic planetary spheres of Mars, Venus, Mercury and the others are directly equivalent and analogous to the various planes of life beyond the physical Universe. They are theref ore also equivalent for example to the Tree of Life of the Kab balah, and also of the planes of correspondence of the ancient knowledge and wisdom of the West, all ultimately being levels of vibration, Energy and density. At the final analysis, the nature of the multi-dimensional continuum of Energy and vibration that is the Universe is agreed across all cultures and traditions of the worl d since time imme morial, only the names and perceptions varying in accordance with the many and varied races, customs and traditions of the world, with Angels, like all beings existing at the level of the Energy continuum of the Universe that most precisely matches their own unique Energy. "},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 268 Chapter 50: Holy Guardian Angel Everyone enjoys the invisible com pany of a Holy Guardian Angel who remains with us from the mom ent of our very first physical incarnation on Earth, constantly watching over and guiding us during our progress through many physical lives on Earth and beyond. Holy Guardian Angels are members of the Angelic race of Divine beings who are still evolving just as every member of the human race is still evolving, but on an alternative evolutionary path to human beings. Of course all paths ul timately lead to our Divine Creator, The Source, God. Like our Higher-Self, our own Holy Guardian Angel will communicate with us at a very s ubtle level, often by means of impressions, intuition or the “voi ce within”. Such communication can be in the form of perceiv ed warnings, advice, and such knowledge from the inner spheres as we might require to progress at any stage of our life on Earth, or onwards through the inner spheres of life. Should we stray from the sacred path, our own Holy Guardian Angel may endeavour to warn us by the most subtle but effective means, but cannot directly intervene or interfere with our own freewill. Our Holy Guardian Angel has access to the inner levels of reality and therefore knows and understands everything about us including past, present and future lives, and all factors influencing those lives including those influencing our progress along the sacred path back to God. Those who listen for and are receptive to the promptings of their own Holy Guardian Angel will always take heed of such guidance because like the Higher-Self will always have our own Divine progress to heart. Like our own Higher-Self our Holy Guardian Angel should always be approached and respected in to tal Love and total faith, and"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 269 always in the certain knowing our Holy Guardian Angel is always with us and always will be; we nev er journey along the path alone.   "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 270 Chapter 51: Spirit Guides Spirit Guides represent a very wide range of Spiritual beings ranging from discarnate human be ings who have previously incarnated on Earth, oft en many times, through to beings who have never before physically incarnat ed, or indeed might and often do originate from a completely di fferent planet in the Universe. Planetary origin is of no real importance in the inner spheres; all life is ultimately Spirit and an equal aspect of God. The concept of “appearance” and “speech” is also completely meaningless beyond the physical wo rld of matter. Spirit guides originating from other planets are very oft en much more advanced in many ways than Sp irit guides originat ing from Earth who’s knowledge is very often no more advanced than the human they are guiding. This is due to the fact that human beings living in the Astral worlds having previously li ved on Earth are still very similar indeed in most respects, including levels of true knowledge and wisdom to those still liv ing on Earth, the main difference being that they are discarnate, not inha biting a physical body, and reside within the Astral worlds rat her than the physical world. Some people believe everyone is allo cated a Spirit gu ide from birth, others believe that in or der to enlist the services of a Spirit guide a specific request needs to be made. Such requests can be made while meditating from a deeper, ex panded state of Consciousness, or when the Mind is completely quiet and focussed. Just before drifting off to sleep or just after waking in the morn ing before arising can be very good times for communi cation with Souls and Spirits of the inner realms, due to the receptive state of Consciousness existing at these times. Genuine Spirit guides have chosen of their own freewill to assist a person during the course of a ph ysical life, and often even later after the person they are guiding has made the transition to the Astral worlds after the passing of physical death. During the course of a lifetime a person might well even enjoy the services of a range"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 271 of different Spirit Guides acco rding to life circumstances and ongoing progress along the path. Spir it Guides also very often specialise in a specific type of assistance, and when a person no longer requires that particular type of assistance, often due to ongoing advancement, the guide might leave and be replaced by a more appropriate guide requir ed for the further advancement. It is also quite possible to reques t a Spirit guide to leave and to request a replacement at ones discretion as life circumstances decree. A Spirit guide can never interfere with the freewill of the person they are guiding, and ther efore the wishes of the person must always be completely respected. Before proceeding further, a word of caution; there are numerous Spirits in the Astral worlds, in particular those existing within the lower, darkest, Astral worlds who are extremely anxious to establish direct communications wit h human beings still living in the physical world, often for their ow n dubious, often dark purposes. These are the type of Sp irits often contacted by means of the Ouija board for example. These Spirits will claim to be anything or anyone you would like them to be in order to gain your confidence. Some even make the most outrageous claims to be such Divine beings as Archangels or even God. Unfortunately, Spirits dwelling in the lowest levels of the Astral worlds very often mean no good, sometimes even having the intention to eventually control or even possess a human being for their own purposes. There are of course m any genuine Spirit gui des dwelling within the inner levels of the Astral worlds who really are only concerned with the genuine well-be ing Spiritual pr ogress of the person they are guiding, such guides often dwellin g in the mid to inner Astral worlds. Unfortunately it is not always an easy matter to determine which Spirits are genui ne in their intentions and which are not. Should you make contact with a pot ential Spirit guide in meditation, in dreams or by pro-actively seek ing or requesting a Spirit guide, you should always follow your inne r-guidance and the voice of your Higher-Self who will know the true nat ure of the Spirit you are in"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 272 contact with. If your inner voice or intuition says “l eave well alone” then you would be well advised do ju st that without question; never be so tempted by the thought of enj oying your own Spirit guide that you allow such temptation to over-rule your inner guidance which always speaks in your very best inte rests. If you do accept a Spirit guide, be sure to develop a relationship over a long period of time in order to establish mutual tr ust. If the Spirit guide tries to encourage you to do any thing, particularly against your own freewill, then immediately cease all communications with that particular Spirit immediately and permanently. Genuine Spirit guides will never, ev er compel you to do anything, especially against your own freewi ll; they are there to help you according to your needs and evolution, always respecting freewill and only assisting or answering questi ons if specifically asked to do so. If you have any doubts whatsoever for the need of the assistance of Spirit guide, then do not seek o ne at all; your intuition, Higher-Self and Holy Guardian Angels are your very best guides, and above all can and should be completely trusted at all times. The main mission of a Spirit Guide, as the name suggests, is to literally guide people through life by offering and providing such assistance as Universal laws allow, should the need arise or requested to do so, and providing always such assistance does not compromise the freewill of the person. This assistance will, in addition to progress along the path, include help in resolving life problems, providing advice, answe ring specific questions, specific help with healing, communication with deceased relatives and much more. Again however, a Spirit Guide can only assist if such help is proactively requested either consciously or subconsciously, in order to avoid influencing t he freewill of the human they are guiding. It is quite possible to communicate intentionally and directly with Spirit Guides although this usually takes quite some practice, such communication being by telepathy . For those who have not yet established direct conscious cont act with their Spirit Guide,"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 273 assistance from the guide can arri ve in many and varied forms, including but not limited to “voices” appearing in thoughts, impressions, intuition, within dr eams and by way of synchronistic events; events which might seem like a pure coincidence at the time, but which actually have a meaning. People who practice meditation might often find them selves communicating with their Spirit guide sooner or later, and once such communication has been established will usually be ongoing. Synchronicity is a particular co mmon way for a Spirit Guide to assist and to make their presence fel t. If they really want to make a point, they will create a synchronicity in a person’s life, immediately causing the person to take notice. Synchronicities in general are experiences created by the Soul or Higher-Self in order to bring greater awareness. A person either alone or with the assistance of their Spirit Guide creates the synchronistic event in a inner realm through the mediation of the Soul , subsequently manifesting into the physical world. If for example you happen to be walking along one day and meet someone apparently by accident, it is usually because your Soul and the Soul of the person you have just met have made the decision in the inner realms to meet each other. There is absolutely no such thing in the Universe as “chance”; the laws of Cause and Effect being ev er present within the lives of everyone. As we will see later in this book, everyone without exception leaves their physical body at night during deep sleep to travel to the Astral worlds. Sometimes these travels only extend as far as the lower Astral worlds corresponding to the areas of the personal psyche, or slightly inner to the level of the group human unconscious; these travels are often remembered later as nonsensical dreams. Sometimes however the Soul during deep sleep travels to the level of the Astral worlds to which they will transition a fter physical death. There the Soul will le arn valuable lessons required for physical life, meet deceased relatives, loved ones and friends and travel the infinite Astral realms in order to gain further valu able experience. Often there are specific tasks or m eetings to attend to during these"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 274 visits. It is a task of the Spirit Guide to guide a person during these nightly visits and to generally provide advice and assistance. Most people will not recall these Astral visits or might often simply dismiss them as elaborate or vi vid dreams. Be absolutely assured however that everyone does ind eed leave their body during deep sleep in order to travel and carry out missions within the Astral realms, often in the presence of, and with the guidance of Spirit guides.   "},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 275 Chapter 52: Communication with Inner Spheres As mankind has accelerated its descent into materialism and away from The Sources of Universal reality and knowledge, bands of Spirits in the inner spheres have increasingly endeavoured to make contact with people on Earth in an attempt to turn mankind back towards the Light, it’s true pur pose and destiny. These bands of Spirits in turn work with inner Spir its and they in turn inner Spirits still, and so it is through ever in wards spheres of life, the inner always assisting the outer, the fa te of mankind and beings of all planet in the Universe always being a Universal concern. The inner Spirits know that if it could be conclusively proven and demonstrated to mankind bey ond all doubt the trut h of survival after physical death and of the nature and truths of the inner realities, the present course of the humanity could be tur ned back from the brink of where it is currently heading . The main focus of the inner spheres therefore, especially over the last two hund red years or so until more recent years has been to encourage contact with the Spirits of the inner spheres through people usually known as “mediums” who are receptive to such contact, through which they are able to establish and mainta in a two-way communication between the Spiritual and physical worlds. In more recent years the term “medium” has been replaced with “channel”, and the act of a medium communicating with inner spheres is usually known as “channelling”. There are many and varied types and degrees of channe lling, ranging from transient psychic contact from a fully awake state through to trance channelling, materialisation and the direct voice. "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 276 Chapter 53: Psychics A search on the Internet today will reveal numerous so called “psychic services”, frequently being offered by means of “premium rate” telephone services charging se veral dollars per minute. These services are offered in various forms, including but not limited to psychic readings, rune readings and tarot card readings. There are certainly genuinely gift ed psychics offering their services today, but unfortunately there are also many indiscriminate people claiming to be genuine psychics who seem to do nothing more than play on the emotions, desperation and vulnerability of people, with the sole purpose of obtaining thei r money; such so called psychics are nothing more than complete charlatans. Genuine psychics of the sort pe ople might have heard about prior to the increasing popularity of the Internet can provide a genuinely useful service that can be of gr eat service, help and comfort to many people, always providing of course people receiving such a service fully understand the meanings and limitations of such a “psychic reading”. Psychic readings are not a definitive telling of the future or of a specific direction in life, and an y psychic claiming the contrary should be completely avoided. G enuine psychics can only suggest probabilities based upon their own interpreta tion of the psychic Energy associated with the person re ceiving the psychic reading; it is then for the recipient of the p sychic service to proactively alter the course of their own life in the direction of the future probable outcome in order to be more “in tune” with the Ener gy, vibration and therefore probability of than outco me, an outcome which of course is still by no means guaranteed. As we will also discuss later in this book, everyone creates their own reality, and it is therefore for each and every person to understand this extremely important fact and to proceed in life and on the sacred path accordingly, wh ile not relying on the word of"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 277 others. Again, while certainly not discouraging people from seeking the services of a psychic, anyone doing so should be strongly advised to first of all to determi ne the absolute honesty, integrity and level of abilities of any psychic before proceeding with any psychic reading session, and in par ticular before parting with any money. A bad or fraudulent psychic reading can very easily leave a person in a much worse state t han before the reading took place. We will discuss in a later section of this book how each and every person can assume full control of their own reality without the need for the services of a psychic or a medium. This is not accomplished by the need for a psychic telling of what the possible future is, but rather by proactively deciding what your own future should be, and subsequently consciously creating that future for yourself by means of your own freewill. Always remember, there is absolutely nothing that we cannot be, do or have, and no psychic reading will ever alter that absolute fact, a truth due to the perfect workings of the Universe, The Source, of God.  "},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 278 Chapter 54: Psychic Mediums The most basic form of channelling is that used by “psychics” who “hear” the voices of Spirits “i n their head”. These include the “television psychics” or “psychi c mediums” as they often call themselves. This type of psychic will often work with a large group of people, or sometimes on a priv ate one to one basis, or often at longer distance by means of telephone, or indeed these days even by email or Internet messenger service. Unfortunately, as with other types of psychic service, there are many charlatans who operate quite simply and very cynically to take money from vulnerable, o ften bereaved people who are often suffering considerable grief through the recent loss of a loved one. It is often very difficult indeed for the average person to differentiate between a good and genuine psychic medium and a charlatan. It should be said however that any genuine psychic medium should be prepared to do one to one personal “sittings”, and should, as with any genuine psychic, be able to provide a list of testimonials from satisfied clients. There are unfortunately many charlatans ar ound, especially with the rapid rise in the Internet where thousands of such opportunists are offering their services to people, people who are often experiencing serious difficulties in lif e or in many cases are recently bereaved. Such people are therefore extremely vulnerable due to the desire to receive word from their loved ones and to know they are happy in their new home within t he inner worlds of the Astral planes, often thought of as “ heaven” or the “afterlife”. Again, always, always investig ate psychics extremely thoroughly before engaging their services, and always, always obtain and verify as many testimonials as possible before proceeding. The importance of these precautions simply cannot be emphasised enough, the consequences of failing to do so can be very adverse. The next chapter in this book will provide you with excellent guidelines about psychics and loca ting genuine psychic services."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 279 Always listen to your inner guidan ce and never, ever agree to the services of a psychic of any kind if your inner-voice, your Higher- Self, advises you against it.

"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 280 Chapter 55: Genuine Psychic Services In previous chapters we have di scussed in no uncertain terms of the limitations of psyc hics, and above all the serious and very real dangers involved in utilizing the services of “premium rate psychics” of the sort that seem to proliferate on the Internet today, no doubt attracted by the profits such calls generate, calls that are often charged by the minute. Again, it has to be stressed that due to the large profits available to people calling themselves “psychics”, and who often refer to themselves by glamorous or my stical sounding names intended to impress the potentia l client, that very considerable care should be taken before even considering utilizi ng the services of such people. It is important to note that some of these people offering psychic services by means of premium rate telephone services and the Internet are indeed genuine. Other “psychics” believe themselves that they offer a high level of psychic abilities when in fact they do not. Again however, and this simply cannot be stressed enough, it is extremely important to be totall y certain that anyone claiming to be a psychic does indeed have genuine, high level psychic abilities, otherwise the person receiving the reading will not only have wasted money, but much worse could be adversely psychologically affected. So how does a genuine psychic offer their services? First of all we should recognize that every single human being as well as many animals have psychic powers available to us. With most people however these abilities ar e below the surface of the Mind in a latent state and have therefore never been fully exercised. Genuine psychics are very often born with p sychic abilities to some extent, and then, with that realisation, fu rther develop their psychic abilities over the course of many years, and usually with the benefit of some high level training by other experienced psych ics. Some psychics are fortunate enough to have natural hi gh-level abilities from birth, but these are relatively scarce."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 281 Other genuine psychics possess clairvoyant abilities, that is to say they actually “see” images in their “Minds eye”. The “Minds eye” is actually an Etheric Energy centre , one of the seven “chakras” often known as the “third eye”, “brow c entre” or “brow chakra”. We will discuss the chakras and clairvoyance in more detail later in this book. Some genuine psychics are “clairaud ient”, that is to say they actually “hear” answers. There are also genuine psychics who work with the “intuition”, “feelings” or “impressions” they receive in response to the various questions asked. This works in a similar way to remote viewing. Some ps ychics concurrently possess all of these abilities and can use combinations of them for the best possible answers. Other forms of psychic readin g use a method often known as “scrying” or “divination”. These methods use instruments such as Tarot cards, the I Ching, runes, cr ystal balls or even tea leaves in order to view the probable future. A more complex forms of scrying is numerology. As impressive a nd even glamorous as these might sound, such tools are however simp ly that, tools that facilitate a point of focus and ther efore an aid to the psychic reader who is interpreting Energy in the same way as a clairvoyant or indeed any other psychic ability. Some forms of scrying such as the I-Ching and numerology are extremely co mplex and can be extremely accurate, but only when uses by highly experienced practitioners. Another well-known form of scrying is Astrology. By Astrology we do not mean “reading the stars” in the newspaper which is not real Astrology and should not be rega rded as such, and most certainly should not be relied upon in any way. True Astrology does exist and can be very accurate involvin g the compilation of proper astrological charts based on a wide range of factors. As with all types of scrying Astrology is still the interpretation of Universal Energy and its likely influence at any particular temporal Earth time. Like all forms of scrying, psychic abilities, clairvoy ance and other"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 282 abilities there is nothing mystical about it, they all ultimately interpret configurations of Energy. Once again it must be absolutely stressed that no psychic, regardless of any claims to the c ontrary or whatever instruments they use can ever foretell the ab solute future for anyone. Whereas the past, relative to temporal physical Earth time is definitive, dealing with events that have already occurred, the future depends entirely on a range of quantum probabilities, in other words of potential, possible or probable futu re events existing within the inner multi-dimensional realities beyond the confines of the physical world where space and time do not ex ist. At any particular time, as it is measured in physical terms, there can theref ore be any one of an infinite number of possible qu antum outcomes for any particular related situation. Consulting a psychic can cause a person to subconsciously move their life in the direct ion of one of these mu lti-dimensional quantum probabilities, thereby in creasing the chances of that probability becoming a quantum realit y in the physical worl d. As we know, we all constantly create our own rea lities, no one can create a reality for us, so anyone believing strongl y enough in what a psychic tells them can strongly influence there ow n reality in the same direction by holding that desired reality within the Mind as if it were already a fact. This is often completely misinterpreted as an accurate psychic reading, when in fact the recipi ent of the reading has create a reality themselves based upon that reading. That is not necessarily negative, especially if the recipient of the reading has enjoyed benefits as a direct result. Assuming all diligence has be en heeded and a high quality and genuine “reader” has been located and engaged for a psychic “reading”, and also expectations are not unrealistically high, such services can be of tangible benefit by the provision of mental comfort, and also affordi ng the opportunity to pos itively affect future events based upon the range of probable events. "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 283 It must once again be stressed however, regardless of any claims to the contrary, no psychic can predict the absolute future, and certainly no psychic can alter that future. Any psych ic who claims otherwise by for example offering to bring such things as money, love, travel etc. should be co mpletely avoided. Aside from the Universal laws of fr eewill which any genuine psychic reader should understand and fully respect, ultimately only the person receiving the psychic reading can create their own future, their own reality, such are the workings of immu table Universal laws; no other person, psychic or otherwise, can create a reality for another person, and that includes bringing wealth, love, travel or anything else. A psychic reading should theref ore only be used strictly for guidance purposes in order that the person receiving the psychic reading can influence their own “futur e” in terms of physical Earth time. A psychic reading is a very se rious matter indeed and should therefore be approached with the same diligence as with obtaining any other serious product or servic e, in fact much more so because of the likely effect of the r eading on the person receiving the psychic reading whic h can be profound. Also be extremely wary of psyc hics who ask leading questions, seeking information from you they c an use as a basis for extracting further information on a question and answer type basis, or who provide broad, generic type answers of the sort that could easily apply to almost anyone. Such a question and answer session might proceed as follows: Psychic: I sense someone in your life called John. Do you know someone called John? Client: Yes I do. Psychic: Is he a friend or perhaps someone you work with? Client: Well actually he is a cousin"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 284 Psychic: Yes I was feeling that was the case because you are clearly quite close Psychic: I sense a grandparent who has recently passed on. Do you have a grandparent who has recently passed on? Client: Well my grandmother pa ssed on about 5 years ago. Psychic: Yes, the connection is becoming stronger now. It is your grandmother Psychic: I sense that your grandmother would like you to sort out your relationships Client: Relationships with who? Psychic: Your relationships generally, es pecially with other family members And so the session continues with the psychic asking ever more searching questions during which ti me they build an impression of the life and circumstances of the client which is then used as a basis for a convincing psychic readi ng. Such a reading of course is totally fake. Another common ploy used by charla tan psychics is to state that something very important, often some thing the client is longing for will happen by a specific date. Of c ourse, when that event inevitably fails to transpire, the person who received that prediction, who will often be in a very highly stressed st ate by that time , will call back on the premium rate telephone serv ice wanting to know why the event did not happen and when it will happen. In this way the psychic can lock the client into a series of premium rate, very expensive consultations for as long as the client is desperate enough to go along with it. This is just one of many such ploys used"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 285 by Internet and premium rate psychics in order to secure further money from clients by the use of premium rate telephone services. So the question is, if you wish to seek the services of a genuine psychic what should you do? First of all it is not at all unr easonable for a psychic to charge for their services although many of the very best and most genuine psychics actually do not. One charac teristic of a genuine psychic is the desire to be of selfless se rvice to other people without any thought whatsoever of reward. This also applies to genuine healers and other Spiritual people who’s main objective is to be of service to humanity. Those psychics that do charge a nominal amoun t for their services will charge by the “sitti ng” and never by the mi nute. Again, charges will vary but a typical charge should be no more than $50 for a sitting of long enough duration to be of great value to the client. In most cases the charge will be a lot less or often free. It should be pointed out that if a ps ychic does provide their services for free, you should offer a donation for their serv ices any way in just such an amount that you feel is appropriate. Never be taken in by the clothing in which a psychic dresses. Many psychics, in particular when app earing on Web pages are seen to be wearing all manner of mystical looking clothing, often including such things as a head scarf of the sort worn by “fortune tellers”. Genuine psychics never feel the need to impress or mislead in this way, always preferring to dress normally. Again, never be taken in by fan cy sounding names or titles often beginning with the word “psychic” followed by an often false, sometimes glamorous or mystical sounding name. Most really talented and genuine psychics will not even have, or indeed desire a presence on the Internet. They are so well-known"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 286 and respected that people will travel very considerable distances for a sitting, often even to another country. Another indication of a genuine psychic is their temperament and overall personality. Genuine psych ics are very usually very sensitive people, and would never , ever seem to be in a rush, frustrated, or even become annoyed at the questi ons of their client. Never be afraid to challenge a psychic directly on any answer or information received. If their char acter or attitude changes as a result, then terminate the se ssion there and then and do not continue. If you must consult a psychic wi thout recommendation, which again is extremely inadvisable, the first few questions should be addressed at the psychic in order to establish their credibility, experience and abilities. As them the following as a minimum: 1) Where did you receive your formal training as psychic? 2) How many years have you been providing psychic services? 3) In what environment have most of your readings been carried out? 4) Are you prepared to offer 30 minutes without charge in order that I can establish the accuracy of your readings by asking you simple questions? 5) Can you provide the names an d full contact details for at least 10 clients? These are all totally reasonable questions, and ones that should be asked first. Now let us look at the sort of answers you should receive: 1) Even naturally gifted psychics require training from other experienced psychics in orde r to maximize their own"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 287 potential, as well as for the ben efit of the client. This can be a long and ongoing process. If a psychic says they have not received such training then leave them alone. 2) As with all things a psych ic requires time and real experience in order to develop their abilities to a high degree. A minimum length of ex perience should be at least 10 years. 3) Most genuine psychics will be familiar with and utilise traditional psychic “sittings”. Thes e will typically take place in the home of a psychic or sitter, or in another recognised environment such as a Spiritualist church. If any psychic only has experience with Internet, telephone, email or other distance methods, then leave them well alone. First hand psychic sitting experience with the client present is crucial. 4) Any genuine psychic should be prepared to provide 30 minutes of their time free of c harge in order for you to fully satisfy yourself they are genui ne. Despite what any psychic might claim to the contrary, 10 minutes, 15 minutes even 20 minutes is not sufficient time to determine the authenticity of a psychic. 5) Obtaining genuine, reachable an d verifiable references from satisfied client is an absolut e must before accepting any consultation with any psychic. Always obtain at least ten such references and always follow up by contacting each reference personally, and asking them for the basis of their testimonials for the psychic. Only if all of the references prove to be totally authentic, and the answers to the questions you ask are satisfactory, and above all the references appear to be genuine should you proceed with the consultation with the psychic. "},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 288 Once you have found your psychic it is extremely important for you to know how to interact with th e psychic for your maximum benefit while allowing the psychic to be able to function efficiently. Never get involved in chatty sort of conversations with the psychic. If you do this you will provide the p sychic with plenty of information they can use to make the information they provide seem impressive. Always therefore be to tally polite, friendly but above all detached. Never volunteer information. Answer the questions put forward by the psychic as briefly as possibl e without elaborating on them. That isn’t to say that you should withhold information, because the psychic needs to establish and ma intain a link, but rather only provide the exact information requested and no more. If this is a one to one local psychic reading as it should be ideally, observe the body language of the p sychic to see if they seem comfortable with the session. If t hey do no seem comfortable then the psychic connections are probabl y not there, and the sitting will provide no useful purpose. Observ ing body language is also a very good indication as to whether the psychic is genuine. The psychic should appear to be totally relaxed, friendly and above all focussed at all times. Should you decide on a “distanc e sitting” such as telephone, Internet messenger or email, and all of the above advice has been heeded to the extent possible, then here is what you can expect in terms of accuracy. All mediums have to establish a p sychic connection with you at the Energy level of the human Mind in order to provide any sort of reading at all. One to one local sitti ngs are by far the best for this, but the connection can be established during distance sittings, because “distance” is purely a physi cal Earth characteristic that does not exist on the Mind Energy level a true psychic reading"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 289 takes place. Generally speaking, the more interactive a sitting is, the better the connection can be potentially established. Telephone sittings can result in a decent psychic connection. However, especially in the case of the premium rate psychic services the psychic is oft en unprepared for the telephone call and therefore the sitting. The psychic might typically be going about their daily activities when the ph one rings with a client expecting a psychic reading. In these cases an effective psychic reading might be difficult at best. The psychic wil l be more focussed on what they were doing before the phone rang, par ticularly if it was something important to them, and will not be able to focus on making and maintaining the connection with the client. The only telephone readings that can be effective th erefore are thos e that have been mutually arranged beforehand, and w here both the psychic and the client are fully prepared. Never make use of any psychic service that requires simply phoning a premium rate, or indeed any number, and the psychic will be available immediately. Email is another elec tronic medium used for psychic services. Email does not even require the psychic and the client to be actively connected, being a passive medium, so establishing any sort of meaningful connection by email must be regarded as doubtful at best. However, it is quit e possible over a length of time and with many email exchanges fo r psychic to establish a good connection with the client, and to provide a meaningful reading. This will take time however, and will involve multiple email messages. The same rules alwa ys apply however as for all psychic readings, and in particular the need to avoid providing the psychic with any information that can be used to contrive answers. One medium that does have real potential for psychic readings are the electronic “instant messenger” services so popular these days on the Internet. Instant messenger, or messaging services have the benefit of the direct connection between the p sychic and the client. More importantly usually it is ne cessary to plan such a psychic reading session in advanc e so both the psychic and the client are"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 290 prepared. Most importantly of all however messenger services are written or more specifically typed. The physical action of typing, like writing, strongly focu ses thoughts in the Mi nd, and which focus assists considerably in the psychic connection and reading session, for the same reasons as physically writing affirmations or anything else intended to influence inner energies, the subconscious Mind or Higher-Self is very effective. So if a distance consultation is crucial, and all other guidelines as detai led here have been observed, an electronic messenger consultation is a very realistic option. The more advanced, and potentially accurate methods of psychic reading such as Tarot, the I-Chi ng and Numerology should always be in the presence of proven experts in these areas, with many years experience supported by a large number of verifiable references. In conclusion, always completely follo w the guidelines set out in this chapter, and above all always follo w your inner guidance at all times. Your Higher-Self will never, ever, ever let you down and that is a fact that should be kept in Mi nd at all times. If you are unsure about consulting a particular psychic, or indeed any psychic, and in particular if you receive feelings, messages or intuition from within, then under no circumstances proceed against your inner guidance, however desperate you might feel . The consequences of trusting and accepting the words of a charlatan psychic can be very damaging indeed for many reas ons, including psychological, financial and material, and is quite simply not worth the risk however desperate you believe y ou might be for guidance or information. Your very best source of guidance comes from within. The previous chapters of this book detail how to obtain these answers without ever having to rely on a psychic or anyone else. If it is contact with people who have passed on to the As tral worlds you are seeking, again, you have abilities to meet this person or people within the Astral worlds, and to return with i ndisputable, first hand proof of the meeting."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 291 It is never necessary to rely on the wo rd or abilities of others. As an immortal Spiritual being, made in the true Spiritual image of God, there is nothing at all that you cannot be, do or have, or information, advice or guidance that you do no t have direct access to whenever you need it.   "},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 292 Chapter 56: The Ouija Board The Ouija board has long been a popular method of attempting to contact “the other side”, and is probably the only prod uct sold on a large scale for this particular pur pose. The name “Ouija” is derived from the French and German words fo r “yes”; “oiu” and “ja”. The Ouija consists of a flat board upon which is printed the letters of the alphabet, some numbers, punctuation marks and with the words “ yes” and “ no”. . The participants proceed by placing their fingers lightly on a pointer, which then supposedly without the conscious effects of the participants moves to spell out a series of messages. Many users of the Ouij a board often regard this activity quite simply as a novelty for parties and other such gatherings, very often without fully realising the very real potential dangers of which there are many. The Ouija board can and often does work, and indeed many communications received can be from “the other side”. Unfortunately however many of these contacts are with beings residing in the very lowest le vels of the Astral planes who’s intentions are often much less than honourable. As discussed previously, humans and other beings living in the lowest Astral worlds do so bec ause of the dark, negative and sometimes very evil li ves they previously led while on Earth, and accordingly now exist at these corre spondingly low Energy levels of vibration. The danger with this is t hat the lower in the Astral plane the being exists, the easier it is fo r them to make contact with the physical world through the Ouija board, due in part to the inner relative densities and lower rela tive vibrations of the Ether. The lower in the Astral worlds the being, the lower is their Energy vibration, usually indicating a co rrespondingly low level of trust. Always remember that these low Astral worlds are a perfect reflection of the character of thes e beings existing there. The more inner the being relative to the ph ysical world, the more evolved and therefore trustworthy the being is, but at the same time the more"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 293 difficult it is to contact people li ving in the physical world. This simple guideline should always be kept in Mind in these situations. The beings of the lower Astral worlds will freque ntly revel in claiming to be Angels, Archangels, famous people or even God, while others will have no hes itation at all in cl aiming to be deceased people known to the Ouija board sitte rs. On other occasions these lower Astral beings might simp ly use obscenities, cursing and generally extremely bad language. Why do these lower Astral beings behave in this way? Aside from the fact this is very often the character of these beings, and hence the reason they inhabit the lower Astral worlds in the first place, their despair is often pushed to the extreme simply because t hey can no longer physically experience the things they once enjoyed and very often abused so much while still physically alive such as indulgence in crime, violence, excessive drinking, e xcessive drugs use and excessive sex devoid of genuine love, respect or passion. If they had any sort of reasonable capacity for love, lo ving thoughts or other positive attributes, they would not be in the situation they are in. If they even had the capacity to ask for help to relieve them of their misery, such help would be provided by more highly evolved inner beings if appropriate. Mediums w ho have contacted beings at these low Astral levels often report extremely hostile, abusive and sinister voices. These are the voices of the very same beings often contacted through the use of Ouija boards. Unfortunately, because the user s of the Ouija board are usually hoping for and therefore anticipating genuine contacts with inner-level Spirits, t hey will almost a lways be taken in by the deception of these lower Astral beings. Sometimes this is all quite harmless, and although the Ouija board users are misled, there is us ually no permanent harm done. There is a very real danger however of some lower Astral beings having much darker and more sinister motives. Such dangers include a lower Astral being for example posing as a deceased relative. Once the lower Astral being has been able to conv ince the Ouija board"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 294 sitters they are indeed a deceased re lative, they will often be very manipulative, proceeding to request or even demand certain things to be done for them, mostly with view to increasing it’s own strength of presence within the material world. Such requests are often carried out by the Ouija board sitte rs without question, not wanting to risk upsetting or offending what they genuinely believe to be a deceased relative, friend or inner Spiritual being. Lower Astral beings do not like dwelling in their dark worlds, and will very often seize any opportunity to take control of a physical body in the material world. This c ould in turn very easily lead to a full possession resulting in all so rts of potentially nasty problems, including but not limited to very severe psychological problems. The personality of the possessed pers on might change dramatically and for the worse. The only solution to such a state of possession, is to exorcise the being from the posse ssed person. This might all seem rather dramatic after what star ted out as an innocent party game, but it most certainly can and does happen, and accordingly all Ouija board users should know the dangers beyond any doubt before using a Ouija board, even as a party novelty. The Ouija board should always be regarded as a potentially very dangerous instrument and preferably avoided altogether. Those insisting on ignoring these dangers should at the very least be aware of the type of being likely to made contact with, and what their real motives often are. Any being claiming for example to be a deceased relative should be thoroughly tested by asking questions to which only such a relative would know the answers. The same principle also applies to all beings purporting to be Angels, Archangels or famous people. Such be ings will in reality know very little about Angels, Archangels or the famous people they purport to be, and can therefore be easily c aught out. Again, it is very important indeed to remember this sort of behavior is a reason why these beings are dwelling in the lowest part of the Astral worlds in the first place; they simply cann ot and should not be trusted under any circumstances unless fully te sted by an expert who understand these dangers."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 295 Stoker Hunt, a person who carried out research into the effects arising from the use the Ou ija board, summarized a common pattern of communication that can often develop when people make contact with entities within the low levels of the Astral worlds; he said: “The invader focuses on the victims character weaknesses, if one is vain, appeals to vanity are made. ‘I need your help’ the seducer will say, ‘and only you can help me’. The entity is malicious and does not hesitate to lie, mi srepresent itself (usually as a deceased loved one) and flatter. It’s better for the invader of course if the victim is alone, isolated and ill. If needs be t he invader will terrify its victim, materialising in ghastly form, inducing grotesque visions, inciting poltergeist activity, causing objects to appear out of the blue, delivering false or tragic news, le vitating objects, perhaps levitating the victim. All these things and more might be done, not as ends among themselves, but as a means to an eventual complete possession”. It should be clear by now the Ouij a board is a potentially very dangerous instrument indeed, espec ially for those who do not understand its fullest implications . Dr. Carl Wickland, an American psychiatrist, wrote his classic work on mental illness “Thirty Years Among the Dead” in 1924, within which he warns: “ The serious problem of alie nation and ment al derangement attending ignorant psychic experi ments was first bought to my attention by cases of several persons who’s seemingly harmless activities with automatic writ ing and the Ouija board resulted in such wild insanity that commitm ent to asylums was necessitated. Many other disastrous results which followed the use of the supposedly innocent Ouija board came to my notice, and my observations led me into res earch in psychic phenomena for a possible explanation of these strange occurrences”. These are only a very few of the possible outcomes of the use of the Ouija board. It should be made clear however not all contacts"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 296 by means of the Ouija board are malevolent, and there have also been many positive, long term comm unications where it has been possible to contact well meaning and friendly inner level Astral beings. One particularly noteworthy case was that of Pearl Curran who used a Ouija boar d with her neighbour on July 12, 1912. After a year of experimenting she began to receive messages from Patience Worth, a Spirit entity who claimed she was born in 1649 in Dorsetshire, England. Betw een 1912 and 1919 she dictated five million words through the board, in cluding epigrams, poems, full- length novels, allegorie s and short stories. Her collective works filled twenty nine bound volumes, and 4375 single spaced pages. These works included five full l ength novels, the most successful being “A Sorry Tale”, a 300,000 word story of the earthly life of Jesus which was reviewed by the New York Times on July 8, 1917, commenting: This long and intricate tale of Jewish and Roman life during the time of Christ is constructed with the precision and accuracy of a master hand. It is a wonderful, a beautiful and noble book”. Patience Worth won many more accolades and awards over the years for a wide variety of literary work. Another famous Spiritual entity who first appeared by means of the Ouija board called himself “Seth”, who first made an appearance when Jane Roberts and her hu sband first began using a Ouija board in 1963. The entity eventua lly introduced itself as Frank Withers who died in 1942 after his most recent physical life as an English teacher. He preferred to be called “Seth” and stated his mission as helping people to understand themselves and reality better. Through Jane Roberts, Seth dictated several best-selling books dealing with the nature of reality, reincarnat ion, Astral travel, dreams and the nature of God. Se th also provided step-by-step teachings on meditation techniques and extra-sensory perception. He was also able to diagnose illnesses, correctly describe the contents of buildings and rooms many miles away, and materialised as an apparition in well-lit settings."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 297 There have been many other such successful uses of the Ouija board that proved to be of great value to the people concerned, and in some cases, such as Seth, to humanity as a whole. This should not be taken as reason in and of itself to ju stify the inherent risks involved of using the Ouija board. James Merrill, a Pulitzer winner describes his Ouija board exper iences when he wrote “The Changing Light at Sandov er” in 1982. His frightening experiences including visions, bodily transfo rmation, the feeling of powerful presences as well as more memorable and joyous ones are recorded in the poem. After thir ty years however he no longer recommends people use the Ouija board because “one can never tell how susceptible a given person will be”. On balance, the use of a Ouija board should be strongly discouraged. Due to the nature of the way this instrument functions it is much more likely to attract malevolent low-level Astral entities than well-meaning or even helpful inner-level beings. Those who do attract lower level beings ultima tely stand a very high chance indeed of suffering possession and/or serious mental illness, both of which would be nearly impossi ble to overcome by modern medical means. The only solution to such a serious situation involving inter-dimensional forces would be an exorcism carried out by a highly experienced practitioner of which there are very few living today. The most sensible solution ther efore is to resist any such temptations completely, leaving the Ouija board and similar instruments such as a tumbler with playing cards and automatic writing very well alone for your own safety and for the safety of those around you. "},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 298 Chapter 57: Trance Mediums Trance mediums as the name sugges ts place themselves into an altered state of Consciousness, us ually known as a “trance”, with the objective of channelling informa tion directly from beings of the inner realms. Although trance m ediums can and often do make contact with deceased humans, they have also been successful in making contact with inner-level Spir its, many of whom can provide valuable and accurate information on Spiritual matters. Over the years genuine trance medi ums with high level channelling abilities have channelled a considerable amount of often very valuable information from Spirits of the inner spheres, some of Whom have been very high level Spir its indeed, often resulting in information of great value to mank ind. On several occasions these inner-level Beings have channe lled information through the same medium for many years, and t he information thus received has often been the subject of various series of books, many of which are still available today. Following are just three of the most exceptional cases of channelling from advanced Spiritual beings. White Eagle: A high level Spirit w ho for many years during the first part of the twentieth century channelled at very large quantity of advanced information and teachings through the mediumship of Grace Cook. It was with the assist ance of White Eagle and several other advanced Spirits the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle was able to communicate through Grace Cook and provide considerable valuable information regarding life in t he inner realms of life and realit y. This resulted in books quite literally channelled from the inner spheres, including “Arthur Conan Doyle’s Book of the Beyond”. In later years “The White Eagle L odge” was formed to continue the work of Grace Cook and White Eagl e, and to spread the teachings as far and wide as possible by means of a range of books, and also to freely offer other valuable serv ices to those in need of such services such as healing. Bas ed in Hampshire in England, the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 299 White Eagle Lodge still continues th is very important and valuable work today many years after the passing of Grace Cook, who was undoubtedly one of the greatest of the more recent trance mediums. The many boo ks produced by White Eagle, Grace Cook and the White Eagle Lodge can still be obtained today from White Eagle Lodge. Silver Birch: Through the medium ship of Maurice Barbanell around the middle of the twentieth centur y, Silver Birch was present at numerous “sittings” during which he patiently answered questions for the “sitters”. A “sitting” is a group of people attending what is often known as a “séance”, wher e the medium in vokes a deep altered state of Consciousness know n as a trance. The Spirit will then “talk” through the body of the medium directly. Over the course of many years, such sittings were frequently held at the home of Mauric e Barbanell during which time Silver Birch answered literally thousands of questions for hundreds of visitors from all over the world. It shoul d be mentioned that “Silver Birch”, like “White Eagle” are assumed nam es; these great Spirits actually represent entire groups of very high level Beings all working together as one within the inner Sp iritual realms for the direct benefit of mankind. In the case of Silver Birch, in order to achieve contact with his medium Maurice Barbanell from t he inner realms of the Mental plane, the Spirit worlds, it was necessary to make use of the vacated Astral Body of an Americ an Indian as an “interface”, in order to mediate the differences between the very high Energy vibrations of the inne r Spiritual worlds and the much lower Energy vibrations and density of the physi cal world. Maur ice Barbanell was also the editor of “Psychic Ne ws” in which he published full transcripts of the question and answ er sessions that had previously taken place between Silver Birch and the sitters. In addition there where many books published detaili ng the Silver Birch question and answer sessions, all providing cons iderable information on a very"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 300 wide range of important Spiritual matters. T hese valuable books are still available today through t he Spiritual Truth Foundation. Seth: As previously discussed, through the mediumship of Jane Roberts a Spirit referring to himself simply as “Seth” channelled a large volume of Spiritual informati on over a number of years. These channelled sessions resulted in a series of books still available today including “Seth Speaks” and many others pub lished in the name of Seth. Aside from these more well-know n mediums and the Spirits with whom they worked, there were many other less well-known but nevertheless important cases, all providing most valuable information on a very wide range of subjects, usually for the direct benefit of mankind. Such valu able communications between the Spirit worlds and human mediums is still occurring today, a well- known example being the ch annelling of a group of beings collectively known as “Abraham” Who are channelled by Esther Hicks with assistance of her husb and Jerry Hicks. Esther and Jerry Hicks continue to do an exceptional service by bringing their high level teachings to mankind in the form of seminars, books and electronic media. A further but less well-known gr oup of high Spiritual beings collectively known as “Michael” provi de very valuable information to mankind through various people w ho channel Michael and record the teachings received. "},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 301 Chapter 58: Materialisation Mediums Materialisation mediums are a less well-known type of medium, but might certainly seem much more im pressive to the sitters present during these sessions than voice channelling alone. Materialisation mediums are able to allow the Spirits with whom they are communicating to draw large quantit ies of ectoplasm from the body of the medium and to a lesser extent the other sitters present while in semi-darkness, thereby facilitating a means by which Spirits could actually become visible and therefore materialise either completely or in part. Unlike the Spirits channelled by some trance mediums, these Spirits tended to be low to mid-Astral level Souls who were not therefore able to impart much in formation of value to mankind generally. Only low to mid-level beings can lower the low vibration to the level of vibration of the Etheric body required in order to interact with ectoplasm thereby facilitating a complete materialisation. Entities known as “ghosts” have such a low level of vibration and correspondingly higher density, the reason they are so often “seen” as apparition. Ma terialised, channelled Spirits did nevertheless provide considerable ev idence of the continuity of life after physical death to the sitters present, many of whom were also seeking, and indeed achieved communication with deceased relatives. One of the most famous of all materialisation mediums was Helen Duncan who carried out numerous successful séances whereby Spirits of the deceased would materi alise completely in ectoplasmic form, and in such a form were able to communicate with all present on a one to one basis. Many of s éances of Helen Duncan took place in the 1930’s a nd 1940’s during the time of the second world war, and therefore not surprisi ngly many of the Spirits who materialised were people who had been killed during the fighting. The services of Helen Duncan oft en provided very great comfort to bereaved relatives, many of whom were actually able to see,"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 302 communicate with and hold conversati ons directly with their loved ones. Throughout the war years Helen D uncan reunited many grieving relatives with servicemen who had lost their physical lives in action. At one particular séance in Portsmouth a sailor materialised and was reunited with his mother. The sailor said that his ship, HMS Bahrnam had very recently been sunk. Maurice Barbanell, the editor of “Psychic News” and the medium for Silver Birch heard about this and made enquiries at the admiralty as to whether this sinking was in fact tr ue, and if so why had the relatives of the deceased crew members not been offici ally informed. The admiralty was furious at this situation due to the fact that the sinking of HMS Bahrnam was still considered to be classified information and accordingly should not have been public knowledge. The military authorities became very concerned that a medium of the capabilities of Helen Duncan c ould so easily obtain further classified information from deceased army personnel, and in particular sensitive information r egarding the forthcoming D-Day landings. This of course was not the intention of Helen Duncan at all. The authorities subsequently however reacted in the most appalling possible manner by arresting Helen Duncan who was by that time a frail lady with six children and a disabled husband to support, and sent her to jail for nine months causing her husband and children to be evicted from their family home as a direct result. The authorities then needed to find a suit able law under which to charge her, finally deciding to make use the extremel y outdated, misguided and often highly barbaric witchcraft laws that we re still in force in Britain at the time. Helen Duncan was later visi ted in jail by Winston Churchill who was absolutely appalled by the si tuation. As a direct result Winston Churchill subs equently promised to repeal all such laws at the very first opportunity. During the subsequent trial of Helen Duncan forty one highly credible witnesses swore under oat h they had been present when"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 303 their loved ones had materia lised and communicated with them during her séances. One such witness was a high-ranking wing commander who stated under oath he had met his dead mother, father and brother at a Helen Duncan séance. Not a single one of these highly credible witnes ses was broken under cross- examination. The court also tried to make the case that all of these materialisations must have been the work of accomplices wearing false beards, wigs, white cloaks and other such items, but no such evidence was ever found and of c ourse ever could be found. Helen Duncan did not charge money for her services therefore such an elaborate deceit would not have made any sense whatsoever. Some years later a team of st age magicians headed by William Goldston, the founder of the magicians club, carried out an experimental sitting with Helen Duncan. He and his colleagues were apparently completely astounded when during the sitting a deceased famous stage magici an, “The Great Lafayette”, materialised and spoke to the group in his own voice. Goldston later reported in Psychic News that Helen Duncan must most certainly be genuine, and that no magician could possibly duplicate the phenomena he and his colle agues had witnessed that day. In 1956 police in Nottingham raided a séance being held by Helen Duncan. Despite the police know ing very well, due to their investigations into Helen Duncan that materialisation séances need to take place in semi-darkness due to sensitivit y to light of ectoplasm, they apparently nevertheless made a grab for the medium and took flash photographs of the surroundings. Needless to say nothing was ever found, and the photographs revealed no evidence whatsoever of any sort of malpractice. However the shock incurred by the sudden withdrawal of ectoplasm due to exposure to the lights was sufficient to very seriously injure Helen Duncan, and most sadly she passed on withi n five weeks of the raid. "},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 304 Helen Duncan was most certainly one of the worlds most gifted materialisation mediums and it really is truly horrendous that the life of this frail, well meaning la dy should have been terminated in such a brutal way, for no other reason than the continued ignorance of the authorities. Her legacy however continues to this day, and few would doubt the services of Hele n Duncan were gifted, genuine and most valuable in helping numerous bereaved people, including during the time of the second world war where so many people physically lost their loved ones in the fighting, and who where able, through the gifts of Helen Duncan to know beyond any doubt that their loved ones are safe, well and happy within their non-physical existence of the Astral worlds, oft en known as the “afterlife” or the “beyond”. The Noah’s Arc Society for Physical Mediumship was formed in England in 1990 and now has a membership of 1700 people and 150 member circles worldwide. It was established to provide a safe haven for mediums and to protect t hem from what the President of the society describes as: “the harsh treatment meted out to early pioneer physical mediums from so-c alled researchers who insisted on trussing up the medium, demanding endless tests, and inflicting grave harm physically through violating the laws governing physical phenomena”.  "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 305 Chapter 59: The Direct Voice The direct voice is most certainly one of the most impressive forms of mediumship whereby the people present at a sitting, the sitters, are able to very clearly hear Spirits speak aloud in their normal voices, exactly the same voices as they were known by in physical life, and to engage in long conversations with them. This was particularly reassuring for the re latives of the deceased ones as they then knew beyond any doubts whatsoever from the accent, style of speaking, phraseology, words used and information received that they really were in direct communication with their loved ones speaking to them in person from the “beyond”. As with materialisation, the dire ct voice involves the use of ectoplasm. Spirits draw ectoplasm from the throat chakra of the medium and to a lesser extent the sitters, and then form the ectoplasm into an “Etheric voice box” through which they are able speak from the Spirit side of the channel, manifesting in the physical world as a Spirit voice. This Etheric voice box functioned by making use of the ectoplas m to reduce the higher thought vibrations of the Spir its communicating through t he “voice box” to a much lower rate of vibration t hat could translate to physically audible sound. These Spirit voices were very ofte n so clear and loud it was exactly as if speaking to a physical person in the same room. Although direct voice sittings needed to take place in darkness as with materialisation sittings due to the sensitivity to light of ectoplasm, the sitters could sometimes easily observe the whitish coloured ectoplasm exuding from the throat chakra area of the medium. The ectoplasm could also be very clearly observed and photographed by means of infrared viewing equi pment that did not affect it. From the Spirit side of the channel the ectoplasmic “voice portal” could be seen as a large glowing disk of Energy into which they would “speak”. It should be noted that Spirits do not actually physically “speak” in the absence of a physical body, but rather"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 306 communicate by means of a projection by the Mind of thought towards the voice portal which then translates the resultant thought vibrations into a clearly audible voice by means of the Etheric ectoplasmic voice box created from the ectoplasm of the medium and sitters. One of the most extraordinary di rect voice mediums was Leslie Flint, 1911-1994 who’s permanent sitters recorded literally thousands of voices of discarnate Sp irits on tape over the course of many years. When these discarnat e Spirit voices first started appearing to Leslie Flint he was o ften expelled from cinemas and theatres as the voices were di sturbing the quietness of the surroundings, and of course peopl e had absolutely no idea of who the voices were or where they were originating from. The voices channelled by Lesli e Flint during his numerous and usually recorded sittings ranged fr om the Souls of the deceased relatives of the sitters, through to people who were once famous on Earth who came to deliver impo rtant messages, usually involving evidence for the continuity of life after physical death. Of course there were the usual groups of sceptics who believed Leslie Flint was a fraud. Leslie Flint often therefore agreed to conduct sittings in the presence of researchers who had carte blanche to carry out more or less whatever experiments they needed to in order to pr ove or disprove that Leslie Flint and the Spirit voices were indeed genuine or otherwise. In one such particular experiment as reported in the Psychic News edition of 14 February 1948, Leslie Flint was physically tied to a chair with sticking plaster stuck over his lips thus sealing them together completely, and with bandages plac ed over his mouth over the sticking plaster. The researchers observed the Spirit voices still arriving with their usual volume and clarity. There were twelve people present during that particular sitting and all agreed the voices were most definitely not those of Leslie Flint but were in fact rather those of the Sp irits who had arrived in order to communicate with the sitters. At the end of t he sitting everything previously"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 307 applied by the researchers, incl uding the ropes, the bandages and sticking plaster were all still tota lly intact and completely untouched, just as they were when originally applied by the researchers. The information received directly from Spirits by means of the direct voice mediumship of Leslie Flint was not simple vague information of the type that could easily a pply to anyone, but was rather extremely specific and accurate as you would expect to be the case coming directly from the Spirits who were in possession of and conveying the information. One su ch typical example involved an airman who was killed in action during the se cond world war. This airman originally appeared at a sitting bei ng attended by Lord Dowding, giving his name as Pe ter William Handford Kite. The Spirit asked if his parents c ould be contacted at an address he supplied, and be invited to attend a sitting where he would be present for them. The parents duly a ccepted the invitation to attend the sitting with Leslie Flint and for nearly forty minutes the airman communicated with his par ents in his own clearly recognisable and normal voice. His parents were abl e to confirm everything he had said was totally true and accurate in every respect. Among the things he spoke of to his parents during the sitting was a joke about buying an Alsatian dog, that his mother had put photographs of his grave in Norway in her bag that very morning, that he liked the cherry tree in the memorial garden they had planted for him, that his bedroom had not been changed in the six years since he had “died”, that he had not liked the wa llpaper in his bedroom and that his father was still driving his car although it was too small for him. Unfortunately, sceptics still tried absolutely everything possible in order to attempt to discredit Leslie Flint, just as they had previously tried to discredit many other well-known and totally genuine mediums. In 1971 Leslie Flint had th is to say about this situation: “ When I first began to allow myself to be tested I was naive enough to believe that if the tests were successful the scientists and researchers who had carried them out under their own conditions would proclaim to all the world t he truth of life after death. All too"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 308 soon I learned the hard way that many of those who call themselves researchers have immutable values of their own which preclude belief of a meaning or purpose in man’s existence or the possibility of a life afte r death. Their concern was to disprove the reality of my voices and they would postul ate any alternative, however far-fetched or absurd, sooner than admit the implication of their own successful experiment”. Some of the more ludicrous expl anations put forward by some of these so called researchers included suggestions the voices were not real but rather the result of some hypnotic power accompanied by mass hallucinations. This was later disproved when a throat microphone was attached to the throat of Leslie Flint during a sitting such that the slightest sound m ade through his larynx would be magnified enormously, while the researchers continuously observed him at the same time through an infra-red telescope. When Leslie Flint proved them wrong yet again, the best suggestion the researchers could come up with is that he must have the ability to talk through his stomach. One impartial, open-Minded expert who did investigate Leslie Flint very thoroughly indeed was Professor William R. Bennett, professor of electrical engineeri ng at Columbia University in New York City. As engineers are usually regarded as highly practical and level- headed people, his evidence wa s widely regarded to be of particular value. Professor Bennett had this to say of his own personal experience during a Leslie Flint sitting: “My experience with Mr. Flint is first hand; I have heard the independent voices. Furthermore, mo dern investigation techniques, not available in earlier tests co rroborate previous conclusions by indicating the voices are not hi s. But to be thorough, one should consider the possibility of live accomplices. This suggestion became untenable to me during his vi sit to New York in September 1970, when, in an impromptu séanc e at my apartment, the same voices not only appeared, but took part in conversations with the guests.”"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 309 The Spirit voices channelled by Les lie Flint are still available as recordings available on the Inter net website established in his name and for his work, and anyone can judge for themselves both the authenticity of the voices and the value of the information received.   "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 310 Chapter 60: Electronic Voice Phenomenon As times have progressed since the days of the materialisation and direct voice mediums science has pl ayed an increasingly important role in communicating with Spirit s of the inner spheres. Many voices from the “beyond” hav e been captured on magnetic media and in particular on audiotape. There have been numerous cases, especially in recent years wher e the voices of deceased people now living in the Astral worlds would appear to amazed relatives on audio tape. This usually happened when something quite normal was being recorded, but when the tape was played back the voices “from beyond” are clearly present on the tape. These voices are often very clear, usually carrying a short but simple message, enough at least to provide ample ev idence to those involved of the presence of the deceased person. It is this sort of experience that has prompted further extensive and controlled investigation into obtai ning the voices of “deceased” Souls now living in the Astral real ms by recording them on tape and similar electro-magnetic recording devices. These experiments are often carried out in a similar way to conventional sittings or séances whereby the sitters simply sit around the tape recorder or other recording device providing the necessary focus and Energy. The presence, focus and intent of the si tters are sufficient to attract the attentions of Spirits from “the other side”, who are then able to record their messages. These messages cannot actually be heard being recorded due to the vast differences in the densit y and vibrations between the Ether of Astral and physical worlds, ho wever the voices are heard to be present during the repl ay of the tape. How does this situation occur? The entire Universe, the Ether consists of vibration, Energy, an d of particular importance in this case the Electric and Magnetic “f luids”. These “fluids” are not actually liquids as recognised in the physical world, but rather the electric and magnetic characteristics of the Universal Fire and"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 311 Water elements. It is the electr o-magnetic propagation properties of the Ether that allows the vibrations of the communications of the Spirit voices, thought waves in th e form of Energy, to pass through the electromagnetic continuum of the Ether and thus to be recorded on magnetic tape. During one particular set of expe riments carried out under strictly controlled conditions in a sound-proof studio in order to ensure that no extraneous noises could be present, two researchers left a tape recorder running for twenty seven minutes, during which time 200 Spirit voices were recorded. As with all of these “phenomena” there were several sceptical scientis ts who endeavoured to find a “logical” explanation for these vo ices recorded on the tape, but were totally unable to do so. This area of research became known as “Electronic Voice Phenomenon” or EVP for short. M any famous people considered pioneers in their fields such as Marconi, Edison, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Crookes and John Logie Baird were all totally convinced of the reality of Spir it communication by EVP and were using their professional skills and reputations to prove it. Even the Christian churches were open-Minded to EVP including Catholics, Protestants and Fundamentalists. The Catholic church has even actively encouraged research directed towards Electronic Voice Phenomenon. Two of the earliest religious investigators were Fath er Ernetti and Father Gemelli who stumbled upon the Electronic Voic e Phenomenon while recording Gregorian chants in 1952. Father Gemelli apparently heard the voice of his own deceased father on the tape saying, “Zucchini, it is clear, don’t you know it is I”. “Z ucchini” was the childhood name of Father Gemelli. Pope Pius, the c ousin of the Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei was co-founder of the Jung Institute and was an internationally recognised and respected parapsychologist who worked very closely with Dr Konst antin Raudive, a pioneer of EVP working in Germany. Rev Frei stated: “all that I have read and heard forces me to believe t hat the voices come from"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 312 transcendental, individual entities. Whether it suits me or not, I have no right to doubt the reality of the voices ”-- Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei. Rev. Professor Dr Gebhard Frei died October 27 1967. In November 1967 at numer ous EVP tape recording sessions a voice claiming to be Gebhard Frei was re corded. The voice was positively confirmed and identified by Prof essor Peter Hohenwarter of the University of Vienna as unquestionably the vo ice belonging to Dr Frei. The Catholic religion became in creasingly supportive of EVP research with several Vatican approved researchers producing compelling evidence for EVP. Father Leo Schmid, a Swiss theologist, collected more than ten thousand recorded voices in his book “When the Dead Speak” in 1976, published shortly after his death. In England, in 1972, four senior members of the Catholic church became involved in the famous Pye Recording Studio tests conducted by Peter Bander. Father Pistone, Superior of the Society of St. Paul in England, said after the tests: “I do not see anything against the teac hing of the Catholic church in the voices, they are something ex tra-ordinary, but there is no reason to fear them, nor can I see any danger” . --Father Pistone. A series of high and respected officials of the Catholic church subsequently lent support to EVP in what has now become a firm Vatican position of acceptance for these “voices from beyond”. The following definitive statement was i ssued by Father Gi no Concetti at the Vatican: “According to the modern catechism, God allows our dear departed persons who live in an ultra-te rrestrial dimension, to send messages to guide us in certain di fficult moments of our lives. The Church has decided not to forbid any more the dialogue with the"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 313 deceased with the condition that thes e contacts are carried out with a serious religious and scientific purpose” Printed in the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano and cited in Sarah Estep's American Association Electronic Voice Phenomena, Inc Newsletter, Vol 16 No, 2 1997. The “ultra-terrestrial dimension” to which Father Concetti refers is of course the Astral worlds, again o ften known as the “beyond” or the “afterlife”. The church itself does not as yet appear to officially support the reality of the true multi-dimensional nature of the Universe, or indeed the reality of the true purpose and destiny of mankind, it is however most posit ive that indeed it does at least officially support the reality of the continuity of life in an inner dimension after death of the physical body.  "},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 314 Chapter 61: Instrumental Transcommunication Instrumental Transcommunication, “I TC” for short, is a particularly fascinating extension to the work of EVP. World ITC, an organisation specialising in this field and from which the following is referenced has this to say in introducing their cause: “For thousands of years medium s and shamans have been in contact with a type of communica tor that we don’t see and we cannot touch. These types of communicators can’t be perceived through our five senses. And the so called “normal” people (who are not aware that they might have mediumisti c capabilities), often say that they feel that they are in contact with something/somebody in a way that other people canno t understand or believe. We define: Transcommunication takes place wi th partners we cannot perceive by use of our five senses. That is, partners inhabiting realms beyond our perception” – World ITC. Note: again, the “realms beyond our perception” is a reference to the Astral worlds, the “afterlife”, the “beyond”. Instrumental Transcommunication, ITC, is a range of technologies and means by which communications arriving from the Astral worlds can be received and stored by technical equipment. Unlike Electronic Voice Phenomena whic h largely focuses on audio tape recordings, ITC greatly extends the range and sophistication of equipment used to include tape recor ders, TVs, radios, computers, telephones, mini-disk recorders, video recorders, the psychophone and all other devices already being used or will be used in the future in order to obtain these c ontacts from the Astral worlds. Examples of such devices also include microphones, video cameras, amplifiers for microphones, noise generators, mixing desks, lasers, ultrasonics and many other technical devices with the intent of obtaining meaningful information fr om the Astral world in the form of voices, as well as images and text. "},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 315 The big advantage of ITC is the po ssibility to prove to others in more compelling ways than traditional channelling, often viewed with cynicism and scepticism, that something out of the ordinary “paranormal” is indeed taking plac e. People generally have more faith in scientific evidence that is often believed to be more physically tangible. The entire field of Instrument al Transcommunications has been evolving for a number of years. In the 1920’s Thomas Alva Edison, inventor of the electric ligh t, the motion picture camera and phonograph was busily at work in hi s laboratory building a machine to achieve Spirit communication “with the dead”. His assistant Dr Miller Hutchinson wrote, “ Edison and I are convinced that in the fields of psychic research will ye t be discovered facts that will prove of greater significance to the thin king of the human race than all the inventions we have ever made in the field of electricity.” This was a most profound and import ant observation relating to the work of one of the greatest innovators that has yet physically lived. Edison himself wrote “ If our personality survives then it is strictly logical or scientific to assume that it retains memory, intellect and other facilities and knowledge we acqui re on Earth. Therefore, if we can evolve an instrument so de licate as to be affected by our personality as it survived in the nex t life, such an instrument, when made available, should record something”. – Thomas Alva Edison Around 1925 Oscar d’Argon ell wrote a book ent itled “Voices from Beyond by Telephone” in which he detailed long conversations with his friends from the Spir it world. His book al so gave details of how the calls were actually accomp lished from the Spirit worlds. In 1936 Atila von Szalay started experimenting with record cutting equipment and achieved success in recording Spirit voices on phonograph records. In 1949 Marcello Bacci began re cording voices using an old vacuum tube radio. A team of Spirits subsequently developed"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 316 around his work speaking to him th rough radio sounds. It should be noted there are large bands of Souls within the Astral worlds who’s self appointed task it is to make and maintain contact with people still living on Earth. The primary reason for this is to conclusively establish the truth, r eality and importance of t he continuity of life after the death of the physica l body, thus assisting the advancement of mankind. People w ould visit Marcello Bacci at his home, and deceased relatives would often speak with them through the equipment. In 1959, a Swedish film producer , Friedrich Juergenson captured voices on audio-tape whil e recording bird song. Listening more intently to his tapes he heard hi s mother's voice say in German; “Friedrich, you are being watched. Friedel, my little Friedel, can you hear me?” During the next few years he continued to record hundreds of voices from the Astr al worlds. Friedrich Juergenson went on to publish two books on hi s work called “Voices from the Universe” and “Contact with the Dead”. In 1967 a researcher, Franz Seld el, developed an instrument known as the “psychophone” for recording voices from the Astral worlds. In 1971 a very important series of experiments took place involving the chief engineers of Pye Records Limited when they invited EVP pioneer Konstantin Raudive to their sound laboratory, installing special filtering equipm ent to block out noise from radio waves. Raudive spoke into the microphone for eighteen minutes, during which time no other voices were h eard in the studio. When the tape was played back the researchers heard over 200 different Spirit voices from the Astral worlds. Th is well-known experiment led to a large number of independent peopl e using home tape recording equipment to collect Spirit voices. During the late 1970’s considerable progress was made when USA based Spiritual researchers Ge orge and Jeanette Meek met a gifted psychic William O’ Neil. T he Meeks provided the resources"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 317 for an advanced project in direct Spirit communication with Spirit friends of Willam O’ Neil being in vited to participate. One of his Spirit friends was Dr George Jeffr ies Mueller, a deceased university professor and NASA scientist who simply appeared in O'Neil's living room one day as a semi-ma terialized Spirit and announced he was there to assist in t he project of Meek and O'Neil. This became a remarkable collabor ation between the Astral and physical worlds with Dr. Mueller assisting Bill O’Neil to design a new piece of equipment that could c onvert Spirit voices into audible language. The device designed as a result of this remarkable association between the two worlds became known as the Spiricom comprising a series of tone and frequency generators emitting 13 tones spanning the range of the adult male voice. By late 1980 the Spiricom had evolved to the point where the Spirit voice of Dr. Mueller was l oud and easily understandable. The pioneering work of the Meek’s with their friends Bill O’ Neil, and Dr. Mueller in the Astral world became the catalyst for many similar experiments and research, carried out all over the world. Between 1982 and 1988, Hans Otto Koenig developed a new type of Spirit communications devic e utilising extremely low frequency oscillators as well as ultra-viol et and infra-red lights. In 1983 he appeared on the popular Radio Lux embourg where his equipment was set up under the close scrutiny of the radio station engineers. One of the engineers ask ed if a voice could co me through in direct reply to a question, and a voice quickly replied, “We hear your voice. Otto Koenig makes wirel ess contact wit h the dead.” . Stunned, Rainer Holbe the radio show presenter addressed the millions of listeners across Europe saying, “I tell you, dear Listeners of Radio Luxembourg, and I swear by the life of my children, that nothing has been manipulat ed. There are no tricks. It is a voice, and we do not know from where it comes.” Between 1984 to 1985 Ken Webster received some 250 messages on his computers from a Spirit named Thomas Harden who had"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 318 passed on in the 16 th century. The Spirit claimed he had owned the same property four centuries earlier. Thomas Harden appears to have remained in the Etheric region of the Astral planes closest to the physical world and was therefor e what is commonly known as a “ghost”. Thomas Harden referred to the computer as a “light box”, and sent information accusing Ken Webster of stealing his house. The many messages that follow ed in an old English dialect contained much informati on about the life of Sp irit and of that era generally, all facts that were confirmed later. And so ITC has progressed over the years with many seemingly amazing “phenomena” involving Sp irit communication from the “beyond”. In 1985, Klaus Shreiber began to receive the images of Spirits on his television set incl uding Albert Eins tein and deceased Austrian actress Romy Schneider, as well as various deceased family members; another of numerous such incidences of ITC, both intentional and by design, whereby residents of the Astral worlds are able to make direct communica tion with physical people still living on Earth. In 1985 the science of ITC entered a new phase when Mark Macy of the World ITC organization and web site where many of the above examples of Spirit comm unications can be found, began to work closely with scientists and re searchers on both sides of the Atlantic. Mark Macy said: “Sixteen of us met in England to discuss this modern day miracle, its tremendous possibilities for our world, and the obstacles that stood in the way. We formed new friendships, and by the end of a long weekend we also formed INIT; The International Network for Instrumental Transcommunication. In the coming months Ethereal beings told us that they were observing our efforts closely and would provide guidance and support. We began to observe unprecedented miracles in our re search. Many of us received phone calls, from Spirit friend Kons tantin Raudive, and the Harch- Fischbachs; note: radio based ITC equipment of Maggy Harsch- Fischbach and her husband Jules Harsch of Luxembourg; received"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 319 astounding pictures and messages th rough their computer, all as a result of resonance among INIT members. It was clear that a new phase of ITC research on Earth had begun. Our Ethereal friends told us that the greatest strides w ould be made by individuals from different countries who committed to work together in harmony with pure intentions”. As these aging researchers passed on to the Astral worlds themselves, they very soon began to communicate with their colleagues still remaining on Earth. These researchers turned Spirit communicators from the Astral worl ds included Konstantin Raudive, Friedrich Juergenson, Klaus Schr eiber, Bill O’ Neil and George Meek, all of whom wished to cont inue their earthly research from their new side of the veil in the Astral worlds. The World ITC site sums up this remarkable research with equally remarkable results thus: Ethereal be ings told INIT on more than one occasion that simply opening the door to the Spir it worlds can be dangerous; but researchers w ho work together and dedicate their efforts to inner human principles will receive Ethereal guidance and protection. As years passed the Ethereal fri ends of Mark Macy along with a team of more than one thousand Sp irit beings who had once lived on Earth shared vast and astonishing information with INIT members through computers, telephones, radios and other technical media. The advanced Ethereal beings said they had accompanied our world for many thousands of years and had come close six times when Earth had r eached a crossroads leading either to a dark age or a period of enlig htenment. This they said was the seventh time and they wished to establish a lasting bridge with their formless realm of wise, loving Consciousness. ITC research would be the means by which to establish that bridge. Through the work of INIT it became evident that the more miraculous forms of ITC contact were made possible by such Ethereal beings who also provid ed protection and guidance for ITC"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 320 researchers and their Spirit friend s. Mark Macy has been a leading researcher in ITC for many year s. In 2001 he is was experiencing “miracles” in his laboratory includ ing colour images of Spirits on a reliable basis, and the steady im provement of radio contacts towards a loud and clear dialogue. It is clear the field of Instrumental Transcommunications is proving to be very important in proving t he continuity of life after the death of the physical body and of the inner rea lities, information that really is so important to the future of mankind. As the years progress, the work of people like Mark Macy and his World ITC, together with the numerous scientists and researc hers both within the physical and Astral worlds will become progressi vely more important as one of the main routes of inner level Spirit communication.  "},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 321 Chapter 62: Channeling Conclusion There are numerous ways and means of establishing and maintaining contact with a wide range of beings from the inner spheres of reality, especially human beings. Some methods of communications are relatively sa fe for the genuine and experienced channeler, medium or researcher, and others of which are outright potentially dangerous such as the Ou ija board and its variations for example. Any form of channeling at all cont inued by inexperienced people should always be regarded as pot entially dangerous, and should accordingly never be attempted. Genuine channelers, mediums and EVP experts for example have been practicing their particular disciplines for many years and therefore fully understand the dangers involved and how to deal with them should they arise. Many of these people al so have entire bands of be ings in the Astral and inner spheres assisting, watching over and protecting them during the furtherance of their important work. Although many forms of channeli ng are highly effective when practiced by genuine channeler s, mediums and researchers, including those mentioned earlier in this section, there have been and still are unfortunately many much less competent practitioners as well as large numbers of out right charlatans who are doing nothing more than seeking to willfu lly deceive people, usually for financial gain. Such charlatans ar e particularly dark as they will generally be more than happy to prey upon recently bereaved people and others suffering in life. Unfortunately the general public tends to take the cynical and sceptical view by focusing on the charlatans claiming them to be representative of channeling generally, thus giving all genui ne mediums, channelers, researchers and their work a bad name. In other cases science and researc hers who are totally rooted in the three dimensional world of physical matter have tended to commit much of their time and Ener gy in striving to disprove the"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 322 ability to contact beings of the inner realms, including deceased human beings, using whatever means they have available whether such means are fair, ethical, true or otherwise. Many people have also become quite understandably high ly disillusioned after one or more experiences with fraudulent mediums or psychics that have often resulted in considerably more harm than good. It is not at all surprising th erefore that genu ine channeling, mediumship and instrumental res earch has never achieved the level of acceptance necessary in order for mankind generally to take it seriously enough to accept the absolute and most important truth of the continuity of life a fter the death of the physical body, and indeed of the existence of mu lti-dimensional realities of life beyond the physical world of matter, the physical Universe only representing a tiny fraction of the magnificence of the entire Universe of Energy, Consciousness and Love of which we are all an inseparable aspect. As mentioned earlier t here is a whole hierarchy of more advanced beings of the inner spheres of reality who are concerned with the progression of the entire human race. These hierarchies extend ever inwards, the inner always assisting the outer in the great ascent back to The Source, The Fi rst Cause, to God. As mankind has strayed further and further from its true path and destiny in favour of an illusionary pat h built around creed, dogma, indoctrination, gross materialis m and the ego, perceiving only a three dimensional physical reality, the beings of t he inner spheres are involved with various strategies aimed at bringing awareness of the inner truths and realities back to humanity. It has been realised by these adv anced beings that channeling and most other forms of mediumship have largely failed to succeed in this most important task for the reasons previously discussed, and accordingly alternative more direct and convincing approaches are required. The new focus over t he last few decades therefore has been to teach mankind the existence of the inner realities, the truth of the continuity of life afte r physical death, and in encouraging"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 323 people to verify these important matters for themselves at first hand rather than having to rely solely on the word of mediums, psychics, clairvoyants and others. This strat egy has resulted in the numerous seemingly miraculous and ongoing situations which was first referred to in the introduction to this book thus: “T oday we are witnessing seemin gly “miraculous phenomena” whereby people are experiencin g spontaneous, and sometimes even dramatic Spiritual exper iences. Often, following such experiences are a sincere and d edicated seeking of genuine and true purpose, very often acco mpanied by an overwhelming realisation that t here really is much more to “life” than the physical, material world erroneously identifi ed as “reality”. Such life changing experiences arrive in many and varied forms and degrees, including spontaneous Astral Pr ojection, or “out of body experiences”, Lucid Dreams, n ear-death experiences, and very often simply a sudden “r ealisation” in the form of an unmistakable inspiration or intuition received from “higher” sources. These changes are not only happening in the adult world. We are also witnessing new and extremely succe ssful children’s books, films and television programs, subtly guiding children away from the creed, dogma and indoctrination of the past”. This then is the new paradigm moving forwards in this new and pivotally important era for all mank ind. Once a sufficient number of people on Earth have expanded their awareness and Consciousness to fully realise, encompass and accept the inner realities and Universal truths and to structure their lives accordingly, this will in turn result in a much wider and accelerating expansion of Consciousness eventually encom passing the entire group human Mind, the collective human Consci ousness, whereby exactly the same Universal realisations, trut h and realities will sooner or later become an integral component of the Consciousness and life of every human being on Earth. It is no coincidence therefore t hat these seemingly “miraculous” events, are increasingly occurring during this new era into which"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 324 the planet and mankind has now progressed. Channelling, mediumship and other indirect methods of contact and research all have their own place and ar e no less effective or important to those genuine people who practice them or to the people who genuinely benefit from them; t he emphasis has now however shifted. The remainder of this section is therefore dedicated to this new and vitally important approach to the inner realities. We will discuss how you can consciously visit the inner worlds verifying at first hand the truth and nature of your own immort al existence, and in the Astral worlds in particular to comm unicate with deceased human beings including family and friends, as well as gathering a multitude of extremely valuable expe riences and information.  "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 325 Chapter 63: Contact with the Inner Spheres There are numerous ways in whic h the inner spheres of life and reality ranging from the Astral planes to the much more inward Mental planes be contacted, connected with and indeed visited. Many of these methods, in partic ular those required to safely communicate with the inner spheres of life beyond the Astral worlds are advanced, requiring dedication, discipline, practice, balance, and a degree of personal evolution in order to accomplish safely and successfully. That having been said, almost anyone can potentially achieve these levels of ability with commitment and dedication, by diligently and honestly applying individual development methods including thos e discussed in the next section of this book. For those so willing , the rewards can be very profound indeed, and very often life changing for the better. Again it must be stressed howe ver that despite the numerous articles you may read on the Internet and elsewhere regarding channelling and other such indirect methods of communication with the Spirit worlds, everyone would be very well advised indeed to leave these well alone until such time as your necessary level of development has been achieved, otherwise the consequences could well be very se rious indeed for those who choose to dabble without the necessary abilities and experience. We can now proceed to look in at several distinctly different methods of achieving contact wit h and travelling to the Astral worlds, including methods used successfully over many years. These methods will not only result in a much higher quality and more reliable level of experience and communication with beings in the inner worlds as compared to channelling and other indirect methods, but most importantly are also completely safe. Having successfully accomplished any of the followin g methods any temptations to interact with the i nner worlds by less direct and safe methods such as channelling will be set aside and seen for what they are."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 326 Chapter 64: Clairvoyance Clairvoyance quite literally m eans “clear seeing” and can be defined as the ability to view within and beyond space and time without the need for physical eyes ight, and therefore beyond the limitations of the five physical senses. There are many levels of clairvoyance and those with clairv oyant abilities might experience the entire range of such levels or simply just one or two of them. In general terms clairvoyance includes the ability to view things at any distance beyond t he scope of the eyesight and other physical senses, and also to “see” beyond the confines and limitations of temporal space and time, in particula r to view the Astral worlds and the people and beings living t here. The images “seen” by a clairvoyant might range from a sti ll image or even an impression, to full motion pictures in vibrant co lours appearing every bit as real and lifelike as actually viewin g the physical world through the physical eyes if not much more so. The Astral worlds and beyond exhibit colours, sounds and vi brations way beyond anything perceivable by means of the five physical senses, and a clairvoyant can often view these in all of their splendour. Clairvoyance is often known as the “sixth sense” and is associated with area of the forehead known as “the third eye”. At the location of the third eye there is a co rresponding physical gland known as the pineal gland located slightly above and between the physical eyes, approximately mid-way between the eyebrows. This is also the same location as one of the ma in Vital Energy centres of the Etheric Body often known as the “brow chakra” as discussed earlier. It is the brow chakra that is actually the “third eye” and which is therefore responsible fo r the ability of clairvoyance. The physical pineal gland itse lf has steadily atrophied during the course of the evolution of mankind, par ticularly in recent millennia, progressively shrinking from its original size of approximately equivalent to a ping-pong ball, down to approxima tely the size of a pea as it exists in most people today . This atrophying of the pineal gland is mainly due to its lack of use, not only from a physical point"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 327 of view but more particularly due to the lack of it s intended Spiritual use, thereby gradually shrinking as mankind has forgotten how to recognise and fully utilise its late nt psychic and inner abilities. The pineal gland has also shrunk en due to breathing habits that became progressively less cent red on Vital Energy and more centred on the inhalation of or dinary air through the mouth and nose. Of course humans need to physically breath, but the breathing of Vital Energy throughout the entire body is also vital for to the existence of life in all spheres of the multi-dimensional Universe. In many respects the pineal gland resembles an eyeball, and indeed it still has many of the same characteristics as an eyeball except that of course it cannot physically see in the same way as physical eyes. The biological pineal gland actually functions in conjunction with the brow chakra of the Energy Body in order to bring Spir itual or higher visions to the Mind rather than t he physical visions of the three dimensional world of matter as pr ovided by the senses of the two physical eyes. As previously mentioned however, due to the progressive lack of use of the Spir itual vision over the course of thousands of years as mankind has become increasingly obsessed with materialism and its focus on t he five physical senses, the brow chakra has progressively succum bed to disuse, and the associated pineal gland has accordingly steadily atrophied as would any organ which is no longer used for extended periods of time. The decline in use of the pine al gland, coincident with a progressively more ma terial outlook on life and the associated decline in understanding and knowledge of Spiritual realities and of the true destiny of mankind, has resulted in people ceasing to consciously breath Vital Energy through the entire body including the chakras, in this case the brow chakra, and to focus exclusively on breathing through the nose and mout h. This in turn has resulted in mankind progressively seeing th ings in a totally different and limited way, and only in accordance with the perception of the five physical senses. This is a major contributing factor as to how"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 328 mankind has progressively lost c ontact with the inner spheres of reality and therefore of his own Spiritual nature, true purpose and ultimate destiny. This same lack of inner Spiritual awareness is also a major reason why most people now perceive themselves to be located within the confines of a ph ysical body, completely separate from everything and everyone else around them and from the Universe generally, looking out on the world through physical eyes, interacting with the surroundings by means of the eyes and the other four physical senses. When mankind eventually turns its back on materialism, creed, dogma and all of the other insidi ous negative factors affecting humanity today, and once again beg ins to know its true and ultimate destiny, people will once again begin to live their lives in accordance with true Spirit ual values arising from the full realisation of our true Spiritual na ture, and in the certain knowledge we are all children of the same Pr ime Creator, The Source, God, to whom it is the ultimate destiny of everyone to eventually return as perfected Spiritual beings. Those people now following the tr ue path are already beginning to regain their true Spiritual faculties including clairvoyance. As this process continues those people will progressively experience raised vibrations of the Energy Body, Soul and Spirit, in turn facilitating the reconnection with and realisation of inner abilities such as clairvoyance, which will in turn strengthen and become progressively more profound as time progresses. Children up to the age of five year s old or so having only relatively recently arrived back from the Spir it worlds and not having yet been fully indoctrinated into the material world of the five physical senses, still have very strong clai rvoyant connections to the Astral worlds and can still “see” beyond space and time. As mentioned earlier, very often children appear to their parents to be fantasising or playing with “imaginary friends ”; if only parents knew these friends are in fact very real indeed. Young children are still very much a part of the world of Fair ies, Gnomes, Mermaids and other"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 329 such delightful and very real beings of the Astral worlds. Clairvoyance, as naturally enjo yed by young children brings the ability see distant places, view things happening in those places in both the physical and Astral worlds , and even to see into the past, present and future; there really are no limits. Anyone can work towards activating the brow chakra, the third eye, and therefore clairvoyant abilities. First and foremost however must come a sincere and true Spiritual recognition, and the true determination and commitment to evol ve and progress. Without this level of recognition, commitment and sincerity, no true progress can or will be made. As with all inner and Spiritua l exercises an adequate state of relaxation is first of all requir ed within a location where you know you will not be disturbed. A comfortable chair or recliner is ideal, providing you will not be prone to falling asleep. For this reason, lying on or in a bed is not adv isable unless supported in a semi- upright position by pillows for example. When firmly settled and completely comfortable, spend a few minutes becoming as deeply relaxed as possible. The next section of this book provides full detai ls on achieving a state of deep physical relaxation, absolutely ideal for these exercises. Next, in order to increase your st ate or relaxation, perform rhythmic breathing for a few minutes. Breathe in slowly through your nose to a count of five, hold your breath fo r a slow count of five and then breathe out slowly through your mout h for a further count of five while imagining all tension l eaving with your breath. These procedures will slow down your brai nwaves to a more receptive level and deepen relaxation. Next, close your eyes and focus on the area of your third eye which is located between your eyebrows; to do this effectively you will need to focus your physical eyes upw ards and inwards as if going slightly cross-eyed. At first this might seem somewhat"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 330 uncomfortable and might even cause tension or a slight ache, but these will pass with continuous practi ce. Maintain your full attention at the position of your third eye and do not to allo w any thoughts to enter your Mind; your entire attention should be entirely focussed on the area of your third eye and viewed behind your closed eyelids. Continue to concentrate as much as you possibly can and watch for anything appearing within your fi eld of focus. You might for example start to see colours, shapes, symbols, or even images. Continue with this ex ercise for at least ten minutes, the longer the better, thirty minutes being a useful time to practice this each day. When you wish to conclude the sessi on, slowly bring yourself back to your normal waking awareness. Once you are fully aware, immediately write down everythi ng you saw while focussing on the third eye, no matter how insignifi cant it might seem. Keeping a notebook or journal spec ifically for these exercises is very important. Make these exercises a daily habi t; the more often these exercises are practiced the sooner results c an arrive, continuity being very important. Should you not see or per ceive anything at all for the first few sessions please do not be concer ned; it might well take some people many weeks or even months to penetrate the veil between the physical and Astral worlds, a ve il that has become ever thicker and less accessible due to the exclusive use of the physical senses. Consider these exercises as like the peeling away of those the physical layers that hav e been added over the y ears until finally all layers have been peeled away revealing the glories of the Astral worlds. Patience and perseverance are extremely important as is the case with the gaining of all wo rthwhile inner abilities. This third eye activation exercise may also be combined with meditation by practicing these exercises at the end of a meditation session where you will still be very relaxed and your Mind quiet and highly"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 331 focussed. Having gained clairvoyance, constant use of this ability will be further enhanced over time by continued daily practice. In addition to clairvoyance ther e are the related abilities of “clairsentience” and “clairaudienc e”. Clairsentience is a more general ability involving the inner equivalent of the senses of smell or touch. Like all inner abilit ies clairsentience might appear spontaneously as a result of Spiritual progress or as a result of the practice of other abilities such as clairvoyance. For example you may suddenly sense a perfume, per haps of flowers, even though there are no such flowers physica lly present anywhere near you. Or you might suddenly feel something br ush past you or feel a tickling sensation on your face when there is apparently no-one else present. These are all examples are of clairsentience where impressions from the inner worlds are perceived in the form of smell or touch. Clairaudience is the ability to perce ive sounds originating from the inner spheres; sounds not detect able by the physical ears. These sounds can vary dramatically rangi ng from random noises such as pops, whistles and knocking sounds, through to the full reception of other beings and situations within the inner worlds. Clairaudience is not related to the physical ears in any way, but is rather linked to the throat chakra. Beings residi ng in the inner wo rlds will often attempt to communicate directly with humans in this way, and as such this might be considered to be a form of channelling. However as with all communications from a completely unknown source, these should be approached wit h extreme caution. Clairvoyance is a rightful ability of all human beings. Like all such abilities however they should always be used for good and honourable purposes and in particular for your own genuine needs and ongoing development and to a ssist others whenever the need and opportunity arises. Never be tempted to use any inner ability against others in any way, or against their will otherwise there will most surely be a karmic price to pay, either in this life or a future life."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 332 Chapter 65: The Akashic Record Every single thought, every acti on and every event happening now, has ever happened, and ever will happen anyw here in the entire Universe in all dimensi ons of reality are inst antly “recorded” in the causal sphere of the Universe, o ften known in Eastern mysticism as the “Akasha”, another name for the Ether or The All, an aspect of the Universal multi-dimensional continuum that is God. This repository of Universal information is often known as the “Akashic Record”, or sometimes even conceptualised as the “Akashic Library”. On an individual level, the Akashic record holds every minute single detail of every single life of each and every person without exception. This information will when a person has progressed far enough along the path be made availabl e, at which time the full details of all lives will be revealed in perfect context. Although the Akashic record is frequently conceptualised as a vast library with shelves upon sh elves of record books, it exists in reality, as with everything else in the entir e Universe as pure Energy of the Ether. The Akashic record can be accessed by humans having the necessary psychic abilities, such people often discovering highly detailed information relating to past events going back over any number of years as measured in Ea rth time, and also even of future events. Very often prophets predicting the future are doing so by accessing the Akashic record and “viewing” details of such probable future events. One su ch famous person was Edgar Cayce, sometimes known as the “s leeping prophet”, who over the course of many years while in a state of deep trance channelled a considerable amount of inform ation on a very wide range of subjects in direct response to qu estions addressed to him by those present, much of which was recorded. It is quite probable that other famous prophets such as Nostradamus also obtained predictions of future events by directly a ccessing the Akashic record. There are several advanced psychics who can also obtain information and predictions directly from the Akashic record, some"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 333 of whom for example work with police forces in the search for missing people or to solve unsolv ed crimes. It should be pointed out once again however that not all people who claim to be psychics have this level of ability, but might well nevertheless claim the ability or to seek to impres s people simply by mentioning the Akashic record. As ever therefore before spending money or relying on any psychic for any purpose, whatsoever, always gain testimonials and evidence of their clai med abilities first; this vital but precaution simply cannot be stre ssed enough. Any genuine psychic would be pleased to produce such testimonials; any not pleased to do so or take offence at the requ est should be completely avoided. Genuine psychics, particularly thos e with the ability to access the Akashic record will usually be Sp iritual people who will therefore not be motivated by mere materialistic or commercial gain, indeed most genuine psychics will fully underst and the detrimental effects of such materialism and commercia lism and theref ore will most certainly not be motivated by mere money. It is quite possible that many cases of afterlife regression, clairvoyance, remote viewing and ot her forms of psychic access are also achieved by means of access to the Akashic record, although this might not always be the ca se. There are peop le however with advanced psychic abilitie s who can proactively access the Akashic record with such a high level of accuracy, the information they access, record and make availabl e has the potential to alter the course of science or even the wh ole of the planet such is its importance. These people are howe ver usually very secretive and understandably so, fearing the negat ive backlash, ridicule and cynicism they might be subjected to by science, religions and the materialistic world generally. The time is arriving however whereby access to the Akashic record will become fully accepted, and those with the abilities to do so will be respected for the service they provide for the benefit of mankind. "},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 334 Chapter 66: Astral Projection No longer is it adequat e, necessary or indeed desirable to rely solely on psychics or channel ed information for evidence of Spiritual realities. Over the last few decades in particular Astral Projection and “Out of Body Experiences”, often known simply as “OBE”, have become increasingly more important at all levels in pointing the way forward and ther eby reconnecting mankind with inner realities and destiny and purpos e in life. Astral Projection is also the best possible preparation for the next physical death, which of course everyone will experi ence sooner or later. “Death” is an event in the personal evolut ion of every person, and event experienced a multitude of time, that should never be feared, being the next stage of a joyous Spirit ual journey on the return to Our Creator, The Source, to God. Those who can Astral project from their physical body in order to explore the inner realms of rea lity, their next home, never fear “death”, knowing beyond any doubts whatsoever from first hand experience that in reality the finali ty of so called “death” really does not exist, and is in fact no more than a completely natural transition from the dense, low vibration of Energy of the dense physical world of matter, to a much higher En ergy vibration and correspondingly finer density of existence in the i nner worlds, the Astral and Spirit worlds. Again it should be mentioned at this stage that the Astral and Spiritual worlds are not actually “higher” relative to the physical world, but are in fact “inner” dimensions with The Source, Our Creator, God at the very centre of all creation at the very highest vibration of Energy. “Death” not only no longer holds any sort of fear for people who learn and engage in Astr al Projection but indeed the situation known as death usually becomes something to be embraced with excitement and anticipation when the time arrives, and with it a knowing beyond all doubt the true r eality of the life of peace, tranquillity and harmony awaiting beyond the confines of the physical world."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 335 In addition to Spiritual explor ation, meetings with deceased relatives and friends and for general information gathering, Astral Projection is also extremely us eful for many other valuable purposes including for example heal ing and manifest ation. Indeed an entire book could be written on the profound benefits of Astral Projection but by far the best way of discovering these profound realities is by direct experienc e. Those who experience Astral Projection and out of body experiences see and know the physical world for what it really is, a te mporal experience, and have a much more profound understandi ng of the true meaning of life, usually resulting in a complete re-eval uation and appraisal of individual priorities and direction. There is actually nothing at al l new about Astral Projection, even the most ancient cultures for ex ample the ancient Egyptians and many others were totally familiar with, and made maximum use of these completely natural abilities. Many cultures, for example the native American Shaman, still use Astral Projection extensively today for many purposes benefiting their people. There are many references, albeit in symbolic form to Astral Projection in the books and bibles of the popular world religions. Highly advanced, no longer visi ble ancient civilisations of thousands of years ago used Astr al Projection extensively to manifest things required on Eart h. Even very earliest humans of hundreds of thousands of years ago at the very dawn of civilisation were capable of Astral Projection, very often practiced by the tribe shaman or “medicine man”. Indeed, the entire tribe would often participate in the Astral Projec tion process by drumming and other methods and rituals designed to in voke the required altered state for Astral Projection. It is now thought the paintings found on the walls of caves around the world, many of which are very similar indeed despite the vast distances separating them across entire continents, are actually pictures depicting ex periences of Astral travel, and more importantly such depictions relate important information bought back from the Astral worlds by the shaman for"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 336 the benefit of the tribe. However, as with so many inner abilities such as clairvoyance, mankind has la rgely lost the instinctive ability to Astral project due largely to the millennia of ongoing creed, dogma and materialism. So what exactly is Astral Projection? First of all it is most important to keep in Mind that Astral Proj ection is an extremely normal and natural ability of all human beings. Every time we achieve a certain stage of sleep the Energy and Astr al bodies are automatically projected out of phase with the physi cal body, often associated with rapid eye movement, abbreviated to “REM”, signifying the onset of a type of low level Astral Projec tion. Most people wh o are untrained in remembering dreams and sleep activities will have no recollection of this process. The projection of the Astral Body during sleep and the various modes of dreaming and of their implications will be discussed in detail later in this book, but for now however suffice it to say that Astral Projection is a completely natural human process, as natural in fact as sleep itself. The main difference between Astral Projection during sleep and Astral Projection in the usual meaning of the term is in the latter case the process is carried out with full conscious awareness and control. Rather than both Mind and body being in the sleep state, with Astral Projection the body is in the sleep state but the Mind is fully awake, aware and in conscious control over the entire process; th is then is the fundamental basis of all Astral Projection and Out of Body experiences. As discussed earlier, humans fundamentally comprise three distinct bodies; the physical body, the Astral Body and the Mental or Spirit body. There is also an intermediat e body effectively acting as an “interface” or “transformer” betw een the physical and Astral bodies, usually known as the Etheric or Energy Body. Under normal circumstances most people are only aware of the existence of their physical body, being entirely focu ssed on the five physical senses of sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch, through which the three dimensional world of matter is ex perienced. The inner much more"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 337 subtle bodies are always very much present however, albeit existing beyond the range of the per ception of the five physical senses. We are all multi-dimensional beings, concurrently occupying physical, Astral and Mental bod ies, even though most people are only aware of the physical body. Astr al Projection is the projection of Consciousness beyond the limitations of the five physical senses in order to assume awareness and c ontrol of the Astral Body with its own Astral senses, within the Astral planes. Astral Projection is not actually projecting to the As tral plane as such, because as humans we are already multi-dim ensional beings, continually and concurrently existing in the Astral and Spiritual worlds at an infinite number of levels of En ergy. Where we perceive ourselves to “be” at any time is determined by at what level of vibration of Energy our conscious awareness is focussed. As tral Projection is therefore a projection of Consciousness beyond the confines of the physical body, thus becoming consciously aware of the Astral worlds thereby assuming control over the Astral Body already residing there. The Astral worlds are very real indeed, seeming much more solid and real than the physical world, the physical world merely being a very pale projection of these inner or more specifically inner realities; an illusion that might seem very real, but is really only “real” in accordance with and as perpetuated by the restricted perception of the five mundane physica l senses existing exclusively to enable interaction with the physical world of matter. As previously noted, Eastern traditions often refer to the physical world of matter as “maya”, illusion. It s hould also be noted that although the Astral worlds appear to be much more solid, “real” and vibrant than the physical world, the Astral worlds have been and are still being created by the Minds of human beings in accordance with recent experiences within the physi cal world, and the Astral worlds are therefore in and of themselves not true reality, true reality being our true home as immortal Spiritual beings in the inner, inner world of Spirit. By comparison with the ph ysical world, the Astral worlds"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 338 are, at the mid to inner levels a much more pleasant place to be, with anything desired being instant ly created by the Mind without the need for money, work or any of the other trappings of a physical existence. Astral projectors, like those who have passed on after the experience known as “death” do not find themselves in some sort intangible “dream world” but rather experience a very solid, vibrant, intense environment where all senses seem greatly magnified. The senses involved of course are th e inner Astral senses and not the five mundane physical senses so much taken for granted in the physical world of matter. Thoughts can actually be seen to take shape instantly and anyt hing desired can be instantly manifested by means of the powers of the imagi nation in the very process of creation. This is also why the Astral worlds are known as the “desire worlds” and the Astral Body known as the “desire body”. Everyone dwelling at any particular level of the Astral planes exists at exactly the same level of Sp iritual evolution, vibration and density, and accordingly absolute peace and harmony prevails at the mid-Astral worlds and inner. Of course in the lower Astral worlds although everyone is also on the same level and of a like Mind, character and personality, thos e worlds reflecting the people living there can be anything but peaceful and harmonious, being a direct reflection of the dark lives of those people while living on Earth. In the peace and harmony of the mid to inner Astral worlds there is no money, no factories or offices, no formal work, no bosses and no formal leaders, everyone of thei r own freewill working together harmoniously as Spirit for common causes. People living within the Astral worlds still nevertheless reta in their materialistic perspective and earthly desires, the main reason they are still livin g there, and it is not until these desires have been completely recognised, satiated and purged, with material things seen for the illusions and barriers to progress they really are, c an further progress be made to the"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 339 inner vibrations and ever more b lissful conditions of the upper Astral and Mental worlds. It is these human characteristics of the mid-Astral residents that causes the mid-Astral worlds where many Astral projectors find themselves to be very similar in deed in appearance to Earth, so similar in fact that after the transition known as “death” many people do not immediately become aware of the fact they have “passed on”. Similar houses, cars, trains, gardens, leisure, entertainment and many other typi cal Earthly characteristics all created by the desires human Mind ov er aeons of time, often as an extension of their previous mate rial lives on Earth, all being represented within the Astral worlds . The Astral worlds were not therefore created for humans, but ra ther by humans as a reflection of what they believe life at that level should repres ent. This applies to all levels and realms of the As tral worlds, and indeed the Astral worlds of the beings of other planets are similarly created according to their own particular worlds, environments and perceptions. Everyone upon passing over to the Astral worlds after physical death will be attracted to the pr ecise degree of vibration and density of their own Astral body, character, beliefs, perceptions and level of Spiritual development. It is very important to remember however that all of these worlds, pas t, present and future, still exist concurrently within the Universal continuum of the Ether, The All, God. Unlike Earth however the As tral worlds contain everything from the past, present or even the future as relates to Earth time. This is one reason why the Astral worlds often seem so much like the physical world that some people who have passed on from Earth and why they oft en do not realise they have actually “died”, often taking quite some time before t hey can accept it. In addition to a familiar Earth-like environment and people, the Astral worlds are inhabited by numerous entities and beings who have never physically existed on Earth, including from the past and future of Earth, and some who will even origi nate from other planets in the physical Universe. "},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 340 Within the Astral worlds a c ause in the form of a thought will immediately result in a corresponding effect whether it is positive, neutral or negative. New residents and visitors very quickly learn this important principle. The Astr al projector should always know and understand these laws before pr ojecting otherwise it is very easy indeed to become caught up in undesirable situations that are in reality no more than the manifestation of his or her own Mind. For example if the Astral projector is afraid of meeti ng an “evil being” then he or she will up on projecting probably co me into contact with that very same evil being. The evil being will however be merely a projection of the imagi nation and accordingly not at all real but nevertheless seeming very real and terrifying for those unprepared for such situations. It is most important therefore within the Astral worlds for the projector to maintain a passive stat e of Mind at all times but with an air of mild curiosity. In this way everything will seem normal, and opportunities to explore and learn will rapidly present themselves quite naturally, very often by meeti ng other Astral residents or quite likely a guide. The guide might be a personal “Spirit guide” or one of numerous willing Astral guides who are only too willing and able to help all Astral projectors. At the final analysis however the best way to learn about the Astral pl anes and the Universal laws prevailing there is to actually go and gain experience at first hand; this is exactly what the advanced intelligences of the inner realms are endeavouring to bring about in this new era for mankind. There are many aspects of Astral Projection and the Astral worlds in general the projector will need to get used to very quickly indeed. Travel is instantaneous; it is simply a matter of thinking where you wish to go or who you wish to be with, and you will instantly find yourself there simply by focussing on the destination. Of course a projector needs to know where they wish to go in the first place and this is where an Astral guide c an be most useful. Meeting deceased relatives, friends and others is ve ry straightforward assuming they are still dwelling at the same or lower level of the Astral worlds. A person in a lower Astral world c annot however project to a person"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 341 in a inner Astral world due to the higher vibrations existing there, vibrations that cannot be tolera ted by an Astral body of lower vibrations. By simply thinking about the person, by visualising them and by desiring and creati ng the intent to be with them as if you are already there, you will instantly fi nd yourself in the presence of that person. All communication in the Astral worlds takes place by thought transfer, and is therefore inst antaneous. Such thought transfer can be basic telepathic communication to the exchange of entire packages of information in symbo lic form including imagery. There is no problem talking as on Earth with the “mouth” of your Astral Body if that is what you wish to do, and indeed new arrivals within the Astral might instinctivel y do, but nevertheless actual communication is still carried out te lepathically by words, images or symbols over any distance, and therefore speaking as with a physical mouth is superfluous. Many people newly arriving in the Astral worlds will quite understandably speak their mouth as a matter of habit, but this still results in telepathic communicati on nevertheless, and they quite soon realise that communication is by pure thought transference and will learn to use that m ode of communication. Although telepathic communication can be per formed a word or symbol at a time, it is much more efficient, as the people of the Astral worlds soon discover, to send entire “ packages” of thoughts which the recipient can absorb at will. Is Astral Projection safe? Yes, absolutely. No actual harm can come to an Astral projector. A question often asked is whether another being can enter and take over the physical body of a projector while the projector is st ill away from the physical body in the Astral worlds. The answer to this is quite simply this situation cannot occur any more than it can happen while experiencing normal nightly sleep projections. "},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 342 Another question often asked is whet her it is possible to get “stuck” in the Astral planes and not be abl e to return to the physical body. Again there is no danger of this situation occurring whatsoever. While still possessing a physical body a fine silver cord, the Astral matrix, maintains a permanent connection between the physical and Astral bodies, and this connection is only finally severed at the point of physical death. In order to return to the physical body it is only necessary to think about being ac tually there at that moment and it will happen instantly regardless of your Astr al situation at the time. There have been numerous methods for achieving Astral Projection used over the course of many t housands of years. Many methods taught in modern books and elsewhere require very considerable practice, discipline, willpower, pat ience, concentration, and very often even a high degree of natural ability; many of these methods are often for all practical pur poses beyond the scope of most people as many have already discovered. Many if not most of the met hods often described today are designed to initially result in wh at is commonly known an “Out of Body Experience” or “OBE”. The te rms Astral Projection and Out of Body Experiences, often abbreviated to “OBE”, are often confused or used interchangeably. In fact As tral Projection and OBE properly describe distinctly different situ ations. Astral Projection can be defined as a projection of Consci ousness beyond the confines of the five physical senses to assume control of the Astral Body, the Soul, which then becomes the pr inciple centre of conscious awareness and the vehicle of travel wh ile interacting with the Astral worlds. OBE can be best be defi ned as an “Etheric projection”, where the centre of Consciousne ss is projected away from the physical body to the Etheric Body, also known as the Energy Body. The Etheric or Energy Body is denser than the Astral Body with correspondingly lower vibrations. An OBE therefore takes place closer to the physical world. The Etheric plane is often referred to as the “real-time zone”, taking place close to the physical world of space and time rather than within the Astral realms beyond space"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 343 and time. Although an OBE, an Et heric projection appears to be taking place in the physical world itself, the environment experienced during an OBE is ac tually a dense reflection of the physical world within the Etheric plane, and accordingly has many characteristics of the As tral plane of which it is a lower vibration, higher density aspect, including, as most people quickly realise, sensitivity to thoughts. Thoughts can quickly cause what are often known as “reality fluctuations” where familiar surroundings and objects can suddenly appear, alter in appearance or even disappear completely. It is quite possible and indeed common to convert an initial OBE to a full Astral Projection simply by conscious ly raising the vibrations of the Etheric Body. This can be accomp lished by using the power of the Mind to form the definite intent to transition to the Astral, achieved for example by focussing on a particular Astral locale or a particular person residing within the Astral worl ds. An intent is then formed to be at that locale or with the per son, or by issuing a definite statement in the form of a command in the present tense, for example; “ I am now in the presence of my grandfather”, or, assuming you have an Astral locale you are already familiar with; “I am now at...and then the name of the locale”. Astral Projection and OBE methods like all inner abilities require long-term commitment and practice. It is no good approaching these things in a less than committed way or as some sort of novelty. Everyone can succeed with As tral Projection or OBE, but the Mindset for success must be absol ute, regardless of how long it takes. Likewise, the desire for Spiritual exploration must be absolute and most importantly for all the right reasons, reasons you will for example find in this b ook. Your Mind, and in particular subconscious Mind should be so programmed to succeed with Astral Projection and O BE that it becomes an integral part of your psyche. The more you desire to experience these abilities the more likely you are to succeed, and the sooner you are likely to succeed. "},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 344 As with most abilities, regular and dedicated practice makes perfect; it is not good enough to si mply practice for just a few minutes for a few nights and give up if there is no success; like most things, success will come to those who persevere. Therefore before embarking on these important objectives, take time to make a full intellectual and emoti onal commitment, together with the resolve to succeed. The profound ben efits for those who do so will more than justify such co mmitment and resolve, and the experiences will become increasi ngly more frequent and profound as time progresses.   "},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 345 Chapter 67: Three Astral Projection Methods Astral Projection Method 1: The Third Eye Focus As previously mentioned, there have been and still are numerous methods for achieving conscious As tral Projection, and ultimately the choice of method is det ermined by personal preference. However the following methods and their variations contain the major principles required for success, and which methods have enabled many people to succeed consistently with Astral Projection who might otherwise not have been able to do so at all. The following first three methods are oriented towards Astral Projection as opposed to OBE. These particular methods are sometimes also known as “phasing” as your conscious awareness is “phased” away from the sphere of the five physical senses of the Earthly body to assume conscious awareness and control over the inner Astral senses of the Astral Body within the Astral planes. All successful methods of Astral Projection require the projection of Consciousness away from the ph ysical body and senses. One of the most fundamental aspects of achi eving this is to first attain a state often known as “Mind awake, body asleep”. In this state the physical body is fully asleep just as it would be during your usual night-time sleep, but the Mind re mains fully conscious and aware just as it would be normally during daytime waking hours. The Mind awake, body asleep stat e therefore involves focussing your attention fully away from the five senses of your physical body until your physical body quite litera lly goes to sleep by itself while your Mind remains fully awake. The Mind awake, body asleep state can be accomplished at any time with sufficient abilities of concentration and relaxation, the methods of which will be discussed in the next section of this book. Such abilities do however require time and practi ce, although all such time and practice is very well spent. "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 346 There are fortunately very much quicker and easier ways of achieving the Mind awake, body asleep state without the need to formally practice to the same extent. This is fundamentally achieved by making use of this st ate as it naturally occurs during sleep cycles, for example after awak ing from your normal night’s sleep a couple of hours earlier t han usual. When you first awaken from the sleep state, including even a daytime nap, your body is normally in an extremely relaxed state while your Mind starts to awaken to a state of daytime conscious awareness rapidly. The basis of this Astral Projection me thod therefore is to maintain and deepen this already physically relaxed state until such time as your body goes back to sleep to continue its normal sleep cycle while at the same time focusing your Mi nd to keep it fully alert and conscious. It is quite possible to achieve th e required Mind awake, body asleep state after going to bed at night and before sleep by allowing your body to fully relax and go to sleep while main taining full conscious awareness. If you can allow your body to fully relax into sleep while maintaining your Mind in a fully conscious state, you will become aware of the projection process t hat automatically occurs during normal sleep and can then assume fu ll control over the projection process and subsequent activities. Before we commence with a full Astral Projection method we should again address the common c oncerns that might arise as a thought in the Mind thus preventi ng successful Astral Projection to take place. It is simply not possible to become lost in the Astral planes or not be able to return to your own physical body. While Astral projecting your Astral body is always connected to your physical body by means of a fine, often invisible thread, often known as the “silver cord”. If visible this thread looks exactly like a silver cord, but one that can expand infinitely. The silver cord, which is actually the Astral matrix as discussed earlier in this book may be likened to an umbilical cord connecting your Astral Body, or more specifically your integrated, c onjoined Astral and Mental bodies, your Soul and Spirit to your ph ysical body. This maintains a vital"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 347 link that simply cannot be severed during Astral Projection. Likewise, another entity cannot po sses your physical body while you are in the Astral planes. We are all multi-dimensional beings, and although travelling in the Astr al Body where your conscious awareness is located, you are still also concurrently occupying your physical body, albeit beyond the reach of the five physical senses. So again, please do not worry at a ll about not being able to return to your physical body or of it being possessed by another entity; such fears are unfounded and will almost certainly prevent successful Astral Projection. I fo r one am not aware of any cases whatsoever where any these si tuations have occurred. Moving on to this first Astral Projection method: commence by setting your alarm clock to awak en you at least two hours before your normal waking time. A very good time to awaken for this is around 04:00am. This method involves allowing your physical body to go back to sleep while your con scious Mind remains fully awake. As soon as you awaken start th is procedure immediately; do not be tempted to roll over and go back to sleep again. Lie flat on your back and maintain the extremel y relaxed feeling you enjoyed immediately upon waking. Next, immediately focus your full attention on the area directly be tween your eyebrows. This area corresponds with a major centre of the subtle Energy Body known as the “brow chakra” or “third eye” as discussed earlier. To accomplish this you will need to force your focus upwards and then move your eyes inwards in order to focus exactly on the area between your eyebrows as if you are going slightly cross-eyed. Some people might find this to be ve ry straightforward, while others might find it somewhat of a strain at first. The strain will soon settle down however with practice. Next, while maintaining your focus between your eyes, become fully aware of the entire area of the top of your head; this is known as the area of the “crown chakra”. Finally, again wh ile keeping your attention firmly on your third eye, also become aware of the region of your upper chest; this is the “hear t chakra”. It is not necessary to"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 348 focus on your crown and heart c harkas, but only to maintain awareness of them. Your point of focus should be on you brow chakra, your third eye located bet ween your eyebrows. Please do not worry to begin with if you ha ve trouble maintaining awareness of your crown and heart chakras at fi rst; it is most important of all to maintain concentration and focus on your third eye, your brow chakra. While focussing on your third eye remain fully relaxed and empty your Mind completely of all thoughts. It is most important to maintain your physical body in a state of complete stillness and total relaxation throughout. It is also most important to remain flat on your back; do not roll over on to your side or any other position other than flat on your back. This might seem like a difficult process at first, but if you remember to do this from the outset as soon as you awaken, you will s oon be able to preven t your normal mundane waking thought processes from starting. If a thought does enter your head, for example, “what shall I have for breakfast today?”, or “am I still totally relaxed”, or “can I still sense my physical body”, simply acknowledge the presence of the thought and al low it to drift through your Mind without giving it any further consideration whatsoever. Do not fight such thoughts or become upset by them otherwise your concentration and relaxed state will be broken, and you will have to either start t he process again or leave it until another day. Again however, the benefit of waking two hours early in the morning is to achieve and maintain the necessary state of deep physical relaxation while not a llowing thoughts to even start to enter your Consciousness. While maintaining your attention firmly on your third eye and with your conscious awareness of yo ur crown and heart chakra’s, all while keeping your Mind totally cl ear of thoughts, begin to breath rhythmically through your nose. Slowly and deeply breath in through your nose to a slow count of five, hold your breath for a further slow count of five, exhale through your nose for a further slow count of five, and then rela x your breathing for a final slow count of five. Repeat this breathi ng process five times initially."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 349 Having completed this initial breathing exercise while still maintaining your full attention on your third eye, maintaining awareness of your crown and hear t chakras and emptiness of Mind, imagine with as much feeling as you possible can that you are a feather falling very gently fr om a great height. Feel yourself drifting very slowly and peacefully downwards while enjoying the lightness, floating and drifting f eeling immensely. Should your attention drift away from being the feather, repeat the breathing exercises and then start drifting as a feather once agai n. This might all seem like a lot to remember at first, but it is really a fully integrated process, and very soon you will not even have to think about it. As you become more proficient with this stage of the process you can modify it to suit the best method for you; the main objective is to achieve that all important Mind awak e, body asleep state. As this procedure progresses you s hould feel your body maintains a state of deep physical relaxati on and soon starts to feel progressively heavier as if sinking right into your bed. You might also feel a very pleasant wave of warmth sweep ing through your body as this process progresses. It is still very important to maintain complete concentration on the third eye area between your eyebrows without wavering, and if possible to maintain awareness of your crown and heart chakras, all, most importantly while maintaining your Mind empty of thoughts. Soon you should completely lose all sensation of your physical body to the extent you forget about it altogether. You should however never be tempted to ask your self whether you can still feel your body, as this will break your concentration; just know beyond any doubts in your own Mind that you cannot feel your physical body and that the process is ther efore progressing very well. Once again it must be stressed that this Mind awake, body asleep state is absolutely fundamental in order to achieve success with almost any method of Astral Projection. It can take anywhere between five minutes to an hour or more to reach this state, so please do not"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 350 hurry it; the time taken to achieve this fundamental Astral Projection state will reduce with practice, and in particular with success. You must proceed in a calm, relax ed and controlled way, always knowing beyond any doubt you have already succeeded. If after one hour you have still not been able to achieve the required Mind awake, body asleep state then it is best to simply accept the time as valuable practice and to continue aga in another day. Everyone can potentially achieve this natural state, it simply like most worthwhile things requi res genuine commitment and practice. As previously mentioned, by com parison to most other Astral Projection methods this procedure is very much more straightforward and easier to accomplish due to being an extension of the normal sleep process. Be absolutely honest with yourself at all times; if you are still aware of your physical body or cannot maintain the focus on your third eye area, or can prevent thoughts from entering your C onsciousness, then do not continue with that particular session, there is al ways another day, and of course practice makes perfect. Having successfully achieved the Mind awake, body asleep state it is very important indeed to maintain it; it will not be long before the Astral Projection process natural ly commences. Do not allow any thoughts to linger in your Mind and do not ask questions of yourself, such as, “have I achieved the Mind awake, body asleep state yet”. When you have reached this state you will know beyond any doubt. You will have no feeling of yo ur physical body and will probably start to see swirling colours, like clouds, drifting across your field of inner vision. This is known as “hypnagogic imagery” and is an extremely good indication you have achieved an impo rtant state for the next stage of this method. It is now very important to maintain this entire state without breaking your concentra tion. Again, do not worry, it will come sooner or la ter with practice; people have achieved success at the first attempt but others might take weeks to accomplish this. "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 351 The hypnagogic imagery will soon become more and more intense and might begin to form more recogni sable shapes such as scenes, or sometimes symbols. These are ac tually visions of the Astral worlds, and you should welcome t hem knowing you are very close indeed to fully projecting. You might also start to hear noises such as hissing, popping or other strange noises, but again please do not worry; these are only the audi ble equivalent of the imagery originating in the Astral worlds. Another very common experience is seeing your surroundings through your closed eyelids. If you experience this state it is a very good sign indeed that the projection process has commenced. Your physical body will be asleep and your Etheric body wi ll have moved out of phase with your physical body, and you will be viewing your surrounding with your Etheric sight rather than your physical eyesight. In fact what you are viewing is not your act ual physical surroundings but rather a very similar Etheric reflection of it. One of several possibilities mi ght present themselves having reached this important stage; y ou might suddenly find yourself travelling towards the imagery at great speed, and very soon afterwards find yourself suddenl y completely within the Astral worlds. Another possibility is t hat the imagery might suddenly take on the appearance of a “televisi on screen” where you can plainly view a part of the Astral planes and everything occurring there as if watching it on TV. If this happens, imagine yourself as intensely and realistically as possible that you are moving towards the screen and as it gets larger and larger the scenery becomes more and more vivid. Once you reach the screen imagine yourself passing right through it and completely into the scenery you were previously observing; you should then find your self fully in the part of the Astral plane you were viewing within the screen. Yet another possibility is that you see “tunnel” type structures appearing in your Minds eye. If this happens simply imagine yourself moving towards and into one of the tunnels and very soon you should be transported to the Astral planes at high speed arriving after what might well ha ve been a most exhilarating ride."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 352 These are the most common sit uations encountered during this stage of the Astral Projection proc ess just before projecting to and arriving within the Astral planes. You might well find an alternative scenario presents itself, in which case simply relax and go along with it without questioning it in your Mind; no two people’s experiences are exactly the same. There is another possibility you might encounter while practicing Astral Projection; the sudden onset of what appears to be rapid and often very dramatic vibrations . These vibrations might feel localised, often around the top of your head, or might spread throughout your body. It is also quite possible for some or all of your Etheric body to suddenly start “floating” out of your physical body. If this happens you have the possibility of converting to an “Out of Body Experience” or “OBE”, which is dealt with in much more detail later in this section. If you wish to continue with your Astral Projection experience rather than converting it to an OBE you mu st remain totally calm, relaxed and passive as the vibrations are o ccurring. This might seem to be much easier said than done as the vibrations can often seem very dramatic although always totally safe. Simply allow the vibrations to wash over you as if you were bathing in them, and soon enough they should dissipate at which poin t you might well find yourself in the Astral world and you will have succeeded with your Astral Projection. The vibrations might however actually become a full OBE situation where you simply float right out of your body. If this occurs you can to proceed with the procedure as detailed for an OBE, later in this section. While practicing this Astral Pr ojection procedure there is also another state you might encounter; that of “three dimensional blackness”. This will appear in your Minds eye as an area of blackness encompassing your entire field of inner vision. However, unlike seeing blackness with your physical eyes behind your eyelids, which might seem flat an d two dimensional, this blackness"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 353 will appear to have thr ee dimensions, and feel much more solid and real. This three dimensional bla ckness is still located within the area of Energy associated with the Astral planes, but is rather in fact an intermediate state usually experienced before fully transitioning to the Astral planes. One approach to this situation is to use your imagination as intensively as possible to create a large, brightly coloured door in the blackness with the wording “To the Astral Planes” written on the door in large letters. This symbolises a portal into the Astral planes through which you will travel. It is very important that the door is made as solid and real in your imagination as possible before passing through it; the best way to determine if the door is ready to open is to imagine yourself knocki ng on it, or imagine yourself throwing pebbles at it. If when you knock on the door with your imaginary hand, or when the pebbles hit the door the sound seems muffled, wait while intensifyi ng and deepening the experience and then with your imagination knock on the door or throw the pebbles again. This time it might seem louder and clearer. Continue with this process until k nocking on the Astral door or the impact of the pebbles sound every bit as real as the sound you would hear in the physical wo rld. When this happens imagine yourself opening the door and wa lking right through it. While imagining yourself doing this you should not see yourself in the third person as if observing yourse lf walking through the door, but rather actually imagine yourself in the first person within your Astral body walking through the door, at which point you should then find yourself in the Astral world. It is most important to maintain total concentration, relaxation and focus throughout all of these scenar ios. If you allow your Mind to wander or start to think of ph ysical, mundane things you will find yourself returned immediately back to the world of your physical senses. Should this happen it is best to resume the practice another day. "},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 354 If the Astral door method does not work for you for moving beyond the area of three-dimensional bla ckness there is another method of progressing to the Astral pl anes but which requires more concentration. This involves the “p lacing of intent”. While in the three-dimensional blackness form a st rong intent to travel to the Astral worlds with as much concentration as you can possibly muster. Similarly, if you wish to vi sit a certain place or person within the Astral worlds you must place a strong intent, imagining yourself with as much clarity as possibl e, and in the present tense to actually be in the presence of th at person or place already. Having formed your intent you should either find yourself suddenly travelling at great speed, soon fi nding yourself at your Astral destination. Sometimes a “portal” might appear in the form of a tunnel, area of colour or other symbol through wh ich you should imagine yourself passing. Should the placing of int ent not work first time, place a strong mental request for the presence of a guide. If you then perceive the presence of a guide you can state your request or intention, and the guide will assist you with wherever you wish to travel to. If you do not know wher e you wish to go, then simply ask the guide to be taken somewhere in teresting, or to a place where you can learn valuable lessons for your Spiritual progression. Should none of these procedures succe ed it is highly advisable to terminate the session knowing you at least made excellent progress, that the practice was most valuable, and then to resume another day. It is most important never to feel discouraged. The benefits of achieving Astral Proj ection are really profound; each time you practice will bring you a stage nearer your objectives, and is extremely well worth the time and effort committed. Each practice will impress on your subconsciou s Mind your absolute desire to accomplish Astral Projection, and it is for the subconscious Mind to assist and facilitate this objective. Do not forget to record everything, successes or otherwise in your notebook, journal or diary as soon as you can after your experience has ended. If you delay in doing this, even for a few minutes, you"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 355 might well start to forget import ant and valuable details of your experiences. When arriving in the Astral you shoul d again remind yourself this is a “Mind world” where everything y ou think or imagine can, and usually does become an instant r eality. If you are apprehensive for example, or worse imagine there are evil beings nearby, you will soon meet such beings even though they are not in fact real; they would in fact be a product of your own imagination. For this reason, you should always maintain an air of passive curiosity and never over-react to your surroundings. It is useful to remember that everyone on the level of the Astral to which you have projected has a very similar personality and level of evolution as yourself. If anything happens that scares you or makes you feel uncomfortable it will almost always by a product of your own Mind. Mental and emotional control is therefore most important, while always maintaining a position of mild curiosity. Should you be presented with a si tuation you feel you simply cannot handle it is best to conclude that particular Astral journey by willing yourself back in to your physical body. If this happens resolve to yourself next time you will remain in complete mental control. As previously mentioned, a very good idea once in the Astral is to immediately mentally request the presence of a guide. At least one guide should appear who will not onl y show you around or take you to wherever you wish to go within the Astral Planes, but the presence of a guide will also help you keep your emotions under control. If you wish to meet with a deceased person such as a previously passed over relative, simply form an image of the person in your Mind, mentally imagining yourself to already be in their presence. You can also include the thought “I am now in the presence of.....” and state the name of the person. Again, as always, this imagination must always be in the present tense; in the Astral and inner worlds there is no space or time everything happening in the Eternal Now. The person should very soon appear before you, or alternatively you wil l find yourself instantly in the presence of the person wherever they are."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 356 After several visits to the Astral an extremely worthwhile activity which many people become involved in is a process known as “Soul retrieval”. There are many guides and other beings in the Astral worlds specialising in th e retrieval of Souls who have for some reason become trapped in either a lower part of the Astral where they do not rightfully belo ng, for example a belief system territory, or are very often trapped very close to the physical world and are often seen or perceived as a “ghost”. We have already discussed ghosts earlier in this book, but suffice it to say once again that these unfor tunate people become stuck for many and varied reasons and are often too relu ctant or too scared to leave of their own accord for their rightful place in the Astral worlds. For some reason, trapped Souls very often respond much more favourably to people who are still physically alive on Earth but travelling within the Astral Body. Fo r this reason people in the Astral planes involved in the process of S oul retrievals often very much welcome the assistance of an Astral traveller. Each Soul retrieval is usually different but equally important. It should be noted however that some Souls become stuck close to the physical world due to horrendous circumstances surrounding their physical death, circumst ances they have either become trapped within or keep reliving over and over again. Again, as no space or time exists beyond the physical world, a ghost is simply repeating a series of actions wit hin the Eternal Now and without concept of the space or time relati ve only to the physical world. You should be prepared for this eventualit y and allow your guide to take the lead. A Soul retrieval broadly consists of gently convincing the trapped Soul that they are in th e wrong place, and that you are there to help them to their rightfu l home. While doing this mentally project thoughts of reassurance, Unconditional Love and other positive emotions. When the trapped person agrees to leave their current circumstances, they can t hen be guided to the level of the Astral worlds to which they rightfully belong. "},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 357 When you wish to conclude a journey to the Astral all you need to do is to place the intent to be back in your physical body and you will arrive there almost instantly . Having arrived back in your physical body, always add detailed records in your Astral notebook, recording every possible detail. Although to begin with this method is best performed after awaking early in the morning, it is also quite possible to Astral project by means of this phasing method at any time of the day at all. Just after retiring to bed at night is a particularly popular time, the main problem being there is a much higher likelihood of falling asleep before the process is complete, in other words the Mind going to sleep before the physical body. Performing this procedure during the daytime from a fully waking state requires the development of high-level deep physical relaxation and concentration abilities as will be discussed in the next section of this book. After learning such abilities you will be able to achieve the Mind awake, body asleep state at almost any time at will without awaking from a sleep cycle first, and by using this method you will be able to Astral project almost any time at will. The only difference between practi cing this method after early morning waking and during the day t herefore is with the latter deep physical relaxation must first be in voked by means of concentration and other methods rather than rely ing on the immediate waking state. This method can also be attempted, often quite successfully after a daytime nap where again your body will already be very relaxed, thus making it much easier to in voke the same Mind awake, body asleep state as with early morning wa king. In this situation start the method as soon as you awake after your nap and do ensure you remain totally relaxed, maintaining the “just awakened” state of deep physical relaxation before pr oceeding with the rest of the method, just as for the early morning waking method. "},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 358 Astral Projection Method 2: Creative Visualisation This is a very effective variation to the “Third Eye” method, and one which can often result in a much mo re rapid transition to the Astral planes. This method might also prov e to be effective should you not have succeeded with the first method. This again has proved to be a highly successful Astral Projection method, and one that can be selected as a complete alternative to the “Third Eye” method if desired. It can also be used if you feel unable to maintain the necessary focus on your third eye, while keeping your Mind clear of thoughts. Although this method is based upon the use of the imagination, it also involves the use of all the inner senses for maximum effect. We should note straightaway, as we will see later in this book, imagination should never be confused with mere “fantasy” or a simply a “figment” of the imagina tion” but rather as an extremely important and most powerful human ab ility. In this case imagination is your key to the Astral worlds. Development of the powers of imagination, including visualisation abilities, will be discussed in more detail later in this book, but suffice it to say for now that well developed powers of imagination are a tremendous advantage in the practice of both Astral Proj ection and OBE as well as many other valuable abilities. This Astral Projection method s hould as with the first method be once again ideally performed immediat ely after awaking a couple of hours earlier than usual, or alternat ively at night-time just before sleep. If night time is chosen the same caution applies as with the first method; there is much more chance of simply drifting off to sleep before the Astral Projecti on method has been accomplished; early morning is therefore much more preferable. This method can also be performed immediately after awaking from a daytime nap or after invoking the required state of deep physical relaxation at any other time during the day. "},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 359 To proceed with this method, begin by focussing your attention on your third eye, brow chakra, but rather than keeping your Mind totally empty of all thoughts as wit h the first, “Third Eye” method, this time use all of your power s of imagination to create, as realistically or vividly as possible a scene of your choice, such as a park, a beach, your garden or indeed anything else you feel is familiar, appropriate or attracti ve to you. The more engaging the scene is the more effective this method will be, so a place that where you really enjoy being such as a favourite place in the countryside, your garden, the house of a close relative would be ideal for this method. The scene does not have to be one you are familiar with, it can be one creat ed by your imagination, and place that really excites you and you woul d love to be. Whatever location you choose must hold you attention and generate the same emotions such as excitement, relaxation and anticipation as actually being there in person. Imagine yourself totally immersed in , and becoming an integral part of that scene with complete realism, knowing yourself to actually be there already. Again this must be performed in the first person so you actually know beyond any doubt that you really are a part of your scene. Continue by making your chosen scene and your involvement within it as real and as vivid as you possibly can within your Mind, to such an extent in fa ct that you feel and know beyond any doubts whatsoever that you are actually already an integral part of the scenario. Use all of your senses to the maximum extent; smell the freshness of the air and the scent of the nearby flowers, feel the warmth of the sun and the firmness of the ground beneath your feet. Hear the birds singing cheerfully, taste that cooling drink you are casually sipping as you f eel the cooling breeze against your face as it whispers through the trees. Maintain this entire scenario in your Mind with all of your powers of concentration fully engaged whil e maintaining your deeply physically relaxed state. Soon you will find your scene assumes a life of its own, and ra ther than having to use your imagination to create the scenario it now seems to unfold before you as you"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 360 become more and more a part of it. Continue this involvement with your scene, following its course and allowing it to unfold while maintaining an air of passive anticipation. When you reach this stage, you will have successfully made the transition to the Astral world. Ev erything occurring will no longer be a creation of your imagination but ra ther a very real Astral locale. Remember to stay completely ca lm and assume an air of being a passive but curious observer while waiting to see what transpires next. You can at this stage also assume full control over your situation. You might for example desire to meet a deceased person; if so, simply visualise the person as if they are already in your presence while forming the desire and intent to be with them. The person might appear in your presenc e or you might be transported to wherever they are. If you wish to visit another part of the Astral worlds you are already familiar wit h, simply imagine you are already there, again always in t he present tense, and you will find yourself transported there instantly. During your first few vi sits to the Astral wo rlds, as suggested with the “Third Eye” projection method, you might be well advised to mentally request the presence and a ssistance of a guide, and if one appears request to be taken to areas of particular interest and benefit to you. Remember the charac teristics of the Astral worlds, most importantly that they are Mi nd worlds where you can create at will and your thoughts inst antly become reality, and you will be able to gain experiences far beyond the remotest comprehension of people still entirely focussed within the material, phy sical world of the planet Earth. The use of imagery in this way as a route to Astral Projection can be a very powerful catalyst in deed, and even imagining a static object such as a candle or a fruit can help to focus the Mind away from the five physical senses an d towards the Astral plane, while invoking the all import ant Mind awake, body asleep state. Any image or scene you personally find absorbing for any reason whatsoever can be effectively used for this technique, the more"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 361 absorbing, interesting and attractive to you the better. The scene used for this method does not have to be one that you are familiar with, it can be any scene that c an hold your full imagination, to focus your attention as far away as possible from your physical senses. Astral Projection, and in particular this highly effective and proven method is all about proj ecting your conscious awareness away from the five physical senses, a proce ss also known as “phasing”. You are quite literally limited only by y our imagination, which in itself has no limits being a basis of all creation. When you Astral project you will very soon discover not only does your Mind by means of the powers of imagination shape your rea lity in the inner worlds, but so to does it in the physical world, t he only difference being to manifest into the physical world, being of a much higher density and of much lower vibration often takes longer to achieve. These extremely important matters are discussed late r in this book when we discuss the truth of how we all create our own reality. Astral Projection Method 3: Communion with the “Deceased” Unlike the first two methods this method is not Astr al Projection by the usual definition, but nevertheless shares many characteristics with it. This technique has proven to be extremely effective in enabling many people from all walks of life to communicate directly with deceased relatives and friends, and to gather irrefutable proof of the continuity of life a fter physical death without the need to commit to a full Astral Projection method. People using this procedure hav e been able to meet with deceased relatives now residing in the Astr al worlds returning with information only those people could possibly have known. This method might appeal to those who do not feel ready for full Astr al exploration, or who are unable to commit the necessary time and effort, but nevertheless wish to prove bey ond any doubt the truth of the continuity of life after the death of the physical body without having to rely on the services of a medium, psychic or clairvoyant."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 362 Other people might simply wish to reunite with deceased loved ones or friends and to be assured they really are fine and very happy in their Astral home. One of the biggest advantages with this method is the possibility of comm unicating directly with deceased people without having to rely upon t he services of a psychic of unknown abilities. Making contac t with a deceased loved one through a psychic medium will always leave room for doubt, however, meeting and communicati ng a deceased relative person to person within the Astral worlds, and returning with irrefutable first-hand proof will provide evidence beyond any doubt whatsoever. Such meetings also provide conclusive proof of the continuity of life after the death of the physical body, thus confirming the truth that we are all immortal Spiritual beings, and that “death” is merely an illusion and a superstition that simply does not exist in reality, death being merely a natu ral transition from the low vibration and densit y of the physical world to the higher vibration and much lower density of the Astral worlds, sometimes known as “the afterlife”, “the beyond” or even “heaven”. As we will see however, the Astral worlds are not the true “heaven worlds”, but rather another step along the pat h towards out true home in the Spirit worlds that truly are the glories of Heaven. This method might not, initially at least, result in such a vivid interaction with the Astral worlds as with full Astral Projection, and indeed most certainly is not inte nded to do so. Nevertheless, the quality of the Astral experiences will steadily increase with practice, and even from the very first su ccess the experience should be unquestionably real. Many who mi ght commence with this method having already conclusively proved to themselves the reality of the inner worlds, might then wish to progr ess to a full Astral Projection method. The most important objective of this method therefore is to meet with “deceased” people who have passed on to the Astral worlds, and to obtain irrefutable confirmation of their continued existence, happiness and well-being. "},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 363 This method once again relies principally on the immense powers of imagination which everyone, w hether they realise it or not possesses. Many people might well question their own ability to visualise effectively or indeed at all, but in reality everyone can visualise at least to some exte nt, and as with most abilities the more visualisation is practiced, the more success will be experienced. For example, close y our eyes for a moment, relax as much as possible and visualise in your Minds eye your own home, car, pet, a relative or indeed anyth ing or anyone else well-known to you. The image should come to Mind very quickly and easily. Now visualise something from your past such as a memorable scene or occasion. Now do the same again but this time add the feelings and emotions you associate with thes e people, animals and scenes with as much depth and emotion as y ou possibly can. Depth of feeling and emotion supports imagination in an extremely powerful and important way. You wil l very soon realise that you can indeed visualise and add emotion to any situation at wil l. As with all abilities practice makes perfect, and this most certainly also applies to imagination and visualisation, as we will see in the next section of this book. To commence with this procedure the first requirement is to sit or lie down comfortably in a place w here you will not be disturbed, and relax as much as you possibly can. If you already have a method by which to achieve deep physical relaxation then please do use it. For those who do not formally practi ce deep physical relaxation, the next section of this book will deal fu lly with this subject by providing a method by which a state of deep physical relaxation can be achieved. It is however most important not to attain such a relaxed state that you fall as leep; you merely need to be as relaxed and focussed as possible on your objectiv es. Here is the full method for communion with “deceased” people living in the Astral worlds: Stage 1: While sitting or lying down as comfortably as possible, but without the possibility of drifting off to sleep, gently breath in through your nose to a slow count of five, hold your breath for a further slow count of five, and t hen gently exhale to a final slow"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 364 count of five. Repeat this procedur e at least three times or until you feel deeply relaxed. Th is relaxation process is the first stage in shifting your focus away from your physical environment, and is very important for success. Stage 2: In your now relaxed state, imagine, by means of the most intense imagination you can possibl y summon, a pool of sparkling clean white Energy located a sm all distance beneath your feet. Start to gently inhale and “feel”, again by means of the imagination that this pure, sparkling white En ergy first enters your feet, and then steadily travels up through your ent ire body eventually reaching the top of your head. As this vibrant Energy travels up through your body feel how exhilarating, refreshing and relaxing it is. Now feel this vibrant Energy passing through the top of your head before drifting down as if it were a beautiful sparking white waterfall to re-join the pool of En ergy just below your feet. Repeat this process at least three times as vividly and with as much feeling and imagination as possible, each time with the Energy rising steadily up through your body and through the top of your head before gently falling back to the E nergy pool beneath you, in a beautiful sparkling shower of pure, white sparkling Energy. Stage 3: Next, again by means of t he most intense imagination you can summon, feel a large pool of the same pure, white, vibrant sparkling Energy located just above your head. As with stage 2 start to gently inhale and “feel” this exhilarating, refreshing, relaxing Energy start to drift gently downwards, passing first through the top of your head and slowly down th rough your body until it reaches your feet. Upon reaching your fee t, visualise and feel the Energy, again by means of your imagination, leave both feet and gently curve back upwards to rejoin the vi brant, while pool of Energy just above your head. Again, as with stage 2, r epeat this at least three times, but as many times as you feel is necessary to become completely energised, calm and relaxed. You will soon discover after practice how many times you need to repeat this pr ocess before progressing to the"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 365 next stage. It is most important to “feel” this Energy as intensively as you possibly can by means of your imagination, first as it travels down through your body and then as it travels up wards once again to the pool of Energy just above your head. After this stage of the process you should feel comple tely relaxed and energised. Stage 4: The placing of intent to vi sit someone. At his stage intent should be conveyed to your sub-conscious Mind to travel to the Astral worlds in order to meet someone residing there. This stage alone will not in and of itself result in a direct shift to the Astral world, but rather primes your sub-conscious so it does not place any barriers before the process, which can often otherwise happen. The placing of intent not only co nditions your sub-conscious Mind to accept the required Astral Pr ojection where it might otherwise attempt to block it, but also provides the int ent required to proceed to the final stage in the process. In practice theref ore, after stage three you will simply form a firm intent in your Mind to travel to the Astral worlds for your desired purpose, in this case to meet and communicate with a person residing there. Note: the next stage in this process is absolutely fundamental to success, and might well take so me practice before success is achieved. Please do not be disc ouraged, this stage requires summoning your very highest possible level of imagination, in particular visualisation, and again you will find these abilities progressively increase with regular practice. Eventually you should be able to simply form the firm intent to explore the “afterlife”, meet deceased relatives, guides and an yone or anything else you wish to do during your afterlife explorations . For your first journey however the Astral worlds will not be fami liar to you and you will not usually therefore be able to plac e the intent to visit a specific locale. You can however request the services of a guide who will be familiar with a very wide variety of locati ons that they will be more than willing to show you. The services of a guide are very useful indeed, especially when visiting the Astral worlds from the physical world for the first few times. "},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 366 Stage 5: Having formed the intent to visit a deceased relative, proceed as follows: With all of the powers of imagination you can summon, visualise a location you associate with a deceased person of your choice. The gar den of the home where the person used to live is ideal for example. If you do not have such a clear memory you can, as an alternativ e, create your own ideal scene such as a garden, a park or indeed anywhere else that takes your fancy, but it is most important to be able visualise the chosen location as vividly and realistically as possible, utilising the maximum extent of the powers of your imagination. Once the location is as clear in your Mind as possible, start to create an entire animated scenario for meeting the deceased relative involving all of your se nses as deeply, vividly and with as much emotion as possible. By emotion we mean positive emotions such as happiness, joy and anticipati on. It is extremely important to know in your own Mind, and beyond a ll doubt that this is the means by which the gateway to the Astral world is created and the meeting with the deceased relative subs equently accomplished. This will start out as a scenario created entir ely by the powers of your own imagination, but will gradually, or even suddenly switch to a dynamic scenario whereby everythi ng assumes a life of its own without any input from your imagination whatsoever; the scene will simply unfold before you. An ex ample of this scenario might progress something like this: You are sitting on a bench in your favourite park where your grandparents often used to accompany the family when you were very young. It is a very beautif ul, idyllic, warm summers day, the sun is shining brightly and the birds flitting about the skies and sitting in the trees while singing cheerfully, and a gentle, most welcome cooling breeze makes ri pples over the park pond where the water lilies are blooming and bobbing up and down on the shimmering water. The sweet scent of roses drifts across from the nearby rose garden and the trees ju st behind you look beautiful and green while rustling in the gentle breeze. In the distance you can"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 367 see and hear children playing joyf ully with their own friends and families. Note: Use all of the senses of y our imagination as intensively as possible to see, feel, hear, smell, touch and experience this scene as vividly as you possible can. You must feel as if you are actually an integral part of the scene beyond any doubt whatsoever in your Mind. Suddenly you see a figure walking towards you; it is your dear grandfather who passed away some years before. He ambles up to you and with a joyful look on his face and says, “hello John”, or whatever you wish your name to be, “how are you ke eping?” “I am fine” you reply, “why not take a seat and we can have a nice chat”. And your grandfather then sits down beside you. Imagine your grandfather just as you remem ber him when you were younger while continuing a conversation with him. Keep imagining both sides of the conversation for now. “Do you remember the fine times we all used to enjoy here?” asks grandfather. “Yes”, you respond, “we used to come here every week in the summer, and on really hot days I used to look forward to a nice cold ice cream”. Note: keep this two way conversation going for a time and you will find the answers from grandfather becoming increasingly more spont aneous and not originating from your imagination at a ll; when this happens you know you have established a connection with the r eal Astral presence of your grandfather, and your conscious aw areness has crossed from the physical world to the Astral world. The scene is very real because you have created it in the Astral by means of your imagination based upon a scene in the physica l world. This is a creative process whereby you are creating an Astral environment and then inviting your grandfather to meet you within that environment; the meeting is between your Astral bodies or Souls. Your perception of the locale might be different to how your grandfather perceives the local. Like everything, the locale is created from pure Energy, and how it is perceived depends entirely on how the Energy formation is"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 368 decoded and interpreted by the Astral senses. It is most important not to think about these things however, focussing entirely on maintaining the ongoing dialogue wit h grandfather. If you question the reality of the situation you will almost certainly lose the Astral connection and return to your physical level of awareness. Grandfather says, “your grandmot her and I used to come here before you were born, when your parents were about your age”. “What did you used to talk about” you ask? “We used to talk about many things”, said grandfather . “Your grandmother was always talking about her jewellery collec tion”. Note; by this time the answers from grandfather are bec oming increasingly spontaneous and require no input whatsoever from you. At this stage you should focus entirely on asking the questions and maintaining the dialogue. “What was in this jewelle ry collection”, you ask. “There were many beautiful pieces in the collection” says grandfather. “Your grandmothers favourite was a large brooch made from 22 carat gold, set with diamonds and with a large red ruby set in the middle; your own mother has that piece of jewellery now”. And so the conversation continues for quite some time until it is eventually time to part. You tell your grandf ather how much you have enjoyed your meeting before you both say cheery goodbye to each other until the next time you meet. You can then imagine walking home before gradually bringing your awareness back to your physical surroundings. Taking a few deep breaths, relax and reflect for just a moment on your meeting with your “deceased” relative. The next thing to do, most importantly, is to immediately write down the enti re experience in as much detail as possible in a notebook designated for the purpose. The large gold and diamond brooch with the ruby set in the middle as mentioned by your grandfather has your curiosity aroused and when you next see your mother you ask her about it. Your mother seems absolutely amaz ed, and asks you how you could possibly know about the brooch that is now a family heirloom, and is usually safely stored away out of sight. Your mother then goes upstairs and"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 369 brings down her jewellery box, lifts up the lid and takes out a brooch that is absolutely iden tical to the one described by grandfather; the rest of the collecti on that used to be owned by your grandmother is there too. What has transpired can be summarised as follows: By going through all of the stages of this procedure, you first created by means of your imaginati on an Energy location in the Astral world where you could meet with your gr andfather at the same level of vibration. The initially created scenario by means of meeting in your imagination and commencing a two-way conversation created a mental connection with t he Soul of your grandf ather who is living in the Astral worlds. Yo ur grandfather then res ponded to your mental invitation to join you in your created scenario, which in the Astral world is very solid and very real indeed at the Energy level at which it exists; every bit as solid and real as a similar place in the physical word, and indeed more so. Please also remember that in t he Astral worlds space and time simply do not exist, and your grandfather is able to join you instantly, travelling to your Energy locale simply by responding to your thoughts and vibrations and wi lling himself to be with you. Once the initial contact has b een established withi n the Astral locale you created the entire sc enario becomes and indeed is very real, and will then progress dynami cally and without any effort, just as such a meeting would do in t he physical world. You are able to participate in this scenario due to the fact that your own conscious awareness is now more located wit hin your Astral body as opposed to your physical body, and your conscious presence, your focus and awareness is therefore within t he Astral worlds or planes. This is really the same process as Astr al Projection. Again, it is very important indeed to know beyond any doubt whatsoever that the Astral and inner worlds are not some distant, dreamy, mysterious places, but rather they exist all around you at much higher levels of vibration, Energy and Consciousne ss, and in fact to the beings existing at the same level of the Astral worlds seem much more solid, vibrant and indeed real than the physical world of matter."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 370 Consciousness, like the Universe itself, is a continuum. This method works by focussing, projecting and raising your Consciousness to the inner Astral levels. This process is analogous to tuning your television set to a different channel. In the physical world there are literally thousands of radio and TV pr ograms as well as other types of transmission bei ng broadcast concurrently over a wide range of radio frequencies. Ho wever, you can only actually tune in to listen to or view one at a time. In changing a TV channel for example you might be tuning into a wavelength higher in the radio wave frequency spectrum, t hereby bringing the next channel into view on your TV screen. And so it is with communication with the Astral and inner spheres of life. Your physical senses exist at a relatively low frequency with which you normally “ tune in” the physical world by existing at the same frequency, and decoding the corresponding vibration of Energy. By using this method based upon the immense powers of imagination, you are, like a television receiver, tuning your conscious awareness into the much higher frequency of the vibration of the Energy of the As tral worlds, where direct contact can be made with relatives, friends and others already living there at those corresponding levels of Energy. As mentioned previously, this met hod of Astral Projection might not, in the beginning at least produce the quality, intensity or vividness of a full Astral Projection method, but will after time and practice become increasingly more vivid, real and intense, until eventually this actually becomes a full Astral Projection method, every bit as effective as any other method. Right from your first “afterlife” exploration success however you will never have any cause to doubt the validity, reality and value of the experience, and will know for yourself, beyond any doubt, life really does continue after the death of t he temporal, physical body of matter. You will also know th ere is no reason to engage the"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 371 services of a psychic or psychic medium, as you can obtain the answers for yourself and know them to be very real and true.   "},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 372 Chapter 68: The Out of Body Experience While practicing Astral Projection there is another experience that can occur spontaneously and whic h possibility you should be fully prepared for. Having achieved the Mind awake, body asleep state you might suddenly feel as if some or all of your body begins to “vibrate” very rapidly. These vi brations can steadi ly increase in intensity to the point where they can seem very dramatic indeed. In addition to these vibrations there is also the possibility that your physical body will seemingly become completely “paralysed” to the extent you simply cannot seem to move any part of your body at all, a state known as “catalepsy”. Do not be alarmed if this occurs, you are in absolutely no danger and the condition is perfectly safe. A further possibility during this process is for some or all of your Etheric body to start to “float” out of or above your physical body. These are all very common characteristics of the early stages of what is usually referred to as an “Out of Body Experience”, more commonly known as an “OBE”, and agai n are all perfectly natural and no cause for concern. Should you find yourself in an OBE situation while pr acticing Astral Projection the first thing to remember is to remain totally calm and relaxed; you are not in any danger. The vibrations will often increase to the point where your conscious awareness will leave your physical body and become cent red within your Etheric body. At this point you will be completely free to travel in the Etheric plane beyond the confines of your physical body. The actual separation process between your physical and Etheric bodies during the vibrational sta ge can either happen automatically whereby your Consciousness and Ether ic body will quite literally be projected from your physical body, finding yourself floating somewhere in your room, or you might have to help along the process of separation; there are various ways to achieve this. A particularly effective method of leav ing your physical body with your Etheric body once the vibr ations are well and tr uly established is to"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 373 imagine with as much realism and certainty as possible that you have already floated some distance above your physical body. As with all creative processes in volving visualisation and the imagination you must imagine this si tuation in the present tense as if it is already an absolute re ality; there should be no doubts whatsoever in you Mind as to the certainty of this. If this succeeds you should actually find yourself floating above your physical body. If separation by means of your imagination does not work, a more direct approach will be required. Move out of your physical body with your Etheric body by “rolling” to one side. It is most important not to actually move your physica l body while doin g this, indeed if by this stage your physical body has become completely paralysed as frequently occurs in this situation, this condition known as “catalepsy, you will not be able to move your physical body anyway. These are all perfectly normal char acteristics of the onset of an OBE, so please do not be alarmed; it is most important to remain as calm and passive as possible wh ile going with the flow of the OBE process. You can also gradually sit up with your Etheric body, and then, if successful, gradually stand up and move some distance away from your physical body. Once again it should be noted it is very important indeed during this process not to tense or move your physical body in any way; all mo vements should be with the Etheric body only otherwise you could termi nate the OBE process suddenly finding yourself in a normal state of waking Consciousness. Separation from your physical body while the vibrations are in full flow is not as difficult as it might seem. At this stage of the OBE process your centre of consci ous awareness will be centred within your Etheric body that will as a resu lt feel very real and solid while your physical body will be unable to move. Again, it is most important to absolutely remain calm at all times, ens uring you are in full conscious control of the separation process. It sometimes happens that immediately after the initial exit from your physical body, your Astral “vision” might seem somewhat dim,"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 374 or in some cases even non-exis tent. Should this happen, will yourself to move further away fr om your physical body by imagining you have already done so, and t hen with as much emotion as possible, firmly and meaningfully st ate the command in your Mind, “full clarity now”. Re peat this command with absolute authority as often as is necessary to achieve full perception of your surroundings. Do remember that y our Mind, your Consciousness is in full control, and whatever you desire must become a reality. It is highly advisable to understand the characteristics of your Etheric body and how to maintain fu ll control over it during an OBE. Although the Etheric pl ane is not on the same level of Energy vibration as the Astral plane it is still nevertheless an outer extension of it, a lower aspect of the entire Univer sal continuum, and therefore very similar charac teristics apply as to the main Astral planes. The Etheric plane is much closer to the density of th e Astral planes than the physical plane and like t he inner planes t he Etheric plane is therefore also a “Mind world” and highly responsive to thought. Accordingly, one of the first charac teristics you will notice is that any thought will instantly become a cause with a correspondingly instant effect. With this in Mind it remains absolutely vital to retain full control over your thoughts and emotions at all times, maintaining an air of passiveness or passive curiosity. If you do not achieve this level of control over your own emotions you have the potential to quite literally scare yourself back into your physical body, by for example becoming fr ightened of the possibility of meeting an evil being. If you do create such a particular thought within your Mind then it will immediately manifest into your reality and the evil being will conveniently appear in exactly the same the form as you imagined in your worst fears. This being will not be real of course, being rather a product of your own imagi nation, but it might certainly seem very real and every bit as frightening as you imagined it to be. "},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 375 Another characteristic you will notice once you are out of your physical body is that you will expe rience full vision, but rather than being restricted to the normal narrow field of vision of the physical eyes your field of vision wil l now be better than 360 degrees; as well as being able to see all around you your vi sion will also in effect be spherical. This might well seem somewhat alarming or even confusing at first; you might for example see a cupboard behind you that would normally be in front of you. This “illusion” is caused by the fact you are used to your normal narrow physical field of vision while confined within your physical body, and your Mind simply cannot at first comprehend and assimilate the characteristics of full, unrestrict ed spherical vision. It should not take long to get used to this situation however, particularly if you are well prepared for it and fully understand what is actually happening. Your quality of vision might initia lly vary between non-existent to crystal clear, and often very much better even than physical vision. As mentioned previously, should you experience no vision or dim, murky vision initially, the best thing to do is to move further away from your physical body by im agining you have already done so, and then mentally state the comm and with as much authority and Energy as possible, “full clarity now”. The next challenge to confront y ou once out of body will be that of moving around. In the Et heric plane you are not confined by gravity or movement on two legs as you ar e in the physical world, but can rather move around in any direct ion at all at will, including up through the roof and down through t he floor. Similarly, objects appearing to be solid such as walls and doors will now present no barrier whatsoever; you can simply pass straight through them at will. It is worth noting that in your Etheric body you are identical to what people commonly refer to as a “ghost”. The only tangible difference between a ghost and a per son in the OBE state is that the latter can return to their physical body at will whereas the former, the ghost of course cannot. "},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 376 A person in the OBE state can oft en materialise as an apparition before other people, especially in places with a particularly high concentration of ectoplasm. Similarl y, with sufficient Etheric Energy and density, both a ghost and a pers on in the OBE state can also affect objects in the material wo rld by making them move or make sounds; such a person is often know n as a “poltergeist”. A person in the OBE state can also meet and communicate with deceased humans, and indeed this often happens. Deceased humans can either be people from the Astral worl ds “visiting” the lower Etheric plane, or can be “ghosts”, passed over human beings still existing within the lower Etheric planes for some reason. The newcomer to OBE will often, particularly at first find moving around an awkward process at best with a tendency to unintentionally float through doors and walls, or often even up through the ceiling or down thr ough the floor. Although you will initially tend to move around by th inking you are moving your legs as you would in your physical body, ultimately all movement, like everything else in the inner worl ds is controlled by the focussed powers of the Mind and in particul ar will, intent and imagination. You are not in any way restricted by the physical rules of physics and can therefore travel anywhere in the worl d or even within the physical Universe simply by m eans of your will, intent and imagination. Once again however, it is most important to understand your travels will be taking place within an Etheric reflection of the physical world ra ther than within t he density of the actual physical world itself. Again is should be made absolutel y clear that while travelling during an OBE you are not actually “seeing” the physical world itself, or passing through physical objects as such, what you are perceiving is an Etheric “reflection” of the physical world. So when you travel through a door or a wall, or visit anywhere in the physical Universe, you are actually in a very close “copy” of that environment. That is why the Etheric environment is so susceptible to the Mind where you can creat e objects, situations and even complete alternative realities. As previously mentioned however, it"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 377 is still quite possible for a person in the OBE state, or a ghost to lower the vibrations of their Energy body to such an extent as to be very close to the physical world. There are Masters from the inner spheres of life and reality who can at will match the vibrations of the Energy of the physical world, ther eby fully materialising within the world of matter as a “solid” person, every bit as solid as any other human being living on the physical Earth. One day every person will enjoy the same abilities, ther eby being able to visit the physical world in “solid” form at will, from any inner plane of the Spirit worlds. Many people in the OBE state visi t the Moon, a nearby planet such as Mars or even distant star systems; there are absolutely no limitations to travel within the Etheric plane where space and time simply do not exist, everything occu rring quite literally at the speed of thought. If you wish to move forward then simply imagine you have already done so. Likewise, should you wish to visit a friend or relative then all it takes to do so is form the desire and intent to do so and to imagine being already in their presence, at which point you should instantly find yourself in the presence of the person. Of course the people you are visiti ng within the physical world will not usually be aware of your pr esence in the same way physical people are usually completely una ware of being visited by a deceased person. The peop le you are visiting will therefore usually fail to respond to any attempts at communication. If however the person you are visiting possesses medium, psychic or clairvoyant abilities they might well be able to perceive your presence and often even to be able to easily co mmunicate with you. A pet such as a dog or cat are very often ac utely aware of people in the OBE state just as they are of deceased visitors or ghosts. The next thing you will need to lear n while in the OBE state is how to control acceleration, speed and momentum, all of which have no limits in the inner planes of life and reality. You can if you wish accelerate to the speed of a car, a plane, or even beyond the speed of light; all travel taking place at the infinite speed of thought. Remember however that thought is Energy just as the entire"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 378 Universe is Energy. Having reached such speeds however, it is necessary to learn how to slow down once again or you might suddenly find yourself venturing deep into outer space. Full control of movement simply takes practice. Remember to do everything smoothly and with full focus and pr esence of Mind and you will very soon get used to moving around. Even if you do find yourself in outer space or some other unfamiliar location, don’t panic, you can always return to your physical body at will at any time simple by forming the intent and imagining that you have already returned to your physical body. You might also want to fly which is perfectly possible in the OBE state with no physical gravity to contend with. As with basic movement, flying is an ability that needs to be learned and controlled. It is for example much eas ier to blast off into outer space than to soar gracefully over the tr eetops like a bird. To fly, simply form the will and intent to do so and imagine having already launched into the air and flying like a bird. As always, these thoughts should always be in the present tense and to the extent you know beyond any doubt that you are already flying like a bird. If you wish you may even imagine yourself with your arms outstretched flying like Superman. Or if you pref er you can flap your imaginary wings just like a bird. At first you might find yourself drifting back down again; this is merely due to your own concept and expectation of the force of gravity as experienced within the physical world; you initially expect not to be able defy the physical laws of gravity and remain in the air and accordingly you do not, always drifting back downwards just as you would expect to happen in the physical plane. Always remember that all of your thoughts and imaginati on are your reality. As there is actually no gravity whatsoever in the Etheric plane and you need to lodge that reality firml y in your Mind when flying, knowing, beyond doubts in your Mind you will rema in airborne at will. "},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 379 This might well take some time and practice; we all have to live with gravity as a natural aspect of th e physical world, and generally do not expect to be able to defy the laws of gravity by remaining off the physical ground while fully unsuppor ted. Once you have firmly planted the thought in your Mind that gravity simply does not exist it will become your reality thereby enabling you to remain airborne. After plenty of practice, flying during an OBE will become second nature, but anticipate many amusing situations in the meantime such as drifting through the roofs of strange homes or blasting off to the moon. Passing through solid objects might also present problems initially, mainly due to the belief, like flying, it is impossible to do. In the physical world we are conditioned to believe that walls, doors, ceilings and all other material objects are solid; they are only solid of course to the mediation of t he physical senses. In the Etheric planes however, being a lower aspec t of the Astral planes, belief can be a very powerful barrier in deed to progress. The only way to overcome this obstacle is to know beyond any doubts in your own Mind that while in your Etheric body you can indee d pass straight through any objects that might appear to be solid and with absolute ease. After the first time of passing through a wall, a door, the ceiling or floor you will be left in no doubts whatsoever, and will happily proceed to travel through any seemingly solid objects with complete confidence in future. It is advisable however to avoid passing through reflective surfaces such as mirrors or windows. These can often cause an anomaly by projecting you into a mirror image of your Etheric surroundings, which are in fact in turn a mirror image of the physical worl d, and all sorts of possible anomalies, illusions and confusions can occur. Leaving your home by passing th rough a wall, a door or even through the ceiling will prevent such situations arising. Once outside you can travel at any s peed you desire, from a casual walking speed to flying at the speed of an aircraft or indeed any speed at all, thus cove ring good distances in a relatively short time while still being able to view th e scenery as it passes beneath you."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 380 You can travel around the world by using normal navigation techniques, following roads, rivers and landmarks, but for travelling great distances it is often better to travel to your destination instantly simply by forming the will and intent to do so, and imagining yourself to already be ther e. As previously mentioned it is quite possible to travel quite literally at the speed of thought, which is much, much faster than the speed of light. If you know where you wish to go or who you wish to visit and can visualise that location or person, then you can arrive there in the same instant. There are no limits to such instant travel, travelling from say England to Australia happens in less time than the blink of an eye. This not only applies to places on Earth, but also theoretically anywhere in the entire physical equivalent of the Universe. The main problem with tr avelling instantly in outer space however is you will not be able to easily visualise a destination much beyond the moon, Mars, or other better known inner planet, simply because there is not sufficient data available to form a proper image within your Mind. M any people in OBE state do travel to the Moon, and it is certainly worthwhile visiting the moon at least once just for the experience, especially the far side of the moon that faces away from Earth, and theref ore cannot normally be viewed by physical means. If you do wish to explore the physi cal Universe, remembering of course that it is infinite and you are travelling in an Etheric reflection of the physical Universe as opposed to the physical Un iverse itself, the best way to proceed is to fly at the highest possible speed you can summon, launching yourself into outer space, heading for whichever star system takes your fancy. If you do find yourself in an OBE sit uation rather than the originally intended Astral Projection, it is still quite possible to transition from the Etheric to the Astral planes. In theory this is achieved by simply raising the vibrations of your Etheric body until you match the vibrations and density of the appropriate level of the Astral planes. Your Etheric body should then simply fade giving way to your Astral"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 381 Body as you find yourself within t he Astral planes. This is exactly the same process occurring natur ally with recently deceased people when transitioning to their next home in the Astral worlds. To raise your vibrations to the As tral planes, as with all inner travel, it is simply a case of forming the will and intent to do so while using your imagination to visualise your self as already being at your desired Astral destination, or in the presence of the desired person. A further and often very useful possi bility is to mentally request the assistance of a guide. A guide w ill usually appear and will be very pleased to assist you in achieving your desired destination or objective. Should you not succeed in the transition to the Astral planes in this way, there are othe r possibilities. One possibility that has been proven to be effective is to fly at the highest possible speed towards a point midway between the ground and the distant horizon. Very often this will result in the increase in the vibration of your Energy body with a resultant “dimensional shift”, and you will find yourself somewhere within the Astral planes. Sometimes “tunnel” or “tube” like st ructures might also appear while in the Etheric plane. These are effectively “portals” to the Astral planes and entering such a tunnel will often result in travelling at a seemingly very high speed before ve ry quickly arriving within the Astral planes. This is a similar process to the “tunnels of light” often reported by people during “near death experiences” or “NDE” as they are often called, and are also the same tunnels often encountered by recently deceased people when transitioning from their previous physical existence to their new home in the Astral worlds. You should be fully aware however there is no risk at all associated with entering these t unnels of light; you can always return to your physical body at will. In addition to experiencing a spontaneous OBE situation while practicing Astral Projecti on, it is also quite possible to induce an OBE by design. As with Astral Projection there are numerous methods for inducing an OBE. Many if not most such methods however can, and unfortunately oft en have proven to be very"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 382 difficult to achieve for most pe ople, requiring very considerable dedication and practice, still wit h absolutely no guarantees of success. Unfortunately many people become discouraged with persistent failure to achieve an OBE by means of these methods, simply believing it to be beyond their capability. The main reasons for failing to accomplish an OBE with the many of the methods available today in cludes the failure to achieve adequate states of deep physical re laxation, concentration and trance, the Mind awake, body asl eep state starti ng from a fully waking state. Fortunately however there are several much more natural methods which, as with As tral Projection make use of the naturally occurring sleep state in order to accomplish these pre- requisite conditions. Excellent powers of concentrati on are required to achieve an adequate state of trance if endeav ouring to perform an OBE from a fully awake state. However, if pr ojecting from a just before, during or after a state of sleep, the i nduced trance state is no longer required due to the fact the body wil l already exist in a state of deep physical relaxation. Methods with which to invoke OBE from the natural sleep state ar e therefore much more straightforward and very much easier to achieve than methods practiced from a fully waking state, and are accordingly much more within the reach and capabilities of the ma jority of people. It is simply not necessary to attempt an OBE from a fully waking state unless there is a particular r eason for doing so. If the desire is to OBE during the daytime it can be much more easily achieved by taking a daytime nap. It is also much more convenient to OBE during the night or very early morning, as most people are otherwise occupied during daytime hours. Another excellent benefit of performi ng OBE at night is that your physical body will still be asleep and receiving all the rest and recuperation it naturally requires while your Etheric or Astral body is travelling elsewhere gaining valuabl e experiences; a most efficient"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 383 use of time which applies to both Astral Projection and OBE projections. Like Astral Projection OBE is a perfectly natural process. There are three differ ent methods for achieving an OBE from the natural sleep state, all of which have proved to be highly successful for a wide range of peopl e. The three times when these OBE methods can be used to th e greatest effect are: • Immediately before sleep, after retiring to bed. • After awaking 2 hours or so earlier than usual. • Immediately before or after a daytime nap. The second of these possibilities, immediately after awaking a couple of hours earlier than usual also relies on drifting back to sleep again. This particular time of the morning, after two or three normal sleep cycles, seems to be par ticularly effective in invoking OBE and Astral Projec tion as well as Lucid Dreaming. This is almost certainly due to the fact the body is in a particularly advanced state of deep physical re laxation, and the Consciousness is clear of the mundan e thoughts usually present in the Mind after a full waking day. At this time the Consciousness is also much more tuned into the inner realms where it will have been normally focussed during sleep. As previously mentioned, every one naturally projects during the physical sleep process and the object of the OBE and the previously discussed Astral Projecti on procedures is to make use of this fact in order to achieve a fully conscious and therefore fully controllable experience. Early mo rning is also a particularly convenient time to perform OBE or Astral Projection and will not usually result in tiredness after ar ising in the morning; the physical body will still be in a state of deep relaxation. All of the following three methods involve programming your Mind before sleep in order to invoke a conscious OBE at some stage during the sleep cycle. Using these methods OBE often occurs shortly after falling asleep. As with Astral Projection, the more these"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 384 methods are practiced, the more reliable and successful they will be.    "},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 385 Chapter 69: Three OBE Methods OBE Method 1: Affirmations The use of affirmations is an ex tremely powerful and proven way of invoking an OBE. Normally while the conscious Mind sleeps, the subconscious Mind is particularly ac tive. The subconscious Mind is immensely powerful and directly communicates with your inner bodies and Higher-Self as well as the inner spheres of reality. Also, as previously mentioned, every one unconsciously projects during normal sleep, but usually have no recollection of the experience except sometimes by means of a particularly vivid dream. The affirmation method works by progr amming your subconscious Mind in order to bring about a fully con scious OBE, and at the same time alerting you to the fact that the process has already started in the form of typical pre-OBE characteri stics such as vibrations and paralysis. One of the greatest benefits of this method is that it requires no formal training in deep physical rela xation, concentration, trance or indeed any of the other usual and o ften very difficult OBE training methods, relying simply instead on completely normal functions of the body and Mind in order to bring about these states in completely natural way. It might take anywhere from a couple of days to a month or so to achieve OBE by this method, but once the subconscious Mind is programmed to invoke a conscious OBE state it should become a regular occurrence achievable at will, especially with ongo ing practice. An affirmation is a short phrase repeated in the present tense with as much emotion as possible as if it has already become an absolute reality. The consistent use of such an affirmation will program your subconscious Mind to accept and follow your instructions. This is an extremely simple and straightforward method of achieving an OBE, an d one well within the sc ope of everyone. The"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 386 only decision that needs to be made is the sleep time chosen to perform this method, the choices being as previously noted; at normal bed-time, after awaking a c ouple of hours earlier than usual in the morning or just before a daytime nap. As mentioned earlier, the early morning method has o ften proven to be particularly effective for both Astral Projec tion and OBE. The method proceeds as follows: At your chosen pre-sleep time, mi nutes before you feel yourself drifting off to sleep, st art to repeat your affirmation over and over again until you drift off to sleep, while still re peating the affirmations. When you feel yourself near to sleep, continue to repeat the affirmation with as much emot ion and single pointed focus as possible, while knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever that your instruction has already become an abs olute reality. Your affirmation can be repeated aloud or silently within your Mind, both are equally effective. Another highly effective approach is to actually write down your affirmations on paper until you becom e sleepy, or preferably until you fall off to sleep completely. If you feel you cannot go to sleep while writing, t hen write down as many affirmations as you can until you feel tired and feel need to dri ft off to sleep, and then relax and continue to repeat your affirmation in your Mind until you drift off to sleep. Writing down an affirmation is a particularly powerful way of impressing your wishes on your subconscious Mind by means of an action in the direction of your intentions. Again, the subconscious Mind is extremely powerful, being the vast majority of the totality of your Mind, and which aspect of your Mind is in direct contact with the inner spheres of life and realit y as well as with your Higher-Self. A further possibility for impressing your affirmation on your subconscious Mind is by means of a length of knotted string. Obtain a length of fine string or other fibre and tie into it a series of fifty knots equally along its entire length. Just bef ore your chosen sleep time repeat your affirmation, and as you do so move your fingers to the next knot along in the string. T he physical action of sliding your"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 387 fingers from knot to knot along the string helps to impress the affirmation upon your subconscious Mind. Another potentially very powerful enhancement to this process is to record your affirmations on to tape, CDROM, DVD, MP3, or other electronic recording media, and then to set it to replay after your spoken affirmations as you drift off to sleep. You can either record or play the affirmations a specif ic number of times or set the playback to loop through the affirmation continuously. An affirmation relayed to your subc onscious Mind in your own voice while you sleep has a very powerful influence upon your subconscious Mind, which will then accept and act upon that affirmation. The subconscious Mind never, ever “questions” your intent; it will always accept your instructions expressed in the present tense without ques tion, and work with your conscious Mind and your Higher-Self to bring your in structions into reality. The affirmation chosen should be short, concise, and always spoken in the present tense as if it were already an absolute reality. Examples of such affi rmations might include: “I am now out of body” “ I now travel out of body” “I now leave my physical body” “I now travel out of body with full awareness” “I now enjoy an out of body experience” These are just a few examples of suitable affirmations. You can formulate your own affirmation, but always remember to make it in the present tense as a statement of fact. If you continue to repeat your affirm ation as you drift off to sleep, as well as listen to the affirmation if using a recorded affirmation, the"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 388 next thing you will be aw are of when the affirmation is successful is awaking to the pre-OBE characterist ics of vibrations, catalepsy or floating out of your physical body. This often happens very shortly after falling asleep, or might indeed happen at any time during the night. When this does happen you ar e well on your way to an OBE and should simply follow the procedur es as previously discussed in order to complete the exit from your body. Again, this is an extremely powerful, proven and successful method of invoking an OBE, but like ever ything worthwhile perseverance is crucial to success. Never be discouraged after only a few days of practicing this or any other OBE or Astral Projection method; keep moving forward until you succeed which you surely will. OBE Method 2: Visualisations As previously mentioned, imagination, of which visualisation is an integral aspect, is an extremely powerful human ability, the same power as behind all creation in fac t. The use of the imagination and in particular visualisation is an extremely effective method of achieving an OBE, particularly w hen used in conjunction with an affirmation as discussed in method 1. This method works by projecting your conscious awareness away from the confines of y our physical body while y ou drift off to sleep, by focussing on the visualisation of a particular scenario or object and becoming completely involved wi th it. A scenario rather than an object is usually more effective as you can become much more involved with it. The scenario or object chosen can be one you are already familiar with or alternat ively one you create by means of your imagination. Any scenario will potentially work fine, but the more detail and involvement you can place into it, using as many senses as possible, the more effective it will be. Whatever scenario or obj ect you select for this purpose needs to be sufficiently captivating to hold your interest and complete attention for at least ten minutes and preferabl y much longer, ideally for thirty"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 389 minutes or more. An ideal choice of scenario might be a favourite place such as your garden, a plac e in the countryside, a favourite holiday location, in fact anywhere at all where you have particularly strong and positive connection wit h happy and positive emotions. You can also use your imagination to entirely create your ideal scenario in your Mind, one that does not actually physically exist. Although this might at first seem to be more difficult, it does provide you with the opportunity of creati ng an ideal scenario that you know you can become fully involved wi th, and one which makes full use of all of your senses. This can be any sort of scenario you like however elaborate or fantastic it might seem, the more fun and mentally captivating it is the better. Another possibility that has also pr oven to be highly effective is to use a scenario based upon your own home. In this case, before commencing this procedure, walk around your home a few times and take particular note of three familiar objects. Ideally these objects should appeal to different senses including vision, hearing, touch, smell and hearing. For exam ple a ticking clock, a fragrant pot plant or air freshener, a plasti c or rough surface and any other favourite household item. Make a habit while walking around your home of taking particular note of the characteristics of each of these objects in turn and how they stimulate your senses, committing these sensations to memory in as much detail as possible. Commence this technique at your chosen pre-sleep time. Normally this will be upon retiring to bed at night. Again however, after waking a couple of hours earlier than usual in the morning can also be a particularly effective time for this process. Alternatively, just before a daytime nap is also very effective. Start by imagining your favourite scenario or tour of the objects in your home by using all of your powers of visualisation and other senses. Use all of your powers of imagination to become totally immersed and involved with your scenario. If for example it is a favourite holiday location by the sea, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin and the sand"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 390 beneath your feet, hear the sound of the waves gently washing upon the shore, smell the aroma of the food drifting across from the nearby beachside snack bar and tast e that ice cream or drink you are enjoying to cool down. Imagi ne yourself walking around taking in all of the sights, sounds and other sensory inputs, and become completely involved to such an ex tent that you know beyond doubt that you are actually right ther e enjoying the experience; there should be no doubts at all in your Mind about this. In the case of the tour of y our home, imagine yourself walking around your home pausing at each of y our chosen objects in turn in order to study and fully appreciate them. See, hear, sm ell, feel and if appropriate taste each of these it ems as you reach them using all powers of your imaginat ion. As you continue the walk around your home taking in the sensory feedba ck from each of your chosen objects in turn, completely immerse yourself in the process as much as you possibly can, kno wing beyond any doubts whatsoever in your Mind that you really are actually walking around your home examining each of your chosen items in turn. If you have chosen a single object or person, involve yourself with that object or person to the ma ximum possible extent of your imagination. Study the object or person in as much detail as possible in your Mind, utilising all of your senses and knowing beyond any doubts whatsoever in your own Mind that you are actually in the presence of that object or person. Continue to engage your imagination in this way until you drift off to sleep. As you feel yourself drifting off to sleep deepen the feelings, sensations and emotions associ ated with your scenario. By projecting your consci ous awareness away fr om your physical body you have primed yourself for an OBE experience. As with the affirmations method you might well find yourself suddenly awaking with the typical pre-OBE characteri stics either very shortly after drifting off to sleep or at any time during your sleep period. Again, this method might take anywhere between a couple of days and a"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 391 few weeks to be successful, so please be patient and above all persevere, you can achieve OBE, everyone can. Remember, as we will discuss in much more detail later in this book, your imagination has truly immense powers that should never, ever be underestimated, and imagination has consistently proven to be a very effective means of invoking an OBE. This method has the additional benefit of developing all powers of your imagination, which as we will see later can be used to great effect for many other very valuable abilities. OBE Method 3: Floating Balloon During normal waking hours the Etheric Body is usually firmly integrated with the physi cal and inner bodies. During sleep times however the inner bodies automatica lly move out of phase with the physical body during what is actually a projec tion to an inner level, but one which most people remain completely unconscious and therefore unaware of. The floating balloon met hod works by using the imagination in order to consciously invoke a feeling of floating upwards just prior to sleep. When you drift into sleep your subconscious Mind will continue to consciously invoke the upwards floating feeling associated with your Et heric Body, which in turn can become a full OBE. This method is particularly effective when used in conjunction with an affirmation as with the pr evious method, and as with the other methods can be used prior to any sleep time; usual bedtime, after awaking a couple of hours earlie r than usual in the morning, or just before a daytime nap. Again, as with the previous methods, early morning just after waking a couple of hours earlier than you normally would do is a particularly effective time for invoking an OBE as well as Astral Projection or Lucid Dream. Commence this method as you begi n to drift off to sleep by imagining with as much r ealism, and as vividly as possible that you are balloon filled with helium. Feel with all of your imagination how"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 392 extremely light you are. As you dr ift nearer to sleep feel yourself floating gradually higher and higher , ever upwards towards the glorious blue sky. Feel warmer and warmer as you continue to float ever upwards towards the sun shin ing brightly above you. As you drift ever higher, visualise your home and then your street and then your town becoming smaller and sma ller. Maintain this feeling of extreme lightness and of floating ever higher with the scenery below you becoming ever smalle r until you drift off to sleep. Maintain this awareness of drifti ng upwards with as much intensity as you can, intensely enjoying every minute of it as you continue your ascent, as the Earthly landmarks beneath becomes specks against the planet Earth, and soon Earth itself becomes smaller and smaller as you continue to rise ever upwards into the great Universe. When successful you will be woken, o ften very shortly after drifting off to sleep but could be any time, by vibrations or perhaps initial catalepsy. Quite probably with this particular method however you will awake to find yourself alr eady floating out of and above your body, at which point you can assume full control over your out of body state as previously discussed. In conclusion, all of the descr ibed methods for invoking an OBE have proven to be extremely effect ive for many people of all types of natural understanding, ability and circumstances, using as they do completely natural characterist ics of the body, Soul and Spirit, and not therefore relyi ng upon any difficult, advanced, mystical or otherwise convoluted procedures requiring considerable time, practice and concentrat ion without ever bei ng certain of success. That is not to say of course the more advanced procedures involving OBE from a fully waking state are not effective because they most certainly can be gi ven the time, commitment and dedication, however the ultimate obj ective is to achieve an OBE in order to focus on the considerable benefits that will be realised as a direct result rather than focu ssing on more lengthy and difficult"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 393 methods with the disappointment and frustration resulting with lack of success. These three simple methods as described also have the additional and considerable advantage of producing results before frustration sets in, thereby eliminating a very major cause of people to give up before OBE success is achieved. It is best to discover as soon as possible which particular method suits you the best and most important ly to stay with it and keep practicing every day. Above all enjoy the experience of learning and succeeding. Both Astral Projecti on and OBE are very great inner adventures which will certainly bring profo und benefits and truths into your life, truths which will enable you to face both your current life on Earth and your inner destiny on your pat h, in the knowledge that you are without question an i mmortal Spiritual being of the Universe, a true son or daughter of God.  "},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 394 Chapter 70: The Near Death Experience Throughout recorded history people ha ve returned from “death” to tell of their experiences during the ti me they were “out of their own body”. The situations leading to such experiences are numerous and can include extreme medical conditions as heart failure, accidents, and very often even during the course of medical operations. These near death experiences, often simply referred to as an “NDE”, share common characterist ics including the perception of floating above or near the physical body and observing the physical body from an unusual sit uation; for example from the corner of the room, or as has often been repor ted in the case of medical operations from the corner of th e operating theatre. If doctors are present the person experiencing t he NDE will usually see doctors endeavouring to revive their physical body, after which a doctor will often pronounce them as “dead”. Some people later choose to rela te their NDE experiences to doctors, relatives and friends, howeve r it is likely the vast majority do not, often believing for example they will not be believed or worse are considered to have been hallucinating due to the anaesthetic or other m edical factors associated with the medical situation, or suffering from after- effects arising from the physical condition leading to the NDE. Other people are afraid to relate NDE experiences on the basis they might be considered to be mentally deranged or will be ridiculed. To most people experiencing an NDE, relating the experience to others seems pointless, the experi ence itself being so intensely profound and personal. Re search has proven however that literally millions of people have experienced an NDE, most of which are described as deeply profound, life changing experiences. One of the most significant effects of an NDE for people who are deeply religious is that they immediat ely realise the creed and dogma of religion for what it really is, having experienced, albeit only for a"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 395 short time the absolute truth of t he survival of the human Soul and Spirit and the truth of what awaits after the expiration of the physical body, truths so prof ound, real and beyond any possible doubt that such a person will nev er return to the dogma and indoctrination of a religious belief system ever again. Like most people experiencing an NDE , previously religious people having “seen the light” are extrem ely thankful indeed they have been given the opportunity to set aside the restrictions of their previous belief system and to have been given the opportunity to restructure their lives towards t he realisation of their own true purpose and destiny. There have been many famous people, especially in the last century or so who have experienced an NDE and have told of their experiences afterwards. Due to their standing the NDE experiences of these well-known and often respected people are usually taken very se riously indeed and form the basis of some of the most compelling evidence in existence today as to the truth of NDE what happens at the point of the death of the physical body and immediately a fterwards, and most importantly the truth of the inner realities of life beyond the physical world of matter. There are many similar experi ences reported by people having experienced an NDE. These include “seeing” and experiencing their entire life “pass before their eyes” seemingly in an instant. Although this “life review” seems to happen in just a moment in time due to the experience actually o ccurring within the Etheric plane beyond the confines of space and time, this life review is complete in every respect, every single aspect of the most recent life of the person being experienced exactly as it was originally experienced during the course of their physica l life. Another co mmon feature of the typical NDE is experiencing intense white radiant light, the Divine light of God, and with it an overwhelming and all encompassing feeling of absolu te Unconditional Love; an experience completely beyond the capability of conveying by means of the written word."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 396 Frequently people experiencing an NDE also perceive and sometimes vividly experience the presence of deceased loved ones, friends and other “beings of light” who are there to guide them at the moment of transition from the ph ysical to the Astral worlds. Often the person experiencing the NDE will be told by one of these people to “go back”, or “it isn’t your time yet”. This is often all the motivation needed to return to the physical body, serene in the certain knowledge of the glories awaiting one day upon the final passing from that particular physi cal incarnation on the planet Earth. Like people who practice Astral Proj ection and OBE, those experiencing an NDE will never again fear the state of transition from the physical to the non-ph ysical worlds, still erroneously known as “death”. An NDE is very similar indeed to an OBE or Astral Projection as discussed previously. As with final physical death it is possible to initially transition either to the Et heric plane closest to the physical world, the same process as an OBE, or to transition directly to the Astral world as occurs with Astral Projection. The Etheric NDE is the situation whereby the circumstances associated with the NDE, for example within an operating t heatre, are witnessed from outside the confines of the physical body. Tunnels and beings of light are all characteristics of an NDE shar ing similar characteristics to an Astral Projection. The value of both OBE and Astral Projection in experiencing at first hand at any time the realities aw aiting after the death of the physical body are extremely evident and profound. People experiencing an NDE can only experi ence the greater realities and truths for a short time whereas those experienced with OBE and Astral Projection can experience t hem at will for extended periods of time as time relates to the physical Universe, and have the opportunity to explore the Astral wo rlds thereby gaining valuable life guiding knowledge before the time arrives for the final Astral Projection, often known as “death”, for that particular physical lifetime."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 397 NDE, OBE and Astral Projection are all experiences reproducing what will happen to each and every person at the point of physical death, resulting in a profound knowing of the trut h of the higher realities and the conti nuation of life after the death of the physical body. Anyone enjoying these expe riences will profoundly know beyond any doubts the state known as “death” is not final but is rather the continuation of a much greater advent ure, the next stage in life as an immortal Spiritua l being of the multi-dimensional Universe with a glorious path ah ead on the return to back to our Supreme Creator, God.

To many, “life” seems little more than merely existing from day to day, endeavoring to survive, providing for themselves and their families as best they can, ofte n wondering whatever will happen next, and usually attributing ever ything happening in their life to such notions as “luck”, “chance” or “fate”. Many people resign themselves to accepting their “lot” in life, often from birth, while very often feeling envious of those who’s “lot” in life from their own perspective seems to be much better than their own. Of course many people are so comp letely involved with their own existence that they give very littl e if any thought to the vast number of other people who are actually much worse off than themselves. And so it is with life generally, people carried along like corks on the ocean, controlled by their ego, while striving to gather as many material possessions on Earth as possible while remaining totally oblivious to the inner realities of the infinite Universe and of their true purpose for living on Earth, a purpose which if only they knew, was actually chosen by themselves even before their current life on Earth even began. Whatever the life circumstances a person has including even parents was chosn as the best option available to evolve, and therefore people should never complain about a “lot” that they chose for themselves. The main thing that differs is in the degree of realization of these facts, and how they are benefited from. People having no understanding, dire ction or even love of life is not how it should be or indeed was ev er intended to be in the grand scheme of things. Each and ever y person is an equal and integral aspect of The Source, The All, of God, and as such enjoy all necessary abilities not only to liv e each and every life in complete harmony, happiness, health, peace and plenty, but most importantly to use the valuable ti me on Earth for the most important"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 400 and sacred task of all, progress on the path of ascent back to The Source, our Divine Creator, God. The human race of the planet Earth has a very long way to progress in the grand Un iversal scheme of thi ngs and each lifetime on Earth should be spent wisely wit h personal progression at the forefront of each physical life. Thos e who initially ignore or fail to recognize these most important facts will find themselves lagging behind their brothers and sisters of the human race who will be progressing through the inner spher es of life beyond the physical and Astral worlds, enjoying conditi ons of peace, harmony, bliss, love and light far and away bey ond the comprehens ion of people still living on Earth. Those who fail to comprehend these important facts and fail to structure each life accordingly, will also find themselves returning to Earth time and again until their lessons are eventually learned and progress is finally made. Every single human being without exception has God given abilities to manage each and every life to t he full, in peace, harmony and happiness. Just as God is the Prim e Creator in the Macrocosm, the entire Universe in all of its magnificent spher es of life and reality, human beings as Divine and integral aspects of God, made in the true image of God are creators in the microcosm, our own world in whichever sphere we are living. Please realise, accept and fully understand the prof oundest truth in this next statement; we all create our own reality! We create every single success, every single failure, every single illness, every single relationship, ever y single problem, every single trauma, every single incidence of “good fortune”, every single incidence of “bad luck”, lack of m oney, excess of money and lack of needs; in short, absolutely everything; there is nothing that we do not create in our own lives. In accordance with the immutable Universal law of Cause and Effect, nothing in the Universe ever happens by “chance”; everyone is responsible for who they are and w hat they have in life such as it"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 401 is; there are no exceptions to this reality. Today a major problem within the world is that the vast majority of people simply do not yet know and understand t hese fundamental truths and accordingly create individual realities wit h which they are unhappy. To compound these problems even further , negative emotions due to adverse circumstances attract even further sources of unhappiness, and so it goes on ad-in finitum, a whole series of negative effects resulting from a corresponding series of negative causes. The opposite also applies of course; those who are happy with their lives will focus on that happiness and as a direct result will attract and experience even mo re happiness. Such is the way of the Universe, the power of at traction, of Cause and Effect, and all other Universal la ws always unfailingly operating with total immutability. There is no such concept as favouritism in the Universe; everyone is equal, and accordingly has an absolute God given equal right to have all genuine needs fulfilled, to be happy and content at all times, and to live in peace and harmony with the Universe. Everyone without exception has equal opportunities to progress as an immortal Spirit and aspect of God, indeed it is not only an opportunity; to evolve back to the First Cause, The Source, God is our most sacred objective, and really is the true meaning of life. In this section of this book we will discuss how you can take full control over every aspect of your life and your own ultimate reality regardless of your current ci rcumstances. We will discuss the importance and methods of tr ue concentration, focus and relaxation, all of which are fundam entally important in every day life. We will discuss how you can manifest anything you need or desire into your life and realit y regardless of your current circumstances; everyone without exception has this same creative power as an integral aspect of God. We will discover how to heal yourself and others using only the powers of the Mind; healing is not usually a function of the physical body as doctors and most people believe, but is ra ther a function of heal ing the Etheric Body the Energy Body which can be profoundly influenced by the"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 402 focused powers of the Mind. We will discover how you can protect yourself and your family from dar k, negative beings and forces that can and often do attack people far mo re frequently than is generally recognized. We will also discuss how to remove these dark forces should they already have taken a hol d in your life. Finally we will discuss the many abilities, attri butes and disciplines required for personal progression and evolution, not only for the benefit of your own current life but also for t he benefit of your loved ones and others around you, and ultimately fo r the benefit of all mankind. There is another extremely and fundamentally impor tant reason why as many people as possible should structur e and live their lives as they were intended to be before birth into the physical world; the more people wh o begin to live their lives in accordance and in harmony with the Universe, Universal laws and therefore with God, the more t he collective Conscious ness of mankind of which we are all an integral aspect will be expanded. The more people who recognize Spiritual truths and pursue the true and sacred path, the more the collectiv e realm of the planes of human Consciousness will be expanded in the same direction until finally all of mankind will be liberated from the sh ackles of creed, dogma and materialism, each and every person without exception free to pursue their own ultimate reality, and their own importa nt part in the destiny of all mankind.  "},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 403 Chapter 72: Deep Physical Relaxation By relaxation we do not necessarily mean for example reclining in a comfortable chair in front of a television, relaxing in the garden or taking a holiday or leisure break, pleasant and welcome though these might be, but we rather mean “deep physical relaxation”. Deep physical relaxation is not only an ability that is important to integrate into your dail y lifestyle in order to help combat stress and other negative feelings, but is also extremely important in the development of many other positiv e and valuable ab ilities required in the ongoing process of m anaging your own life and destiny. The benefits of learning and regul arly practicing deep physical relaxation simply cannot be underes timated. Many of the valuable abilities contained in this section rely on the ability of deep physical relaxation and accordingly we will discuss this important ability from the very outset. You might feel that you are already relaxed, however if you consciously check all of your muscle groups and your state of Mind you will usually soon discover that the reality is very different indeed. You might we ll find tension in various muscle groups preventing complete relaxation as well as tension and stress of the Mind. In this chapter we will discuss a highly effective method for achieving deep physical relaxation, which once learned will enable you to deeply relax at will, at any time and under almost any circumstances. Before commencing these exercises it is important not to be too tired otherwise the effectivene ss will be reduced and there is always the possibility of falling asl eep. It is best therefore not to have eaten a large or heavy meal beforehand that wi ll interfere with the deep physical relaxation process. It is also highly advisable to wear loose, comfortable fitting cl othing, otherwise the relaxation process can be restricted and accord ingly not be as effective as it should be. To commence these exercises first of all make yourself as comfortable as you can in an armc hair or similar place where you"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 404 can relax in an upright or semi-upri ght position. It is not advisable to lie down flat on a bed due to the possibility of falling asleep, however it is quite alright to prop yourself up in bed in a semi- upright position using pillows. Taki ng a warm bath can also be very beneficial before commenc ing these exercises. A good posture is also very important; if you allow y ourself to slump in your chair or bed or if your back and therefore spine is not as straight as possible, it will most certainl y be counter-productive to the relaxation process. If your a rmchair does not allow your head and neck to be completely comfortable place a pillow behind your head, adjusting it until it is comfortably supported. The objective before commencing deep physical relaxation exercises is for your body to be as balanced and free of strain and stress as possible from the outset, and in such a way as to remain completely balanced throughout the duration of the exercises. Ultimately you should be able to relax under any circumstances. One of the most useful and effe ctive conditions under which to relax for the development of many im portant abilities is while sitting completely upright in a straight -backed chair, while not leaning against the backrest of the chair. These relaxation exercises are commenced with deep breathing exer cises designed to remove as much stress and negativity as possible from your muscles and your Mind. The practice of deep physical relaxation: Breathe in deeply but slowly to a sl ow count of five and imagine at the same time, with as much realism as possible that the air you are inhaling is a very bright, r adiant, sparkling white. As you progressively inhale, feel the positi ve relaxing Energy of this white, radiant, sparkling light entering your entire body and spreading throughout your body from head to foot. Hold the breath for a slow count of five while feeling and enjoying as intensely as possible the radian t, sparkling white light bathe your entire body, and then slowly exhale to a further slow count of five."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 405 As you exhale, imagine as realistically as possible that your breath is a dark grey colour, and as y ou exhale this dark grey breath containing all negativity and tensi on is now leaving your body as you feel progressively more relaxed. Now continue to relax for a further slow count of five and once again repeat the process of inha ling pure, radiant, white sparking light, again feeling it s pure relaxing Energy entering and permeating your entire body from head to f oot before finally once again exhaling the dark grey light, while at the same time feeling all tension and negativity leaving your body. All inhalations, pauses and exhalations should be carried out to the same slow count of five for each part of this process. Repeat each breathing cycle at leas t five times, ideally continuing until you are feeling generally relaxed, refreshed and positive. Please note that while doing these breathing exercises you should inhale by using your entire di aphragm and not just your upper chest. You can accomplish this by drawing in each breath by using the entire area from your lower stomach to your upper chest, drawing in each breath in this way. The next stage in d eep physical relaxation, to be carried out immediately and follow ing on from the first stage involves progressive active relaxation, starti ng at your feet and finishing at the crown of your head. To proceed with this phase of the exercises, while still retaining your relaxed feelings after the initial breathi ng exercises, imagine as vividly as possible a large sphere of bri ght, glowing, radiant white light positioned just beneat h your feet. Using as much imagination as you can summon make this sphere of light as bright, glowing and radiant as possible; as bright or even brighter than the sun on a clear summers day. Next imagine as realistically as you possibly can this sphere of radiant light moving gradually upwa rds, first encompassing both of your feet. Your feet should now be completely bathed in this bright,"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 406 glowing, energizing white light; you can feel the glow of the warmth of this bright, radiant, energizing li ght around the entire area of your feet, toes and ankles. Feel all re maining tension draining quickly away from the area of your feet as they bec ome extremely relaxed and free of all tension. Maintain this visualization as vividly as possible until all remaining tensi on completely dissipates from the area of your feet. Next imagine the bright sphere of radiant white light moving slowly up your legs to the area of your calves. Again feel this area completely bathed in this bright, glowing, energizing white light, allowing the sphere of Universal light to remain in this position until both of your calves are completely free of all tension and completely relaxed just as with your feet area previously. Next imagine the white s phere of radiant light moving still further up your legs until reaching your thi ghs. The sphere of light can very easily expand as much as it needs to do in order to fully encompass any area of your body at will. As with your feet and calves allow both of your thighs to bathe and relax completely in the glowing, radiant, energizing white E nergy of the sphere of light. As before, allow the sphere of light to remain in this position until you know beyond any doubt that all tension has fully dissipated, and this area now feels totally relaxed. Repeat this process as the radiant, bright, white glowing sphere of Energy travels further up your body next reaching your hips and buttocks followed by your stomac h and lower back ar eas, and then your chest and upper back, arms and shoulders. Your arms should remain totally straight by your sides allowing the sphere to encompass the entire trunk of your body and arms as it progressively makes its way up your body encompassing everything as it does so, and leaving each area totally fully relaxed. The sphere of radiant white light now reaches your neck. Allow the sphere of radiant white light to bathe your neck area for longer, and as long as necessary for you to release all tensi on. Your neck can collect a considerable amount of tension and time must be provided"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 407 for all tension to completely diss ipate, ensuring your neck, as with your lower areas are completely relaxed and free of all tension. Finally the glowing, white radiant sphere of light reaches your head. Allow it to remain around yo ur head area while all tension completely dissipates from your face and head muscles, again leaving them totally and completely relaxed as with all of the lower parts of your body. After all muscl es in your head feel totally relaxed, imagine the radiant, glowin g white sphere of light traveling to the top of your head, and then onwards into the infinite Universe. Now take time to bathe in this ex tremely pleasant feeling of deep, full body relaxation. Feel just how blissful it is to have removed all of that stored tension and stress from your entire body. You can remain in this position of deep ph ysical and mental relaxation for as long as you wish while you fully appr eciate how wonderful this total relaxation really is. Very often this deep physical relaxa tion exercise is valuable pre- cursor to Astral Projection, OBE, concentration, manifestation, healing and other import ant abilities to be discussed later in this book. In this stressful world it is very useful indeed however to learn the art of deep physical re laxation as a valuable ability in and of itself, and one which will prove to be particularly welcome at the end of a long, hard stressf ul day, or indeed at any time at all when you simply feel the need to relax. After sufficient practice, deep physical relaxation can be performed anywhere at all at will and wi thout the need for a comfortable location or the need for visualizations. The ulti mate objective should be the ability to achieve deep physical relaxation while sitting absolutely upright, spine complete ly relaxed, sitting on a chair, without using the backrest of the chair. Your body must respond to and obey your will at all times. Ultimately theref ore you should reach the stage where you can sit completely upright, spine erect on a non-padded chair, and totally re lax by simply concentrating, focusing and willing your body to so. When you can achieve a state"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 408 of deep physical relaxation at will like this, many more latent abilities will open themselves to you, abilities that can have a profound effect on your life and ongoing evolution.    "},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 409 Chapter 73: Concentration The ability to totally concentrate at will is not only extremely beneficial but in fact is one of the most important of all abilities, and one upon which most other abilities ultimately rely. Without adequate powers of concentration nothing worthwhile can be achieved or true progress accomplis hed; this is such an important truth that everyone should fully understand. On the other hand with the ability of complete powers of concentration quite literally anything is possible. The benefits of developing the ability to totally concentrate at will includes but is certainly not in any way limited to the complete control of thoughts, absolute peace of Mind, self-confidence, inner strength, will power, ability to focus your Mind, improved memory, better ability to make and carry out decisions, more control over your daily life, ability to study and learn much more quickly and efficiently, control over extraneo us passing thoughts and not giving in to them, freedom from needless, annoying, obsessive, compulsive or upsetting thoughts, routines and habits, inner happiness, the development of extremely valuable abilities as will be discussed in more detail later in this book, more advanced powers of the imagination including visualization, and the ability to meditate effectively. There are m any more valuable benefits arising from the ability to fully concentrate, these being just a few of the more important ones. Many people unfortunately have considerable difficulty in concentrating for more than a few seconds at a time, with the Mind constantly jumping around from t hought to thought and subject to subject without any sort of conscious control or structure whatsoever. People are often heard to complain for example, “I cannot possibly think of a hundred th ings at once”; and therein is a real problem; they ar e indeed thinking of a hundred things at once instead of just one single thought; the immediate task in hand or point of focus."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 410 Another expression for this inabili ty to concentrate on a single thought is “monkey mind”; the Mind is constantly chattering away endlessly creating noise and thus dimming its true power, abilities and therefore effectiveness. In so me parts of the world people who are unable to maintain any single thought for more than a few moments are known as “quinhento s pensamentos”, which literally means, “five hundred thoughts”. This situation applies equally to people of all cultures throughout the world. Diluting the Mind with thoughts is lik e diluting anything; the totality of its effectiveness will be reduc ed in proportion to the amount of dilution as the concentrated effectiveness is scattered and dissipated. A single strongly focu sed thought is extremely powerful, this simply cannot be emphasiz ed enough. “Phenomena” which to most people would seem to be completely miraculous are easily possible by means of single poi nted, completely focused and concentrated powers of the Mind. As previously discussed, thought is Energy and therefore focused thought is focused Energy the vi brations of which can have a profound effect on the object of the thought, with results that might appear to the casual observer as truly miraculous. A graphic example of such immense power of concentration has often been observed and related by those who have traveled in India. They tell of how they personally witnessed a seed actually being planted in the earth, and which seed not only then immediately sprouts and grows before their very eyes, but ve ry soon thereafter also yields fruits that could actually be pl ucked and even tasted. All of this occurred in just a few moments. This “phenomena” was accomplished by the use of the mo st intense use of the powers of concentration and imagination by Fa kirs who used these powers to such focused, single pointed and pr ofound effect, that the objects of their intense powers of concentr ation and imagination actually manifest for all to see, sense and experience in the physical world. To control your thoughts is to ex ercise a much higher level of control over every aspect of your life with all of the profound"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 411 resultant benefits. Lack of concentration and control over thoughts generally can be likened to pierci ng a sheet of thin paper with a blunt pencil; piercing a sheet of paper with a blunt pencil will prove to be difficult, and the paper will very often simply tear. However if the pencil is sharp, the point w ill pierce the sheet of paper very easily indeed leaving a small neat hole. The same situation can be applied to concentrat ion; if concentration is blunt and undisciplined and th e Mind is crowded by hundreds of thoughts, the Mind will be equally blunt and ineffective, and accomplishing any single objective or indeed anything at all worthwhile will be very difficult indeed or quite often impossible to do. If on the other hand the concentration of the Mind is sharp and single pointed, then the entire Energy of the point is focused in one place on one single intended action, and the results will be that much more effective. The stronger, more focused and single pointed your concentration, the mo re powers and abilities you will enjoy in controlling every aspect of your life, ongoing evolution, and therefore your own personal hap piness, peace and harmony. The ultimate objective of concentrati on is to attain a state of “single pointedness” of Mind. Such si ngle pointedness is the total, complete and unwavering focus on either one single thought, or very often no specific thoughts at a ll; in other words a focus on a total emptiness of Mind, totally devoid of all thoughts of any kind. Such a complete concentration on emptiness of Mind is fundamental to another very important ability, that of meditation, the benefits of which are profound, numerous and extremely valuable. A highly developed abilit y of concentration will also assist in the processes of Astral Projecti on, OBE, healing and many other powers of the Mind. Although almost anyone can develop high levels of concentration and willpower there are certain ba rriers to success that should be taken into account. Any inherent physical or mental weaknesses brought about for example by an ongoing illness, can effect concentration. At the same time such conditions can fortunately be"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 412 healed, as we will also discuss later. A lifestyle too filled with a wide range of activities can also make it difficult to achieve the ability of total concentration, the Mind of such a person always being preoccupied with thoughts pertaini ng to their ongoing activities. Such a person will also have diffi culty in finding the time and motivation required to put aside the necessary time each day.   "},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 413 Chapter 74: The Practice of Concentration Initially concentration can be practiced from any sufficiently relaxed position. Ultimately however, once a good degree of concentration has been achieved, the ability can be taken to a much higher level with a more formal posture such as for meditation, a subject we will discuss in much more detail later. You should ideally start by devoting at least ten minutes each day to these exercises, later increasing to at least thirty minutes each day if possible. There are several progressive stages involved in achieving a high level of concentration abilities. First of all you need to ensure you are completely relaxed, ideally by performing deep physical relaxation exercises. As previously mentioned, once your levels of concentration and will power have reac hed a certain leve l it will no longer be necessary to perform formal relaxation exercises, you will be able to sit in your upright chair, take up your posture with back completely straight and relax instant ly simply by willing to do so; everything must comply with your will but this first requires the necessary level of concentration. The following concentration ex ercises are progressive. It will accordingly prove to be counterproductive to move on to the next exercise until the previous exer cise has been successfully and fully accomplished. Sit straight up in hard chair, spine absolutely vertical, not leaning back, knees together and hands face down on your knees or thighs and proceed as follows: Exercise 1: Close your eyes and count backwards in your Mind from 100 to 0. Should you miss any numbers go back to 100 and start over again. You should be abl e to do this 10 times in a row before proceeding to the next exercise. Exercise 2: Close your eyes and count backwards from 100 in increments of two. In other words count backwar ds 100, 98, 96, 94, 92, 90 and so on down to 0. Shoul d you miss any numbers start"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 414 again from 100. You should be able to succeed with this exercise 10 times in a row before proceeding to the next exercise. Exercise 3: Repeat exercise 2, but this time counting backwards in increments of three; 100, 97, 94, 91 and so on. As before should you miss any numbers you must st art over again. You should be able to succeed with this exer cise 10 times in a row before proceeding to the next exercise. Exercise 4: Select any word of your choice, an interesting one is better, and continuously repeat the same word over and over again in your Mind. Should another word enter your Mind then start over again. When you can repeat the same word in your Mind for at least 10 minutes without interrupti on this exercise is complete. Exercise 5: Select a convenient object such as a fruit, and spend at least 10 minutes examining it from all sides. You must apply your entire unwavering attention to this exercise, the objective being to memorise the object as complete ly and in as much detail as possible. Examine the object from all angles, not allowing any other thoughts to intrude within your Mind while doing so. Your entire focus and attention should be examining a nd memorising your chosen object in as much detail as you possi bly can. Only when you have completely memorized this object should you move on to the next exercise. Exercise 6: Close your eyes, concentrate, and visualise your chosen object from Exercise 5 as r ealistically as possible. Visualize the object exactly as it appeared when you were previously examining it, making it appear so lifelike in fact that you believe you can easily reach out and touch it. Should you have difficulty with this return to exercise 5 and me morise the object for a further 10 minutes. This is an extremely val uable exercise for many of the abilities we will be discussing later. Once you have successfully completed this exercise with the original object, repeat exactly the"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 415 same exercise again with a range of different objects of various shapes, sizes and colours. Exercise 7: Obtain a fruit of your choice and divide it into sections. Examine your fruit thoroughly, not only with your visual senses but also with your senses of smell, t ouch and taste. Exam ine it visually, smell it, feel it and taste it, committing all of these received impressions to memory in as mu ch vivid detail as possible. Exercise 8: Close your eyes and imagine exactly how the fruit appeared while previously examining it utilising all of your senses; sight, smell, taste and touch. Imagine you can smell, taste and feel the texture of the fruit thereby completely re-creating it in your Mind. The fruit should appear to be so solid and lifelike that you desire to actually reach out and eat it. As with the previous exercises should you not be able to achieve task this at the first attempt then go back to Exercise 7 and embed the characteri stics of the fruit in your Mind as firmly as possible once agai n before progressing on with Exercise 9. It is most important not to proceed with any exercise until the previous one is complete. Exercise 9: Close your eyes and imag ine you can hear the sound of a clock ticking loudly. The ticking must seem totally real as if there actually is a clock in your room. Once you have established the sound of the clock realistically ticking in your imagination, maintain the ticking for a full 10 minutes without interruption. If your concentration is broken and you miss a few ticks of the clock, you should either start over again or leave the exercise for another day until you can imagine the ticking with total reality for a full 10 minutes. Exercise 10 : The objective of this final exercise is to achieve a total emptiness of Mind, a total void of all thoughts. This is an extremely valuable state to be able to achi eve, and is the basis for achieving"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 416 many inner abilities, and should t herefore be practiced for as long as it takes to perfect this ab ility which is also the basis of meditation. Close your eyes, relax, and vigorously reject any thoughts attempting to enter your Mind. At fi rst this might seem difficult as thought after thought tries to encroach upon your imposed silence. If thoughts do encroach upon your s ilence, rather than feeling distracted or even frustrated, simply passively observe the thoughts and allow them to drift through y our Consciousness without giving them any focus. If you do latch onto a thought and start to give it any sort of importance it will then occupy yo ur Mind and might well prove to be very difficult to remove. The objective of this exercise is to hold your Consciousness totally and completely clear of all thoughts whatsoever for at least ten minutes. This exercise might well take several weeks of practicing for at least ten minutes each day before fully achieved. It should be stressed however that this final ex ercise is extremely useful and important in the developm ent of a wide range of inner abilities, and should ideally be practiced daily unt il perfected. Even tually it will become possible to maintain this state of Mind for as long as you wish, and certainly for many hours at a time, during which profound experiences can occur. Having successfully completed a ll of these exercises, your concentration and willpower will hav e increased considerably and will prove to be an excellent asset in the future. It is most important however to maintain the practice of these exercises regularly, ideally every day, otherwise you could very easily start to diminish your powers of concentration. S hould this happen repeat whichever exercises are necessary in order to bring your concentration levels back to those of exercise 10 once again; you should be able to achieve total vacancy of Mind at will. Having acquired the most valuable ability of total concentration at will, it is also highly beneficial to be able to control all of your"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 417 thought processes throughout the day. This involves focusing your thoughts exclusively on whatever it is you are doing at any particular moment in time and never allowing your thoughts to wander on to other matters. Remember: focused thought is extremely powerful, but scattered, random, transient thoughts will result in the same effects and not hing worthwhile will be achieved. Such focus of thought might seem difficult at first; most people tend to naturally let their Minds wande r as a lifetime habit, however with perseverance ongoing control of thoughts will in turn become a habit which will find yourself do ing subconsciously without even thinking about it. Thought control will further enhance your concentration abilities and will also sharpen your levels of Consciousness and powers of memory, as well as other valuable a ttributes of the Mind and Spirit, attributes that will ena ble you to assume full control over your daily life as well as your ongoing personal evolution. Finally we will conclude this section with three high-level concentration exercises that ar e indeed a challenge, and truly are tests of absolute concentration and willpower. These exercises are by no means absolutely necessary fo r the developing inner abilities, but for those who relish a challenge and wish to develop powers of concentration to a very high level indeed, they are most worthwhile. These exercises, involving the abi lity often known as Telekinesis might even seem impossible to some people, but please be absolutely assured that they mo st certainly ar e indeed both possible and achievable. The candle flame : Before commencing this first exercise it is most important to ensure that you are totally physically and mentally relaxed and focused with no distractions or potential distractions whatsoever. The previous concentration exercises must have be been fully accomplished."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 418 For this exercise an ordinary candle is required. Place the candle safely on a table in its holder on a surface before you. While remaining as relaxed and as fo cused as possibl e, and while keeping your Mind completely clear of all thoughts not associated with the task in hand, sit in your chair with your elbows resting firmly on the table and with your chin cupped in your hands. Now focus exclusively on the candle flame with complete, unwavering concentration. Take some time to completely relax, focusing entirely on the candle flame while seeing and thinking about nothing else whatsoever; your thoughts should be totally focused upon the flame flickeri ng before you. When you have achieved the required state of Mind use all of your concentration and willpower to move the candle flam e. It is very important while you are doing this to imagine, as realistically as possible and without any doubts in your Mind w hatsoever that the flame has already moved in the desired direct ion in accordance with your will. Never imagine that it will move; y ou have to know that it has already moved beyond any possible doubt in your Mind. By using your willpower and concent ration to move the flame while imagining with total certainty that it has already moved in the required direction you will infl uence Energy beyond the physical limitations of space and time to comply with the will of your Mind, manifesting the desired result as a physical reality. Remember always that thought is Energy and the En ergy of your thoughts will influence other Energy on order to manifest your desires; this applies to everything in the Universe in all spheres of life and reality. You must also kn ow beyond any doubt in your own Mind that not only that you can achi eve this but in fact you have already achieved it. At first the flame might appear to move only such a small distance as to be ha rdly perceptible. Never have any doubts however that you have i ndeed moved the flame, and continue to move it more. "},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 419 You might succeed at the very first attempt with this exercise or it might take some days or even weeks. With practice however moving the candle flame with your Mind, a process known in the physical world as telekinesis, it will become progressively easier. This is an excellent exercise for increasing concentration and willpower as well as for underst anding the importance and effects of the inner Energy and powers involved. When doing any of these exercises it is extremely important indeed to remember there is no such concept as “try”. “Try” is a word of total weakness, and one which should be completely elimi nated from your thoughts, actions and vocabulary at all times; in developing these inner, valuable abilities, we never, ever “try”, we always “know” beyond any doubt in our Minds whatsoever that we have already completely and totally succeeded with our objectives. Once you have succeeded in moving the candle flame from side to side, move it up and down. W hen you have succeeded with that, extinguish the candle flame using your powers of concentration and willpower alone, always remembering to imagine the flame is already extinguished. When you have succeeded in extinguishing the candle flame, re-light it agai n. You will soon find with regular practice you can exercise total control over the candle flame using the focused powers of your Mind and concentration alone. This process is known as “telekinesis” or “psychokinesis”. The Psi wheel: This is another exercise in telekinesis, achieved once again by means of exercising complete control over your powers of will and concentration. As with the candle exercise it is highly advisable to ensure you ar e totally relaxed and completely focused on your objectives before proceeding. For this exercise you will need a drawing pin, sometimes known as a “thumb tack”, and a piece of whit e cardboard. Pl ace the drawing pin flat end downwards on a table. Next, cut out a square from the sheet of white cardboard of approx imately one quarter of an inch by one quarter of an inch. Now very care fully place the square of white"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 420 cardboard on the point of the drawin g pin, also known as a thumb tack, so it balances completely. This then is your basic Psi wheel, and you are now ready to commence with this exercise in concentration and telekinesis. Again, before starting please ensu re you are totally relaxed and focused on the task in hand with no extraneous thoughts in your Mind whatsoever. It is well worthw hile to perform the vacancy of Mind exercise before commencing in order to tune your Mind into the task ahead. Place your elbows lightly on the t able and sit with your chin cupped in your hands a short distance from your Psi wheel. Now cause the square of cardboard to turn around by using your powers of will and concentration alone; this can be achieved by concentrating deeply on one corner of the cardboard square and imagine that it has already moved in the desired dire ction. You can also imagine a hand or a white beam of light orig inating between your eyebrows, your third eye or brow chakra reaching out and pushing the cardboard square around while knowi ng beyond any doubt that it is already moving. Again, as with the candle flame exer cise it is very important to imagine and know beyond any doubt w hatsoever that the square of cardboard is already actually moving around in the desired direction. When you succeed the cardboard square will start to noticeably, physically move on its axis, the tip of the drawing pin. It might only start to move extremely slowly but perceptibly at first, but with practice the psi wheel can be made to sp in faster and faster uintil it is spinning like a fan. When you achieve this you will feel a great sense of satisfaction and accomplishment and a knowing beyond any doubt that your ability is very real which indeed of course it is. In order to be totally convinced of your powers of tele kinesis you can also place the psi wheel in a transparent, clear box or other container and place a lid on the top of the container so the psi wheel is completely sealed"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 421 from external influences. When y ou do your telekinetic psi wheel exercises with the psi wheel sealed in the cl ear box you will again notice the psi wheel still turns as before even though there can be no possible external physical influenc es. Physical matter of any sort represents no barrier whatsoever to the powers of the Mind and the Energy of the Universe that pervade everyone and everything without any exceptions, only differing by Energy configurations as influenced by Mind, and the relative rate of vibrations. The floating needle : For this third exercise you will requ ire a wide glass or bowl of water, an average sized needle and some heavy grease with which to coat the needle. Proceed then as follows. Place the glass or bowl on a table and fill it with water very near to the rim. Allow the surface of the water to settle completely. Next, grease the needle completely ensuring it is fully coated and very gently place the needle upon the surf ace of the water so it floats upon the surface tension. Allow the needle to settle until it is completely still and floating in the centre of the container. As with the first two exercises you must fi rst ensure you are totally relaxed and completely focused on the task in hand before proceeding. Sit with your elbows resting on t he surface of the table and with your chin cupped in your hands , and then using all of your willpower and powers of concentration cause the needle to move across the surface of the water. As with the previous exercises you can imagine a beam of light or hand projecting from between your eyes, your brow chakra, reaching out to the needle and pushing it across the surface of the water. Again, it is very important to imagine to the extent that there is no possib le doubt in your Mind whatsoever the needle has already moved across the surface of the water and has already reached the other side. As with the first two exercises, total unwavering willpower, focus and concentration are required in order to accomplish this"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 422 successfully. You might fi nd you succeed with this exercise at your first attempt or you might find it takes several weeks of practice. Please do not be discouraged, the sense of satisfaction of gaining this telekinetic ability is very we ll worth the effort, and your powers of concentration will have further advanced. Having succeeded in causing the needle to move across the surface of the water now cause it to spin around. As with the psi wheel all you need to do to achieve this is to focus on one end of the needle and t hen push it around using all of your imagination, willpower and concentration, and if necessary by imagining a beam of light or a hand orig inating from between your eyes pushing the needle around. As before, you must know the needle is already spinning round in accordance with your total will and concentration. Having succeeded with that exercise you will find you can make the needle move exactly in accordance with your will. It is most important that pursuin g these abilities should always be alone and solely for the benefit of your own individual development. Never, ever, ever seek to impress others with public demonstrations otherwise your focu s, abilities and progress will be very adversely affected. Your own development is very individually focused, while most importantly of course always being willing to assist others with any aspect of thei r life or personal development is appropriate or asked to do so. Ther e are those living on Earth with powers of the Mind that most people cannot even begin to comprehend, but these people never speak of their abilities or perform in public, and that is mo st definitely a wise position to follow. All these exercise are extremely valuable for developing powers of concentration, powers that are extremely important for all inner abilities, including those to be discussed next. "},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 423 Chapter 75: Meditation Meditation is without question one of the most worthwhile and valuable practices anyone can undertake on a regular and ideally daily basis. Many people however st ill tend to associate meditation with a perceived far eastern mystical practice whereby a person will sit on the floor in an impossibl e looking position, surrounded by candles and burning incense while c hanting a mantra. In actual fact meditation for the vast majority of pr actitioners is nothing like this at all. Meditation is a daily habit for millions of people the world over within all cultures and all walks of life, and more people join the ranks of meditation every day as they discover the very considerable values and benefit s of this ancient practice. Let it be said straightaway t hat there is absolutely no need whatsoever for such notional complicated postures, candles, incense or any other m ystical instrument or practice. Meditation can be performed almost anywhere at any time of the day, providing it is in a place which offers the nec essary freedom from distractions. So what exactly are the benefits of meditation? To start with meditation calms the Mind and relaxe s and dissolves tension from the body. In the longer term the Mind begins to experience much higher levels of peace, tranquilit y and serenity, not only during meditation itself but al so during daily life. T here is a progressive and profound increase in happiness, tolerance, love, understanding, fearlessness, and inner powers and abilities. With meditation the powers of c oncentration increase and the Mind becomes progressively sharper and more under control, including freedom from unwanted thoughts, emotions and influences, and with a much higher ability to enjoy the present moment. There are many further such tangible benefits, but in short, meditation greatly strengthens the body, Soul and Spirit resulting in a higher quality of life. "},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 424 There are also other important benefits that might seem less obvious. While in a state of deep meditation you are open to the inner realms of reality and Energy thereby making it possible to contact and communicate with beings of the inner realms, including but not limited to Spirit guides, p eople residing in the Astral words who have passed on from Earth, and even your Higher-Self or Holy Guardian Angel. These contacts c an be extremely valuable indeed, with information, intuition, insights, advice, encouragement and much more, all assisting considerably in daily life. During deep meditation, you can ask questions, and receive answers on issues of importance to you. Remember, space and time simply do not exist in the inner realms of life and reality, and accordingly the beings and people dwelling there have access to the past, present and future, as well as to vast repositories of information maintained in huge Astr al libraries and of course the Akashic record of the Causal sphere of the Universe. Most meditation techniques have one ultimate objective; to achieve complete silence of the Mind and therefore to reach the real “I” level of pure awareness, resulting in a more direct channel of communication with your inner-sel f and a greater, more profound connection with The Source, Ou r Divine Creator, God. Again, we must always keep in Mind that w hen meditating we are focusing inwards to our Soul and Sp irit as well as to the inner realms of life and reality. It should be kept in Mind therefore that the inner realms are actually identical to what are often referred to as the “higher” realms; it is simply a matter of perspective. Most people talk of “higher realms”, hi gher “levels”, “planes”, “worlds”, “spheres” and so on, but these ar e actually inner states of Consciousness, vibration and Ener gy, the physical world being the outermost “shell”, the physical epide rmis of the Universe existing at the highest density and the lowest vibration. As the great quantum physicist David Bohm succinctly obs erved, the outermost layer of the Universe, the physical Universe as observed by science is as “frozen light”. Although Astral and Mental worlds therefore may be"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 425 considered to be higher relative to the physical worlds, they are in reality all progressively inner wo rlds with our The Source Energy, The First Cause, God at the very centre. The observable, physical Universe as known to science is merely a very small fraction of the glories of the entire Univ erse in all its spheres of life and reality. It is in meditation that we reach far beyond the ephemeral, maya, illusion of the physical world of matter and indeed the Astral worlds, to focus far inwards towards the source, eventually realizing a complete oneness with The Source. When performing meditation, Astral Projection or in deed any other journey beyond the physical world, this is really an inner journey to inner states of Energy, vibration and being.   "},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 426 Chapter 76: The Practice of Meditation In order to meditate effectively, a sufficient degree of concentration is required, and is one reason why this ex tremely important ability was discussed in depth the previous section. Without concentration it will be very difficult indeed to adequately silence the Mind and therefore to achieve anything worthwhile during meditation. It is very important to meditate sitting in a totally upright position with your spine completely straight as practiced with the concentration exercises. Medi tation cannot be effectively accomplished while lying on a bed or reclining or even leaning back in a comfortable chair. If sitti ng on a chair during meditation it is best to sit totally upright, spine ab solutely vertical on a hard backed chair, a dining chair for example, with your legs and knees firmly together and your hands palms down on your thighs. Alternatively sitting cross-legged on the floor, to tally upright with spine totally straight is also an excellent pos ition for meditation. It is not necessary to formally use an exotic position such as t he full or half Lotus, but you may of course do so if you wish. It is fine in the very early stages to sit on a pillow to make yourself more comfortable, but never sit with your back against the backrest of a chair, or indeed against any other support; your back and therefore your spine must be absolutely straight and totally unsupported. Your hands should be positioned with your palms facing downwards and resting lightly on your thighs. It is a good idea to meditate in the same place and at the same time of day where you will not be disturbed. Although such items as candles, incense and other materials are not at all strictly required, you might very well find them to be useful in setting the specific meditative mood and focusing of y our Mind. By using for example certain scented candles or incens e, these will become associated with your meditation time and might therefore assist you in reaching the required level of Consciousness and relaxation more quickly and effectively. This is a matte r of personal choice entirely."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 427 Next perform some deep breathing exercises for example those discussed earlier in this section in order to help you to achieve the required level of relaxation, and to help you to focus your Mind away from mundane matters. Breathing in for a slow count of five, holding your breath for a slow count of five, and breathing out for a further slow count of five is exce llent for helping to achieve a good level of relaxation before commenci ng meditation. Repeat this five times initially, and more if you feel it is beneficial. While performing the breathing ex ercises you can also imagine inhaling pure, glowing or sparklin g white light, and exhaling through your nose grey light containing an y tension or negat ivity stored in your body. When you are totally rela xed and sitting totally upright in the meditation position, use all of your powers of concentration to empty your Mind of al l thoughts; only a complete vacancy of Mind should prevail. Should you have difficulty in achieving this immediately at first, you can reach this state of concentration and state of Consciousness in stages over time. It really does not matter how many sessions it takes to achieve the total vacancy of Mind state, but reach it you must in order to be able to meditate effectively, and the sooner the be tter. The previously discussed concentration exercises are an exce llent way of achieving complete vacancy of Mind, and it is str ongly recommended you complete the concentration exercises before commencing the practice of meditation. To commence with your meditation assume your chosen meditation position, attain the necessary degree of deep physical relaxation by performing the breathing exercises and then begin to observe your thoughts as they pass through your Mind. It is very important not to participate in these thoughts, temp ting though it might be, but to merely be a passive observer, a cknowledging the thoughts as they occur but then allowing them to simply drift by without further involvement. Again, it is most import ant not to attach yourself to any thought and become involved with it. Continue this exercise for as long as you can but ideally for at least ten minutes each day; at"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 428 least thirty minutes each day being your ideal objective. When you first commence this exercise yo u might be besiege d with thoughts, particularly if you have not prac ticed the concentration exercises first, and it is strongly suggested that you do, however from session to session the number of thoughts will diminish until they finally become few and far between. This might well only take a week or might take several weeks or even months depending on your individual circumstances and levels of relaxation, concentration and focus. You can reinforce this process throughout the day by pur suing the same procedure as suggested for part of the concent ration exercises, only thinking about what you are doing at any particular moment in time. Do not allow any extraneous thoughts to ent er your head and interfere with your current task. For example, if you are driving your car, think only about driving your car and do not allow your Mind to wander to other unrelated matters. The same applies for any activity whether it be shopping, your job of work , cooking a meal and so on. Always focus exclusively on the task in hand to the total exclusion of all other thoughts. This will assist greatly in thought control and strengthen your powers of concentration. The next stage in the proc ess of learning to meditate is to select a single thought or object of your own choice and to hold the thought or image in your Mind for as l ong as possible. This might for example be a memory of a place you enjoy visiting, a memorable holiday or any other happy memory. It might be easier at first to visualize a familiar object such as a favourite picture or an item of household furniture, or the image of a loved one. It does not need to be something you are actively in volved with or interested in, any object will do as the objec t of your visualization such as a fruit, candle, cup or other such familia r item. Having decided on the object of your thought, assume your meditation posture by sitting in your chair or on the floor with back totally straight, and after any relaxation and breathing exercises bring the thought or image firmly into your Mind as realistically and with as much presence as possible. Ideally your thought or image should fill your entire Mind."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 429 If any other thoughts attempt to in trude then with all the will power you can summon reject that ex traneous thought immediately and bring your Mind firmly back to your intended thought or image. It is very important indeed to immediately reject any intruding thought the very moment it tries to join your chosen thought or image. You will find this exercise will become progressively easier over time, with your thought or image becom ing stronger, and with less and less intruding thoughts which will become easier to reject. When you can hold your thought or image vividly and solidly in your Mind for ten minutes without waveri ng or any intruding thoughts the final stage is to be able to dismiss that thought or im age at will right at the end of your meditation session, leaving you with a full vacancy of Mind where the image once existed. Hold you Mind empty of your chosen thought or image for a few moments before gently raising your Consciousness back to the physical level. After this has been fully accomplished, for future sessions you can proceed to the full meditation stage; full vacancy of Mind. This step involves assuming your meditation posture and rather than holding a thought or image in your Mind, hold your Mind totally devoid of all thoughts not allowing any thought to intrude. In the beginning you might find the occasi onal thought attempts to intrude into your silence; if it does simply use all of you willpower to reject it immediately. When you can achiev e this stage you are now ready to meditate effectively. As an interim stage in your medi tation learning process, you can commence your meditations with a single chosen thoug ht or image, and then after a couple of minutes or so remove the thought or image and proceed with a complete vacancy of Mind. After a time you will find it will be possible to omit the thought or image of the scene or object altogether and pr oceed immediately with a complete vacancy of Mind from the outset of the meditation session. Having achieved this level of c oncentration and emptiness of Mind you can now proceed to meditate effectively. A meditation session"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 430 should ideally be at least twent y minutes, but less will suffice initially. This however is only the beginning as you will discover naturally as you progress; each meditation session will progressively deepen your inner awareness. Remember you are focusing inwards towards The Source and not to some “higher” level relative to The Source. As previously mentioned, when we refer to the “higher” worlds and states of life and being, these are actually inner states relative to the physical world and physical body , with the highest vibr ation of The Source, The First Cause of God at the very center, and the lowest vibration of Energy at the outermost level, the physical, material level from where meditation commences. Your focus should therefore be inwards towards the Astral and Spir itual worlds, your Higher-Self, and ultimately with the highest and most Divine, God. With time and dedicated daily pr actice meditation will come progressively deeper and with more profound levels of inner awareness, soon becoming a very bli ssful experience, bringing with it the potential for the profound benefits described earlier. Ideally while meditating you should reach a stage where you completely lose contact with the feeling of your physical senses body and surroundings, being totally focu sed on the inner states of Consciousness. This is an ideal state to r each and should be your immediate objective. Meditation should become a daily habit, and one that you should always look forward to. There is no fixed duration of time for meditation; some people meditate fo r up to thirty minutes each day, while others might meditate for several hours at a time or even for a full day, completely absorbed in their inner Consciousness. During the process of deep meditati on situations might occur that you should be aware of. These sit uations often involve imagery to varying degrees and intensity. One of these is often known as the “TV screen”, or “cinema screen” effe ct. This is exactly the same effect as frequently occurs during t he Astral Projection process as"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 431 discussed previously. This “screen” is actually a “window” into the Astral planes. Should this situat ion occur you have two choices; either to observe the screen and to simply learn from these visions and what they mean to you, or y ou can alternatively convert the meditation into a full Astral Projec tion by imagining yourself moving towards the screen as it becomes larger and larger, eventually passing straight through the image in the screen into the Astral worlds. If you choose to do this, proceed as for an Astral Projection as discussed in the previous section. It is also quite possible, and quite often occurs with some people in particular that the meditation can become a full out of body experience. The first signs of this would usually be the ability to “see” through your closed eyelids. This means that your Etheric body has already moved out of phase with your physical body as happens during a normal sleep cycle. You are actually viewing your surroundings with your inner senses rather then through your actual physical eyes. Should this occur you can maintain an absolute concentration and remain in a state of meditation, or you can simply decide to leave your body in order to enjoy the out of body experience. If you do decide on t he OBE, then proceed as for the chapter on OBE. If you decide to remain concentrating on your meditation, then your Etheric visi on might either remain, it might fade, or very often, as your vibrat ions rise it will give way to the “viewing” of the Astral worlds, in which case you might proceed as described above. As this is a meditation session it is preferable to choose the “viewing” option rather than converting to a full Astral Projection or an OBE, but the choice is always yours. It is always the best to follow your inner guidance. Much can be learned by simply observing the Astral images displaye d before you, and in particular any associated symbolism. While meditating and focusing on y our inner awareness your Mind is also tuned into the inner worlds of the Astral and Spiritual planes; this can be at any level depending on your level of vibration that will"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 432 always correspond to the level of the Universe your Consciousness is focused within. This focus and awareness can frequently result in communications with beings such as Spirit guides, deceased relatives or even your Higher-Sel f. These possibilities are one of the most valuable aspects of m editation. Should you make contact with these Beings you will clearly “ hear” their voices in your head, often just as clearly as if they were speaking to you in the physical world. You might also “see” the beings you are communicating with by means of clairvoyance. It is most useful to engage in two-way communication when these opport unities arise; much can be learned about the inner realities and in particul ar about yourself and your life situations, but always d epending on the precise nature of the Being you are communicating with. Communication is performed mentally by telepathy, either in the form of words, images or both. You can ask questions simply by thinking or imagining your questions as clearly as possible, and the answers will arrive back in a similar way. As you progressively absorb yourself into your meditation your brainwave frequencies will progressively slow down. This also happens quite naturally from time to time during the day according to the type of activity you are engaged in at the time, but more usually occurs before going to sleep at night where the brain passes through all of the decreas ing frequencies un til you go to sleep completely. The highest brai nwave frequencies occur in the normal waking state; this is known as the “beta” state characterized by very fast frequencies of bet ween 13Hz and 40Hz. If brainwaves slow down somewhat, as often happens while for example daydreaming during the day, and which will usually happen as meditation progresses, the “alpha” brainwave state is reached. This alpha state is characterised by brainwave frequencies in the order of between 7Hz and 13Hz. During meditation or trance work , after sufficient practice and experience, brainwaves can slow down even further to the “theta” state, characterized by brainwaves of a frequency of 3.5Hz to 7Hz."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 433 Theta level is the most profoundly clear and focused state; many people experience profound inspirati on, intuition, ideas and other thoughts while in the thet a state, originating bot h from beings of the inner spheres and from the Higher-Sel f. Theta is also the state of vivid imagery where the powers of imagination and visualization are particularly profound. For answers to questions, manifest ation, healing, to be discussed later in this book, theta would be t he ideal state to achieve. There have been famous scientists in the past who would place themselves into such a deep st ate of concentration and depth of thought that they would reach the theta state. Indeed, many such famous scientists have intentionally invoked the theta state for maximum inspiration and creativity . This has resulted in many important inventions and theories, a notable example being the “special theory of relativity” which was postulated by Albert Einstein while in a deep thinking theta state of Mind. Meditation in general, and in particular deep, highly focused meditation with a high degree of concentration is an excellent way to achieve answers to almost anything at all. These answers will often originate from your Higher-Self, that part of you that is in the most direct contact with God, an d these are all messages that are totally reliable. The Higher-Self is sublime, it knows everything that “Is”, and is mostly concerned with y our evolution. An y inspiration, intuition or message from the Highe r-Self is unmistakable for what it is, and must always be acted upon without question, always. Failure to act on inspiration from the Higher-Self will either lead to no result, or sometimes, worse, suffering. These are just a few of the nu merous possibilities and benefits resulting from deep meditation. For many people, particularly of the Far Eastern cultures, the ultimate objective of true meditation is to achieve such a profound level of inner Consciousness as to become one with the very highest of the Spiritual planes, a state mystically known as “Samadhi”. Those who achieve this state of extreme bliss, approaching the inne rmost levels of Energy and"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 434 vibration know beyond any doubts that everything in the Universe is indeed one, and that ev erything and everyone is an integral part of “everything that Is”, The Source, God. One of the most important aspects of the practice of meditation is to remain totally focused with maximu m possible concentration, while maintaining your Mind free of all thoughts and external influences, and to accept and to l earn from any inner sit uation arising. These include all of the possi bilities previously di scussed, but there are indeed many other possibilities. Ma intain clarity of Mind and be prepared for any experience occurri ng during meditation from which valuable lessons can be learned and in formation or intuition gained. You will very soon find that your daily meditation is something you look forward to, and your meditation sessions will become progressively longer and more prof ound with practice. Dedication, commitment, and daily practice ar e keys to the practice of successful meditation.  "},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 435 Chapter 77: Twin-Hearts Meditation Twin Hearts is a special variat ion of meditation, and one most certainly deserving of a particular mention. Although not exactly the same as meditation in the norma lly accepted terms, Twin-Hearts nevertheless is profoundly valuable for the planet, all mankind, and indeed the practitioner, and is very well worth practicing frequently. This meditation is bas ed upon the principle that the Energy centers of the Etheric Body, the chakra’s , are gateways to expanded levels of Consciousness. For the purposes of the Twin-Hearts meditation the principle chakras involved ar e the crown chakra and the heart chakra. The objective of this special medi tation is to bless the Earth with loving kindness through the crown and heart chakra’s, which in turn become channels for your Spiritual Energy. In turn you will be blessed many times in accordance with the Universal law of Cause and Effect; it is in giving you will also receive. Many practitioners of the Twin Hearts meditation have reported heightened levels of intuition, increased healing powers, sharper and more organized mental facultie s, inner peace, loving kindness, compassion, enhanced Spiritual service, brighter and more balanced aura, larger chakra’s, enhanced communication with the inner spheres and Higher-Self, the development of clairvoyance and other inner psychic abilities, healthier physical body, more success in life with less stress, and a more balanced personality. The practice of The Twin Hearts meditation: It is useful first of all to perform some physical exercises of your choice for around five minutes in order to cleanse and energise your Energy Body. Sit in your usual meditation posture, either on the floor or sitting on a chair with your legs and knees together, back and spine"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 436 absolutely straight, and your hands turned down and resting on your thighs. Next mentally request with as much clarity and sincerity as possible Divine blessings for guidance, hel p, protection and illumination. Now activate your heart chakra si mply by becoming aware of it; you should feel your heart chakra acti vate, with a feeling of warmth and Unconditional Love emanating from your entire chest area. Next send sincere blessings from your heart to the entire planet Earth, including every pers on and every being, with loving kindness, great joy, happiness , Divine peace, understanding, harmony and goodwill. Next activate your crown chakra located across the top of your head, again simply by becoming aw are of it. As with the heart chakra you should feel a pleasant, warm glow or similar sensations emanating across the crown of your head. Again send blessings to the planet Earth through your crow n chakra just as you did from your heart chakra. Allow yourself to become a channel of Divine love and kindness, great joy, happiness, understanding, harmony and Divine peace, sharing these with the whole pl anet Earth. When projecting your blessings it is important to feel and appreciate the implications of each and every thought, feeling and word. Next, meditate and bless the Eart h with loving-kindness through the both the heart and crown chakras simultaneously. This will align both chakras thereby making the blessing much more powerful. Next gently imagine a brilliant white or golde n light on the crown of your head. Become aware of and remain aware of this light, the inner stillness and the bliss for a few minutes, and then gently and silently chant the mant ra “Om” or “Amen”. "},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 437 When meditating on the in terval between the “Om ” ' or “Amen”, simultaneously be aware of the ligh t, the stillness, and the bliss, and let go completely. Continue this meditation for about ten minutes before slowly bringing back your awareness to your physical body. Raise your hands facing outward to your chest level. Now release excess Energy by blessing the planet Ea rth with light, loving-kindness, peace and prosperity for several minut es until you feel your body is normalized. You may bless specific persons or your family and friends after releasi ng the excess Energy. Finally, after this meditation is complete, always give thanks to God, your Higher-Self and to your Spiritual guides for their Divine blessings. After completing this meditation it is advisable to ground yourself by gently performing some physical exercises for a few minutes. This concludes the se ction on meditation. Those who practice meditation with dedication, sincer ity and commitment will very soon realise and enjoy most prof ound benefits, and henceforth meditation will become a time to look forward to and enjoy each and every day.  "},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 438 Chapter 78: The Human Paradox It is a very powerful fact that the vast majority of people in the world today are failing to achieve their full potential, happiness, wealth, health and desires through a comple te lack of understanding of the way in which the Universe operates in its immutable, perfect, loving way. When we choose to incarnate into the physical world we do so in full knowledge of who our parents will be, what challenges in the next physical life we will be faced with, and the determination to realise, understand and to meet those challenges, thereby learning vital lessons, to evolve Spiritua lly and to achieve total joy while doing so. It is only in achieving these and other im portant objectives can we be fully aligned with T he Source, our Creator, God. We are all expressions of God, expressed in all spheres of existence with Unconditional Love and natural, instinctive, powerful desire to evolve, ultimately back to God as a perfected aspect of God. This is indeed the absolute tr ue meaning of all lif e of which we are all inseparable aspects. We ar e all, each and every one of us immortal, Spiritual, Divine Beings joyfully journeying along the path back to God Who first gave us the precious gift of Life. Over the years however mankind has steadily, a nd increasingly turned its back away from The Source, our Creator, God, and towards an alternative existence involving gross materialism, dogma and indoctrination, thereby becoming the slave of mammon. Most people are influenced by such erroneous factors such as what is expected of them by those ar ound them, what other people think in the game of conforming to society and the “way things are done”, and above all by the trappings of ma terial desire, vanity and of the individual ego. It is only when an individual realises these truths and has the courage, strength and determination, all of which will be fully supported by the Universe, to face up to them can that individual"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 439 become truly free to fulfil his or her destiny with total joy, meaning and purpose, and to attract anythi ng and everything that they can possibly desire into their lives. In order to achieve this state of awareness it is necessary to consciously become an open channel through which the Universe, The Source, God can express in the physical world. This means always being totally open to the Un iverse and acting accordingly in the same direction. Most people t oday unfortunately do exactly the opposite by always endeavouring to conform and live up to the expectations of others, the pursuit of material gain, and forcing things in a perceived direction by physical means. Instead of being an open channel, a source of expr ession of God and of their Higher-Self, they simply think a bout everything too much with a desire to physically “do” things in an attempt to force things the way they want them to go, which very o ften is totally contrary to the flow of the Universe. Quite simply they have failed to “let go and let God” and as a direct result people suffer, fail to reach their full joyous potential and fail to evolve , thereby ensuring yet another incarnation on Earth in order to retu rn once again in order to fulfil everything that was failed to be fu lfilled in the previous lifetime. The vast majority of people incar nate on Earth today are within this cycle of birth, Earth life and transiti on back to the Astral worlds to review what has or has not been achieved before returning to Earth again in order to correct the c ounter-productive actions of the previous life, and of course to hopefully make progress towards the ultimate objective on the path back to The Source, The First Cause, God. Of course at the same time every single human without exception has to go through an evolutionary phase, often including hundreds of lives on Earth over the course of many t housands of years. This is a natural and necessary aspect of individual evolution. Without many cycles of Earth life experienc e it will not be easily possible to acquire the necessary level of Spiritual evolution and Energy vibration to continue along the path back to God. However, this"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 440 cycle of the Earth human race ha s been and is being protracted by many factors, including gro ss materialism, creed and dogma and the “human paradox”. Unfortunately, even in the 21 st century, society is still operating a system that has been in operation for centuries, thereby trapping people from a very young age in a cycle that prevents happiness, fulfilment and evolution. From the first day a chil d is born into what should be a glorious, joyful and fulfilling existence they are indoctrinated into the trappings of the material world. A child is taught to focus on the five physical senses, to behave in a certain way that precludes maintaining t heir still strong connections with the inner worlds from where they so recently arrived, and they are taught to treasure material things including toys representing what their parents hope they will materially become later in Earth life. Later children are told by parents, relatives and teachers that they must go to school in order to get the qualifications required in order to get a “job” so that they may work for the next 40 years before retiring on a pension, but only after the physical body, Mind and Spirit has often been traumatised to a high degree, and where they can live the remainder of their lives in the hope of surviving in a non-caring world for the most part. From the moment of birth the Mind of most children is shaped by parents based upon their own percepti on of what life “is all about”, and usually based upon their own current circumstances in terms of type of job, type of street and house to live in and many other factors, all based upon the situat ion and aspirations of parents, relatives and others. Many childr en are taught that it is wrong to aspire to a life that is outside of their “station in life” and they should focus on the lifestyle that t heir parents have always accepted. The Mind of a child at both conscious and subconscious levels is very impressionable, and it does not take many years of having the ideals of parents repeatedly conveyed for them for the subconscious of the child to accept it as reality, and from that point"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 441 onwards it will become the reality of the child just as it was for the parents. Finally, often sooner rather than later, old-age and failing health finally takes its toll and the we lcome release back to the non- physical worlds once again takes place. Once the transition to the Astral worlds has taken place during the process known erroneously as “death”, the Soul will have every opportunity to reflect on what might have been for t hat most recent Earth life, what was not accomplished and why, t hereby eventually resolving to return once again to Earth in order to achieve those same objectives the next time around. The Soul will then know that for t heir entire stay on Earth, rather than conforming to the hopes, as pirations and expectations of others based upon their own reality, they, as powerful Spiritual beings with freewill could have created any reality at all consistent with the lessons to be learned on Ea rth during physical life, and that there is really nothing at all they cannot be, do or have. Humanity is currently stuck in this paradox, a cycle of often what amounts to misery due to creating a reality that is not consistent with the true mission of the Soul, and it is not until this cycle is broken that everyone can find tr ue joy, fulfilment and happiness, and above all true evolution along t he path back to God, to Whom we all have the ultimate duty to return as perfected human beings made in the true Spiritual im age of our Divine creator. The current system of education and society originated three hundred or more years ago. It might well have worked back then but with society still enforcing th ese principles, supported by creed dogma and the indoctrination of parents, teachers and society generally, mankind has actually fail ed to progress as the Universe intends; people have failed to evolve with the joy and fulfilment of Spirit. "},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 442 Children are told to go to school, study certain subjects, achieve certain qualifications, get a certain job, and then work in a certain office, factory or other place of work in order to earn the basic money required for material things in order to satisfy the material and personal demands of the ego. The pressure to conform and go through this routine is usually so strong that most people quite simply cannot resist it, even if t hey knew the alternatives, the real reason they are here. People might say that money is necessary even to acquire the basics of survival such as food, cl othing and shelter. Yes of course this is true, but the fact is we are here to attract and enjoy unlimited wealth if desired, and not simply t he very basics for survival in the Earth life system. There is a very big difference however between “wealth” and “money” and it is this di stinction that has led so many people astray, continues to do so today, and will continue to do so until the Consciousness of mankind begins to understand and live by these realities and, most importantly each individual live their life accordingly. The Universe has unlimited wealth, riches and abundance just waiting to be delivered to each an d every person. Ask and you shall receive, every time, there are no ex ceptions to this. The Universe does not recognise favouritism, luck, chance or any other such very human notions often used as an ex cuse by people to blame their own lack of progress on “other” fa ctors that are perceived to be outside of themselves, when in fa ct they are always an inseparable aspect of such a person. Many people however simply do not know how to ask or to receive, and they therefore fail to achieve abundance, joy and happiness, instead becoming a slave to soci ety, family and above all to themselves. The vast majority of people in t he world today are not taught how to attract unlimited wealth, but rather how to “make money”. It is in the making of money that so much misery has been wrought upon all of"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 443 mankind, with the gross materialis m driven on by the ego and self- interest resulting in the misery we see today, being the direct result of this desire to “make” ever more money for the benefit of vanity, the ego and business pr ofits, and to conform to the demands and expectations of family , friends and others. Very few people achieve true financial freedom, and even those that do are very often not at all h appy, fulfilled or joyous about their situation simply because they felt compelled to “make” their money at a very physical level, often attr acting much misery in the process, both to themselves and to others. “Making money” is not the same as “attracting wealth”, abundance and the resultant true emotional freedom, joy and fulfilment. Only those who can fully un derstand how the Universe, The Source, God channels abundance through His/Her expressions within the physical world, thr ough mankind, through each and every person, can and will achieve as much abundance as they can possibly desire, and most important ly with the true joy, happiness and emotional freedom that goes with it. This means throwing off the shackl es of society, the creed, dogma and indoctrination and the opinion s and expectations of others in order to become a true channel for abundance. Those who can do this will answer those who may be crit ical by virtue of an extremely joyous, happy, fulfilling life on Earth, and one in which all desires are realised at will. It has often been noted that those who physically seem to “work” the hardest all of their lives seem to have the least money, possessions and true happiness, w hereas those who seem to “work” the least often seem to enjoy unlimited abundance, joy and true freedom. Many people will view such happy, joyous and fulfilled people with envy, often a ccusing them of achieving their riches through some sort of illicit means, or they might accuse them of being “lucky”, “fortunate”, or “in the right place at the right time” or of some other erroneous factor . The fact is these are mere"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 444 excuses to the people making these observations, a way of justifying to themselves that it can never happen to them. It is a very sad but true fact that many people still prefer to make use of their time in seeking to fi nd fault with others rather than to celebrate their success and to be trul y joyful that a fellow brother or sister human being has discovered true joy, happiness and fulfilment. Unfortunately today many people in stead look towards failure and revel in the failure of others, a r eally terrible indi ctment on humanity generally. The simple and powerful truth is that those who have achieved such levels of true fulf ilment have done so by casting off the shackles of society and hav e become open channels by which God can express fully in the physical world, thereby being blessed with unlimited abundance, joy and happiness. So the question is, how can any one escape from the chains of modern society to which they are cu rrently bound in order to realise their true potential? These questions and others will be fully dealt with in the next chapters of this book. Suffice it to say that every single person on the planet has the ability to attract unlimited abundance, all they have to do is understand that fact and have complete faith and gratitude while taking all of the necessary actions for what can seem like an extremely rapid, joyous and very real transition. Before we progress however to ac hieving these levels of joy, happiness and fulfilment, let us take a look at some of the fundamental reasons that people fail to realize anything significant. One of the most powerful and trues t expressions of all is quite simply Let go and let God . In China a philosopher known as Lao- tsu said the following. “In the practice of the Way ev ery day something is dropped. Less and less do you need to force things until you finally arrive at non- action. When nothing is done nothing is left undone”."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 445 These are very powerful words indeed, and once they are fully grasped will place you in a much be tter position to st art attracting the abundance, joy and fu lfilment that you truly desire. The fact is, mankind is currently so focussed in the material world that he is always “forcing” things by endeavouri ng to “do” things all the time. If a person desires something they automatically believe that a physical action is required in order to achieve it, thereby “forcing” things in their direction. Such force might well bring about the intended result, but nevertheless Un iversal laws are immutable, and the force of that cause will always have a corresponding effect; there are never any ex ceptions to this. W hatever the person was forcing is not actually a “physical thing” it is in reality Energy, the very same Energy from which all things are made, and in forcing that Energy in a certain directio n, a direction that might not have been the natural direction of that Energy, then a disharmony has occurred which the Universe will always balance. As we will see from the next chapters of this book, the entire Universe is Energy, vibration and Mind, and Energy is therefore gui ded by the Mind, not by the physical effort of “doing”. Many people in the world today oper ate with the belief that the only way to achieve anything is to take a physical action, often motivated by greed, fear, uncertainty and other negative, irrational and primitive human emotions. It is th is desire to physically “do” something in order to force a perce ived objective that often brings about the opposite effect. It is simp ly not possible to “do” anything against the flow of the perfection of the Universe and the immutable Laws in constant operation that are responsible for the perfect order of the Universe. People are therefore focussed on “doing” instead of simply “Being”. In order to achieve anything it is first necessary to “be” rather then to “do”. It is therefore always the “being” that precedes the “doing”, there is not and cannot be any other way. This is of course not to say that we should never “do” things. Quite the contrary in fact; action is often necessary, but the action must always be aligned completely with the flow of the Universe; you first"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 446 must “be” and then you can “do”. It is by being an open channel, always receptive to intuition, inspiration messages from inner sources that the necessary Energy arrives requiring an action that is in total alignment with that Energy. In terms of receiving abundanc e you might for example have projected a desire for something in accordance with the Law of Attraction, and the rea lisation of that desir e will sometimes include the requirement to take a physical action in a certain direction in order to align the Energy involv ed, and thereby allowing the object of your desire to manifest into yo ur physical reality. Although we all create our own realities at all levels of the Universe, while we are focussed within the physical world in a physical body The Universe, The Source, God will make use of physical channels in order to bring anything that has been attrac ted into observable, tangible physical reality. But please note: in this case we first had the “being” before the “doing” became necessary. It was never necessary to decide on what you want and then to take immediate physical action to force it in your direction. The next chapters of this book will describe the process of manifestation, and the attraction into your life anything you can possibly desire in much more depth. There is a process however that must be followed in order to attrac t true abundance, and most importantly with the complete joy, happiness and fulfilment that goes with it. You must first of a ll decide precisely what you desire. Part of this process is to think very deeply or better still to meditate on your desire in order to be absolutel y sure that it will add to your life in a positive and fulfilling way. This step should never be hurried. Once you have decided that you rea lly do want that object of your desire, you need to turn your attention fully towards it, no longer as a desire but as if it is already a to tal reality in your life, experiencing all of the emotions associated with it. "},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 447 You continue to do this while being totally open to messages, intuition and circumstances that wi ll start to appear in alignment with your desire. When these a rrive you must immediately recognize and take the appropriate actions according to the nature of the message. Please note that it is only at this stage that actions are sometimes required as a result of simply “being”, and not as a result of attempting to force things in your direction. The final step is in the receiving. It is very important indeed to be fully aligned with the vibr ations of all Energy involved in order to be in total harmony with whatever it is you are receiving, which will be vibrating at the same c onfiguration of Energy. It is worth noting that many people actually do attract at least abundance to themselves without realising it, by virtue of their thoughts and emotions which are always responded to by the Universe, however they simply to do not know how to receive. This is analogous to a door whereby the person is on one side of the door in a closed room accompanied only by his or her desir es, while everything they have ever desired is pile d high on the outside of the door, never being able to open the door to “delive r” the desired to the person who attracted them. Ask and you shall receive, but only if you have the channels open to facilitate the receiving. It is necessary to understand how to receive that the door might be permanently open, or indeed not exist all providing for a free channel for abundance from the Universe, toget her with all of the freedom, fulfilment and absolute joy that accompanies it. So therein is the true human paradox. Mankind is largely stuck in a “no pain, no gain” attitude of societ y, largely driven by materialism, vanity and the uncontrolled ego, with a perception that in order to achieve anything worthwhile direct physical action must first be taken. This is brought about by the materialistic focus of people generally, largely as a direct result of conditioning from a very early age by a society who lost its way millennia before. Children from birth are indoctrinat ed into this system by parents, relatives and teachers. Even though children will from birth"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 448 instinctively know why they are here, what must be accomplished and how Divine laws operate with them in achieving their objectives, the assault of material indoctrination is so powerful, and from so many different human infl uences that the conscious Mind takes over and overwhelms the tr ue knowledge and purpose, while ignoring the constant stream of inner messages and guidance from within. From that moment on the child becomes another slave of mammon, “working” in the physical world for material possessions, taking whatever direct physical ac tions are necessary to achieve the perceived objectives by forcing th ings in that direction. People not only spend their lives chasing ephemeral, physical, material things in order to satisfy the constant demands of the ego, family and others, but they do so oft en not only to enhance their own lifestyle but rather to conform to the expectations of others, and very often quite simply because it is “the way that things are done”. Other physical actions are moti vated by greed, fear and uncertainty, all still very insidious characteristics of much of mankind today. It is only when this human paradox can be set aside that mankind can once again fully align with T he Source, The Div ine, God, and once again become a tr ue channel of the ab undance, freedom and absolute joy that is the right of every single person as a true son or daughter of God, an expr ession of God made in the true Spiritual image of God. "},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 449 Chapter 79: The Eternal Now “Time” is an illusion, a purel y human construct of mankind, designed for convenience in order to measure a perceived “past”, “present” and “future”. The illusion of “time” on Earth is maintained by means of a scientific measurement of the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun in the physical three dimensiona l Universe in order to observe the seasons and the time the Earth takes for a complete rotation relative to the Sun in the measurement of ongoing “time”, in turn measured by various physical instruments such as clocks, calendars and charts. Beyond the perceptions of most of those in the physical world, “time” simply does not exist. Ther e is only Now, the Eternal Now where everything that has happened, is happening and ever will happen relative to the Earth concept of time already exists, always has existed and always will ex ist. Beyond Earth therefore the concepts of “past, present and futu re” simply do not and cannot exist. The entire Universe from The Source, The First Cause, God is Energy vibrating at a frequency rela tive to The Source, The Source being the very centre of the Univ erse of Energy and the physical world being the outermost shell, the physical three dimensional Universe as observed by means of the physical senses and by science, existing at the lowest rate of vibration and the highest density. It should also be mentioned that the physical Universe of matter represents only a tiny fraction of the Universe of Energy and vibration in its entirety. All Energy is influenced by the causation of thought before configuring under the influence of t hat thought, manifesting as an observable effect in the plane at which the thought originated. Everything that happens, ever happened and ever will happen in the entire Universe ther efore, including the physical world, first originated as a thought originating from the Mind of a Being, and which thought in turn has its corr esponding effect on the Energy of"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 450 the Causal Spheres of the Universe while becoming the corresponding and potentially observable effect. The Ultimate act of Cr eation by The First Cause, The Source, God of the entire Universe in all of its glorious spheres, planes and dimensions originated in the very beginning as a thought in the Mind of God. It can be truly said therefore that we all exist as “expressions”, within the Mind of God, made in the true Spiritual image of God. Since the beginning of the human c oncept of “time” mankind has sought to live life based around that concept, thereby always thinking in terms of past present and future rather than Now. The Universe and the Energy we influence in the creation of our own individual realities have no conc ept of time, only Now, and as a result there is a no past or future irrespective of how much mankind forces his own existence arou nd those erroneous notions. This tendency to force everything to happen in compliance with a notional concept of “tim e” has a very profound e ffect on the lives of those who do not fully under stand these realities. When a person thinks in the future tense, for example “ I will”, “I want”, “I could” then the Energy being influenced by those thoughts that can manifest into individual reality will be influenced only in the Now, with the perceived future nev er actually arriving. So if someone thinks, says or behaves in a manner that implies “I want”, then that person is placing themse lves into a perpetual state of “wanting” but never of actually receiving. The vast majority of the human race today exists to some ext ent in a state of such wanting, while never being in a state of Mind, Energy and vibration to receive that which they “want”. The Universe, The Source, God is immutable, absolutely perfect in every possible respect, and will accordingly always respond to a thought in its absolute terms rather than a human concept. “I want” literally creates a state of “wanting” perpetually until if or at such time whatever is associated with that thought is shifted to a state of"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 451 “having” in the Now, which will t hen allow the object of that thought to manifest from a perpetual w ant into the actual Now, and accordingly into the individual, observable reality of the person originating that thought. The importance of the Eternal Now simply cannot be over- emphasised. It is one of the most fundamental influences on the ability to create our own realities Now, rather than perpetually being frozen in a state of w anting but never receivi ng, a state that many find themselves in today. The next chapters of this book we will addr ess the importance of only thinking and acting in terms of the present tense in the context of total control over your own life and reality, enabling you to realise the potential that is wi thin every human being, to have anything you can possibly desire. Always remem ber, there is nothing that you cannot be, do or have. The importance of the Eternal Now must be fully grasped and fully understood as a continuous aspect of enjoying total fulfilment, joy and evolution. How we think has t he most profound effect over the effects that occur in our lives; nothing has a more profound effect. It is not sufficient to only rec ognize and express these fundamental Universal laws when it suits us, when we desire something or when there is a situation that demands it, it is absolutely necessary to live life completely in accordance with these immutable Universal laws. Those who do live their lives, either consciously or subconsciously according to these Universal laws wi ll always seem to others to live a “charmed”, “lucky” “fortunate” exis tence, when in fa ct they are in reality living a Magical life, always in total control over their own individual reality, and always in a higher degree of harmony, Energy and vibration with the Universe compared to their less notionally “charmed”, “lucky” or “fortunate” family, friends and others around them. "},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 452 In order to begin the process of living the life of your desires in which you have a total control first of all requires awareness. Rather than thinking random thought s, all of which will have their corresponding effects whether obse rvable or not, start to become fully aware of how, what and why you are thinking what you are. This is where powers of concentration as developed by virtue of the exercises in the previous chapter of this book are so valuable. Presence of Mind, awareness and concentration are a very powerful combination indeed in creat ing your own reality and living that Magical life that many can only dream of. Always think as you wish things to Be, Now. Two of the most powerful words that you can possibly think or say are “I Am ”. As you live your life theref ore the first stage of awareness is to always stop your thoughts short of a statement that imp lies the future tense and to transmute it into the present tense. So “I will” becomes “I am”, “I want” becomes “I have” and “I might” becomes “I do”. Also keep in Mind that there is absolutel y no such concept as “try”. We either Do something in the present Now, or we do not Do anything; “try” simply does not exist except as a concept of a person wishing to achieve something. I “want to feel well” should not be allowed to proc eed as a thought and should be immediately become “I am feeling so well”. This thought takes the reality of feeli ng well from some point in the perceived future that never arrives, to actually feeling well in the present. So a strong thought of “I am feeling so well” will manifest into your reality in the Now, and you will indeed feel well in accordance with the effect of the c ausation of your “I am feeling so well” thought on the causation of t he Universal Energy involved. Similarly, if you have a bill that needs paying and you believe that you do not have the money, anot her human construct, to pay the bill, never think in terms of “I w ant the money to pay this bill”, but rather “I have the money to pay th is bill effortlessly”. Bringing this statement into the present tense ra ther then a future statement of"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 453 lack will cause the means by which the bill can be paid to manifest into your reality, and the bill will be paid in full. Please always keep in Mind; t he Universe always delivers in absolute accordance with your thoughts; there ar e no exceptions to these Laws. Again, “I might succeed at this objective” implies never “actually” succeeding. The “might” places the success into the indefinite and infinite range of possibilities and never as an actuality. So “I might succeed with this objective” should become “I am enjoying complete success with this objective”, and that success will then become your reality as that vibration of Universal Energy has its effect. So in summary, always think in terms of the present tense, and always remember those words “I Am”, using them all the time in the context of the reality you wish to create for yourself. In the next chapters of this book we will deal with consciously creating your own reality, an extremely important aspect of which is recognition of the Eternal Now. Crea ting your own reality is an ongoing, joyous and productive life, not just something to “do” when it suits you or to conform to the demands of others, vanity or ego. Those who understand and consciously apply thes e facts to their lives will be richly rewarded with the level of health, wealth and happiness to the exact extent of the focus of the thoughts that created the same reality. In the next chapter of this book we will discuss in great depth The Law of Attraction, and aspect of Causation, the law of Cause and Effect, that once, fully understood and practiced, which is well within the abilities of everyone, wil l enable you to attract into your physical life absolutely anything you could wish for, desire or need, thus enabling you to live a life of complete abundance, joy and fulfilment. "},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 454 Chapter 80: The Law of Attraction Quantum physics descri bes the energetic characteristics of the Universe and therefor e the fundamentals of the Law of Attraction. We know from even the most fundamental basis of quantum physics that everything in the ent ire Universe is pure Energy, differing only in characteristics such as rate of vibration. Quantum physics also acknowledges the fact that Energy is influenced by Energy, and like Energy attracts in accordance with its unique vibration; this is the very basis of how the Law of Attraction works throughout the Universe. This truth can easily and unam biguously be demonstrated by means of a pair of tuning forks. If one tuning fork is placed a distance from the first fork and the first tuning fork is struck thereby emitting a sound at a certain pitch or frequency, which is in fact vibration, then the second tuning fo rk some distance away will then start to vibrate at exactly the same rate of vibration, and accordingly the vibrations are attracted to each other. This is a very simple but observable demonstration of how Energy and vibration influence the Universe. It is also very important to fully understand that Energy simply does not stop when it ceases to become measurable by the restrictions of physical scientific inst ruments. In fact the extent of the Energy spectrum that can be measured by scientific instruments is extremely small by com parison with the entire spectrum of Energy in the entire Universe, and not just the small, observable, three- dimensional aspects of the Universe . Energy exists all the way to The Source of all Ener gy, The First Cause, God, Who exists at the highest frequency of Energy of all. Everything is Energy including thought, we live, evolve and have our being in a t hought Universe, and it is therefore the Energy of thought that brings about creation, just as the entire Universe , the ultimate act of creation, started as a thought in the Mind of G od, just as everything in the Universe now, including ourselves, are all t houghts in the Mind of God."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 455 Another very important aspect of quantum physics is quantum potential, describing how everything t hat exists already “potentially” exists in the Universe; everything that exists now, ever existed and ever will exist already exists at least at the quantum potential level, and it is the process of observation, i.e. focussing your attention on something that will cause the quantum potential to shift into quantum reality. The Universe in which we live is a huge expanse of pure Energy vibrating at varying frequencies fr om the very highest of The Source down or more specifically outwards to the Universe of physical matter, forming the outer physical shell, the epidermis of the Universe as a whole as observed by science and experienced by the five physical senses. T he experience of separateness is nothing more than illusion project ed by the way that our physical and inner senses interpret that same Energy. As mentioned before, the The Source, the Universe, G od experiences Him/Her Self by differentiating into the observer and the observed; this is why humans exist as individuations of The Source, The First Cause, of God, and how God experiences and expresses through us as individuated expressions of God. Just as our senses and Mind inte rpret the Energy around us, we similarly influence that Energy whether conscious of it or not, and it is that same influence that determi nes the reality as experienced by each and every person, w hether that reality is positive, negative or neutral. Before Energy is observed it therefore exists as probabilities, the very act of obser vation influencing the Energy to manifest as an actual observa ble event rather than a mere quantum probability from the quantum potential of the Energy. The importance of quantum physics is discussed more “The Wisdom of Quantum Physics” chapter of this book, and is well worth reading again before reading this chapter. The Law of Attraction is an extremely important Universal Law, and an aspect of the Law of Cause and Effect or Causation. Understanding and consciously appl ying the Law of Attraction"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 456 enables us to manifest anything at al l we desire into our individual reality. Like everything in the Universe , we are all beings of Energy, extensions of The Source Energy, always attracting into our own individual realities similar Energy in complete accordance with the thoughts we vibrate. As we already know, the entire Universe is Energy and all thoughts are Energy characterised by vibration, and therefore thoughts attract precisely those Energy that are in harmony with the thought you hold in your Mind and are therefore vibrating and projecting into the Universe. This same Law applies whether your thoughts are positiv e, negative or neutral, and the effects will be in precise accordance with those thoughts. Like The Source, we are all ther efore creators within the Universe, co-creators with G od, infinitely creating by the powers of the Mind whether we are conscious of it or not. Most people are not yet aware of this fundamental, powerful and empowering truth, and accordingly have no control over t heir own life, always ascribing things to such notions as “luck”, “fortune” and “chance”. Another fundamental trut h is “ask and it is given”. There are no exceptions to this Universal trut h. The instant you make a request to the Universe, The Source, God, which will be sent, transmitted and received in the form of unique vibrations of Energy, it is instantly granted, there are no except ions. A reason for this is that we are all here to evolve back to the First Cause by utilizing our own freewill, and accordingly the Universe will never, ever fail to grant whatever we belie ve we need at any time in order to evolve; however large or small. We all learn by experience, so if we for example believe we need a castle in order to progress, then the castle is instantly granted so that we might learn of our own freewill, by experience, that we ultimately do not require a castle in order to evolve, being, as it is, merely a physical object of materialism demanded by the ego. The"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 457 Universe can just as easily provi de any such object in the physical world; nothing is ever t oo large or too small. Where most people who understand these realities experience difficulties is not in the asking but in the receiving. In order to receive anything it is necessary to be in vibrational harmony with whatever is to be received. Th is is an absolutely fundamental aspect of the Law of Attraction; lik e Energy attracts, and since any material object, be it a house, car, money or anything else is pure Energy, then it should be clear to everyone that the person attracting the object has to vibrat e the same Energy in order to attract and be in total harmony with it. Again, this simply cannot be stre ssed highly enough; everything in the Universe is pure Energy, an aspect and extension of The Source Energy, and all Energy attr acts like Energy by manifesting in total vibrational harmony with it. This is a reason that upon passing on from the physical to t he non-physical worlds during the process erroneously known as “deat h”, everyone is automatically attracted to that exact part of the Astral or Spiritual words that is most vibrating in harmony with the Soul and Spirit, and which in turn is determined by the state of evolution of each individual. This is how all evolution takes place, including our own evolution back to The First Cause, back to God. As we evolve, the vibrations of our Spirit are always in pe rfect harmony with the vi brations of the level of the Spirit worlds to which we progress. One of the most fundamentally im portant things that anyone can and should do therefore is to be totally, consciously and permanently aware of The Law of Attr action, and to live in Spirit as a conscious co-creator of t he Universe. The person that understands and lives by these truths fears nothing, always existing in a state of joy in the knowle dge that anythi ng we need we can always attract every time; ask and it is always given; all we need to do is to understand how to receive. "},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 458 As you begin to fully understand t hese realities and integrate them into your Consciousness, seemi ngly amazing things will start to happen in your life. You will begin to attrac t everything you desire, people will appear in your life, circumstances will manifest, all in tune with your vibration, all being attracted to you by what you are vibrating. As your entire existence changes in accordance with your vibration you will know within every part of your being that you are indeed a co-creator in the Universe, and wi ll henceforth approach life with joy and enthusiasm. Enthusiasm in fact is a highly appropriate word to define your state, being a derivativ e of the Greek word “en-theos”, which literally means “in God”. To live “in God” or “in Spirit”, “en- theos”, is to be in harmony with The Source, The First Cause, God of which we are all immortal, Di vine aspects, having our existence as we do within the Mind of God. To live in Spirit is to “let go and let God” in the full realisation, knowledge and joy that as immortal Sons and Daughters of God no harm can ever come to us. We al l create our own realities by the thoughts we hold in our Minds, bu t beyond the thoughts we hold in our Minds we should all know that God only is Pure Unconditional Love, and nothing negat ive can possible happen to any of us. The Universe, The Source, God is to tal perfection, and all we need to do is to progress and be open expres sions in the flow of that perfection. As your realization and your enthusiasm grows you will become more and more in vibrational harm ony with that which you wish to attract, and as a direct result more and more of that which you wish for will manifest into your awar eness and therefore your physical reality. This is a self-perpetuatin g process that will very soon be noticed by those around y ou who will often dism iss your “fortune” as “luck”. If appropriate, always strive to share your knowledge with those around you, but if they are not ready to listen, to receive and to understand, never force it upon any one; their day of realisation will arrive sooner or later."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 459 In order to place yourself in vi brational harmony with your wishes you first need to experience t hem. Remember; everything that exists, has ever existed or ever will exist already exists in the Eternal Now beyond the physical spac e-time restricted aspects of the physical Universe, all you have to do is to attract it into your own individual reality by placing yourself in energetic harmony with it, thereby matching your own vibrations. To experience it is to imagine it, visualize it and be an integral part of it in your Mind. Imagination is creation, and therefore when you imagine something it is very real, not some sort of “figment of the imagination”, dream or fantasy. This is one of the very reasons creative visualization is so very powerful; by visualizing and mentally becoming a part of that which you are attracting you begin to match the vibrations that will cause it to manifest into your personal, physical reality. The quicker you can match those vibrations, the Energy involved, the sooner you will manifest the object of your visualisation, your wishes and desires into your life. So to progress with being the creator of your own existence, relax, fully experience in your Mind that which you wish to receive, and then “let go and let God”. Another important aspect of The Law of Attraction is “expectation”. You must always know, beyond any doubt that you already have everything you could possibly wish for; it is just a matter of receiving. You must therefore a lways expect to receive and never doubt even for a single moment. Always know, beyond any doubt that the Universe will provide. A further important aspect of realizing your wishes is “desire”. Unless you are in perfect harmony wit h whatever you wish for, it will not manifest into your existence, and desire for whatever it is you wish for is a very important component of this process. If you do not genuinely desire something then y ou cannot be in vibrational harmony with it, and it will not appear within your personal reality however much you believe you may wish for it."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 460 So your wishes must always be fue lled by desire and expectation, while never, even for a single moment doubting the results. Ask and it will be given, there are no exceptions, all you have to do is to place yourself into a state of re ceiving, and The Law of Attraction will operate with total, immutable action in manifesting the object of your wishes into your life. The Law of Attraction applies equally to attracting or repelling people. Everyone without exception is a “transmitter” and “receiver” of vibrations which vibrations ar e picked up by thos e around you, or sometimes even at great distance; distance being a physical concept that does not apply within t he inner levels of Energy where they first have their corresponding a ffect. People who feel attracted to you or you to them are thos e who are most in vibrational harmony with your own specific vi brations. Everyone, usually at a subconscious level detects the vibrat ions of others to some extent, this being the reason why people oft en take an instant like or dislike to someone else. They are picking up on the vibrations of the other person. Genuine psychics and very often animals are much more tuned into the vibrations of peop le, and indeed everything, and can instinctively determine the character of any being. The Universe knows no such conc epts as failure, contraction or chance; knowing only success, expansion and evolution in accordance with the immutable Laws of the Universe. All that is required therefore to attr act anything at all into your own individual life by The Law of Attraction is to be in total energet ic and therefore vibrational harmony with the Un iverse as an expression or “channel” of The Source, The First Cause, with God and that which you wish to attract into your individual reality. A further most important factor that everyone should know and keep in Mind is that everyone pl anned their own individual physical life, and knew what to expect an d what was expected before even incarnating into the present physical body. Every physical life has a purpose but currently the majority of people do not know they have such a purpose. This is due in la rge part to the indoctrination most"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 461 people receive into the physical worl d from the moment of birth, where they taught that all that exists is ph ysical, and everything else is “fantasy”. Once people do realise they are here for a spec ific purpose, usually related to personal evolution on the path back to God, they can begin to realise that purpose by vi brating in harmony with it, thereby attracting those things that they are here to attract as a necessary aspect of evolution. Everyone on Earth is a physical extension of Source Energy, with exactly the same creative powers as The Source; we are all co-creators with God. With all of these factors in Mind it should be absolutely apparent to you by now that The Law of Attr action is extremely important, and key to happiness, fulfilment and joy. You now know that you attract to you everything and anything you hol d in your Mind, be it positive or negative. Your task therefore is always to accentuate the positive and reject the negative. You know that there is absolutel y nothing that you cannot be, do or have, and that all you need to do is to know this glorious truth, and that you can truly attract only t hose most positive, desired and wished for things into your life. When you reach this stage, and you must sooner or later, whether in th is life or a furt her life, you will then know without any doubts whats oever that you are indeed a Divine expression of God, a co-cr eator with God in this great and perfect Universe of Energy, vi bration and Consciousness in which we have our Being, learning and continuing to evolve back to The Source, The First Cause, back to God. The future chapters of this book will describe the va rious factors, processes and methods that will enable you to realise your true powers as a creator of your individual reality within the Universe, but before we move on to those chapters we should also discuss other emotions that are very important in the realisation of your wishes, those of joy, gratitude and faith."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 462 The more joyful, happy and “light- hearted” you are, the higher will be your corresponding overall rate of vibration. The higher your inherent rate of vibrati on, the more powerful will be your attractive powers. Joy is a very high emotion and therefore state of vibration of Energy, and one that is a fundam ental characteristic of the Universe along with Unconditional Love. The more joyful you are the higher will be your rate of vibration and the more aligned you will be to The Source. This in turn will enable you to manifest your desires much more freely. It is most important therefore to ma intain a high state of joy. And why not maintain a blissful state of joy? You are after all a Divine, immortal, Spiritual Being, an expr ession of God, made in the true Spiritual image of God, and accord ingly there is absolutely nothing that you cannot be, do or have. What is there not to be joyful about? Those who are not joyful are in a state corresponding with a focus on the physical, material world they erroneously believe to be reality, and when physical things do not conform to their own physical efforts, wants or hopes then they become angry, sad or worse a state of despair. These emotions will always perpetuate more of the same in accordance wi th the Law of Attraction. It is therefore vital to never embr ace negative, angry or depressive thoughts, because once this process starts to occur it can become self-perpetuating, and the person can very easily become trapped in a vortex of destructive, negative Energy. Once you realise that you are immortal, Divine and the creator of your own reality, you will alwa ys be joyful, which in turn will accentuate the process of creati ng your own reality. When you reach that high state of Energy, vibration a nd being you will know beyond doubt that there is absolut ely nothing that you cannot be, do or have, and you will continue to exist in perpetual state of joy, seeing the material world for what it really is. You know beyond any possible doubt that you have the pot ential to constantly create your own existence every singl e moment as a natural aspect of your life."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 463 Even so, always strive to be joyful, and never, ever, ever let anything get you down, and The Law of Attraction will operate for you in a most powerful way. Always remember, you are an infi nite expression of The Source, The First Cause, of God, and the mo re of God you can express, the more abundance will flow into your life from the infinite abundance of the Universe. Always, always, always remain fully aware of how you are thinking. Never allow yo urself to be negatively influenced by external physical factors, situations or people, always remaining aware, and always transmuting any negative situation into a positive situation. Maintain that high state of vibration as an expression of God, and your individ ual reality will reflect your high state of Energy, vibration and bei ng with infinite abundance, joy and fulfilment as you joyfully travel the path back to our Divine creator. Another very important st ate of being is “faith”. By “faith we do not mean faith in the religi ous sense, or faith based merely upon hope, but rather absolute fait h in the immutable workings of The Universe and the fact that you are a loved Son or Daughter of God with the same unlimited potential as God as a co-creator of your own reality and of the Universe. Having faith is therefore to have fait h in your own abilities as well as faith in God. To have faith means to know, beyond any possible doubt that all of your desires, needs and wis hes are always granted without exception, and that all you need to do for your part is to align yourself with those wishes to be in vibrational harmony with them. If you do not have faith, if you ever doubt or reject these important Universal tr uths then it will considerably impact your ability to create. If you do not believ e and have faith in your natural, God-given abilities as creator , then you will transmit that corresponding Energy vibration which will in turn conflict with your very ability to create and therefore to orchestrate your own reality. Another extremely important emot ion is “gratitude”. Although the Universe will always provide, gr atitude is very important to the"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 464 vibrations that you send back to the Universe. The vibration of gratitude maintains our connections with The Source at the highest levels. It is most important not to think of gratitude in the religious sense. A personified God according to religi on “hears” worship, praise thanks and people are told that God in retu rn will grant future requests by way of some form of repayment. This concept is a purely human construct. Gratitude can more correctly cons idered to be a certain type of vibration; a very powerful vibration that influences the Universe in your direction in accordance with the Universal laws of Attraction and Correspondence. To ask, receive and then to be grateful for what you have received transmit s the right vibration to the Universe, which will in turn enabl e you to more easily attract much more of that which you desire into your life in the physical world future. Those who demand things, or w ho ask and expect to receive and are not grateful for what they have received will send out the corresponding vibrations of Energy in to the Universe t hat will in turn make it correspondingly more difficult to receive subsequent wishes. Gratitude is also related to faith. Those who are always deeply, emotionally and sincerely grateful for what they have received from the Universe will also have faith that they will continue to receive, so gratitude reinforces faith and a ccordingly the entire process of creation. The Universe is alwa ys in a state of harmony, and gratitude helps to accentuate y our personal harmony with the Universe. Ask in the certain knowledge and in complete faith that you will receive, and then always maintain absolute, sincere and emotional gratitude for w hat the Universe has pr ovided you with; in this way you will always be more finely in tune with Spirit, God, The Universe, and this will in turn be reflected by the ease in which you can always create your own rea lity, in harmony with God."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 465 Chapter 81: The Truth about Money One of the very largest problem s with the world today is the obsession for the money and the material possessions that people perceive money to be capable of purchasing. The fact is money and material objects are two totally separate things. Understanding the truth about money and the rele vance, or rather lack of relevance of money for acquiring t he things you truly wish for, need and desire in your individual rea lity will free you from dependence on money, thus allowing you to fo cus on manifesting all of your desires without focussing on the need for money as a means by which to accomplish it. The Universe is pure Energy at all levels including the physical level of the material world, and simply does not recognise “money” which is an entirely human constr uct. To the Universe “money” is just another Energy construct that in and of itself has no intrinsic value. Our distant ancestors were manifesting everything they desired relative to their needs long before money was even contrived by recent humanity. The entire Universe is infinite in abundance and it is the Universe that brings everything you could possibly wish for into your life, not mere money. The only reason people are so dependant on money is because they really believe that money is required in order to realise their desires. The fact is, while people hold this belief it will always be a self-perpetuating aspect of their reality, and they will accordingly remain a slave to money just as they are to many other material things. As previously mentioned, “money” is a purely human construct, a symbol, a method of exch ange which in and of itself is totally and completely meaningless. To the Un iverse money is simply Energy in the form of bits of metal, paper and electronic bits and bytes of information with zero value except for the Universal Energy of which it is composed. From a human perspective, money somehow represents value. The ques tion is what precisely is"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 466 “value”? Value is a purely notional concept relative to each individual person. Value can fluctuat e dramatically with such as the “economy”, the “rate of inflation” , the “foreign exchange rates” and many other such human constructs , all of which are only of any relevance at a purely physical level. The irony is that most money it self although it might appear to be real is not even very tangible in the physical world where it is exchanged. Only a very small percentage of the money in the world actually exists in the form of physical coins and notes, the rest being in the form of electronic information held on computers, money that is simply moved around at the touch of a computer key. So even money is for the most part notional, an illusion existing only to perpetuate the human concept of “value”. A main reason most people are so obsessed with money is because of the Energy surrounding money due to the focus of literally billions of peo ple around the world, a ll perceiving money as a necessity. If everyone in the world were to cease focussing on money, then the Energy could not be sustained and the illusion of money would quite simply cease to exist as a concept. It is quite simply not the task of humans to decide how things should be manifested into physical r eality. That is, always has been and always will be a natural func tion of the Universe and of the influence of the Energy of the Univ erse by Mind; it is only humanity that has taken that natural func tion and attached notional values which in turn has caused and continues to cause so much misery in the world today. Money is the fuel of materialism, which in turn is the main reason that humanity has been heading increasingly away from its own true purpose, both on an individual and all mankind level, and towards potential disast er. If only everyone knew the most fundamental Laws of the Universe, including “ask and ye shall receive”, then immediately the need for money would be seen for what it is; nothing more than an illusion, a human physical construct with a notional perceived exchange value."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 467 Another reason money has become such a major focus is due to the perceived power that it brings to the people who would wield it. While so many people focus on money as an object of power, control and necessity, money will be associated with the Energy that perpetuates that same power . While we all create our own realities at an individual level the same is also true at a consensual level on the Energy of the plane of the human Mind where a large scale focus on the importance of money will in turn focus the collective Energy of the human Mi nd upon that importance, Energy that will influence most humans at that level, and subsequently, in accordance with the Universal Law of Correspondence at the physical body and world level. Money is therefore nothing more than a large-scale illusion perpetuated on a massive scale, an illu sion also perpetuated by the focus of billions of individual people on the perceiv ed importance of money. Money is not, never has been and never will be necessary in order to realise anything at all that we desire. The Universe has infinite abundance and will always provide that which has been asked for without any exceptions, all the person who asked needs to do is to know how to receive. Once these truths become realised by millions of people, then the illusory need for money and therefore money itself will simp ly cease to be perpetuated and therefore exist, as people will no longer fo cus on money as a physical necessity. So what does this mean to mank ind in the meantime? Well quite simply that the Laws of the Un iverse are immutable, and just because money exists and so many people are pe rpetuating the illusion of money by focussing on it does not mean that Universal Laws cease to function. The Law of Attraction works with complete perfection, always has worked with complete perfection and always will work with complete perfection. So all you need to do is to cease to focus Energy on money and star t to focus and as k for what you truly desire, and in accordance wit h immutable Universal Laws you shall receive; always, every ti me there are no exceptions."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 468 Your ability to receive will only depend on being in harmony with the vibration of that wh ich you are receiving, rather then focussing on the illusion of money. Providi ng you focus on your wishes and experience them as if they are an absolute reality in your present moment, then you will vibrate in harmony with the object of your wishes which already exists in th e Universe of in finite abundance, and it can then manifest into your physical reality. Wealth is therefore a state of Consciousness, a state of your inner being. Everyone without excepti on was born wealthy, and all anyone should have to do is to focu s on that wealth and be in vibrational harmony with that same wealth in or der to realise it into individual reality. Money is not, never has been and never will be necessary for anything at all. To the Universe money is merely Energy manifested into a physical form just the same as anything else within the physical world. Know at all times that you are al ready infinitely wealthy and focus with joy on realising that wealth and utilising it for the purposes of evolution, expansion and growth, and thereby a state of Being in perfect harmony with the Univer se. Those who are in perfect harmony with the Universe will a lways manifest anything desired into physical reality, joyfully , naturally and effortlessly, and absolutely without the need for money. Unlike money which is often perceived as limited, there is no limit to your own wealth, and remember, weal th is not the same as money. Money is intangible, unreal, an illusion, whereas abundance is your birthright being a Divine aspect of The Universe, The Source, God Who knows only infinite abundance, evolution and growth. To be dependant on money is to be out of harmony with the Universe resulting in imbalance, discord and unhappiness. Those who throw off the shackles of money can live joyously, abundantly and harmoniously. Always remember that you are an extension, aspect and integral expression of The Source, The First Cause, of God, and there is"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 469 nothing but nothing that you cannot be, do or have. Ask and ye shall receive, always. If you wish for something merely focus on the object of your desires, experience i t, bring yourself into complete harmony with it, and it shall be yours.   "},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 470 Chapter 82: The Power of Positive Thinking The power and importance of positive thinking is an important aspect of the Law of Attraction. The importance of positive thinking quite simply cannot be underesti mated or overemphasised. In accordance with Universal laws and in particular the Law of Attraction, the way in which we think and the thoughts that we hold most strongly in our Minds have a most profound effect on our lives in almost every way, and indeed much more so than most people might realise or believe. To ma ny people a thought is something intangible in that it cannot be seen or even m easured as a thought by scientific instruments. Nevert heless, thought, like everything else in the Universe is Energy, and Ener gy influences other Energy. Just because thought Energy exists far behind the measurement of current scientific equipment bei ng a very high frequency form of Energy, does not make it any less real or profoundly important to everyone. All thought is vibration, Energy, a nd therefore a caus e will always in turn, without any exception always yield a corresponding effect upon the appropriate plane. When a person is feeling worried or negative about something they will oft en be told to “think positively”. Neither the well meaning person w ho proffered these words or the person for whom it was intended or the recipient of those words will usually truly appreciate the very considerable significance and profoundest importance of this exce llent advice, which are often simply dismissed as mere sentiment. In the first section of this book we looked at the structure of the Universe and how we can all affect our own lives, those of others and indeed the Universe as a whol e by the way people think and apply the imagination and other powers such as emotion. This is because everyone without exception is an integral aspect of the Universe, The Source, of God, and also most importantly in this context of the Energy of the m ental plane of t he group human Mind. The laws of attraction and correspondence are always in operation whenever we project t houghts, ideas, emotions and anything at all"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 471 involving our imagination. In all spheres of life, including the physical world, like always resonat es with like; if you therefore focus on something negative it will result in the resonation of the corresponding negative Energy, in turn resulting in the attraction of more of the same negative En ergy and corresponding negative circumstances, in other words negat ive effects. Of course, the very same principle also applies with pos itive thinking; positive thoughts will always result in the resonati on of positive Energy, in turn attracting the corresponding positive results. Many people can and unfortunat ely frequently do become trapped within a vortex of negativity d ue to perceived negative things happening in their lives. For example, they might have lost their employment, feel stuck in an unhappy relationship, physically experiencing a lack of money or any one of numerous other such possible adverse circumstances of the sort faced by millions of people every day. Many people ar e for example understandably worried about a lack of money fo r the provision of basic daily needs. What most people do not realis e is that by dwelling on these perceived problems, constantly th inking about them and imagining the worst, thereby influencing t he corresponding Energy, they are automatically bringing mo re of exactly the same problems into their lives thereby compounding the probl em even further as it becomes self-perpetuating. Thinking about lack results in more lack, thinking about abundance results in more abundance, such is the way of the Universe; the power of thought should never, ev er be underestimated. It is for these reasons that the wealthy often become even wealthier and the poor often become even poorer; ev eryone is constantly creating their own reality in exact accordance with the way they think and perceive their own existence and r eality, whether it is from a positive or negative perspective. Everyone without excepti on is a creator in the microcosm, the physical world that is our main focu s of existence for the time being. This is a “God given” aspect of all human beings; we all have the"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 472 freewill and the power to determine the content of our own individual lives, destiny and evoluti on. The way in which we think and the Energy we put behind t hose thoughts are therefore extremely important. It is particu larly important, no matter how difficult circumstances might seem to be, to think as positively as possible at all times. For exampl e, if you were to attend a job interview with negative feelings about the prospects of being awarded the position y ou applied for, then you will most probably not receive the position. If on t he other hand you go to the job interview knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever that you will be offered the position, then the chances are you will indeed be awarded the position y ou sought and emotionally wanted so much, while never doubting for a moment that you would achieve it. Your positive thought Energy will, through the level of the group human Mind, influence the Mind of t he interviewer in your favour. This is why many successful business people almost always succeed in consistently winning large business deals; they always know beyond any doubt in their own Minds, even before they enter into the initial negotiations that they will certainly win the deal without question. The thought of not winning such a deal never even once enters the Mind of the business person, they simply know it as a forgone conclusion. Exactly the same principle applies within life in general; only by thinking the most positive thou ghts while excluding all negative thoughts, and by imagining the most positive things happening in your life with as much emotion a nd positive Energy as possible at all times, will you attract only those most positive things you truly desire. On a more conscious level, if you really need something in particular to happen in your life, endow whatever it is you need to happen with as much positive emot ional Energy as you possibly can. Never, ever think even begin to think, even for a single moment that it cannot happen for y ou, because it most assuredly can; the Universe has infinite abundance, anything and everything"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 473 is possible, and everyone really can have anything they truly need and desire. This is all well and good someone might say, but I am genuinely in severe financial trouble and as a re sult my relationship is genuinely suffering. Difficult though situations su ch as this surely are, it quite simply cannot be stressed enough that the more the person negatively dwells on their perceived si tuation the worse it will surely become due to the immutable Univ ersal laws operat ion, including the Law of Attraction. The more someone focuses on a perceived lack of money, the less money they will receive. The more they focus on a perceived failing relations hip, the more t hat relationship will surely fail. The solution to these situations is to break out of the self-created vortex of negative thinking and to st art thinking only in the most positive terms at all times. It is par ticularly important to go to bed at night thinking only the most posit ive thoughts, never dwelling even for a minute on any situation in negative terms. Just before sleep the link to the subconscious Mind, whic h in fact is by far the largest aspect of Mind, is particularly powerful, and will in turn influence the Energy of the inner planes of life and reality, which in turn once again will sooner or later mani fest into physical reality. Always therefore think in terms of plenty as if all genuine needs have already been met. As previous ly mentioned, it is most important to know be yond any doubts whatsoev er that whatever you desire and focus on will already become your reality in the inner worlds, and which realities ther efore must also manifest into your physical world in accordan ce with the Universal laws of attraction and correspondence; “as abov e, so below, as below, so above”. As with the use of a ll inner abilities, all thoughts must be in the present tense. For example, never, ever think in terms of “I want more money” or “my relationship will improve” or “I need a better job”. The use of the words “want”, “will” or “need” w ill simply make"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 474 matters worse, the implication bei ng that a problem already exists, and therefore “I want ” will place you in a state of perpetual “wanting”. The correct way of thinki ng therefore is; “I have plenty of money” or “my relationship has never been better”, or “I have never been more healthy”. Within the inner spheres of life and reality where thought Energy takes shape, there is no concept such as space or time. Our positive Energy will ther efore first of all infl uence the corresponding Energy of the Universe before m anifesting, under the influence of thought as a desire in the inner E nergy realms of the Universe beyond the limitations of time and space, subsequently, in immutable succession, manifesting in to the material world in the same way. Of course these manifestati ons will not us ually happen immediately, but the more positive Energy in the form of concentrated though, emotion and imagination is placed behind a thought or desire, the sooner the des ire will positively manifest as an observable effect that can t angibly experienced in individual physical life within the material world. It is most important to maintain th is positive Energy, charging it with as much positive emotion as po ssible; any negative Energy will neutralise any positive Energy pr eviously projected into the Universe, thereby cancelling it out. If a negative thought ever enters your Mind it is very important to be aware of it, and to replace it immediately with a corresponding positive thought, preferably a thought that is totally consistent with your ongoing objectives and desires. Another very powerful way of reinforcing positive thoughts is by the use of positive affirmations, the use and power of wh ich we have already seen in the context of OBE methods. Affirmations will al so be discussed in much more detail later in this book. "},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 475 Positive thinking at its most effect ive is therefore much more than simply thinking positively about a par ticular circumstance, it should become a Mindset, a way of life. By thinking constantly only in the most positive manner you will ensure only the most positive things manifest into your life. For ex ample, if you wish to always have sufficient money for all your daily needs you must always think positively and with as much conscious Energy and emotion as possible that you already have t hat money in your possession; never let a contrary thought enter your Mind; if such a contrary or negative thought does enter your Mi nd, even for a single moment, you must dispel it immediately. A nd again, never think in the future tense, only in the present tense to the extent that it already exists within your physical reality. In this way you will constantly influence the positive Energy of the inner spher es of reality, which Energy will sooner or later positively manifest into your own physical life. As space and time simply do not exist in the inner Universe, creating these positive Energy in the present tense where they have their effect beyond the confines of space and time, they must in turn, in immutable succession eventually manifest into your physical world and reality, and not si mply something which might or might not occur sometime in the future. Again, always know in your own Mind beyond any doubt whatsoever that all your needs have already been met, and are a complete reality in your life at this very time, in the completely certain knowledge that the Univer se is infinitely abundant and knows no limits, and that as an immortal, Divine Spiritual being, a co-creator of the Universe wit h the Prime Creator, The Source, God, all of your needs and desires without any exceptions will always manifest into your life an d reality. Always remember, there is absolutely nothing that y ou cannot be, do or have. As well as knowing be yond doubt that your wishes and needs have already become a complete realit y, it will assist this process considerably by projecting as much focussed, positive emotion and Energy behind your knowing and positive thinking as possible."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 476 Recreate the feelings of gr eat joy and happiness surrounding previous events in your life. By recalling and recreating these feelings and emotions, and projec ting them with as strongly as possible behind your ongoing thoughts of whatever it is you wish to manifest into your life as if they are already a comple te reality, you will influence the positive Energy , thus helping the results to manifest more rapidly and in a more powerful way into your own physical reality. Your Mind, Consciousness, thought s, emotions and imagination are all creative powers behind your life and of the entire Universe. The more conscious you are of yourse lf and of your needs and desires the more powerful you will become. By this we do not mean being conscious of your physical body, but rather being conscious of actually being conscious, a con scious channel for expression of God, the very feeling of existenc e, the feeling of being alive, not alive from the point of view of t he physical body, but rather the total inner feeling and sensation that comes with the absolute knowing and certainty that you exist as an immortal Divine creative being, an aspect of God, created in the true image of God. In conclusion on the importance of the power of positive thinking; always but always think positive thoughts in the direction you wish your life to go, and do so with as much focus of Energy, knowing and emotion as possible. These thoughts, whether specific to a particular need or for an ongoing as pect of your life must always be present in your Mind as if they have already completely manifested into, and are already an integral as pect of your present reality, a fact of which you must be completely certain beyond all doubt. It really does not matter how dire life might seem to be at any particular moment, it is extrem ely important during every waking moment to think as positivel y and with as much Energy and emotion as possible that everything you desire already exists within your life, and that you are now enj oying it to the maximum possible extent. Never, ever let a negativ e thought dwell in your Mind, particularly before sleep, or give such a thought any Energy"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 477 whatsoever; immediately convert any negative Energy into the corresponding positive Energy. Notwithstanding immediate needs and situations, always think, focus and concentrate positively about everything in your life, and in turn your life will only bring you positive results, this is The Law of the Universe. Most importantly, always feel the deepest gratitude for how perfect your reality really is, always giving thanks to God with absolute sincerity.   "},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 478 Chapter 83: Affirmations The power of positive thinking can be enhanced and reinforced by the use of affirmations. An affirmat ion is a short statement repeated frequently in the present tense in or der to impress the intent of the affirmation on to the subconscious Mi nd, thereby in turn causing the subject of your affirmation to manifest as a part of your own physical reality. As with all positive thinking, affirmations must always be phrased in the present tense as if the desired result has already become an absolute reality. This will a ttract and influence Energy in accordance with The Law of Attraction, in turn creatin g the reality of the object of your affirmations within the inner spheres of the Universe, which reality must then in turn subsequently manifest into the physical world where t he benefits can be realised. As with negative thinking many peopl e are in the habit of dwelling on problem areas in their life by repeating exactly that which they do not wish to happen. Therefore, as with negative thinking, this results in negatively influenced Energy creating a correspondingly negative reality, until finally manife sting into the physical world as an observable and experi ential negative realit y, thus compounding the original problems and making them even worse. Like positive or negative thinking , affirmations can also affect the people around us at the Energy leve l of the group human Mind; the vibration of any affirmation involving other people will be transmitted and picked up by the people concerned, who in turn will accordingly subconsciously react to it in either a positive or negative way. It is extremely im portant therefore not to even subconsciously repeat negative affirmations, no matter how difficult a situation might seem. For example, a person might keep repeating to themselves such statements as: “ I will never get a promotion in this job”."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 479 O r: “ I will always be short of money”. Or: “my relationship will never improve and become a happy one”. These are all examples of negative affirmations resulting in the corresponding Energy being influ enced in a negative way, which in turn will result in the problem be coming even more of the reality of the person affirming these negative statements. The person who is constantly repeating t hese negative affirmations, either consciously or subconsciously, will be accordi ngly much less likely to receive a promotion in their job, will hav e even less money than before, and might well become even more trapped in their unhappy relationship. Again, and the importance of this simply cannot be overstated; everyone constantly creates their own realities whatever they may be, thought Energy, emotions and affirmations being just three important ways in which this is process manifests in accordance with immutable Universal Laws. Po sitive thinking and conscious positive affirmations will therefor e not only bring correspondingly good things, but will also transmute existing bad things into their corresponding good things. Beyond the confines of the three dimensional world of matte r there is no time or space, so it is never to “late” to transmute a negative si tuation to a positive situation; all time is Now, the Eternal Now. In the examples above this pe rson should always immediately suppress any negative affirmations t hey find themselves repeating, and immediately replace them with the equivalent positive affirmations; they should for example be saying: “I am so pleased with my excellent job promotion”. Or: “ I have all the money I really need”. Or: “my relationship has never been better or happier” ."},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 480 This might well seem so mewhat difficult to do, particularl y in what is perceived to be difficult circumstanc es or where t he reality appears to be totally the opposite, but such circumstances are only temporal, often the result of existing or previous negatively influenced Energy, but which Energy can always be transmuted to its opposite and desired positive circumstances. It is also important that the affi rmation, like positive thinking, is never stated in the future tense, for example, “ I will have a job promotion”; this implies the indefinit e future, that a negative situation already exists, and the re sult cannot therefore manifest positively into your present r eality. Again, dwelling on negative situations and repeati ng them over and over in your Mind will certainly cause more of the same negative vibrations, which will in turn appear into physical reality as the corresponding negative manifestation, thereby compounding the problem even further, in turn resulting in an ever deepe ning vortex of the same negative situations; like Energy always a ttracting like Energy in accordance with the immutable Universa l laws of Attraction and Correspondence. Rejecting all negative thoughts and replacing them only with their opposite, most pos itive affirmations will result in positive vibrations of Energy that will eventually manifest into your own physical life and reality in the form you most desire. Many people generally tend to us e negative affirmations on an ongoing and much more subconscious basis without ever even releasing it. For example, som eone might say to themselves or even aloud; “ I simply cannot complete this task ”, or, “ this is much too difficult ”, or very often on a health level we hear people say, “ I do not feel at all well today ”. These are all examples of subconscious negative affirmations that will in turn become negative realities; the tasks will neve r be completed, will be always too hard, and the person will continue to feel unwell. It is very important therefore to re main alert at all times to these negative thoughts and affirmations, immediately transmuting them"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 481 into their positive oppo sites as they arise and before they have their effect, for example; “ I have easily accomplished this task very easily ”, and, “ that was very easy indeed ”, and, “ I feel so fit and well today ”. In this way the negatively influenced Energy will not be allowed to take influence away from your positively desired reality, and only positive Energy can be a ttracted to you from the Universe and manifest as a tangible reality into the physical world, and therefore your own lif e and personal reality. It is very important therefore to not only make use of affirmations in order to consciously manifest desir ed changes into life, but also to be alert to subconscious, negative affirmations that must be immediately transmuted to their pos itive opposites without delay. The more often an affirmation is repeated, consciously or otherwise, the more quickly and effect ively it will manifest into your observable, individual, experiential reality. An excellent time to repeat affirmations, with as much sincerity and emotion as possible, is just befor e drifting off to sleep at night, and just after waking in the morning bef ore arising. At these times your conscious Mind is most in comm unication with your subconscious Mind and therefore the inner causal spheres of Energy. Repeat the affirmation throughout the day, write down the affirmation on notepaper and place copies of your affirmation around your home, repeating the affirmation fr equently, and whenever you are reminded to do so. If you make use of a personal computer for long periods of time, it is a very good and effective idea to have a copy of your affirmation on your PC desktop utlising some appropriate software. You might not al ways notice the affirmati on, but it will still be integrated into your subconscious Mind where it can begin its effect. The ideal affirmation must be as short as possible and totally unambiguous. It is important to note that the subconscious Mind cannot easily assimilate long st atements. The subconscious Mind, immense and powerful as it is, is actually very child-like in the way it perceives, and is therefore much more easily influenced by short,"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 482 appropriately worded statements. Also the subconscious Mind never, ever questions any statemen t; it will rather accept the statement as an absolute fact, and set about bringing the object of the statement into reality by m eans of its powerfu l influence over the inner Energy levels of the Universe to which it is strongly connected. Affirmations must always stated the present tense, and most importantly charged with as much feeling, positive Energy and emotion as possible, and as if t he result has already manifested into your life as an absolute rea lity; a fact that you should have absolutely no doubt in y our Mind. You should intensely feel the joy, happiness and all other emotions in volved, which w ill generate the corresponding positive vibrations of Energy in accordance with The Law of Attraction. Affirmations should never be perfo rmed in a stressed situation or where you cannot adequately relax or concentrate. For maximum effect affirmations should be rep eated several times each day while being in as relaxed a state as possible, and continued until the affirmation has become an absolute physical reality. Affirmations can often become a physical realit y very quickly indeed, but at other times might take longer. Note that we use t he words “physical reality”, because as soon as you start stating the affirmations with the degree of emotion r equired, then the object of the statement will instantly be answered, the Universe in making it a reality within the inner Energy levels. Frequent repetit ion of the affirmations, with the associated emotion will then further influence Energy to manifest the object of your affirmations as a tangible, observa ble reality in your physical world. The speed at which an affirmation becomes a reality depends on numerous factors including the comp lexity of the desired result, the number of people involved, t he frequency of repeating the affirmation, and most importantly t he extent of emotion, focus and faith being placed behind it. Neve r become anxious for the results of the affirmation to be realised or wonder why they have not"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 483 manifested as yet; these will cause vibrations of negative Energy, thereby slowing the process down. Developing and maintaining faith in your affirmations will result in belief, and it is the belief that will bring you into energetic, vibrational harmony with the object of your affirmations, thereby allowing the object of your affirmations to manife st into your reality. In conclusion, always be fully aware of repeating negative affirmations either consciously or subconsciously, and if you find yourself doing so immediately c onvert them into their opposite, positive affirmations. Make maximum use of controlled, conscious, positive affirmations wherever you need to convert a negative situation into the equiva lent, opposite, positive situation, or where you wish to bring something positive into your life and reality.  "},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 484 Chapter 84: Powers of the Imagination Imagination is one of the most powerful of all vibrations of Energy in the Universe. When considering im agination it must never be confused with mere fantasy, unreal thoughts or simply as a “figment of the imagination”, but rather as an extremely powerful, natural, God given ability that every single human being without any exception possesses. Within the inner spheres of realit y, as everyone will discover very soon after passing on from the physical world, everything desired is brought into instant manifestation by the use of will , intent and the power of imagination. Thoughts take shape instantly and the more power and emotion projected into thoughts, the more real they become and the longer they will remain. Thoughts are vibration, manifest ations of Energy, and most thoughts are transient, that is to say they appear, linger for a time depending on the Energy involved and then fade away again. To create something more permanent in the Astral worlds requires use of the imagination with as much wi ll, intent and focus as possible. This however is often an entirel y natural process requiring no particular effort; it is quite lit erally as natural as thinking. By constantly making use of and thinking about a particular desire, for example a home, the more solid and real it will become and the longer it will persist. Creat ions of the type util ised by many people within the Astral worlds, consensus creations of perhaps thousands or even millions of people, can potentially last for infinity, such creations being the products of collective thoughts and beliefs projected in the same direction and focus by many people. Within the Astral worlds, often known as “the beyond” or “the afterlife” where people transitio n after the process erroneously known as “death”, there are vast areas of Energy comprising just about every type of environment; all consensus creations of numerous people from the past, pres ent and future relative to"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 485 temporal concept of Earth “time”. These creations are the result of vast collective, consensual Ener gy configurations that are continually being influenced by Mi nd, and which En ergy therefore endures under that consensual Mind influence almost ad-infinitum. Many Astral locales including entire cities are inhabited by very large numbers of Astral residents, all continuously influencing the same creative Energy, and thus gi ving these Astral locales their permanency. As mentioned previously , the mid-Astral worlds to which people are attracted after the transition from the physical world in accordance with the Energy characteristic of the individual Astral and Mental body, the Soul and Spirit, are almost identical to the physical world, so much so that many people do not immediately know they have actually passed on. This is because the people of the Astral worlds m odel the Astral worlds based upon their own specific experiences a nd perception of the physical world they have just left, and how they “imagine” it should be. People at that level of evolution on the path often believe that “reality” is represented by material things just as they did on Earth, and accordingly use their powers of the imagination to reproduce that same habitat and perception within the Astral worlds, thereby creating that reality for themselves with which they feel the most comfortable. On an individual level therefore a person might create his ideal home, whereas large numbers of people within the Astral at a consensual level will im agine larger scale cons tructions such as villages, towns and cities, just as t hey were used to in physical life. This applies to all Energy levels of the Astral planes, each level, from the darkest, “hell” like levels to the highest most blissful levels all being a perfect reflection of the vibration of the Soul and Spirit of the people living there, and also their own perception of what “life” should be like in their own reality. This is why, like the physical worlds, the Astral worlds are ephemeral, transient projections created by the Mind of humans, a ll of which are destined to progress and transcend that illusion on the path to the glories, splendours and bliss of the Spirit worlds, pure Mind worlds where"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 486 the perception of form simply does not exist and does not need to exist. The reality and glories of the Spirit worlds are far greater than the temporal physical world or the ephemeral Astral worlds, as everyone will discover as they progress and evolve along the sacred path of perfection back to The Source, The First Cause, God. The Astral worlds are vast, varied and complex, consisting of an infinite number of realms from t he earthly equivalent of past present and future, many of which have been created by beings not of the Earth, but all of which have been created by the very same vibrations, creative Energy of the power of thought, the creative power of the imagination. As we already know, the entire Ether of Universe consists of vibration, which is Energy. Thoughts, emotions and powers of the imagination are therefore also degr ees of vibration of the same Energy. Keep in Mind that Energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be influenced. It is the interaction and influence of Energy by Mind that results in the manifest ation of the objec ts that are the focus of and are therefore influenced by the imagination in accordance with Universal laws, and in particular The Law of Attraction. Exactly the same laws also apply to manifestation into the physical world. Before anything at all can manifest as a reality into the physical world it must first be preceded by thought, a very powerful characteristic of which is imagination. This is very often a subconscious process whereby for example the preparation of a meal is preceded by first imagining what the meal will include, how it should taste, how the meal will be prepared, where the ingredients wil l be obtained from and finally how it will be presented on the table. This is simply a very basic example whereby an act of creation commenced with the process of imagination is subsequently followed up with direct physical actions in the same direction in order to m anifest the original object of the imagination into observable physical reality."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 487 Manifestation can however equa lly be brought about without the need for any associated direct physica l actions at all, exactly the same laws of creation applying to t he inner spheres of the Universe also equally applying to the ph ysical world, again in accordance with The Laws of Attraction and Correspondence in particular; “as above, so below”. Just as anythi ng can be created within the inner spheres entirely by means of the powers of imaginati on, so too can manifestation take place into t he physical world by virtue of the same Universal laws, without even the need for any preceding direct physical action. The physical world however is very dense and of a much lower vibration than the inner Mind worl ds of the Astral and Mental spheres, and therefore more Energy, concentration and focus is required in order to bring about a manifestat ion observable in the physical world. Many people wi ll have heard of “Magic”. We should note straightaway however t hat by true Magic as practiced from time immemorial we do not mean the stage illusionists, prestidigitators, conjurors and other such people from the areas of stage entertainment, but rather Magic in its very truest, very highest and most sacred form. Magic is in reality a sacred science, the word “Magic” originating from the “Magi” who fully understood and applied natural Universal laws in or der to bring about effect that many might consider to be miraculous. The practitioner of true Magic under stands, aligns him or herself with, and makes full and proper use of Universal laws in order to manifest the desired re sults in whichever pl ane of existence the desired result is to be experienc ed. People often erroneously associate Magic with occult prac tices, sorcery and witchcraft for example, but even this is not Magic in its truest and highest form. This is not to say of course that sorcery, witchcraft and similar types of “magic” are not effective, bec ause they most certainly can be and often are, depending on the powers of the practitioner. The Universe does not recognise hu man labels, but only Cause and Effect by virtue of Universal la ws and the influence of the Energy from which everything has been created and has its being."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 488 Sorcery and witchcraft are oft en performed by utilising some Universal laws that resu lt in the influence of Energy in the desired direction, by means for example of spells, rituals and other series of actions, but often without the practi tioner ever being fully aware of what Universal forces are involved or how they ar e being applied. The most powerful true Magic is when the practitioner fully and consciously aligns him or herse lf with, and make s the fullest possible use of Universal laws, powers of the Magi. What most people consider to be “Magic”, and again we are not referring to stage Magic, could mo re properly be referred to as “manifestation”. Manifestation is in the broadest terms the use of the imagination in order to manifest the object of the imagination into physical reality in accor dance with Universal Laws and is the fundamental basis for all creation. In the case of witchcraft, sorcer y and similar practices practitioners often make use of spells, rituals and other regalia su ch as candles, swords, athame’s and much more, in order to provide the focus, intent and Energy required for the object of the imagination, usually by creative visualisation, to manifest into the material world. As we will see later, it is most certainl y not at all necessary to practice witchcraft or sorcery in order to manifest into the physical world, these are quite simply age-old tr aditions that are still carried on today. One of the most important aspects of successful manifestation is highly focussed and concentrated Ener gy in the form of thought or imagination. Indeed, the more Ener gy behind a manifestation the sooner it can materialise into the physical world as an observable reality. Very often, spells an d rituals are only carried out once, meaning the chances of success are more variable and in accordance with the expertise of the focus, concentration and expertise of the practitioner. M agic, or more specifically manifestation can therefore be accomplished by anyone without requiring any form of occult, esoter ic or mystical practices to be performed in order to be successf ul. Indeed, such practices can"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 489 sometimes lead to frustration with the accompanying lack of observable results. Anyone at all can manifest and create any reality for themselves by fully understanding and ap plying natural Universal Laws utilising the si mple, enjoyable and effective exercises that will be detailed later in this book. Finally a word of caution; al l your thoughts, imaginations and creative visualisations must only be for the purposes of good, either for yourself or for other people. Never, ever be tempted to use these powers to harm another pers on. If you do, the Universal law of Cause and Effect, of which karma is an integral aspect will most surely operate against you, and either in this or a future life you will have to pay the price. This is not intended to be a system of punishment as such as with a court of law. The simple fact of the matter is that every cause has its corresponding effect, positive, negative or neutral, and karma is no more than the causation of the Law of Attraction that ensure that no being can be the cause of anything negative without experiencing the corresponding effect. Note that we use the word “exper iencing” rather than “suffering”. Everyone is here to experience and to evolve and not to suffer which is a human construct based on a perception relative to self and the ego. The Universe operates under the influence of the most powerful force in the Universe, Un conditional Love, and that applies to every aspect of human evoluti on, and indeed the evolution of the entire Universe and all Beings , all expressions of God. Providing always that your thoughts, intentions, Energy, imaginations and creative visualis ations are always only for the purposes of good and for genuine needs , and not based in greed, in other words will not bring harm to others in the process, only good will surely result, and your needs and desires will be fulfilled without karmic consequences. "},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 490 Chapter 85: Creative Visualisation Many people have heard of the te rm “creative visualization”, but what exactly is “creative visualisation? Creative visualisation is the process of creating and “seeing” images in your Mind using the pow ers of imagination that we all have as a natural ability of Sp irit. By making these images as realistic as possible within the Mi nd, and by adding Energy to those images by means of concentrati on, emotion and focus, the image will first of all influence inner Ener gy levels, which as we mentioned earlier are actually the inner Ener gy levels comparative to the physical world, before eventually m anifesting into your life as an observable, experiential reality in accordance with Universal Laws including the laws of Attraction, Correspondence and Cause and Effect which of course are all closely related. This experiential manifestation is in the form of Energy that corresponds exactly with the object of your visualisation, the Energy of which vibrates in harmony with it thereby attracting it into your conscious awareness. Your out er, physical reality is therefore always manifested first from within. Th is is not only the basis of all manifestation within the physical world and individual Consciousness, but is also the basis of healing. All diseases of the physical body originat e within the inner bodi es before eventually manifesting within the physical body resulting in a physical disorder. Of course modern medicine seeks to “fix” the problem within the physical body itself, not realising that the Energy giving rise to the disorder of the body still exists as strongly as ever within the inner Energy levels of the Soul and Spirit. As already noted, within the inner worlds relative to the physical Universe, as each and every per son will soon discover upon their next transition to the Astral worl ds after the process erroneously known as “death”, powers of t he imagination with focussed concentration, will and intent results in the instant creation of the object of the imagination out of the Energy of the Astral Ether. The"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 491 creation thus manifested is still pur e Energy but is “shaped” by the Mind of the person who created it. In order to manifest this inner Energy into your present physical reality it is first of all necessary to bring yourself into vibrational harmony with it. Creative visualisati on achieves this by allowing you to experience the object of your visualisation by means of the powers of your imagination, a nd the more you can experience utilising all of the senses, the more you integrate the object of your visualisation into your conscious awareness, and the more it becomes your experiential reality. Unlike the immediate, observable m anifestations of visualisation in the Astral and inner worlds, within the material world the process will seem to be slower due to the relative higher density of matter as compared to the much finer density of the Astral and inner worlds, and the much lower vibrati ons of the Energy involved at the level of the physical world. The mo re Energy, emotion, intent and concentration focussed and conveyed into the visualisation and the more solid and realistically it is visualised utilis ing all of the senses, the more solid and resilient the obj ect of visualisation will in turn become within the fabric of the Energy levels of the inner worlds, and the more you will experience and become in harmony with it, thereby enabling t he object of your visualis ation to manifest into your physical reality. In order to manifest the object of the visualisation as a reality into the physical world, the Energy of the inner worlds need to influence the physical world in t he direction of the desi red result. Again, the Universal Law of Correspondence is a major factor in this process; “as above, so below”, as is the Law of Attraction, although these are of course closely related aspects of the law of cause and effect. Universal harmony will not al low any imbalance between the Energy of the inner worlds and the corresponding Energy of the physical world, or indeed anyw here at all within the multi- dimensional continuum of the Universe. Theref ore once an image is manifested in the inner worlds by means of the imagination,"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 492 creative visualisation, and the Energy exists in a form that has then to be balanced in accordance with The Laws of Correspondence and Attraction, the creation then has to manifest into the physical world in order to maintain Universal balance in accordance with these Laws. Again, the interpla y of the Law of Correspondence as well as the closely related Laws of Attraction and Cause and Effect are all very prevalent in the process of manifestation. As previously discussed, creativ e visualisation is also very important in the attracting of the object of your desires by experientially bringing yourself into harmony with it. The more you visualize and thereby become fully involved with your wishes, the more your vibrations will be in harmony with your wishes, until soon your own Energy will vibrate in harmony with the object of your visualization thus allowi ng it to harmoniously manifest into your own personal reality as an exact vi brational Energy alignment. Another major factor in the success of manifestation into the physical world is due to the influence of the Energy planes of the group human Mind. As we already know, all human Minds are connected at a level of Energy and Consciousness at which levels human Minds can subconsciously influence each other upon the Energy and Consciousness levels of the Mental planes of the collective group human Mind. When a desire of a certain type is created within the inner worlds by the use of creative visualisation and other powers of the imagination, for example the desire to receive a pay increase, the Universe might seek to bring about the necessary balance by influencing the Mind of the person responsible for awarding the pay rise in the desired direction. This is just another way in which Energy seeks balance through physical channels by virtue of Universal Consciousness, Mind and Spirit through which we are all inseparabl e as Universal expressions of The Source Energy, The First Cause, of God. During the creative visualisatio n process required to bring the desired result into manifestati on, you might for example have created an image in your Mind of a higher amount of money written"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 493 upon your usual monthly pay cheque, while at the same time deeply feeling and experiencing t he emotions associated with receiving more money to spend on your desires as well as the gratitude for having received that money; that Energy can then manifest into the Energy of your physical reality as the desired increase in pay. You need not and should not seek a reason for your increase in pay. Once the Energy of your pay increase is vibrating in harmony with your ability to receiv e it, then by virtue of Universal laws it must manifest by the most direct means, means that are very often completely unpredictable. Another way in which desires can be manifested by means of creative visualisation is by way of probability. Before any particular event occurs within the space-time continuum of the physical world there are an infinite number of corresponding probabilities pertaining to that particular even t in the inner worlds beyond the confines of space and time where there is only the Eternal Now. Not only does everything exist, past, present and future relative to Earth time already within the Eter nal Now, but there are also an infinite number of variations and t herefore probabilitie s relating to it. In quantum physics these are know n as quantum pr obabilities. For example in the case of your pa y increase there are potentially an infinite number of possibilities as to whether the pay rise will manifest, not manifest, or even partially manifest. By harmonizing Energy by means of creative vi sualisation, imagining beyond any doubt whatsoever that your pay increase has already completely manifested into your experientia l reality, thereby coming in complete harmony with it, the probabilit y of receiving that pay rise is positively influenced in the directi on of it actually becoming an observable reality. This proces s is all about the influence and balancing of Universal Energy by the Mind. Creative visualisation works at both conscious and subconscious levels of the human Mind. Ever yone is constantly creating by means of the thoughts and images passing through their Minds. However, as most people have no conscious awareness at all of this process, most such thought s and images are usually totally"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 494 random, driven almost entirely in response to minute by minute, hour by hour, day to day physical events in a totally uncoordinated manner. As previously noted, people can and frequently do become trapped in a vortex of negative Energy. By dwelling on negative events and situations, thinking about them c onstantly, imagining all sorts of negative scenarios, in other words “thinking the worst”, the corresponding Energy will be in fluenced and attracted and accordingly “the worst” will sooner or later manifest as a reality into the lives of these negative thinki ng people. Such a situation can then very easily spiral out of c ontrol. For this reason everyone should be fully aware of their own thought processes at all times, instantly rejecting all negative thoughts and images and retaining only those positive thoughts and im ages consistent with the desired direction in life. S hould a negative thought or image intr ude then it should either be rejected or tran smuted to the opposite positive thought or image. Under standing and aligning wit h Universal laws and Energy and applying them exclusively for the most positive purposes as a natural way of living, just as every human was created to do by God, is indeed M agic in its highest and truest form. God, The One, The A ll is the Supreme Creat or, The Source, The First Cause within the Macrocosm of the Universe, whereas human beings being made in the true image of God, and integral aspects of God are co-creators in the microcosm, the individual aspect of the Universe. Every human being wit hout exception is therefore an integral aspect of the great creative process of the Universe, and it is accordingly incumbent on everyone to use these powers consciously, wisely, and only for the greater good of personal and Universal evolution. There is nothing at all wrong with des iring to bring good things into your life and to live comfortably with all genuine needs fulfilled. The Universe is infinitely abundant and there is always enough for everyone. One of the greatest pr oblems on Earth at this time however, is that due to the gross materialistic attitudes and ego of"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 495 many people, together with a total la ck of understanding of the way in which the Universe works and of the true purpose and destiny of mankind, there is a considerable imbalance between those who have much more than they could ever really need to live very comfortably, and those who have insufficient for even the most basic existence, a situation that has been caused by forcing everything in a physical directi on by physical means and against the creative flow of t he Universe. Instead of being open channels of expression and creation, much of mankind has created an alternative physical reality based upon perceptions and idea in turn based upon materialism and the ego. Only when mankind fully understands the immutable operation of Universal laws and lives accordingly will these imbalances be balanced, and every human being in every part of the worl d can live in peace, harmony and plenty thereby fulfilling the ultima te “Kingdom of Heaven on Earth”, an Earth that is finally vibrati ng in harmony with the Universe. Creative visualisation can attrac t genuine needs from the Universe of abundance, therefore facilitati ng the process of balance. In utilising your own powers of crea tive visualisation and imagination you should never be tempted to become trapped within the spiral of materialism or of the demands of the ego by endeavouring to manifest more than the genuine needs of yourself, your family and others in genuine need. It is in cumbent on every one therefore in utilising these God given Universa l powers of the Mind to fully understand their own individual desti ny and that of all mankind, thus ensuring these abilities ar e always used wisely for genuine personal needs and for the greater good of t he Universe, and never merely to satisfy greed, the ego, or for the accumulation of material things for the sake of it. As we know, the entire Universe and everything and everyone within it, is an infinitely large Ener gy field comprised of vibration. Thoughts and imagination are also therefore pure Energy, which when directed effectively influenc es the corresponding Energy in the Universe in the same directi on by coming into harmony with it, Energy that has to be balanced in accordance with immutable"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 496 Universal laws. The more power and focus placed behind this Energy by means of concentration, visualisation, emotions, intent, and will, the more profound and rapid will be the effect be on the corresponding Energy you wish to influence in your direction in order to potentially manifest your desires into physical reality. For these reasons alone it must be stressed once again the absolute importance of exercisi ng total Mindfulness and control over all thoughts and images at all times, and in particular avoiding negative and limited thin king. In this way you can maintain full, conscious control at all times, mani festing only those positive things into your life and the lives of your loved ones. These powerful abilities are within every single human being as creators in the microcosm, each of us being an i mmortal Spirit, made in the “true image of God”, The Suprem e, Divine Creator of the Universe in all its planes of glory, the Macrocosm. Creative visualisation can be applied to potentially manifest anything at all at any Energy level over which Mind has an influence. It should be realised howev er that the larger the desire the longer it might take to manifest it into physical reality. It might not even be possible to manifest some desires in an acceptable time scale due to the sheer number of other people projecting the same Energy into exactly the same desire. A very good example of this situation is winning the lo ttery. When millions of people purchase a lottery ticket each week , each and every one of them is projecting exactly the same desire , in other words vibrating the same Energy of intent to win the jackpot. The sheer individual Energy required to overcome these collective Energy of so many people all focussing on and vibrating exactly the same desire would be extremely difficult to produce and project, and are in any case would be beyond the powers of the Mind of most Ea rthly people at this stage in their evolution. It makes much more sense therefore with the results being potentially much more rapid to focus on desires within your own sphere of personal availability, t hereby involving as few people as"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 497 possible. To use the previous exam ple of obtaining a pay increase; in this case only two people are dire ctly involved, yourself and your manager, and therefore y our Energy can be much more highly focussed and will accordingly be t hat much more effective. Manifesting large, tangible physica l items, for exam ple a home or a car usually takes more time effort due to the number of situations and probabilities needing to be influenced first. All manifestations into the physical world requires a physical channel through which the Universe can realise that desire. There are literally an infinite num ber of ways by which a desire can manifest into your physical reality, most if not all of which are not immediately obvious. As previously noted, the Universe is infinitely abundant and your task is to direct your Energy by means of your God given powers of the Mind, and to vibrate in complete harmony with the Energy of your desires, thereby allowing the Universe to manifest your desires though physi cal channels in its own natural way, and in accordance with immutable Universal laws. For larger manifestation projects it can be much more effective and more rapid in the long run to manifest a desire in stages. For example you might wish to mani fest a successful computer business for yourself where you are your own boss. Taking this example, you might first manifest the new PC requir ed to learn the necessary skills. Next you might m anifest a series of training courses in business management fo llowed by further courses in advanced computer skills. Having successfully achieved this you might then manifest an office from which to launch your new computer business and then start to manifest customers for your business. Once you have many customers and your business is a great success, a fact that in your Mind you should not ever have the slightest doubt, you then might then wish to manifest larger offices and some employees if appropriate. Finally, if you wish, you can manifest a thriving computer bus iness with many employees, a business that is very highly thought of by your customers, and is providing yourself and your fa mily with all of your genuine needs."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 498 This is a fairly basic example of manifestation but nevertheless serves to illustrate a sequential pr ocess of manifestation towards achieving an ultimate desire. Of course, it is also possible to use the creative visualisation proce ss to manifest your successful computer business without any interim stages at all, allowing the Universe to manage the ”details ”. You would likely eventually succeed in manifesting this desir e, however due to the number of people, factors and possibi lities involved, the process might take more concentrated Energy a nd focus during your creative visualisation sessions, as well as more time to bring yourself into vibrational harmony with your desir es, and therefore in turn take longer to manifest. The closely related Laws of A ttraction, Correspondence and Cause and Effect are all involved in the pr ocess of manifestation by means of creative visualisation. These la ws are all very much related but with subtle differences. The Law of Attraction is such that whatever you constantly hold in your Mi nd creates a unique vibration and Energy that the Universe will imm ediately seek to balance by the harmonisation of and manifesting w hatever you hold in your Mind as soon as possible through physical channels, providing your vibration, your Energy at an indivi dual level is in complete harmony with it. Creative visualisation and in particular utilising all powers of the imagination, facilitates this process considerably. The Law of Correspondence is repr esented by the age-old axiom “as above, so below”. Whenever Ener gy is projected into the inner spheres of reality, wh ere density is much lower and vibration much higher, depending on the amount of E nergy projected it will remain as a potential manifestation in t he form of an Energy configuration until such time as the Universe brings about balance by actually manifesting it into physical reality. As previously mentioned, this is the basis of true Magic. Where the Law of Attraction subtly differs from the Law of Correspondence is t hat the Law of Attraction is a more ongoing interaction of Ener gy until harmony is achieved, whereas the Law of Correspondence seeks to balance stronger Energy or vibrations that have b een brought about by a single or a"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 499 few similar actions, by m anifesting the object of that Energy into the physical world where the original creative Energy originated. The Law of Cause and Effect is much more absolute in that it simply states that for every cause, for example the altering of Energy, vibration by means of the power of thought, there has to be a corresponding effect, and the Universe will always maintain balance by bringing about the co rresponding effect. Absolute harmony is always the direction of Energy and therefore of the Universe as a whole. The Law of Attraction is theref ore more of an ongoing state of Consciousness, whereas the la ws of Correspondence and Cause and Effect are more likely to be invoked by a single or few much more focussed cause. All Universal laws are in operation and interacting however at all times, all maintaining harmony, balance and ongoing perfection withi n the Universe. There are no notional limits to what can be manifested by creative visualisation, the Universe is in finitely abundant, but the forgoing needs to be considered most carefully . As with most things in life, whatever you succeed in manifesting will be directly related to the degree of effort and commitment in volved, and the degree to which you vibrate in harmony with it. Finally, before proceeding to the practical creative visualisation techniques following, t hese words of caution should be repeated. Never, ever consider using creativ e visualisation for the purpose of affecting others in any negative or harmful way whatsoever, either intentionally or other wise. The Universal processes involved, like Magic, do not discriminate betw een positive or negative, good or evil, black or white all being degrees of the same Energy. The creative abilities of humans ar e very real and very powerful, and must always be used with a gr eat sense of responsibility. Again, in accordance with the law of Cause and Effect, including karma, anyone who uses their God gi ven powers to cause harm to"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 500 any other person, or indeed to any aspect of the Universe, will most assuredly pay the price, ei ther in this or a future lifetime, there is no escaping the immutable Universal laws of Cause and Effect of which karma is an integral aspec t. All of humanity and the entire Universe are as one; we are all aspec ts of the same infinite Energy and Consciousness of Spirit, we ar e all immortal aspects of The Divine, of The Source, of God, and anyone who harms anyone or anything else equally harms themse lves without ex ceptions and in immutable progression, it is the Law.   "},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 501 Chapter 86: The Practice of Creative Visualisation Learning to visualise effectivel y and at will is an extremely worthwhile ability. Visualisatio n is an aspect of the imagination which can not only be used in the proc ess of maintaining full control over every aspect of your life, but as previously mentioned can also be used very effectively to manifest your desires, to heal yourself, to protect yourself from harmful psychic influences, and much, much more. Also, and most importantly, these ab ilities can also be used in the same way for the benefit of loved ones and others. Imagination is a major power behind all creation in the Universe, both in the Macrocosm and the micr ocosm. Everyone will use these abilities as a completely natural aspect of life in the much lower density of the inner worlds after passing on from the physical world. Learning to visualise effectively, as with most worthw hile abilities, requires time to be set aside, preferably each and every day. Ten minutes each day will suffice to start with, but as you progress, thirty minutes each day would be much more beneficial. Any spare time during the day can be used to pr actice creative visualisation as well as other valuable abilities. To begin these exercises first of all obtain five household items of your choice, such as a fruit, a cu p, a pen, a spoon, a coin; any such items will suffice; it is preferable however if they are all of a distinctly different shape and colour. Start the exercise by attaining a good state of ph ysical and mental relaxation in a place where you can concentrate and will not be disturbed. It is best to sit upright on a hard kitchen type chair without leaning against the backrest of the chair; this will enable you to achieve the necessary stat e of relaxation, concentration and focus, with your spine completely straight, without falling asleep."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 502 For these reasons lying on a bed or reclining in an armchair are most certainly not advisable. Set out your four chosen items in fr ont of you. Now fi x your eyes on the first of these objects and memori se it in as much detail as you possibly can, including shape, co lour, texture, patterns and any other significant details. Next close your eyes and recall the object in your im agination in as much detail as possible. The objective is to visualise the object in your Mind as clearly or even clearer than it appears to your physical sight. You might well find that w hen first starting these exercises the object will frequently f ade from your imaginat ion; if this happens simply use as much will power and concentration as necessary to recall the object back into your im agination. You will soon find that after time and practice the object will disappear and reappear increasingly less frequently until finally you can maintain a solid and realistic image for any length of time, visualising the object just as it appears to your physical sight. Should you become tired practicing with one object, move straight onto the next object and repeat the visualisation exercise. It is very important to remain as relaxed as possible while maintaining each visualisation for as long and rea listically as you can; there is nothing to be gained however by over-tiring yourself. Although these exercises might seem to be quite difficult to start with for some people, as with gaining any wo rthwhile ability it is extremely important to persevere; these are ex tremely valuable abilities as will become readily apparent to you. The objective of these exercises is to maintain an image of your chosen item with total, absolute realism, just as it would appear to your physical sight, for at least five continuous minutes without it fading from your Consciousness. When you have achieved this with your first four chosen objects, select another four objects and repeat the exercises until you achieve the same results."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 503 For the next stage of these exercises, rather than starting with four physical objects, recall any object or scene of your choice from memory and visualise it with as much realism as possible. This might for example be a household it em, something in your garden, or perhaps a favourite location or per son; it really does not matter what image you select providing you can readily bring it to Mind, retain it in your Mind and become emotionally involved with it. Having attained as clear an image as possible in your Mind from memory of your chosen object, person or scene, once again endeavour to maintain the image as it would appear to your physical senses for a full five minut es without it fading from your imagination. When you can maintain any image vividly in your Mind with total realism for a full five minutes, then this part of the visualisation exercises is complete. The final stage of these exercises is to visualise objects with your eyes open. It doesn’t matter which objects you choose for this purpose although it is better to st art with the objects previously visualised with your eyes closed. To commence, with your eyes open imagine, as realistically as possible, your object suspended in the air, standing on a shelf, on a table, or anywhere else of your choice. Your object must appear to be every bit as solid and real as the original physical object, so much so in fact that you feel th at you feel you can actually reach out and touch it. There must be abso lutely no doubt whatsoever as to the complete realism of your vis ualised object as it is suspended in the air, or standing on a solid objec t such as a shelf or table. This exercise is complete when you c an maintain in your imagination your visualisation of any object, in any location, with your eyes open for a full five minutes. "},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 504 Chapter 87: Other Senses of the Imagination Powers of imagination for manife station, healing, psychic defence and many other abilities will be greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with other inner senses ; hearing, sentience, smell and taste. Sentience inclu des touch, but also in cludes the ability to sense temperature, lightness or heaviness, hunger, thirst and tiredness for example. We will commence these exercises by developing within the imagination the sense of hearing. Begin by assuming your usual rela xed position in a location where you will not be disturbed as with the previous visualisation exercises. Now imagine you can hear the ticking of a clock. You must hear this clock ticking as distinctly and realistically as possible to the extent you have no doubts in your Mind whatsoever there really is indeed a clock in your room When you can maintain this sound in your imagination for a full five minutes, select another familiar sound, for example the chimes of a clock, the pealing of a bell, a tapping sound, the sound of rain against a window, the sound of a hous ehold appliance; any distinct well-known sound will suffice. As with the ticking of the clock, imagine your chosen sound with complete realism to the extent you have no doubts whatsoever for a full five minutes before moving on to the next sound. We are only concerned with the auditory aspect of this exercise; should a vision of the item appear in your imaginati on use your willpower to dismiss it immediately. Once you can imagine any sound of your choice with absolute realism for a full five minutes without interruptions as if you are in the physical presence of thes e sounds then these auditory exercises are complete."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 505 The next exercise involves the de velopment of sentience within the imagination, in other words the s enses of touch, temperature, lightness, heaviness, hunger, thirst and other sent ient feelings. As with the previous exercises, in a location where you will not be disturbed assume your usual relaxe d position, close your eyes and select a sentient feeling of your choice, for example warmth. With complete concentration, imagine, as realistically as possible, this sentient feeling. In t he case of warmth for ex ample you should feel the warmth all over your body and without any doubts whatsoever in your Mind. Even if the room is cool you should feel warm. When you can maintain this first sentient feeling for a full five minutes without any interruptions, including any spurious images appearing in your Mind that must be dismissed, you can move onto the next sentient feeling. This time it might be a texture such as a carpet or sandpaper for example. Again, imagine yourself feeling this texture as if you where actually running your fing ers across it. As always maintain the feeling of the chos en texture for a full uni nterrupted five minutes while knowing beyond any doubt in your Mind that it is totally real in every respect. Now move on to the next object of your sentience exercises. This time for example you could summon a feeling of thirst, hunger or warmth. Imagine as realistically as possible that you feel very hungry or very thirsty as if you rea lly need food or dr ink, or as warm as the sun on your skin on a beautiful summers day. Again maintain these feelings with total realism to the extent there is no doubt whatsoever in your Mind that you are actually experiencing them for a full five minutes. Having successfully achieved each of the sentience exercises for a full five minutes, you can then proceed to the next exercises. "},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 506 Next is the development of creative olfactory abilities, the sense of smell within the imagi nation. As with the previous exercises assume your usual relaxed positi on in a location w here you will not be disturbed and close your eyes. Using all of your powers of im agination imagine you can smell a favourite fragrance. It might for example be a perfume, a flower, food cooking, or any other smell of your choice. The smell need not be pleasant, it can be anything at al l providing it is distinctive and you can bring it to Mind. As with all of the previous exercises, maintain this smell in your imagination as vividly as possibl e without any interruptions, and without any of the other imaginary s enses such as visuals intruding. You must be totally focussed on y our selected sme ll, and be totally convinced of its realism as if it is strongly present in your room. If you are imagining the scent of a favourite flower be absolutely convinced you are right next to the flower in question. Again it is most important to focus exclusivel y on the olfactory aspect of the object and not to allow any of t he other senses to intrude. Having maintained an exclusive sense of smell in your imagination for a full five minutes then select another smell with which you are familiar and repeat the exercises. Continue with these olfactory exercises until you have exclusivel y maintained in your imagination various different smells for a full five minutes, after which these exercises are complete. The final sense to be creatively developed in the imagination is taste. Begin as with the previous exercises with complete relaxation where you will not be disturbed and close y our eyes. Now imagine you can taste a favourite food or drink as vividly as you possible can as if you are actua lly eating or drinking a sample of the food or drink in question. As always you must be totally convinced of the reality of this and ther e must be no interruptions either externally or from other senses or thoughts endeavouring to intrude; you must be focussed exclusively upon the taste."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 507 When you have succeeded in maintain ing the first taste for a full uninterrupted five minutes, move on to another taste of your choice. As with the other exercises, once you have successfully maintained in your imagination a range of tastes with total realism and without interruptions for a full five minut es, then these exercises are also complete. As the final exercise we will now put all of t he senses together in an imaginary scenario of your own c hoice. Select any scene of your choosing, ensuring all of your senses are fully included and involved within the scene. We will use a stroll in the park as an example. As always assume your relaxed position ensuring you will not be interrupted and close your eyes. Now bring into your imagination as vividly as possible your imagined scenario. Using our example of the park, vi sualise yourself strolling through the park gates with your family. If you do not have a family then simply imagine instead you are st rolling through the park either by yourself or with a friend or friends . Adapt this scenario to suit your own situation and preferences. As you begin to stroll along the path you clearly hear birds singing cheerfully in the trees and feel the gentle, warm summer wind on your face. You can feel one of y our children tugging excitedly at your hand as the sounds of other children playin g happily drift across the vivid green parkland la wns. As you pass by a rose garden you can smell the fragrance of the roses as you observe them blooming in many di fferent beautiful colours. Soon you reach the park cafeteria and you stop to buy the family an ice cream. You can taste the ice cr eam as it melts in your mouth and as it’s welcome coolness sli des down your throat. Soon you reach the children’s play area wher e you sit down on the soft grass. The smell of the short, recently cut grass is very distinctive. The"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 508 children shout happily as they go off to play on the amusements while you absorb the atmosphere of the gorgeous summers day while enjoying your ice cream. As you finish your ice cream y ou can hear the wind rustling through the nearby trees intermingling wit h the noises of the children happily playing nearby. As time progr esses you can feel the midday sun becoming hotter and hotter and you realise it is time to go home. You call the children from the amusements and all set off on a slow stroll home taking in all of the familiar sights, sounds and smells along the way with the children excitedly discussing everything they enjoyed playing in the park. When you arrive home you all have a nice cooling drink, and you relax in while the children go off to safely play in the back garden. Practice this sort of scenario us ing all of the senses of your imagination as often as possible. The resulting abilities will be of profound value in your life and for the path ahead.  "},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 509 Chapter 88: The Power of Emotions Emotions are powers of the Mind, and like all powers of the Mind influence Energy. Emotion can theref ore be thought of as E-Motion; Energy in Motion. Although all thought influences Ener gy to some extent, emotions can be and very often are a very powerful influence over Universal Energy, and therefore w hat we attract into our individual physical reality we create based upon t hose thoughts or emotions. Thoughts charged with emotion c an be very powerful indeed. Providing we remain fully aware of this fact then we can either control or use emotions in our lives to a very powerful extent. We should always either immediately negate any negative emotions by use of the will, or much better stil l we should immediately transmute negative emotions to their opposite positive emotions as soon as we become aware of them. Again, we should always remain fully aware of our feelings, thoughts and emotions at all times as a fundamental requirement for creati ng our own reality and controlling our own lives rather than simply being carried along with the flow, or being constantly under t he influence of others. It should be mentioned that this is a principle behind true alchemy. When most people think of alchemy or perhaps even in the context of the philosophers stone, they are often thinking in terms of the transmutation of base metals such as lead into precious metals such as gold. This is of course quite possible due to the fact that everything in the Universe is ultimately Energy, and Energy is influenced by Mind. At a quantum potential le vel therefore there really is no reason whatsoever wh y Energy transiently comprising atoms of lead should not be transmuted to Energy comprising atoms of gold or indeed at oms of anything at all. True alchemy in its purest and orig inal form however is not about transmuting material things, about rather the evolution to perfection of the human body, Soul and Spir it where the “lead” of negative"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 510 characteristics are transmuted to t he “gold” of their corresponding positive characteristics, an ongoi ng process of perfection that continues along the path back to un ity with The Source, The First Cause, God. The true meaning of life, the ve ry reason for our creation and individual existence is to evolve back to God by means of the ongoing process of perfection, a lways aspiring to the Ultimate perfection of God. Transmutation of negative, dense, low vibrations to their opposite positive, fine, high vibrations is all a part of the ongoing evolutionary process of all life. Awareness and control over the emotions can be profoundly valuable, especially for example in the creation of our own realities. Because emotions are such a pow erful aspect of the Mind, they have an equally powerful effect on the Energy that shapes our individual reality. The scale of emotion ranges from the very highest emotion and vibration of all, the emotion of th e The Source, The First Cause, of God, that of Uncondi tional Love, all the way down to the very lowest emotion at the lowest end of the emot ional Energy scale of vibration, that of abject hate. It should be noted that the base leve l of emotions, and therefore of vibration have a profound effect on exactly where people find themselves after passing on from the physical world after the process erroneously known as “deat h”. As we know, The Law of Attraction is always in immutable operation throughout the Universe. In the context of the tr ansition from the physical to the non-physical worlds everyone will trans ition to the Energy level of vibration of the Astral worlds th at most closely match the overall vibrations of the Astral body or Soul. Those who have therefore lived a hate oriented physical life wil l transition to a lower Energy level of vibration of the Astral wo rlds that matches that level of Energy and vibration perfectly. They will find themselves existing within a dark, dank, oppressive existence with for example"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 511 perpetual mist and fog with bare tr ees with no leaves; these being a perfect reflection of their Mind and therefore vibrati on. Such a world will be inhabited with other people with similar Energy vibration characteristics. Even these worlds however are plac es of learning and evolution in that the people residing there will ev entually learn the meaning of the phrase “do unto others as they would do unto you”, and once learned they can integrate that ex perience into their being, raising vibrations and the transition to i nner, more pleasant worlds of a inner Energy level of vibration before reincarnating to apply the lessons learned within another physical life on Earth. The same principles apply all t he way down the scale of emotion from Unconditional Love, thr ough joy, passion, enthusiasm, positiveness, optimism, hope, cont entment, satisfaction, boredom, frustration, feeling overwhelme d, disappointment, doubt, worry, blame, discouragement, anger, revenge, insecurity, jealousy, fear and hate. It is well worth noting that “fear” is a level of vibration that is very far down on the emotional scale and ye t is an emotion that many people increasingly project to thei r own detriment by creating a powerful fear driven reality for themselves. As the very true statement says “there is nothing to fear but fear itself”. Like worry, fear will always feed upon itself mani festing more of the object of that fear into the individual, experi ential reality of t he fearful person. Fear must therefore be immediately identif ied and transmuted to a higher Energy level of vibration a nd emotion such as optimism, or preferably joy. Our emotions are also our inner system of guidance as we progress along the path ba ck to God, and in maintaining full control over our own individual reality. By always being consciously aware of our emotions we can steer our lives in the desired direction instead of being swept along like flotsam on a river, by random thoughts and “situations ” and under the influence and even direct"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 512 control of others. As we already know, we are all open channels of expression for the Source, T he First Cause of God, and by maintaining these open channels as widely open as possible we will allow God to express and cr eate though us, in turn enabling ourselves to easily attract and share in the infinite abundance of the Universe. By paying such close attention to our emotions, accentuating the most positive powerful emotions while neutralising or transmuting negative emotions we can align ourselves with The Source, The First Cause, God, thereby enjoyi ng a much closer relationship with God as a free flowing channel of expression, attraction and therefore of creation. We are all co-creators in the Universe, the microcosm, as well as within our own experiential reality. As we will see in the next chapter on the subject of manifestation, emotions can have an extremely powerful effect on creating your own reality. The more positive, focused, emotionally charged Energy you can focus upon your desires as if they are already a total reality in your life, the more of your desires you will attract from the Universe of infinite abundance. One of the most powerful of all aspects of positive emotion is passion. Charging your manifestat ion exercises with passion will greatly enhance its effectiveness, and accordingly how soon it will become an experiential reality within your physical life, keeping in Mind that the objects of your desires have always existed within the infinite abundance or the Eternal Now of the Universe. So whatever you do, always “follow your passions”. Following your passions is very powerful in business. Those who start a business with the exclusiv e idea of causing people to part with money that they may profit will never be truly wealthy, they may merely “make money”. “Making money” and attracting true wealth are very different things. Those who do go in to business to “make money” might well achieve t heir objectives if they work hard and succeed in making money or ev en in making a lot of money,"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 513 but they will most certainly nev er be wealthy. When such people look back at the money they m ade and how they made it, they will know that they have a hole inside them that they can never go back and fill. They made money alright but what genuine difference did they really make to the lives of people and to the world? If they did affect the lives of other people was it truly in a positive way that enriched the life of others? We are all Sons and Daughters of God, made in t he true Spiritual image of God, and we must alwa ys first and foremost serve our Brothers and Sisters of the Univer se before we even think of serving ourselves. Selfless servic e is extremely important both in personal evolution and in attracting wealth. By serving others we serve ourselves in accordance with immutable Universal laws. In business, following a passion is an extremely powerful way of attracting long-term wealth. More im portantly, in the years to come such a person will be rightly fille d with pride, fulfillment and joy at having profoundly been of genuine serv ice to his or her Brothers and Sisters of the Universe, havi ng touched the lives and helped many people in the process. Pa ssion is Energy, a very powerful Energy of emotion that will influence the Energy of like-Minded people by means of the Law of Attraction. When a person is passionate about the product or serv ice being offered, people who are equally passionate about the same subject will be attracted and will likely purchase the product with as much joy as you are selling it to them. This principle ca n be likened to two tuning forks separated by a distance . When one tuning fork is struck the other tuning fork will resonate at the sa me frequency of vibration and will be attracted. If you consider y ourself to be one of these tuning forks and your potential customer the other, both resonating at the same frequency of Energy and therefor e vibration, it is simple to understand how the Law of Attraction operates in these situations. There is plenty of evidence of th is on the Internet today whereby people are following a passion in providing goods and services. These people are sometimes making millions of dollars per year"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 514 offering what might seem like very obscure goods and services, and all working from home with a si ngle Website and no particular technical abilities or resources. The Universe often requires physi cal channels in order to bring physical things into physical realit y. The Internet is the ultimate physical channel in that there are millions of people already connected to the Internet, with more each day, and using the Internet every day in seeking in formation, products and services in pursuit of their passions. When the passions of someone resonate with someone else who is passionat ely offering goods or services relating to the very same passion, their relative Energy, vibration resonates in harmony and they are thereby attracted to each other in a very powerful way. Such an a ttraction really is perfect because these passionate people have been ab le to mutually achieve their objectives with joy, and after they par t will feel mutually fulfilled; the merchant in providing goods or serv ices that have pr oven to be of true value and service to someone sharing the same passion, and the customer for obtaining an object of their passion that will enrich their lives. This is another example of service resulting in evolution and expansion. As we will see in the next chapt er of this book, emotion is an extremely powerful catalyst to appl y in the process of conscious manifestation. The higher and mo re charged the emotion is, and the higher will be the vibrations and the mo re powerful it will be in accordance with The Law of Attraction. One of the most powerful emotions aside from Unconditional Love is Joy. Joy is an emotion that is very high on the Energy scale of vibration; the more joy that is projected into manifestation exercises, the more effective it will be the result. People with a genuine passion for something almost always follow that passion with great joy and enthusiasm, which is why The Law of Attraction works so powerfully in their fa vour in attrac ting an unlimited abundance relating to that passion."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 515 Two further emotions that are ve ry important are Appreciation and Gratitude. Taking anything for grant ed results in low vibrations, and your life will reflect that perfe ctly. Sincere appreciation and in particular genuine and sincere grat itude conveys a vibration that will attract more of the same into your life. It is all a part of maintaining that open channel as an expression of God through which God can express in the form of unlimited abundance, evolution and creation. Always give thanks in your Mind with the highest possible sincere appreciati on and gratitude fo r everything you have attracted into your life from the Universe of infinite abundance and you will continue to attract more abundance without limits. As we will see in the next chapter on the subject of manifestation, empowering your mani festation exercises with the Energy vibrations of joy, passion, ent husiasm, gratitude and appreciation has a very powerful influence over the Energy involved, and will assist enormously with attracting t he objects of your desires into your physical experiential reality by affirming the fact that you already have them, thereby incr easing the attraction of these desires into your experiential rea lity where they can be enjoyed.  "},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 516 Chapter 89: Creating Your Own Reality We will now look at the very import ant process of manifestation; the conscious creation of your own rea lity; the manifest ation of your wishes and desires. Always remember; there is absolutely nothing that you cannot be, do or have. It is highly advisable before embar king on any manifestation project to meditate upon, or consider very deeply whether you really do need and desire any specific objectiv e to manifest into your life and the life of those around you. Some times what seems to be a very good idea and desirable idea at the time turns out to be decidedly less than desirable once it manifest s as a reality into your life. It is most important to think only in terms of genuine needs and never of greed or the demands of t he ego, as for example would be the case if you were comparing yourself with others. Before for example you manifest money, you should think or meditate very deeply on what this money, or anythin g else you wish to manifest will really add, not only to your ow n life but also to that of your family, loved ones and others around you. As we know, the Universe conc eptually consists of illusions, a duality of the “observer” and the “observed”. In this way the Universe, The Source, God, evol ves by experiencing expressions of Him/Herself, as do all individ uations of God including human beings. The observed is meaningless without an observer, and likewise the observer is meaningless without being observed. It is therefore by this process of indi viduation that the process of the observer and the observed is per petuated, and evolution of the Universe continues. The entire Universe of which we are integral aspects is a vast expanse of Energy vibr ating at different rates from the lowest vibration of matter to the highest vi bration of The Source, The First Cause, God. The illusion of separat ion is perpetuated by virtue of the way in which Mind perceives and decodes these vibrations. So"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 517 “things” only exist because we observe them and decode the vibrations of the Energy of the “thing” being observed. Without this observation, the “thing” being observed cannot exist, except as a quantum probability within the vast expanse of Energy constituting the Universe. So everything in the Universe is a quantum probabilit y of existence until such time as it is observed and decoded by the Mind, at which point the probability bec omes an actuality wh ile being observed after which it becomes a probabi lity once again. This equally applies to our indivi dual realities and is the very basis of manifestation, in other words the creation of our own realities based entirely on what we hold in our Mind, which in turn influences the Energy that surrounds us and we are an integral aspect to the extent that a quantum probability can manifest as a quantum reality. The process of creating anything and everything you could possibly desire is a natural, God given abilit y that everyone possesses, it is just that most simply do not know or realise it. The Universe is infinitely abundant; there are no limit s on wealth or anything else. When you know beyond any doubt t hat you are inde ed a creator, a co-creator within this magnificent Universe in which we live, an aspect of The Source, The First Cause, God, then you will know beyond any doubts in your very being that you can realise all of your wishes. The process of manifestation is conceptually extremely simple, consisting of the fo llowing five steps: Know, Ask, Experience, Action and Gratitude. 1) Know your desire. 2) Ask for your desire. 3) Experience your desire. 4) Action towards your desire. 5) Gratitude for your desire."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 518 These five steps will enable you to manifest absolutely anything at all into your own physical reality. Once learned, you will apply these steps naturally in yo ur ongoing existence, and you will become a conscious creator of your own reality, shaping your world in precise accordance with your desires. Y ou can enjoy a magical life of unlimited joy, harmony and fulfilmen t, always knowing that there is absolutely nothing that you cannot be, do or have. Let us now take a detailed look at each of these im portant steps to realising your wishes. Step 1: Know your desire : This might seem obvious, but in fact many people simply do not really know what they desire. They might think they want this, that or the other, but never really consider it in great depth. A friend gets a new car for example, and the person immediately believes that they need a new car; often a better car. A person might go shopping in an expensive store and see something that they cannot afford but believe they need or must have anyway because it will enhance their life in some way. Sometimes people simply decide on a whim that they need a particular item or event in their lives. Knowing what you really do want is an extremely important first step in the process of manifest ing a desire. Before proceeding therefore take as much time as you need to contemplate your desire, and if necessary medita te on your desire or ask for guidance. Consider in considerable detail as to what the object of your desire will really bring to you. How will it really b enefit you? How will it make you happy and enhance your r eality? And most importantly how will it help you towards arrivi ng at where you really need to be? "},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 519 You need to be brutally honest with yourself. Wanting something simply because a friend, relation or person at work has just bought one is not a very good reason for ex ample. Your desires would be driven by the demands of the ego, motivated by such negative emotions as vanity, jealousy or envy. Wanting something to show off to people, or to convey an impression of wealth is not a good reason it is simply egotistic, vain and materialistic. Desiring something on a whim si mply because it seems like a good idea at the time is also not a good reason to manifest anything into your existence. You really do need to take as much time as is necessary to decide and to actually know beyond any doubt that you genuinely need the object of your desire and that your life will be enhanced by it in a positive way. Only you can make this decision; no one else can make it for you. This is your own r eality to create; it is reality of no one else. You are the one who will need to live with whatever you bring into your reality, as well as being completely responsible for its affect on your family and all those around you. It is also important to only focu s on one objective at a time. Never waste your time and Energy by si mply wishing, daydreaming or fantasizing about numerous thi ngs. You must decide on exactly what one single thing at a time t hat you really, genuinely need and desire above all else, and focus y our entire Energy on that desire until such time as it has manifested into your life. There is no time limit on this step because it is so fundamentally important. If you cannot yet achieve that le vel of certainty, use your imagination to visualize and experienc e what your life will be like if you had your objective at this very moment. Experience it. Observe the reactions of those around you. Place yourself forward in time and ask yourself whether you enjoy or regret having this thing in your life. "},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 520 If you are still having problems deciding whether you really do need this desire, just before sleep and just after waking ask for inner guidance. Simply focus and concentrate as deeply as you can and ask very clearly in your Mind, “do I really need this....... in my reality”. Replace the dots with t he object of your desires. Your question will be picked up by your subconscious Mind and relayed to your Higher-Self which knows everything in the Earthly equivalent of past, present and future. Your Higher-Self will know whether this desire enhances your reality or not. Continue to ask this question with complete conc entration whenever you have a quite moment to relax and not be disturbed, and aga in just before sleep at night and just after waking in the morning for your normal routine. Always be alert for the answer arriving, as it surely will, in the form of inspiration, intuition and ju st “knowing”. When your answer arrives you will know beyond any doubt. Always, but always follow this inner guidance at all times; never, but never, ever go against this inner guidance, even if it is not what you “wanted to hear”. What seems like a good idea from your very narrow, physical perspective in space-time rea lity may not be a good idea in the grand scheme of things, and your Higher-Self will always know that beyond all question. And finally you should never, ever, ever ask for money. As we have already discussed, money is, in and of itself totally meaningless. It is a merely a human construct, an object, a notional method of exchange which as far as the Univ erse is concerned is no more than Energy in the form of bits of physical metal, paper or electronic bits and bytes stored on a comput er system. The Universe is infinitely abundant, everything you could possibly wish for already exists, however large or small, and all you need to do is to bring it into your physical awareness, and t herefore your physical reality. Always ask for exactly what you want, and never place a monetary value upon it and again never, but never, ever ask for money. "},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 521 Once you know beyond all doubt what you really want, you can proceed to the next step. Step 2: Ask for your desire: Ask and you shall receive. These are indeed ancient and most wise words. We are all here to evolve by means of our own freewill. The Universe, The Source, God ther efore never, ever denies anyone any request for anything whatsoev er; there are no exceptions to this truth. Each and every pers on must experience exactly that which they need to experience in or der to learn and evolve back to The Source, The First Cause, God. Always remember that this is the true meaning of life. Every wish is immediately and unconditionally granted; all we need to do is to know how to receive. It is in the receiving however that most people fail to realise their wishes. Asking is in and of itself an import ant and very precise step in this process. You need to be positive, unambiguous and precise about how you ask for your desire to be realised. The asking process can be purely in the Mind, however one of the most powerful methods of asking is to simply write down your request on paper. The physical action of writing down y our desire impresses your wish on your subconscious Mind that is di rectly in communication with The Source, as well as focussing your intentions, wishes and desires in a positive and unambiguous way. Always, but always without except ion write down your wish in the present tense. We have discussed and emphasised this previously and we must do so once again. You already have everything you could possible desire. All you ne ed to do is to ask The Universe, The Source, God to bring it into y our personal reality in order that you may physically experience it. "},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 522 If for example you used the words “I want”, then yo u will realise a perpetual state of “wanting”. Remem ber, ask and you shall receive. “Wanting” is a human concept, but nevertheless one which the Universe will gladly provide upon request. Never “want” something, otherwise you will find yourself perpetually wanting that thing and never actually receiving it. Your written request should be in the present tense and as short, precise and to the point as possible. There is no need to write an essay on why you must have this desir e, simply state it exactly as you wish for it to manifest into your own physical reality. The subconscious Mind, although sub lime and immensely powerful, being the majority of the totality of the Mind, is very child-like in the way it perceives instructions. The subconscious Mind will usually perceive direct instructions but not the rationale. If you endeavour to explain the reasons for your de sire the subconscious might well either disregard or confuse what you ar e impressing upon it, and the results will reflect that. The correct way to ask in the pres ent tense could be as follows: “I now have a new car. My new car is blue in colour, has five doors and a CD player”, I am really en joying my new car”. You may also add any other features you desire but keep the list to the point and above all totally unambiguous. Always remember to avoid restrict ing the Universe by including too many details, conditions or timesca les. The Univer se can and will provide you with anything at all, but the more you restrict the Universe by applying conditions, the longer this process will take. When writing down your wish include all of the main points but do not go to such fine detail that it will take a long time to manifest in exact accordance with your desi res. For example; “I am now enjoying my new home. It is a house with four large bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large well-equ ipped kitchen and a large integral double garage. My new home is easily paid for and fully insured. My new home is close to my business office and to my children’s"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 523 schools, and is perfect for myself and my family in every possible way”. Once you have written down your wish, place the sheet of paper in a drawer or other safe place. It is very important indeed having completed this step not to begin to long for the object of your wish to appear, or to wonder where it is, or in particular become frustr ated. These are negative thoughts and emotions that will have a correspondingly negative impact on the object of your desires. Y ou must know beyond any doubt whatsoever that your wish has al ready been granted in full, and that all you need to do now is to bring it into your physical reality. It is also most important to have complete and absolute faith in The Universe, The Source, God, to bri ng the object of your desire into your physical reality. Any lack of faith will have a very negative effect on attracting the object of your wishes into your physical experiential reality by sending ou t vibrations that say you do not believe the object of your desire will manifest into your reality, in which case it will be granted and will not manifest. You have now asked and it has al ready been given. All you need to do now is to allow your wish to appear within your personal, physical awareness and reality. Step 3: Experience your desire: Experiencing is an extr emely important step towards allowing and therefore receiving the object of your desire into your physical reality. In order to experience what you have asked for you must allow it to manifest into your physical reality by The Law of Attraction, and that means bringing your Energy vibration into harmony with the desires you have already asked for and have been given. This is a fundamentally important step, and one that many people fail to realise when they are subconsciously transmitting wishes, thus failing to attract and experience the object of their asking. "},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 524 Everyone constantly transmits desires whether they are aware of it or not. These desires are in the fo rm of vibrations sent out to the Universe. The reason that most people are not aware of this is because they simply are not in a vibrational harmony allowing them to receive the object of their desires. Allowing is to receive, and a very powerful method of receiving is to experience. Experiencing the object of your wishes will bring you into vibrational harmony with thos e wishes, thus enabling them to be attracted and manifest into your personal, physical reality. One very common statement that we often hear is “seeing is believing”. Well the fact is this st atement is exactly the wrong way around. According to the Law of A ttraction, “believing is seeing”; you must believe it before you can actually see it and not the other way around. If you believe something is so in your life, then so shall it be in accordance with The Law of Attraction. Another way of looking at this statement then is “ believing is experiencing”. If you can experience it then you can see it manifest into your reality. By experiencing we do not m ean physical experience because by this time you will no t have the physical object or situation manifest in your experiential physical realit y. The experience is therefore at this stage one of the imagination. Whenever you have the opportunity to remain undisturbed for a time and your Mind is clear of ot her thoughts, sit down comfortably, relax as deeply as possible by taking a few deep breaths, and imagine yourself to be in the presenc e of the object or situation of your desires. This process is parti cularly powerful just before sleep at night and just after awaking in the morning and before arising from bed. Use all five senses within your imagination to the maximum extent in order to experience your desires. Feel it, live it and be an integral part of it. For t he time you are involved with this exercise you must be totally at o ne with the object of your desires. This process can be lik ened to playing a movie fi lm in your head, in vivid Technicolor and surround-s ound, while experiencing every"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 525 aspect of the situation with all of your senses . This is one reason why we practiced creative visua lisation in the pr evious chapter, creative visualisation utilising al l the sense being a very powerful way of experiencing your desires and bringing your Energy into vibrational harmony with your desires. While playing this movie in your Mind feel all of the emotions involved as intensely as possible that are associated with physically experiencing your desires now. We will take a closer look at how we can experience and powerfully harmonize these desires in the next chapter of this book, a chapter that may be read first in the context of this stage of the manifestation process. The more you can feel, experienc e, and above all become excited by the object of your desires , the more powerful will be the attraction, and the more rapidly you will bring yourself into harmony with the object of your desires a llowing it to manifest into your experiential reality. Feel the de eply intense joy, excitement and fulfilment of experiencing this objec t of your desires, every bit as much as if it is already in your physical possession which it really is; all you need to do now is to attract and allow it into your physical reality by harmonising your Energy with that of your desires. The Law of Attraction must then bring the object of your desires into your physical reality; it is the Law. Again, the next chapter, Harmoni sing your Desires will provide a much fuller meditation process fo r bringing yourself into absolute harmony with your desires, and influencing the Energy within the inner Energy levels to bring y our desires into your physical experiential reality in accordanc e with the laws of Attraction and Correspondence. If you are having any problems with this very important receiving step of the manifestation proces s, please read the next chapter, Harmonising your desires before pr oceeding to the next step in this"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 526 process. Always expect total succe ss in manifesting your desires, and you will surely manifest your desires into your own physical reality. Always remember that desires, wishes and expectations are all in the present tense, and should never, ever be expressed or thought of as “wanting” which implies a perpetual state of lack and never receiving. Wishes, desires and expectations are always in the present tense, knowing, beyond any doubts whatsoever that the object of your desires already exis ts within the Eternal Now of The Universe and your inner reality, and t hat all that you have to do is to receive the object of your desires into your own personal reality. Step 4: Action towards your desires: Although the Universe, The Source, God will deliver into your physical reality anything that you desire, wish and ask for, it will empower the process considerably if your also take your own steps in the direction of your desires. This has many positive benefits including reinforcing on your subconscious Mind your total commitment to realising your desires in a totally unambiguous way. This is does not of cour se mean that you physically have to go out there and do everything y ourself. By taking positive steps in the direction of your desire you invo ke another very powerful Energy, the Energy of intent. The Energy of intent will work in conjunction with the knowing, asking and experi encing in a very powerful way by reinforcing your claim on the obj ect of your desire that already exists in the Eternal Now of the Universe. In addition to the Energy of int ent you must also firmly impress upon your subconscious Mind the fact that you are very serious indeed about materialising the obj ect of your desire into your physical experiential reality. Your subconscious Mind is extremely powerful and is in direct communication with The Source. If you therefore have your subconscious Mi nd as well as your conscious Mind influencing all of the necessa ry Energy in the direction of"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 527 bringing the object of your desire into your physical reality, it will be much more powerful and the object of your desire will manifest sooner as a result. If for example you are asking for one thing, and vibrating something completely different, or indeed ar e experiencing merely indifference to your desire rather than a passion for it, then this will influence the Energy involved at both a conscious and subconscious level, thereby acting as a negative influence on the m anifestation of your desire. Your ability to manifest anything, large or small into your physical reality, and the speed and effectiv eness of it doing so will be directly proportional to the net e ffect of the En ergy you have influenced in that direction. You r equire a net positive Energy in the direction of your desire in order for it to manifest into your physical reality. Negative Energy will effectively cancel out positive Energy, projected at both a conscious and subconscious level, and that is why you need to ensure that the Energy in the direction of your desire are as net positive as possible. Physical actions in the direction of your desire will increase the positive Energy in proportion to your degree of intent. So if for example you wish to manifest a new house, you should take positive actions to physicall y go out and look for one. You do not have to worry about whether you can afford it or not, that would be a negative emotion resulting in the negative influence of Energy, and in any case the realis ation of your house is not your concern, it is for the Universe, The Source, God to materialise the object of your desires, your wishes your request into your own reality. In the case of your new house, t he very act of physically going out and looking for the house of your desires will not only project the positive Energy of in tent, but will also very considerably and favourably influence other emotions such as excitement, all of which will add to the net positive effect on the positive Energy you are harmonising towards realising your desires. The same principle"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 528 applies to any material thing or si tuation; the more you physically take steps in the direction of your desire, the more emotion you can feel as a result, and the more you can integrate the object of your desire into your very Being, t he more powerful will be the effect, and the sooner you will be able to realise it within your physical reality. So whatever you do you must ta ke positive action towards your desires. The bigger and the more positive and frequent the action the better; but take some sort of action you must. Never take the Universe for granted and never wait until tomorrow, because the next day you will defer until tomorro w again, and you will never take that important first positive action in the direction of your desires. As soon as you know your desire, have asked for it, and are experiencing it, you must then take steps towards it and allow the Universe to manifest your desir e into your physical experiential reality in ways The Universe will take care of. Step 5: Gratitude for your desire: Gratitude is another extr emely important emot ional Energy that you really must project during the course of manifesting your desires. Now before we move onto why grat itude is so important we must understand that gr atitude is nothing whatsoev er to do with thanking a personified “God”, who, accordi ng to dogmatic religion enjoys being praised, flattered, worship ped etc. for His “work”. Those are merely religious doctrines that have absolutely little or nothing to do with reality, with The Source, The First Cause, with God. God does not respond to such notions that are purely and simply human constructs due to lack of underst anding of the true nature of the Divine. In the context of manifestation, gratitude is another extremely powerful emotion. The power of gratitude functions at several"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 529 levels. To feel sincerely grateful is to be in tune with the Universe. It conveys the Energy that you alr eady know and appreciate the fact that you are an integral aspect of The Source, The First Cause, God, and that you are grateful for being a conscious, infinite, immortal being and co-creator withi n the magnificent Universe in all of its Energy levels of splendo ur, glory and creation. You know beyond any doubt whatsoever that y ou are an integral, inseparable aspect of The Divine and that you live as an immortal Spiritual being who has been blessed with t he Divine ability to create your very own reality in the process of continuing your most sacred task of all, to evolve back to The First Cause, a journey continued with infinite Joy, Gratitude and Unconditional Love. Gratitude also conveys an acknow ledgement for having received the object of your desir e. Remember; you must always at all times think in terms of physically having t he object of your desire actually within your physical possession, for example, “I am most grateful for my wonderful new house”. Along with those thoughts should be the feeling of the most intense gratitude for what you have already received from The Universe. Grat itude makes the object of your desires a real, tangible, integral aspect of your own reality, and the more real it is to you the sooner it will manifest into your personal experiential reality. Gratitude conveyed with genuine sincerity brings you more into harmony with the Universe, and wit h it you become an even more natural creator of your desires. Those people who are completely aligned with the Universe, The S ource, God are natural creators who live what seems to others like a “charmed”, magical life, instantly manifesting anything at all into their own reality, the microcosm at will, just as God cr eates within the entire Universe, the Macrocosm. Such people ar e true Magicians, wizards and creators, and nothing is impossible to them. Never, ever take anything at al l for granted. Always feel deeply grateful for everything that happens in your reality, regardless of whether you consciously attracted it or whether you perceive it to"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 530 be positive or negative. In the grand scheme of things everything that manifests into your physical rea lity is directly fo r the benefit of your own personal evolution, and you should be most grateful for it whether you consciously brought it into your own reality or not. Being deeply grateful al so helps to ensure that you never convey the Energy of dissatisfaction, which is a very negative Energy, and therefore from a physical perspect ive a very destructive emotion. Dissatisfaction, ungratefulness or unhappiness will send the wrong Energy into the Universe, which will in turn react with immutable perfection in reciprocating those negat ive emotions with more of the same. So whatever you feel di ssatisfied, ungrateful or unhappy about will appear into your physica l reality even stronger than ever, creating a vortex of negativ e Energy as causes with correspondingly negative effects. Conversely, those things that you feel extremely sati sfied, grateful and happy about will create a much higher, positive vibration, attracting more of the same into your life. The Universe always naturally moves in the direction of expansion and evolution, and never of contraction or destruction, so positive emotions are always much more powerful than negative emotions even though they are both Energy causes with t he corresponding effects. When thinking in terms of gratefulness you are always thinking in terms of the best, most positive, most creative situations, and The Law of Attraction will ensure that only the same will manifest into your physical reality. So when consciously manifesting your desires, always be extremely grat eful the object of your desire already exists in your reality, and very soon you will become aware of it in your physical reality wh ere you can continue to enjoy, be grateful and be most happy with it. These then are the five powerful steps to attracting anything you could possibly desire into your life, where you can enjoy those desires into your own experiential phy sical reality. All of these five steps are individually very power ful indeed in their own right, but"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 531 collectively they influence Energy so powerfully that you can manifest almost anything you desire into your personal reality with what might seem like amazing s peed. You will soon come to know the truth that there is nothing that you cannot be, do or have. This process is an entirely aspect of t he Universe; God always intended us to be joyous creators in th e microcosm just as He/She is a joyous creator in the Macrocosm, and it is the destiny of mankind to understand these truths thereby r ealising the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. The entire Universe always moves in the direction of expansion, evolution and life, and as an extension of The Source Energy it is your destiny to live in harmony with The Universe, The Source, with God. So create joyfully in the kn owledge that you ar e fulfilling your role as a co-creator in the Univ erse. The Universe is infinitely abundant and enjoys infinite expansion and growth. Never therefore be ashamed, hesitant or unhappy about creation; create anything and everything you desi re with great Joy, Love and Gratitude in the certain knowledge that you are an immortal aspect of God, a Spirit ual Being, a co-creator within this magnificent Universe as you joyfully fulfil the ultimate reality of evolving back to The First Cause, The Source, back to God from when you first came as an immortal Spiritua l Being.  "},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 532 Chapter 90: Harmonising Your Desires In the previous chapter we looked at the process of manifestation, an aspect of which, as discussed in Step 3 of the process of manifestation is to bring yourself into experiential harmony with the vibrations of the object of your desires in order to attract and experience the object of your desi re within your personal reality. This matching of vibrations of Energy is not only a very important aspect of the manifestation pr ocess, but also as an ongoing process. The Law of Attraction is in const ant operation, not only during the time of manifestation exercises. Every thought is a cause with a corresponding effect on the Energy of the Univer se, and therefore all thoughts should always be only in the direction of your desires. Random thoughts will be trans ient and attract little, powerful, single pointed, focussed thoughts will have a correspondingly powerful influence on Energy and therefore of attraction. In a previous chapter of this book we practic ed single pointed concentration. Your entire Cons ciousness should always be one of awareness, focus and concentration in the direction for your desires. This is to live a magi cal life where you are a perpetual creator of your own reality. The more you can focus on and experience your desires on an ongoing basis, while knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever that everything you desire is already yours, all accompanied with hi gh levels of emotion, joy, enthusiasm, appreciation, passion and gratitude, then you will remain in harmony with Th e Source, and open channel of expression of God where infinite abundance is yours for the asking. Always know beyond any doubt that everything you desire is already in your experient ial reality, and so it wi ll be; it is Law. If any doubts or other negative emotion enters your conscious awareness, then immediately dispel t hat thought or transmute it into its opposite positive thought."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 533 The following meditation is very powerful in bringing you into harmony with your desires, especia lly if performed regularly. This process is so powerful in fact in and of itself, that it can be used for the process of manifestation in its own right, although again, the process is will be greatly enhanced by performing this meditation in conjunction with the five step process for manifestation, and in particular by remaining in this state of harmonisation continually. Harmonisation can therefore be c ontinued as a two-stage process. Firstly as a meditation as we will discuss next, while gradually integrating these actions into your ongoing life as a natural aspect of your existence as indeed should be your objective. A good state of relaxation is very important for this harmonisation process, ideally deep physical rela xation, but certainly in such a position that you will not drift off to sleep or be disturbed. As with the previous exercises the best posi tion is sitting totally upright on a hard chair with your spine completely erect, and never leaning against the backrest of the chair. This exercise can be performed at any time of the day in this position. Ideal times of the day are just after arising in the morning or just before sleep at night. At these times your brainwave frequencies are nearer the theta level of vibrati on, a state of Mind that is highly conducive to visu alisation and imagery as well as connection with your subcon scious Mind and Higher-Self. One particular benefit of performi ng manifestation exercises at night just before sleep is that you will carry the focus of the object of your imagination with you into the sleep state after the exercises are complete, and this will assist the process of influencing the inner Energy as well as your subconscious Mind. Again though, in order for this exercise to be fully effective you will need an adequate, preferably deep state of relaxation and to remain mentally focussed throughout the ex ercise without drifting off to sleep."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 534 Commence by closing your eyes. Next create an image in your Mind as vividly and realistically as possible of an item or situation you wish to manifest into your life. Please do not worry if your visualisation skills are not perfe ct from the outset. The creative visualisation exercises described ear lier in this section of the book will have assisted enormously. The more you practice creative vi sualisation, the clearer and more realistic your images will become. As with all inner objectives it is extremely important to imagine the object of your manifestation in the present tense; in other words knowing that it already exists within your experiential reality no w; there must be absolutely no doubts in your Mind what soever about this. If y ou are manifesting a new television set for example you should actually “see” your ideal new TV set already in position in your living room, with yourself and your family already happily seat ed around and watching it, while hearing the television, view ing the moving pictures and experiencing your reactions to what you are viewing. In addition, following on from the previous creative visualisation exercises, bring as many other sens es of your imagination into your scenario as is appropriate such as hearing, smell, touch and taste. Imagine for example as vividly and realistically as possible your family sitting around your new TV set watching your favourite program. See the images on the screen as clearly as possible and be totally engrossed with whatever you are watching on the screen. If you have a pet, visualise your pet sleeping on a rug in front of the TV. Imagine any ornaments located on top of the TV seeing them as clearly as possible within your Mind. The more detail you can add, the more effective it will be. This applies to whatever you are attracting into your reality such as a new house or car for example; all should be experienced as vividly and realistically in your mind as if they are already within your personal experiential reality. It is also very important indeed to place as much emotion behind your visualisation as possible. F eel and know as intensively as"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 535 possible that your manifestation is already a complete reality. Feel with as much emotion and intensit y as possible your feelings of great joy, passion, enthusiasm, appreciation, and of course gratitude. Add all of the emotions re levant to the objective of your manifestation. Emotion is a ve ry powerful force, and the more emotion you can inject into y our imagined scenario the more powerful the effects will become and sooner. Again, and this cannot be stressed en ough, it is most important to make this entire creative visualisat ion as real as possible in every possible sense, as if it has alr eady become a comple te reality that you are already enjoying immensely. There should be no doubts whatsoever in your Mind about this at any time. An extremely powerful way of c harging your visualizations with emotions is to bring into your Mind situations in the past that invoke these powerful emotions, and then to integrate those powerful emotions into your current visua lisation. All you need to do is to recall your absolute most joyous, passionate and enthusiastic situations within your life, which should be easy due to the emotions involved, experience t hose emotions to the maximum extent as if you were actually ex periencing the sit uation itself, and then to move those emotions into your imaginatio n where you are visualizing and experiencing t he objects of your desires. This level of emotion has a prof oundly positive influence on the vibration of the Energy that will attract your corresponding desires into your experiential reality. The more positively emotionally charged you are in the context of y our visualization, the higher and more focussed and concentrated will be Energy influence that will be instantly attracting the corres ponding Energy that will bring the object of your desires into your physical life. Another very powerful way of raisi ng your vibrations and therefore your powers of attraction is to invoke the senses of hearing and smell by recalling favourite mu sic that might have particularly joyous memories and also fragrances that invoke the same sort of"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 536 joyous feelings. Everyone has memo ries of joyful events associated with certain music or a fragrance such as a rose garden, type of food cooking, or just t he distinctive fragrance of a particular location associated with the very high vibration of joy. You can make use of these senses in two ways. If it is a particular piece of music you can have the same piece of music playing gently, but unobtrusively in the backg round, or you can recall the music in your Mind, taking a few minutes to enjoy it, recalling all associated memories and maintain ing the sense of joy and other positive emotions that it will invoked while raisin g your vibrations of attraction. Throughout history fragrances have been used to affect emotion, two of the most famous being Frankincense and Myrrh; both of which are still widely used today. M any ancient rituals performed by cultures throughout the world make use of various fragrances in order to invoke a much higher vibr ation and to stimulate the senses for the intended purpose. Again, these practices are still used widely today. Many people for exam ple will have no doubt heard of “aromatherapy” which again functions in accordance with the same principles. Raising your Energy vi brations has a pr ofound influence over every aspect of your Being in cluding the ability to heal as well as to manifest and generally positiv ely influence your chosen path. You can of course recall thes e fragrances in your Mind in accordance with the exercises of the previous chapter on this subject, but by far the most pow erful way of making use of a fragrance is to actually have t he fragrance in the area where you are relaxing for your harmonisati on exercises. It might for example be a certain plant, a candle with a certain fragrance or even a commercial air freshener that projec ts the fragrance. If it is another type of fragrance such as might be associated with cooking a certain food for example, it is possible to use a device known as a “censer” to burn a small quantity of that food, for example a favourite herb spice or seasoning upon the charcoal block of the censer. A censer can also be used with any sort of burnable"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 537 incense to produce the smell that will invoke the feelings of joy and in turn raising your vibrations co nsiderably. These will have a very powerful effect on raising your vibr ations for this very important harmonisation process. Of course safety is very import ant. If you are going to be using a censer, please make absolutely certai n that it is not placed where it will be a fire hazard. T he charcoal block of t he censer is extremely hot, and needs to be well away from anything that is remotely combustible. The power of emotion for raising your vibration simply cannot be over-emphasised. By recalling the very highest levels of joy, passion, enthusiasm as well as ot her very positive emotions such as love and appreciation, and integrating them within your manifestation experienc e, you will become a powerful conscious creator where you will seemingly attract anyth ing at will, particularly if you also integrate these em otions into your ongoing thoughts. It is also, as discussed previously, extremely important to feel deep gratitude for receiving the objects of your desires. F eel the gr atitude with total emotion and genuine sincerity, giving thanks to God, The Source, the Universe for bringing it to you. It is also very useful to add affirmations to your creative vi sualisation and other aspects of the imagination. For example repeat to yourself; “here I am, sitting in my house watching my wonderfu l new Television set”. Or “here I am, sitting in my new office i mmensely enjoying my new job”. Always phrase these affirmations in the present tense and be totally, completely and utterly convinced in every way of the absolute reality of the situation, there should never be any doubt in your Mind. Maintain in your Mind this comple te creative visualisation scenario together with all other senses and emotions for at least 10 minutes, 20 or 30 minutes being better. If however you feel tired, or unable to maintain the experience fully in your Mind, it is better to finish that session and commence again anot her day. After your creative"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 538 visualisation session is complete, relax, take a few slow breaths and continue with your usual activities. Whenever an opportunity arises you can focus on and experience the object of your creative visualisation exercises. This does not need to be a full creative visualis ation session, but by positively thinking about and imagining the objec t of your manifestation as often as possible, you influence E nergy and stimulate emotion, and the more Energy and emotion invo lved, the more it will influence the inner Energy, and accordingly t he sooner it will manifest into your own physical experi ential reality. Again, the more senses and emotion you apply to your tho ughts and imaginations the more effective it will be. As previously mentioned, you s hould move towards a state of experiencing the object of your desires during your normal conscious state until it is integrated into your very being. The object of your desires will then be attract ed into your experiential reality in a very powerful way. Never, ever have any doubts whats oever that the object of your manifestation is already an abso lute reality. When you are not specifically focussing on the object of your manifestation it is also very important not to crave for su ccess, wishing it to manifest into your life too soon. This will send out negative Ener gy that could well slow the process of attraction do wn as well as affirming that you have not yet taken delivery of the object of your desire, which in turn will ensure that it wil l be delayed to that extent. Always think in the present tense. Do not allow yourself to become stressed by any apparent lack of results so far. Always endeavour to maintain an air of complete calmness, relaxati on and knowing that the object of your desires is already a total r eality and that all you need to do is to become physically aware of it and to physically experience it. "},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 539 Always be patient, follow the exer cises completely as often as possible with dedication, and you will surely succeed. These processes will become an integral an d joyous part of your life within which you are a positive creator. Universal laws are immutable, perfect, and omnipresent, and as an immortal Spiritual Being you are an integral aspect of these Divine Laws. Dedication, commitment and perseverance are keys to success in the certain knowledge that as an immortal, individual aspect of The Source, The First Cause, God you too are also a co- creator within this magnificent, multi-dimensional Universe, and there is nothing that you cannot be, do or have. It sometimes might be that you deci de, as a result of experiencing your visualisations that you no lo nger desire the object or situation. This is fine; it is an important aspect of human growth and Spiritual progression whereby people begi n to attach less and less importance to mere temporal, materi al things in order to focus on the true path and individual evolut ion and destiny leading back to our Divine creator. Simply let the desire go and move confidently on to the next object of desire should you have one at the time. The Treasure Map: For those who might initiall y have problems with creative visualisation, creati ng a “treasure map” is a highly effective alternative while creative visualizat ion is being practiced, as well as fun to do. As we already know a very important aspect of the manifestation process is to ex perience your desires thereby bringing your personal vibrations in to harmony with the vibrations of the objects of your desires. All you need for this method is a large sheet of paper onto which you can draw, paint or paste images representing the object of your desires, always depicted in the present tense as if it is already a complete reality. If you are not an artist you can create a collage by cutting out the appropriate images for example from magazines,"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 540 and attaching them to your sheet of paper to form the required picture. Your treasure map does not need to be particularly accurate or detailed providing all of the nece ssary objects relevant to your wishes are included within your map. It is very important indeed to place a representati on of yourself in the treasure map, a photograph is ideal, preferably right in the very centre of your map. Somewhere in your treasure map write a statement , for example, “here I am watching my new TV set”. Your completed treasure map shoul d contain all of the elements necessary in order to represent t he object of your desire that you are manifesting into your reality, and most impor tantly should convey the image it is already a co mplete reality within your life. When your treasure map is ready, proceed with a full creative visualisation session as before, but this time instead of closing your eyes and visualising, focus with y our eyes open, and with as much concentration and emotion as possi ble on your treasure map. Do not allow your attention to be distracted, you should be fully focussed with your treasure map to the exclusion of everything else. As before, place as much emoti on as possible into your treasure map and apply as many senses as appropriate while imagining all of the details, the entire scenario being already a complete reality within your life. Become totally in volved with your picture, feeling the joy and other emotions of exper iencing it knowing that it is already yours. After focussing on your treasure m ap for a few minutes, close your eyes and recall your image, again with as much feeling and emotion as possible. Please do not worry if you cannot achieve this straightaway, simply open your ey es and re-focus on your treasure map once again. As before, this process is particularly effective first thing in the morning immediately upon waking, and last thing at"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 541 night just before sleep when your Mind is in a particularly receptive state, being more connected to the inner worlds through your subconscious Mind. You will soon find the more you c oncentrate on your treasure map the more you will be able to recall the image when you close your eyes. All the time you can be sure you are creating the image as a reality within the inner spheres of Energy and vibration from where it will be attracted and materialise into your life in accordance with Universal laws of Attraction and Correspondence; “as above, so below”. This is also an excellent exercise for practicing and gaining visualisation abilities, particularly if you encountered difficulties with the creative visualisation exercise s of the previous chapter. Whenever you have a free moment during the day when you will not be disturbed, relax as complete ly as you can, take out your treasure map and completely concent rate on it, again with as much positive emotion as possible, alwa ys in the present tense, and always with an absolute knowing bey ond any doubt that the objects of your desires already exist in y our physical reality. The more often you do this the more Energy will be influenced towards your desires as you bring yourself into harmony with the vibrations of the object of your desire; always keep in Mi nd the immutable Un iversal Law of Correspondence, “as above, so bel ow, as below, so above”, these being references to levels of E nergy and vibration from which causation and therefore attraction into the lower levels of vibration occurs. After any manifestation exercise, or indeed any time you are working with God, t he Universe, The Source to bring something into your life, always remember to thank God most sincerely and reverently, for the blessings receiv ed, and feel the in tense gratitude for these blessings deeply and with emotion. Remember you can use creative vis ualisation to manifest almost anything into your life. It does not need to be a ph ysical object or money, it can be health, happiness, situations such as holidays, job promotions, pay rises, losing we ight, feeling fitter, being more"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 542 creative, and need not only apply to yourself but indeed to anyone at all. And always keep in Mi nd that manifestation need not only be about physical, tangible, material things , but most importantly should also be applied to your Spiritual evolution. We are all here to evolve first and foremost, everything else being a means by which to evolve, so it is most important that you also use these exercises for your own personal evolution, methods of which will be discussed later in this book. It should also be remembered t hat although manifesting into someone else’s life rather than your own might seem like a good thing to do, you must always know beyond any doubts whatsoever that the person genuinel y needs whatever it is you are wishing to manifest for them, for exampl e healing. Should you manifest anything against the wishes of someone else, and if in particular their life is accordingly adversely affected, affect their own freewill otherwise affect the life of that person in any way that is not in accordance with their own wishes, freewill or chosen path, then you will become karmically responsible for your own actions in accordance with the Univ ersal Law of Cause and Effect, however well intentioned they might seem to be to you, and there will be a corresponding effect to be experienc ed by you in the future. It is highly advisable therefore to se ek and be granted the permission of anyone who you will be manifest ing for, healing or otherwise influencing. Manifestation by means of creativ e visualisation and your other senses of the imagination, an d by concentrated thought and emotion is a very real and extr emely powerful ability inherent in every single person without any exc eptions; the vast majority of people do not know or understand this truism as yet. Their time will most surely come sooner or later. With these abilities also comes re sponsibility. The Universe in all spheres is pure thought in the form of Energy, vibration."},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 543 Consequently the powers of the human Mind, being an aspect of the infinite supreme creative Mind of God are absolutely immense, unrestricted and also infinite. With this knowledge comes power, the God given ability to create and to assume full control over your own life and destiny, and also assisting others wherever it is appropriate to do so. Always use these God given and infinitely powerful abilities most wisely and your life will be one of flowing abundance, your progress along the sacred path will be much more certain and joyous, and you will continue to evolve with complete confidence in the certain knowledge you an immortal Spiritual being, an integral and inseparable aspect of the Divine, The Source, The First Cause, Spiritua lly “made” in the true image of God, with whom you are a co-cr eator in this glorious multi- dimensional Universe of Conscious ness, of Spirit, of God that we share as inseparable aspects of God.  "},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 544 Chapter 91: Let Go and Let God “Let go and let God” ; these are extremely important words that everyone should fully understand and heed at all times. It is the tendency of human beings generally to make demands, become impatient and frustrated and to force things whenever things do not seem to go their own way or in the perceived timescale. The Source, The Universe, God, simply cannot be rushed. Everything in t he entire Universe in al l spheres of life and reality happens in an immut able sequence of causation. However it is most important to k eep in Mind at the same time that everything that has ever happened, is happening now or ever will happen in the future relative to the temporal concept of Earth “time” already exists within the Eter nal Now beyond th e illusion or temporal space-time, it is only a matter of attracting something into personal awareness from the Eternal Now in order to experience it in a tangible form. This is a basis for Taoism as discussed in a previous chapter; “going with the Tao” is to progr ess with the flow of life, The Universe, with God. The Universe and everything within it of which we are all inseparable aspects always is evolving perfectly. All we have to do is to evolve with the flow of the Universe rather than, as many people still do today, resist the flow of life it if they do not believe that things are going their way. The reality is that no one kn ows, from our physical human perspective, what the “future” wi ll bring. The “future” is an erroneous human perception based upon temporal Earth “time”. In fact the “future” already exists within the Eternal Now as infinite quantum probabilities encompassing every possible outcome. One thing is for certain however; the c ourse of that perceived “future” will continue to unfold regardless of any resistance; all resistance to the immutable flow of The Source , the First Cause, of God can possibly bring is unhappiness, misery and discontentment."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 545 The Universe, The Source, God is absolute, total, complete perfection; there is absolutely not hing about God that can be added to, modified or subtracted for the better; absolutely nothing whatsoever. As expressions of God we are all destined for that same perfection. Should however you perceive anything, keeping in Mind that all things are expressions of the same perfection that is God, as less than perfec t, you will immediately subtract that same perfection from the Universe and therefore from yourself. Perception of perfection is always at the level at which your senses decode and observe yourself, your situation and your environment. Everything is truly perfect as a pe rfect expression of God, and it is for each and every one of us as an infinite Spiritual Being and inseparable aspect of God to expr ess that perfection as it flows from God through each and ev ery one of us without any exceptions. Thinking, acting and perceiving negat ively contracts and will result in the creation of that same in dividual reality at a physically experiential and inner level. Being a totally open, positive, unlimited channel of expression of God will result in the same unlimited expansion, joy and creation, which again will be reflected within your individual reality. Always, always, always be a joyful, open, positive expression of The Source , The First Cause, of God, and you will be infinitely blessed by everything you desire flowing to towards you and manifesting into y our experiential r eality. Always know, in the very core of your being that you are an aspect of the Divine, of our Creator, of God, and that God love’s you and no harm can ever come to you. G od only ever wants what is best for us at all times while we are still free to exercise our own freewill. It is however the using of freewill in negative ways, against the immutable flow of the Universe that results in misery, discontent and unhappiness. Always have total faith in God, and God will never, ever let you down, an absol ute faith that should endure regardless of how difficult a life situation might seem at the time."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 546 Have total and complete faith in God, always trust God with gratitude and joy, and yo u will always be completely safe, happy and secure. “Let go and let God” is extremel y important in the process of manifesting your desires. Ha ving followed the process of manifestation, never, ever, ever cr ave for results, wonder where the object of your manifestation is, or why it seems not to be yet appearing in your physica l reality. Rather be totally calm, happy and above all most grateful that your wishes have been heard, have already been granted and are even now in the process of manifesting into your physically oriented reality where soon you can experience and enjoy them. Force is a very negative Energy of contraction and will always result in having the opposite effect to that intended. Never, ever force anything in the direction y ou wish it to go in accordance with your perceptions, because to do so will have a negative and therefore counterproductive, contra ctive effect that will be exactly the opposite to that which you in tended. Always let go and let God manifest your desires in a ccordance with your wishes in accordance with the immutable flow of the Universe; the more in harmony you are with the flow of the Universe the faster your wishes will manifest into your own reality as a free flowing expression of God. The importance of this simply ca nnot be underestimated; the more you are in complete harmony with the flow of the Universe and therefore at one with G od, the more rapidly your desires will manifest, because your Energy, your vibrations are more aligned with the flow of the Universe and therefore that which you are manifesting into your life. Faith in “let go and let God” shoul d not be sporadic, insincere or weak; it should always be integrated into your very being, just as God is an integral aspect of your very being. The flow of the Universe is immutable, constant and never wavers even for a"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 547 moment. If it did waver then the Universe would collapse in an instant and would not be sustainable. That same immutable flow of the Universe is within each and ev ery person as an expression of God, and accordingly it is for ea ch and every one of us to align ourselves completely with that flow. Believe in the The Source, The First Cause, God and of your own creative powers as an infinite as pect of God and the “God powers” that flow though you, and you will surely enjo y perpetual total joy, harmony and peace in your life at all times, with the ability to easily, effortlessly and completely manifest anything you desire into your experiential physical reality. Relax. Know that you are an infinite and im mortal son or daughter of God, that the entire Universe including your individual reality as an immortal Spiritual bei ng is unfolding perfect ly, and that there is absolutely nothing that you cannot be, do or have. Simply let go and let God and you will experienc e infinite joy, abundance and progress on the path back to God, thereby being completely aligned with the true meani ng of life; our ultimate reality.  "},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 548 Chapter 92: The Joy and Power of Giving The Universe provides for all of your wishes, desir es and needs in accordance with immutable Univer sal Laws always; there are no exceptions to this truth. This fact should never, ever be taken for granted however. We are all an in tegral aspect of The All, The Source, God, and with receiving must also be giving. It is in giving that we may also receive. Giving must never seem like an obl igation or carried out with reluctance or due to any sort of pressure or coercion by others. Giving should always be from a position of Unconditional Love, Gratitude and the strong desire to put wealth back into the Universe that provides you with wealth. In giving you place back into the Universe some of the wealth you received from it, and which wealth will in turn go towards helping others to enjoy the same wealth that we all ultimately share as equal and inseparable aspects of God. The vibration of giving, freel y, unconditionally and out of Unconditional Love is a very high vi bration, a very high influence of Energy vibration that will positively impact not only those who were receiving whatever you are givi ng, but will also influence the Universe as a whole. So the very aspect of giving in this way will raise your own Energy, your ow n vibration, and accordingly everything will be positively affected in your own individual reality with profound beneficial effects including the ability to receive more readily. Giving and receiving are tw o aspects of exactly the same thing in accordance with the Univer sal law of polar ity. The amount of joy with which you give will be re flected in your joy in receiving. It is in giving that you will also receive in accordance with the immutable law of Cause and Effect. Frequently you may receive orders of magnitude more than y ou gave, but this should never, ever be a motivation for giving which should be always out of Unconditional Love, joy, and a desire to give back to the Universe of which you are an integral aspec t some of the wealth that has been provided to you from the infini te source of abundance of God."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 549 Always remember that the Univ erse, The Source, God always, without exception gives to you with Unconditional Love, and it is in that same Spirit of Unconditional Love that you should also give back to the Universe, The Source, G od. As an integral, inseparable, expression of God, whatever you give to the Universe you equally give to yourself and the Universe , and which will be reflected in your ability to receive. The more you selflessly, joyous ly and unconditionally give, the more you will receive, but again, this should never be a motivational factor, a contrived way of boosting your cash flow or for any other selfish purpose. Giving and receivin g are all aspects of the whole, and whatever you receive in return, and in whatever order of magnitude over that which you gave, you should receive with extreme, sincere gratitude. In addition to giving whenever the oppor tunity arises, it is also an excellent idea to put aside for example ten percent of your net income each month purely for t he purposes of giving. It doesn’t matter how much you earn, put asi de at least ten percent each and every month to give in joy, Un conditional Love and gratitude to those who in your judgement are in need. There is no set “percentage” fo r giving. The Universe does not recognize the human concept of num bers. Giving is a cause that will always have its corresponding effect regardless of the “numbers” involved. Giving, like everything else is a vibration of Energy which will result in its corresponding effect. You might have heard of the word “tithing” for exam ple that implies that you should give ten percent of your income . But again this is purely a human construct that in reality has no meaning whatsoev er. God would never decree how much a person should give, how frequently and under what circumstances and rewa rds accordingly, The Universe quite simply does not operate in t hat way. The Universe operates according to immutable Universal laws, an aspect of which that every cause without exception, incl uding giving, will result in its"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 550 corresponding effect, and always in the direction of expansion, growth and evolution. Always also receive with complete gratitude. When you receive anything at all, always be most gr ateful and give sincere thanks to the Universe for what you have received. It doesn’t matter how much you have, or whether you think you can afford it or not, give freely, jo yously and with gratitude, and your reality and wealth will be enhanced considerably. Giving is a vibration, and it is the very act of giving that will influence the Energy that will also result in receiving. Giving and receiving are both aspects of the same Energy, and are not in any way bound by or restricted by numbers or any other human concept. Always give joyously and you will receive joyously.  "},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 551 Chapter 93: The Joy and Power of Healing When most people think of illne ss and medical treatment they usually think exclusively in terms of the physical body, doctors, medicines, clinics and ot her medical facilities. This of course is quite understandable as most illnesses appear to the physical senses to affect the physical body or mental stat e, and therefore afflictions appear to orig inate in those particula r areas. While this might well be quite true in the case of some physical injuries such as breaking limbs, cuts and other accidents, what medicine has not yet fully come to terms with is th at even the most serious illnesses such as cancer very often do not have a physical, in other words a physiological or psychological origin at all, but ar e rather due to imbalances and other problems aris ing within the Etheric Body, also known as the Energy Body which includes the aura and the main Energy centres of the Energy Body, the chakras. Due to the holistic nature of t he Universe and therefore of the human body, all of which are ins eparable aspects of each other, any problems arising at an inner E nergy level, for example within the Energy Body, will always be correspondingly reflected at a lower level in accordance with the Universal principle of correspondence. The axiom “as above, so below” is again very true, but can be more accurately said “as within, so without”, with ailments originating in the inner bodies manifesting in turn within the physical body “without” in acco rdance with immutable Universal laws. As infinite, multidimensional Beings we actually have an infinite number of bodies rangin g from the very highest aspect of God to the physical body of ma tter in which most people are focussed. Diseases as a cause can occur in any of the inner bodies causing an imbalance that has to manifest in the physical body as a the effect in accordance with immutable Universal laws. Therefore by identifyi ng the origin of thes e problems within the inner bodies, most frequently the Ener gy Body which is closest to the physical body, and treating the cause appropriately, it is very often possible to completely cure even the most serious illnesses"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 552 where traditional medi cine, seeking to treat only the physical or psychological symptoms would inevitably fail. Cures that have seemed to most people, including the medical profession as miraculous, are frequently achieved by holistic healing. It should be mentioned straightaway however that everyone should see their doctor immediately with any medical problem whatsoever, even if the eventual cure will be brought about by inner means. There are various methods of treat ing the Energy Body, many of which you might already be alr eady familiar under the general description of “alternative medici ne or healing”. This description is however somewhat misleading as it could be much more appropriately described as “prima ry healing”. Well-known examples of energetic or holistic hea ling can include for example acupuncture, Pranic Healing and Reiki. There are also healin g methods broadly based on the practice of homeopathy where the objective is to bringing the body balance, thereby bringing about a cure of the ailment. Homeopathy is not generally considered to be a pr actice having an effect on the Energy Body, although in some cases, with certain treatments the Energy Body might well be influ enced favourably. An example of this is healing by means of vari ous herbs and plant extracts, the application of which can have a di rect affect on the balance of Energy Body, thereby bringing a cure. Herbal based healing is a separate and extensive discipline in its own right, and often a very effective one. Herbs, like all plants and indeed everything in the Universe have a unique vibration of Energy that will affect ot her Energy, in this case the Energy of the human Energy Body, and can facilitate a cure accordingly. In many cases howev er the herb or other substance become a point of focus and belief that a cure will result, and it is the very focus on this within the Mind of the patient that will cause the expected cure to occur in accordance with The Law of"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 553 Attraction. This is broadly how the medical “placebo” works. Although the placebo has no medi cine associated with it, the very act of belief and focus on the cure by the patient that they have been cured will then manifest that cu re by The Law of Attraction, the patient having consciously or subconsciously influenced the Energy corresponding with the part of the body that was afflicted in the direction of, and with the result of a cure for the ailment. Another method of healing involv es the use of naturally occurring crystals such as quartz, which again can have a direct effect on the Energy of the Energy B ody due to the natural Energy vibrations of these substances. Different crysta ls exhibit different types and levels of vibration, all of which can influ ence the Energy Body including the charkas in a positive and specific way. It is well-known for example that Quartz exhibits “piezo electric” properties, and is accordingly used in watches, clocks and other precision instruments for maintaining accuracy of time. Again however, healing might be more a function of the Mind of the patient and of their healing focus than due to the action of the actual crystals. Healing by the use of herbs, cryst als and other naturally occurring substances can certainly be extremely effective in the hands of practitioners with the appropriate levels of knowledge and experience. These can be learned and practiced by anyone with dedication. Learning about the healing properti es and methods of herbs, crystals and other substances is extremely worthwhile and rewarding. In addition, there are less well-known methods of healing involving the use of the Magnetic Fluid of the Ether by a practitioner known as a “magnetopath”. Many methods of healing require the services of an experienced practitioner, an example of which might well be difficult to locate in your area. Additionally, as with psychic services, it is often very difficult to determine whether a practitioner has genuine experience and abilities in hea ling or is nothing more than a charlatan whose only objective is to take your money. There are many extremely talented and experienced healers who will willingly provide their"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 554 services for free in appropriate, or sometimes all cases, as a service to humanity. Everyone has the ability to heal almost any il lness, even the most serious of illnesses, many of wh ich are often considered to be terminal by doctors. Before we commence with the practice of healing we should most ce rtainly take a look at two highly effective and increasingly popular methods of healing the Energy Body by the use of Energy, often referred to by practitioners of this type of healing as “Vital Energy”; these methods are known as “Pranic Healing” and “Reiki”. It is well worth knowing about and understanding Pranic Healing and Reik i as skills you might wish to learn for your own benefit and t hose of others should you wish to make healing an important part of your life.  "},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 555 Chapter 94: Pranic Healing The recognised founder of the prac tice of Pranic He aling is Choa Kok Sui. Pranic Healing is a process involvi ng the bringing about of the cure of physically or menta lly manifesting ailments by the treatment of the Energy Body with Universal Energy, also known in the context of this method of healing as “Prana”, a Sankrit word meaning “life-force”. Pranic Healing is a simple yet very powerful no-touch method of energetic healing based upon the fundamental pr inciple that the physical healing process is brought about and accelerated by increasing and balancing the Energy of the Energy Body, and in particular in the areas associat ed with the affected area of the physical body. There are several fundamental pr inciples and stages associated with the practice of Pranic Healing. Treatment usually commences by a process of cleansing involvi ng the removal of diseased Energy from the Energy centres associ ated with the affected part of the physical body, and then energizing them with sufficient Energy to bring about the healing process. It is most im portant to perform the cleansing process before the healing process is commenced, otherwise the diseased areas of t he Energy and physica l bodies will have negative Energy to overcome first, thus slowing or worse completely preventing the effect iveness of the ene rgetic healing processes. It is also very important for t he Pranic healer to avoid becoming drained of Energy or being contaminated with the diseased Energy from the patient. An advanced Pranic healer will avoid this situation by channelling Energy directly fr om his or her surroundings from the infinite supply of the Universe directly into the Energy Body of the patient. By ensuring a constant flow of Energy in this way the healer avoids becoming drained of his or her own Energy which would necessitate a recharging period should this occur."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 556 Decontamination is also a very im portant aspect of Pranic Healing. Healers can become ill themselves by the absorption of diseased Energy from the patient, not only on a physical body level but also at the level of the inner bodies . Decontamination involves the energetic purification of the heal ing space, not only for the safeguard of the healer but al so for future patients. Effective Pranic Healin g includes direct treatment of the main chakras, which as we already know are the seven main Energy centres located at various points within the Energy Body. Different ailments are usually a ssociated with one or more chakras, and by directly treating the chakras invo lved with Energy in conjunction with treating the Energy Body as a whole, treatment is correspondingly more rapid and e ffective. More advanced methods of Pranic Healing make use of E nergy of the appropriate colour, relating to the type of ailment and the area of the Energy Body or chakra involved. This colour healing process is performed by the use of creative visualisation in conjunction with th e projection of Energy by the Pranic healer. An example of the use of colour in Pranic Healing is the use of red Energy for sufferers of Asth ma, which has the corresponding physical effect of dilating the bronchial tubes of the sufferer, thereby relieving the breathing process. Mo re severe ailments such as AIDS and cancer for example, ar e often responsive to the more powerful colour frequencies such as violet. In addition to physiological proble ms Pranic Healing can also be used very effectively to treat psychological problems. Negative emotions as well as originating u pon the Mental Plane or as a result of psychic attack or other inner origin such as larvae can also originate in the form of negative thoughts and emotions that have become attached to the Energy Body and specific chakras of the patient. Conventional psychotherapy can often take many months or even years to release these negative Energy by conventional means, if indeed they ever fully succeed, and even then they are usually unaware of exactly what it is they are treating and of its true"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 557 origin. Psychotherapists are therefore usually treating the physically manifesting symptoms of the problem, as if it orig inated within the physical brain, rather than the true, inner origins of the condition. However, by using advanced Pranic Healing techniques involving the isolation and removal of the negative Energy attached to the Energy Body and the affect ed chakras, traumas, phobias, obsessions, compulsions, addictions and most other psychological problems can be treated and cured mu ch more efficiently at source, and in a fraction of the time required by conventional psychotherapy. More importantly for the patient, there is no requirement whatsoever to disclose any sort of personal information, such information being completely irrelevant to the healing of the problem. Very often, even after t he first Pranic Healing session for healing a psychological affliction, the patient feels a sense of great peace and serenity, as if a large weight has been lifted from their shoulders. Pranic Healing is very powerfu l indeed. Much more than an alternative to conventional medici ne, Pranic Healing can very often bring about complete and permanent cures of even very advanced and very serious physical and psychol ogical ailments, most which would have been impossible to cu re by conventional medicine. There are an increasing number of Pranic Healin g practitioners around the world. The usual caut ions apply when seeking the services of a Pranic healer; always ensure that the practitioner is genuine by thoroughly checking t heir experience and credentials, and most importantly always obtain testimonials and references. "},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 558 Chapter 95: Reiki Healing Like Pranic Healing, Reiki is the practice of healing by means of Universal Energy. Reiki is not usually taught in the usual sense. The ability to practice Reiki is ra ther “transferred” from a “Reiki Master” to the student by a proc ess known as “attunement” after the necessary preparations and knowledge have been attained. Reiki is considered to be a Spiritually guided form of healing, with “Rei” the Universal Consciousness , or “God Consciousness”, Mind, guiding the “Ki”, the Universal Energy of which we are all an integral aspect. People treated by Reiki afterw ards often describe a glowing radiance surrounding and within thei r entire body, an effect of the healing not only the physical body but also of the inner, subtle, Energy or Etheric, Astral and Ment al bodies. In addition to healing, the extent and speed of which are often considered to be miraculous, recipients of Reiki trea tment often describe feelings of peace, security and well-being. During the process of a Reiki h ealing Energy flows through and around the affected part of the Energy Body and aura charging them with positive Energy. This raises the vibrational level of the entire Energy field of the Energy Body in and around the physical body where negative thoughts and feel ings are attached, thereby causing negative Energy, a source of physical illness, to break and fall away. In this way Reiki clear s, straightens and heals Energy pathways within and around the Energy Body, thus allowing Energy to flow in a healthy and natural way. Reiki can be directed at any prob lem area within the Energy Body, thus holistically bri nging about the cure in the corresponding aspect of the physical body. Much more c ould be said about Reiki. There is however already a considerable amount of information available on the Internet and also within b ooks for those wishing to pursue this highly worthwhile healing ability further."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 559 Again, before seeking Re iki healing, or indeed any sort of healing, always obtain as many details from the healer as possible including experience, successful cases and testimonials. Never take testimonials at face value, alwa ys follow them up directly with the people that provided them in order to be certain they are genuine.   "},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 560 Chapter 96: Healing Yourself and Others Just as we have the ability to cr eate our own reality by attracting and manifesting our needs and desires into our physical world, we equally have the ability to manife st healing. As we already know, the vast majority of diseases, even the most serious illnesses including those very often consi dered to be incurable, originate within the inner, subtle bodies. The basis of all holistic healing is that none of our subtle bodies, physi cal, Etheric, Astral or Mental, can, like the Universe itself be separated from the “whole”, and therefore by influenci ng the inner bodies in the required way, the outer bodies will be infl uenced in exactly the same way and to the same degree in accordance with the Universal principle of correspondence, “as above, so below”. Holistic healing can also be likened to the quantum physics metaphor of a hologram, where any as pect of the hologram, in this case the human bodies, physical, Etheric, Astral and Mental contain the whole, the whole bei ng inseparable fr om its notional parts. With the use of creative vis ualisation we can therefore attract Energy into the inner b odies for complete health or for the cure of a specific ailment, and which Energy mu st in turn manifest into the physical body where full health is re stored. It is not only possible to heal ourselves in this way but indeed to also heal anyone at all irrespective of distance, provid ing the person can be visualized and there is sufficient knowledge of the ailment. Healing by means of creat ive visualisation, or more specifically by the imagination can be very powerfu l and highly effective; there are no absolute limits as to the level or completeness of healing by utilising these methods. There hav e for example been cases of inoperable brain tumours completely disappearing, resulting in a full and seemingly “miraculous” recovery. There are numerous cases of other, supposedly malignant and incurable cancers being fully cured where traditional medicine has not been successful and had all but given up on the patient. There are cases for example where"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 561 people have dissolved their own gallstones by means of the creative visualisation. There are exceptions of course to the scope of holistic healing, for example in the case of severe ph ysical injury inflicted by physical means such as by a car accident. Clearly these injuries did not originate directly from within th e inner bodies although they will in turn be reflected in the inner bodies, the principle of correspondence “as above, so below” being equally applicable in all directions, “as below, so above”. Even in these ca ses therefore, creative visualisation can be used to speed the healing process, and to often heal at least some aspects of the physical injuries considered beyond the scope of tr aditional medicine. Healing by creative visualisation can also a ssist greatly in easing pain and suffering, and to bring a greater sense of peace to the patient. There are notable exceptions however. Sometimes before incarnating into the physical world a person will choose a life where they know they will sooner or later contract and eventually pass on from a terminal disease such as cancer. This might seem somewhat strange or even extr eme, and indeed many people would be inclined to immediately re ject such a situation, however there is a very real purpose involv ed in these cases. As we know, everyone is subject to the law of karma; for every negative thought or action there has to be a price to pay sooner or later, and in the same degree. Often when a person has been responsible for a particularly bad or negative deed or deeds during or between lives, an effective way of balancing karma is to contract, suffer and eventually physically expire from cancer or other serious terminal illness during a particular chosen life time. Having paid that karmic debt, it is highly unlikely the per son will have the need to contract cancer or other serious or termi nal illness again in a future life. Other people might not have a karma to balance in this way, but simply choose to suffer from an incurable illness on Earth as an aspect of their personal evolution. Living with such diseases is often an excellent test of many per sonal attributes, and accordingly much of value can be learned."},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 562 Choosing to suffer and eventually pass on from such an apparently serious disease might to Eart h bound humans seem like a very strange choice. It must be remember ed however that while living in the Astral and Spiritual worlds t he Soul and Spirit have a much greater perspective of realit y, knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever that we are all immo rtal, Spiritual beings who quite simply cannot “die”. Such a choi ce of suffering is therefore very much in the context of ongoing indi vidual Spiritual evolution, and in terms of infinity such a life spent in the training ground of the Earth life system out of possi bly hundreds of such temporal lives over many thousands of years, and in par ticular in the context of the progression ahead through the inner spheres of life and reality, the most recent life really is nothi ng more than a temporal moment. It should be stressed however that this by no means applies to all cases of such serious ailments, m any of which are also caused as a direct result of imbalances in the Energy Body, which in those cases are not the will of the patient. These are the cases that can be completely healed by creative visualisation and other inner healing methods, the ailm ent not having a greater purpose relating to the personal evolution of the afflicted person. Another class of patient who mi ght not be healed are those who quite simply do not wish to be hea led. It is not possible to heal someone against their own freewill. Su ch people often believe their mission on Earth is complete, and all they wish to do is to complete their current physical life and pass on to the Astral worlds for rest and reflection in preparation for the next stage of their own individual journey back to The Source, the First Cause, God. Another potentially diffi cult case when a person does not wish to be healed is when they feel they need, often under the guidance of their Higher-Self, to experience su ffering in order to progress or balance karma. Religious people might well believe in these situations that they are being “puni shed by God” or another deity, and they feel compelled in these si tuations to comply with the “will of God”. These cases are by no means the norm however and in"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 563 the majority of cases healing can be, and very often are directed towards others with considerable success. As we will see with the followin g healing method, as with manifestation it is extremely impo rtant to visualise in the present tense, knowing beyond any doubts whatsoever the ailment is already completely healed. In fact the correct way of visualising for healing purposes is not to think in terms of the ailment at all, but rather only in terms in the present tense of the complete, radiant health of the person being healed. This attracts the necessary Energy within the inner bodies, and in particular in the areas that are the target of healing, whic h Energy must then in turn be reflected and manifest into the Etheric and physical bodies as healing. An interesting situatio n demonstrating how this works in principle is by the use in investigative medici ne of a “placebo”. A placebo is an inactive substance, for example water, given to a patient who believes it to be real medicine. In numerous cases the patient is cured simply by taking the placebo alone and with no genuine supporting medication whatsoever. This works because the patient sincerely believes, beyond any doubt in the Mind of the patient that the placebo is in fact real medicine that will cure them. In this case the patient has subconsciously used their own im agination upon themselves, but the result is exactly the same, often to the considerable surprise of doctors and all others concerned; a complete cure. The patient visualised t hemselves as being cured as a direct result of taking what they believe to be an effective medicine, in turn influencing the Energy of the inner bodies, thereby manifesting as an observable cure within the physical body. This process works both ways of course and there are people who unwittingly become ill due to the subconscious use of creative visualisation and of the imag ination genera lly and thought processes generally. This occurs when a normally healthy person"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 564 strongly believes they are, or should become ill for some reason, perhaps out of guilt, or for example as happens in the case of someone considered to be a hypoc hondriac. This belief coupled with the person subconsciously and ve ry often intensively imagining and believing themselves to be ill, will in turn attract that illness in accordance with The Law of A ttraction, resulting in the manifestation of the same illness t hat they already sincerely believe they are suffering from. This in fact is the healing process in reverse, but the principles are exactly the same nevertheless. T he Universe will always, without any exceptions provide whatever is “asked for” whether it is positive or negative in relation to the perc eption of the person experiencing the situation. Univer sal Energy does not “decide” whether any particular thought is “good” or “bad” for a person, the Universe simply delivers in precise accordance with the thought held within the Mind. The person is in fact subconsciously attracting Energy of illness in their inner bodies, thus creating an energetic disturbance that subsequently has to manifest in the outer bodies and eventually the physical body in the form of a ph ysically observabl e illness. An excellent example of th is situation is where a person comes into contact with another pers on who is in turn suffering from a serious communicable disease. The pers on then subconsciously creates within their own imagination a very strong belief that by being in the presence of the person with the dis ease they will inevitably contract the same disease themselves. This belief in the form of a strongly held thought within the Mind of t he person becomes progressively stronger and more focussed, subconsciously imagining themselves as actually suffering from the sa me disease. This disease must then manifest into their own individual reality in accordance with the Universal Laws of Attraction an d Correspondence, “as above, so below”, with the “above” in this case being the inner, subtle bodies. Millions of people actually unknowingl y do this every year on a less serious level with very common ailments such as colds and"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 565 influenza. A family member or friend contracts the cold or ‘flu’, and subsequently those around the infe cted person immediately create the belief in their own Minds they must in turn contracted the disease due to their proximity with the afflicted person. They subconsciously start to visualis e themselves feeling unwell, coughing and sneezing, have a fever and other typical symptoms before finally visiting the doctor. This belief process reinforced by the imagination and thoughts held within the Mind ensures they will indeed manifest the disease into their physical existence just as they had imagined and fully believed, and in fa ct requested whether they know it or not as mentioned previously, the Universe does not differentiate or apply any sort of test to a request in the form of a thought in the Mind, it simply deliv ers in accordance with Universal laws and the freewill granted by G od. “Ask and you shall receive” equally applies to everything in the Universe whether it is perceptually “good” or “bad” for the person who attracted it into their reality. This can also happen when a person actually wishes or asks to contract a disease in order for example to take time off their employment. The wish and desire held within the Mind, reinforced by imagination and intent of beco ming ill in order to facilitate remaining at home will usually be sufficient to ensure the disease is contracted, and the desired time off work manifested as a complete reality. Of course to the pers on concerned it was probably just “wishful thinking”, but to the Univ erse all thoughts influence Energy in the direction of the desired effe ct, whether the t hought was within the Mind at a conscious or subconscious level. Had the person in a ll of these cases consciously visualised themselves to be in full health, in the certain belief they cannot possibly become ill by being in the presence of an infected person, then they will indeed re main healthy. The power of the imagination and thoughts held within the Mi nd has a profound effect on all bodies, physical and inner and in all directions from inner to outer and outer to inner, again in full accordance with the laws of Correspondence, “as above, so below, as below, so above and"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 566 Attraction. Often people say of illne sses, “it is all in the Mind”, and more often than not this is comp letely true whether they really believe this statement or not. There is another very import ant aspect of spontaneously contracting an ailment that must not be overlooked. Very often such an ailment can be a “message” from the Higher-Self indicating another problem originat ing in one of the inner bodies. Sometimes the meaning of this message might be very obvious; for example a heavy smoker might suddenly dev elop chronic bronchitis or pneumonia. In this case the mess age is very clear; continue smoking and the smokers health will de teriorate, possibly leading to physical death. A heavy drinker might develop liver problems; again the message is very clear; stop drinking alcohol or accept the consequences. These are all cases of “wakeup ca lls” from the Higher-Self to the physical self. Very often however messages from the Higher-Self are much more subtle. Keep in Mind that every spontaneously manifesting ailment has an underlyi ng cause for which the ailment is the corresponding effect, whether it is due to an imbalance in the Energy Body or by way of a message from the Higher-Self. Please also keep in Mind the immu table Universal law of Cause and Effect; nothing ever happens by c hance. At times like these the ability of meditation is extremely useful. In deep meditation questions can be asked and answers received regarding the origins and reasons for an ailment. With t he benefit of th is knowledge the appropriate actions can be taken in order to remedy those aspects of life to which the warning rela tes. This does not mean however the ailment cannot be cu red by creative visua lisation, because it most certainly can be. The inner bodies, and therefore the physical body must always respond to your will and the thoughts you hold in your Mind. It is always wise however to be fully aware of the thoughts being held in your Mind at all times, ensuring that you focus on only those thoughts that ar e consistent with the reality you wish to attract, including of course perfect health at all levels."},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 567 Nevertheless, messages from t he Higher-Self are conveyed for a reason and it is most advisable to discover the meaning behind such reason and to take the appropriate action accordingly. It is advisable however whenever an illness occurs spontaneously, even while curing the illness by means of creative visualisation, give some thought as to the possibl e meaning of the illness. Should you receive an answer during meditation, or in the form of inspiration or perhaps in a dream, then you should take heed and act upon it immediately; the Highe r-Self is sublime, and only has your best interests of progression at heart. Your Higher-Self has complete know ledge of your ent ire existence, past, present and future as relates to temporal Earth time, and at all levels of the continuum of the Un iverse, physical, Etheric, Astral and Mental. Always remember however that you should never, ever feel guilty or blame yourself in any way for any illness or ailment however serious, and likewise never blame others. Most illnesses are simply due to imbalances in t he Energy Body of the sort that can happen to quite literally anyone from time to time. Those apparent ailments originati ng in the form of warnings from the Higher-Self are neve r intended to be a p unishment in any way whatsoever, but rather a gentle nudge in the right direction. Should the message from the Higher-Sel f remain unheeded however the nudges will become progressively firmer and more pronounced, eventually, if remainin g unheeded resulting in a larger push in the right direction. The most important thing to remember is that the vast majority of illnesses, with the exc eption of those cases pre-determined before incarnation, will respond to healing by means of creative visualisation resulting in a comple te recovery. When healing others it is always highly advisable to obtain their permission first unless they are in no physical or mental position to grant such permission. Should they refuse your request or not respond to your healing, then the right of freewi ll of the patient not to be healed must always be totally respected at all times as a sacred right. Even if you"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 568 believe you are doing the right th ing by healing other s, if it is against there will at any level then you will be effectively acting against the will of another person, although your positive, loving motives will always be accounted for.   "},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 569 Chapter 97: The Principles of Healing The process of healing is almo st exactly the same as for manifestation, and ther efore includes two valuable abilities already discussed earlier; those of deep ph ysical relaxation and the powers of imagination. An e ffective healing session. After achieving a state of deep ph ysical relaxation in your usual location and position, in a location where you will not be disturbed, sitting upright with your back and therefore your spine totally straight, concentrate with comple te focus on the area of your ailment. Now imagine, with as mu ch concentration, will and total knowing beyond any possible doubt that this area of your Being is completely whole and resonating with the most vibrant health imaginable. Use all of your senses with t he power of your imagination to visualize, feel and enjoy this total, complete and absolute health. Visualize your entire b ody, and in particular the area of your ailment to be glowing, resonating and radi ating total, complete vibrant health. Feel how joyful it is to experience such perfect health. Never for single a moment focus on the presence of the ailment, but rather only on that area bei ng in such absolute, complete, vibrant health. This area, with your entire body should be glowing with health. As with manifestation, your imagi nation and focus must always be focussed completely in the pres ent tense, and there should never, ever be even the slightest doubt w hatsoever in your Mind of the reality of the absolute vi brant health of your body , both at the site of the ailment and as a whole. It is mo st important not to focus on your ailment, or even to think about it even for a second. Any thought of your ailment, however vague, will influence Energy towards the presence of the ailment, that will in turn act against your healing efforts. So always focus on total, complete, vibrant health to the exclusion of everything else."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 570 Use all of the powers of your imagination ap propriately, visualising the affected part of your body, wit hout thinking for a moment about the ailment itself, and also your entire Being as a completely as a picture of total, complete, vibrant health. Again, focus your attention in particular on the area of your body that has been suffering from the ailment, always knowing, beyond any doubts whatsoever that your entire body, including this area is in total, perfect, vibrant health. Imagine deeply how well you feel, how joyous you feel, and above all how completely grateful you are to be enjoying such perfect health. Perform this exercise with as much concentration, emotion and focus as possible for at least t wice each day for ten minutes or more until you are fully healed. As with manifestation generally, just before sleep at night, ju st before arising in t he morning soon after awaking, and also just after a da ytime nap are excellent times for this healing process due to the fact that your conscious Mind is much more in communication with your subconscious Mind. This is true to such an extent that it is a very good idea to perform your healing exercises at these times as well as other times during the day. The more frequently you perform your healing exercises, the sooner you will be fully healed. Each healing session has a cumula tive influence on the Energy involved. So the more you prac tice healing in accordance with these exercises, the more the Energy will become more enduring as it acts in the direction of heali ng. Like everything in the Universe, healing is about the influence of E nergy by the Mind, and extremely important aspect of wh ich is the imagination, which is a powerful creative force. Everything is En ergy that responds to the Mind including all ailments without any ex ceptions. Influencing Energy in the direction of total, complete , and the most vibrant health must therefore, in accordance with i mmutable Universal laws become an absolute reality, there are absolutely no exceptions to this.

To the medical profession and people generally , cures manifested in this way seem to be truly mira culous. People who have been told by doctors that they are “terminally ill” seem to shed all signs of their previous illness in favour of total health. There have been numerous cases of people curing their own “inoperable” cancer, brain tumours, and even dissolving gallstones without any sort of physical medical interv ention whatsoever. One reason why people who are not aware of true healing cannot be cured is because they believe in their own Mind that only doctors, surgeons and other member s of the medical profession can “cure” an illness. Un fortunately, that very belief will ensure that true healing will not be effective, due to the fact the true channels of healing will be blocked by the c onscious and subconscious Mind, and Energy influenced in the same direction. It is sensible to visit a doctor with any ailment, and to respect their word and actions, but it is extrem ely important to know beyond any doubt the true origin of healing, and to focus accordingly. Even if you are given a course of medici ne, exercises or even a surgical procedure, view these as sec ondary influences while always knowing that the primary and true healing influence is by virtue of the Energy from which we are all made. After each healing session feel extrem ely grateful for the fact that your entire body and Being is enj oying such complete, vibrant, joyous health. Again, do not fo cus your gratitude on having been healed. This will influence Energy in the direction of the presence of an ailment, thereby affecting t he Universal healing processes.

Always, at all times concentrate on total and complete vibrant health including the ar ea of your ailment, feeling, experiencing and knowing the realit y of this without the slightest doubt in your Mind. It is fine and even beneficial to focus specifically on the area of your ailment, but only in the context of total, absolute, vibrant health of that part of your Being. This r eality can be reinforced during your normal daily activities by remindi ng yourself often how extremely healthy and well you feel. You can also repeat an appropriate affirmation such as; “I am always enjoying perfect, complete and radiant health”. Again, this a ffirmation must always be in the present tense. It is also very e ffective to place an affirmation on the desktop of your PC. The more you integrate your total, complete and vibrant health into your Bei ng, the more and quicker will it become your absolute reality. Never focus the affirmation on a particular area of your body; always affirm that your entire Bei ng is in perfect, vibrant, radiant health, never doubting it even for a single moment. If you ever feel yourself starting to dwell on your ailment, then immediately focus your Mind and concentration on how we ll you feel, how perfect your health is, and how grateful you ar e for your vibrant health, and repeat your affirmation for as many times as it takes to know beyond all doubt this to be complete ly true. The more often you concentrate on your total health and repeat your affirmation the better. Your affirmation should be come completely a part of your ongoing thought processes to such an ex tent that it is the very first thing you think about in the morning after awaking, and the very last thing on your Mind before drifting off to sleep. This method alone is extremely power ful and will manifest complete health if carried out as described above.

Influencing Energy by what we hold in our Mind and in particular focus on or imagine creates our own reality, and to tal, vibrant, joyous health is no exception, regardless of what temporal, physical ailments might arise from time to time. All a ilments have an inner origin that can be identified and fully cured.   "},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 574 Chapter 98: The Practice of Healing Now let us look at a more form al healing process that some people might find valuable by assisting in the focus all of the distinct processes involved. Proceed as follows: Healing Stage 1: Commence your healing session by performing the deep physical relaxation exercises by first of all make yourself as comfortable as you can in an armchair or similar place where you can relax in an upright position with your spine comp letely straight, or in a semi- upright position, again wit h your spine straight. It is not advisable to lie down flat on a bed due to the possibility of falling asleep, however is quite alright to prop y ourself up in bed in a semi-upright position using pillows. Taking a warm bath can also be very beneficial before commencing these exercises. A good posture is very important and the reason why your spine must be straight. If you allow yourself to slump in your chair or bed or if your back and therefore spine is not as straight as possible it will most certainly be counter-pr oductive to the relaxation process and therefore the healin g process. If your armchair does not allow your head and neck to be completely comfortable with your spine straight, place a pillow behind y our head, adjusting it until it is comfortably supported. The objective before commencing deep physical relaxation exercises is for your body to be as balanced and free of strain and stress as possible from the outset, and in such a way as to remain completely balanced throughout the duration of the exercises. Ultimately you should be able to relax under any circumstances. One of the most useful and effe ctive conditions under which to relax for the development of many im portant abilities is while sitting completely upright in a straight -backed chair, while not leaning against the backrest of the chair. These relaxation exercises are commenced with deep breathing exer cises designed to remove as"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 575 much stress and negativity as possible from your muscles and your Mind. Healing Stage 2: Breathe in deeply but slowly to a slow count of five and imagine at the same time, with as much realism as possible that the air you are inhaling is a very bright, r adiant, sparkling white. As you progressively inhale, feel the positi ve relaxing Energy of this white, radiant, sparkling light entering your entire body and spreading throughout your body from head to foot. Hold the breath for a slow count of five while feeling and enjoying as intensely as possible the radian t, sparkling white light bathe your entire body, and then slowly exhale to a further slow count of five. As you exhale, imagine as realistically as possible that your breath is a dark grey colour, and as y ou exhale this dark grey breath containing all negativity and tensi on is now leaving your body as you feel progressively more relaxed. Now continue to relax for a further slow count of five and once again repeat the process of inha ling pure, radiant, white sparking light, again feeling it s pure relaxing Energy entering and permeating your entire body from head to f oot before finally once again exhaling the dark grey light, while at the same time feeling all tension and negativity leaving your body. All inhalations, pauses and exhalations should be carried out to the same slow count of five for each part of this process. Repeat each breathing cycle at leas t five times, ideally continuing until you are feeling generally relaxed, refreshed and positive. Please note that while doing these breathing exercises you should inhale by using your entire di aphragm and not just your upper chest. You can accomplish this by drawing in each breath by using the entire area from your lower stomach to your upper chest, drawing in each breath in this way."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 576 The next stage in deep physical relaxation, to be carried out immediately and follow ing on from the first stage involves progressive active relaxation, starti ng at your feet and finishing at the crown of your head. To proceed with this phase of the exercises, while still retaining your relaxed feelings after the initial breathi ng exercises, imagine as vividly as possible a large sphere of bri ght, glowing, radiant white light positioned just beneat h your feet. Using as much imagination as you can summon make this sphere of light as bright, glowing and radiant as possible; as bright or even brighter than the sun on a clear summers day. Next imagine as realistically as you possibly can this sphere of radiant light moving gradually upwa rds, first encompassing both of your feet. Your feet should now be co mpletely bathed in this bright, glowing, energizing white light; you can feel the glow of the warmth of this bright, radiant, energizing li ght around the entire area of your feet, toes and ankles. Feel all re maining tension draining quickly away from the area of your feet as they bec ome extremely relaxed and free of all tension. Maintain this visualization as vividly as possible until all remaining tensi on completely dissipates from the area of your feet. Next imagine the bright sphere of radiant whit e light moving slowly up your legs to the area of your calves. Again feel this area completely bathed in this bright, glowing, energizing white light, allowing the sphere of Universal light to remain in this position until both of your calves are completely free of all tension and completely relaxed just as with your feet area previously. Next imagine the white s phere of radiant light moving still further up your legs until reaching your thi ghs. The sphere of light can very easily expand as much as it needs to do in order to fully encompass any area of your body at will. As with your feet and calves allow both of your thighs to bathe and relax completely in the glowing, radiant, energizing white E nergy of the sphere of light. As"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 577 before, allow the sphere of light to remain in this position until you know beyond any doubt that all t ension has fully dissipated, and this area now feels totally relaxed. Repeat this process as the radiant, bright, white glowing sphere of Energy travels further up your body next reaching your hips and buttocks followed by your stomac h and lower back ar eas, and then your chest and upper back, arms and shoulders. Your arms should remain totally straight by your sides allowing the sphere to encompass the entire trunk of your body and arms as it progressively makes its way up your body encompassing everything as it does so, and leavi ng each area totally fully relaxed. The sphere of radiant white light now reaches your neck. Allow the sphere of radiant white light to bathe your neck area for longer, and as long as necessary for you to release all tensi on. Your neck can collect a considerable amount of tension and time must be provided for all tension to completely diss ipate, ensuring your neck, as with your lower areas are completely re laxed and free of all tension. Finally the glowing, white radiant sphere of light reaches your head. Allow it to remain around yo ur head area while all tension completely dissipates from your face and head muscles, again leaving them totally and completely relaxed as with all of the lower parts of your body. After all muscl es in your head feel totally relaxed, imagine the radiant, glowin g white sphere of light traveling to the top of your head and remain there while you bask in the wonderful feeling of deep physical relaxation. Healing Stage 3: Now imagine the sphere of glowi ng, radiant white light travelling slowly down through your body once again, and directly to the site of your ailment. Again, it is most important to not think, even for a moment about your ailment. Think excl usively in terms of relaxation while allowing the brigh t, radiant white sphere to travel to the location of your ailment without thinking about it further."},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 578 Allow the bright, radiant while light to remain at the location of your ailment, always glowing brightly, r adiantly and vibrantly, intensely feeling its soothing warmth. Healing Stage 4: Now start to perform breathing exerci ses, but rather than breathing in only through your nose, imagine as realistically as possible you are also breathing in Energy from the Univer se at the site of your ailment. Again, if your ailment encompasses your entire body, imagine as realistically and vividl y as possible, and always beyond any possible doubts that your entir e body is breathing in Energy from the infinite supply of the Universe. It should be noted that we all continuously breathe and abso rb Universal Energy, but this usually happens as an automatic , subconscious process, and accordingly most people will not be awar e of it taking place at all, the usual focus of breathing bei ng centred through the mouth and nose. Imagine, as vividly as possible that with every single breath Universal Energy is entering your body through the pores of your skin, and feel it doing so with a par ticular recognisable sensation. This sensation varies from person to person, some feeling it as a glowing warmth, others f eeling is as a tingling sensation, and others may well feel the pores are actually “breathing”, which indeed is in fact exactly what is happening. Regardless of the sensation it is very important to imagine the process of inhaling Universal Energy from your surroundings and the Univer se, either at the site of your ailment, without dwelling on your element, or over the entire body as appropriate. Do this as vividl y and realistically as possible, knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever this process is actually taking place, which indeed it is. Inhale Universal Energy at the site of your ailment, without thinking about or dwelling on your ailment, or over your entire body as appropriate for a slow count of fi ve, hold your breath for a further slow count of five, and then slowly breath out for a further slow"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 579 count of five, imagining as you exhale that all negativity is being released through your nose as a gr ey mist or cloud. The objective of this exercise is to inhale and concentrate pure, clean Vital Energy at the site of your ailmen t, or within the ar ea of your entire body as appropriate, while removing all accumulated negative Energy during the exhalation process. It should be noted that this is exactly the same Universal Energy as is influenced during Pranic Healing or Reiki. Healing Stage 5: Maintain the image of the radian t, white, sphere of light glowing around and warming the ent ire area of your ailm ent or your entire body as appropriate. Feel with all appropriate senses of your imagination that your entire body incl uding the site of your ailment is in total, vibrant, radiant health. Know beyond any doubt that this is a Divine, pur e, healing light, directly from The Source of all cr eation, The First Cause, from God. Again, it is most impor tant not to unintentiona lly affirm your ailment by acknowledging its existence, but rather only concentrate on that particular area of your body without allowing the thought of your ailment to ever enter your Mind. Should a thought of the ailment enter your Mind, dismi ss it immediately and move your full attention back to the healing process. Ensuring you remain deeply, physica lly relaxed, imagine as vividly and realistically that not only that the area of your body affected by the ailment is enjoying vibrant heal th, but your entire body is also absolutely vibrant with complete health. The focus should be on the area of your ailment while knowing and enjoying beyond any doubts whatsoever the health of your entire body. Again, and this cannot be stressed enough, it is most important never, ever to think in terms of illness or of the actu al ailment, but rather only in terms of absolute and complete health . Never therefore imagine your ailment will be cur ed, but rather know there is really no ailment at"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 580 all, and not only this part of your body but indeed your entire body is enjoying complete, vibrant, radiant health. For example, if you have a cancer , visualise as intensively as possible that your entire body, incl uding the area of your cancer growth, while not thinking in terms of the cancer growth or illness, is completely vibrant with perfect health . It is this focus, concentration and knowing beyond any doubt, with as much imagination, realism and emotion as you can possibly invo ke that creates the conditions for the healing to take place withi n your inner bodies in the inner spheres by influencing Energy. Agai n, as with manifestation, this Energy manifests within the inner Energy levels first, thereby influencing the inner realities includi ng your inner bo dies, before in turn manifesting into your outer physical reality in accordance with Universal laws, thus manifesting to tal health of your physical body. As this process first manifests in to reality beyond space and time, you are not actually healing an ex isting ailment but rather you are creating the conditions whereby t he ailment never actually ever existed within your inner bodies, and cannot accordingly manifest in your outermost physical body. Your body will be in perfect health as if the ailment never existed in the first place, which after the healing process is actually the case. Again, and this has to be remembered at all times, it is extremely important as with the use of creative visual isation and imagination generally for the manifestation of anything at all to only visualise everything in the present tense, always with an absolute knowing beyond any doubts whatsoever that it is already a complete, total experiential reality. Again therefore, never vis ualise your ailment as being slowly cured, or that it wi ll be cured in the future; you must rather concentrate, focus, vis ualise, imagine, and know beyond all doubts whatsoever that your entire body, includi ng the area of your ailment, without ever acknowledging the existence of your ailment, is already enjoying total, radian t, perfect health in the present tense; this must not seem like wishf ul thinking, but rather a total, absolute unambiguous knowing."},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 581 The numerous and seemingly miracu lous cures that have been brought about by this type of healing method are an absolute testimony to these realities. Ther e are no theoretical limits to the healing of physical ailments however severe by means of these healing processes, so please, never have any doubts whatsoever in your Mind about this while healing yourself. To complete the healing exercise ma intain your state of relaxation, focus, concentration, and the presenc e of the radiant white sphere of light and Energy, together with y our feeling, visualisation and imagination of total, vibrant, comp lete health for at least ten minutes, after which you can ta ke a few deep breaths and completely relax. It is extremely important to offer your most grateful thanks to God for the excellent health you are enjoying, and for the blessings you have received and are receiving, before continuing with your normal routine. Feel, as deeply as possible extreme gratitude for how well you feel, how perfect y our health is, and for everything and everyone in your life. When proceeding with your daily affairs never dwell on your ailment, or in particular on the success of your healing sessions. Leave everything to the Universe, The Source, God in the knowing that the Energy is already influenced and is manifesting your desired result; in this case your, total, vibrant health. If you do happen to think about your health, it is absolutely vital to only think about it in completely positive terms and with a complete feeling and knowing of absolute vi brant, radiant health. Difficult though it might seem at first, it is most important to never think negatively about your ailm ent or your health gener ally, or indeed to think about the ailment at a ll, otherwise those thoughts will neutralise your positive thoughts and therefore the healing process by acknowledging the ex istence of the ailmen t, thereby attracting"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 582 the associated Energy associat ed with experiencing the ailment rather than being free of it. Should you ever find yourself th inking about your ailment in any way, even for a moment, imm ediately repeat an affirmation, preferably the same affirmation each time such as “I always enjoy complete, radiant health, in every as pect of my being”. It is always a good idea to repeat an affirmation as often as possible, and also to write it down and place copies of it around your home where you will see it, repeating the affirmation it as often as possible. Placing a copy of the affirmation on your PC desktop is an excellent idea if you use your PC frequently. Successful healing means only infl uencing and attracting the most positive healing Energy within the inner spheres of life, and ultimately your physical body will refl ect this completely in terms of complete, radiant, vibrant health. This reality quite simply has to be so in accordance with the princi ple of correspondence as discussed earlier, “as above, so below”, and yo u should always be Mindful of this, and know it to be true beyond any doubts. Continue your healing sessions as often as possible, ideally twice each day until you are fully healed. As with creative visualisation for manifestation, the best times of the day to perform healing are just after arising in the morning and just before retiring for sleep at night when you are in closest contact with your subconscious Mind and inner spheres. Any other time of the day is fine however providing you can attain and maintain t he required level of deep physical relaxation and concentration requi red for the exercises, in a location where you will not be dist urbed. After any healing exercise, as with manifestation, or indeed any time you are working with God, the Universe, The Source to attract something into your life, always remember to thank God most sinc erely and revere ntly and with the deepest gratitude for the blessings re ceived, and feel the gratitude for these blessings deeply and with emotion. In addition to healing yourself you c an also use this process to heal others. Healing others is extremel y worthwhile and satisfying, and"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 583 in accordance with the law of Cause and Effect, whatever blessings you send out to others will equally re turn to you. Again however, it must be stressed that healing others must onl y be carried out with their consent, otherwise there is a r eal risk of infringi ng the freewill of that person to be ill, or preventing them from learning valuable lessons as a result of their suffering. Although karma takes motive into account, motive being an Energy influenced by Mind, it is never good to operate against the free will or permission of others regardless of how you perceive t heir circumstances. If a person is too ill to grant such permission, then take as much time as you need to meditate and ask the question with total focus as to whether you should send healing Ener gy to the afflicted person. When you receive your reply you shou ld obey that re ply totally and without question. Your Higher-Self knows the entire picture for all concerned and should be respect ed and obeyed at all times. Many genuine, highly accomplis hed healers dedicate their entire lives to healing others without any thought whatsoever of reward, recompense or recognition, and do so purely out of Unconditional Love and service to mankind. We are all, each and every one of us equal aspects of God, and therefore healing others is also equally healing an aspect of God, and therefore of ourselves. There are absolutely no limitations of distance for healing. As previously discussed, the proc ess of healing occurs beyond the confines of physical space and ti me, neither of which therefore present any sort of barrier or li mitation. Providing you can clearly visualise the person who you will be healing and know the nature and site of their ailment, they can be healed every bit as effectively as if they are in the exac tly same room as you. The process for the remote healing of others is very similar to the process of self-healing. Again, as before, healing others can be performed with a pure creative visua lisation process in exactly the same way as manifestation, or wi th a more formal process. If using the straight creative visualisation process to manifest health for another person, simple vividly imagine beyond any doubt and with"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 584 as much emotion as possible the person you are heal ing, and know they are enjoying complete, total vibrant health. See and know how happy and joyous they are to be feeling so joyously healthy. In order to assist the visual isation process, if you have a photograph of the person you are healing, take as much time as necessary before commencing the healing session to concentrate on the photograph, remembering ever y single detail of the person before proceeding with the healing pr ocess. Continue this healing process as frequently as possible, preferably at least twice each day until the person is completely healed. Again, as with all manifestation, just before drifting off to sleep and just after awaking in the morning are excellent times to perform these healing processes. To commence the more formal heali ng process, star t with the deep physical relaxation exercises as pr eviously discussed. Also perform the Energy breathing ex ercises as previously described. This time, having completed the Energy br eathing exercises, instead of allowing the radiant, white sphere of light to travel back into the Universe, imagine it travelling direct ly to the area of your chest, your heart chakra. Feel the Energy and the warmth of this vibrant, radiant, white sphere of Energy as it bathes your entire chest area. Next, imagine as realistically as possible a radiant, white beam of light being projected di rectly from your heart chakra, reaching out and connecting with the person you are healing. Remember, distance is not import ant and represents no barriers whatsoever to healing. Imagine also, as realistically as po ssible, that the Energy stored within your body is transmitted to the person from your heart chakra as a white beam of bright, vibran t, healing, light. You are sending the person both healing light and Energy. Now imagine this beam of vibrant white light, and the Energy being transmitted with it, to connect direct ly with, and to bath the area of the ailment of the person being healed or their entire body as"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 585 appropriate. Use all of the powers of your imagination to know, beyond any doubt that the person you are healing is already in the most perfect, vibrant , glowing health. Now continue the healing process ex actly as you would for healing yourself except that al l of your visualisations should be intensively focussed with as much concentrati on as possible on the area of the person being healed ra ther than your own body. Continue to imagine and visualise with as much feeling and emotion as possible while sending healing Energy from your heart chakra, and as always with an absolute knowing, beyond any doubt that the person is in total and complete radiant, vibrant health. Never, even for a single moment doubt they are enjoying anything but complete, total vibrant health. As always, this mu st be known in the present tense as an absolute reality, and in t he present moment. Never think, even for a moment that the pers on you are healing has an ailment, or they will be healed, but rather only they are already totally glowing, radiant and vibrant with complete health. Conclude your remote healing session in the same way as a self- healing session. Feel the deepest and most si ncere gratitude for the opportunity to heal another S on or Daughter of God, sending the most sincere gratitude to The Source, The First Cause, to God for healing another. The same principles apply as you go about your daily affairs; do not think about the other person, the s ubject of your remote healing, always trusting everything to the Universe. Should you bring the person to Mind, always think and im agine them in terms of nothing less than enjoying complete, radian t, vibrant health, never allowing thoughts of their ailment or whet her they will be healed to enter your Mind. Any thoughts about whet her they will be healed, or whether the healing is having an effect will attract negative Energy along with the reality a ffirming that the ailment exists; this should never be allowed to occur. Ag ain, as with self-healing, an affirmation is always an excellent way to remain focussed and to"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 586 neutralise any negative or non-present tense thoughts, such as “..........is always enjoying complete , vibrant, radiant health”. In addition to healing yourself an d other people you can also heal animals and even the environment using these healing methods. The process is exactly the same as for remote healing and should be performed in exactly the same way; visualise the creature being healed, the rain forest, or any other aspect of the environment as enjoying complete, vibrant, radiant health. You can also heal a particular aspect of the creature or environment as with the healing process discussed, but again always think, imagine and concentrate in the present tense, and never in terms of it happening in the future which attracts the Energy of an existing problem. The Energy needing to be created and manifested within the inner worlds beyond space and time are ones of perfection. Sending healing Energy to the ent ire planet and all mank ind in this way is similar to the Twin Hearts medita tion as practiced previously, and is extremely worthwhile. Always remember that although this should never be a prime motivation, in accordance with the laws of Cause and Effect, everything you send out to others or to anything in the Universe will be returned to you in kind.  "},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 587 Chapter 99: Living Your Own Reality In the previous section of this book, we discussed the many different, and powerful ways of a ssuming full control over every aspect of your own life and destiny. How to concentrate, meditate, manifest your desires, healing, and how to protect yourself, loved ones, and home from negative Energy and entities. Living and creating your own re ality, and therefore managing and being in full control of your ow n destiny can mean so much more than simply practicing these abiliti es when the need arises, it could, and indeed should be a way of life. The integration into your ongoing life and path of concentration, positive thinking, meditation, manifestation, healin g and psychic defence, all as completely natural and free-flowing aspects of your Bein g will enhance the quality of your life and thos e around you dramatically. Everyone should always know beyond any doubt whatsoever that you are Son or Daughter of God, that you are immortal and made in the true Spiritual image of God, and therefore you ar e a co-creator in the microcosm, your own world, just as God is the Prime Creator in the entire Universe, the Ma crocosm within Who’s Mind the Universe in all its gl ory has its Being. All of your ongoing actions and in particular your thoughts therefore have a most profound effect both on your own reality and also the reality all those and everything around you. Rather than simply thinking posit ively from time to time or manifesting desires only when y ou need something in particular, healing when you or someone else is ill, or applying countermeasures when threatened by negative influences, living every waking minute of every single day in this way will bring about profoundly positive benefit s. By practicing daily meditation, always thinking positively about your objectives while knowing beyond doubt and with absolute cert ainty they have already manifested into your life, by always thinking in te rms of perfect health and safety for"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 588 yourself, family and home, then th is will indeed become your own true reality. We are as we think, all creatin g our own realities in accordance with our thought processes and in particular what we choose to focus and concentrate on. By being Mindful of, and in full control over your thoughts at all times, by only focussing on what you need, then your life will be comple te peace and harmony with all of your needs fulfilled from the infinite abundance of the Universe. The pressures and trials of the materi al world will no longer intrude, knowing that you have complete c ontrol over your own reality and destiny, and accordingly nothing can possibly affect or harm you. Again, and the importance of th is statement simply cannot be overstated, each and every person creates their own reality. Although others might seek to affect your reality from time to time, either deliberately or unknowingly, only y ou and you alone can ultimately create and manage your own individual reality, thus ensuring that external influences c annot and will not a ffect your life or that of those around you. Living your own reality involves living consciously in every moment of every day. Most people today ar e still carried along on a wave of circumstances they simply react to in the moment in a random and non-structured way. The thoughts of most people are random, scattered and unfocussed and lacking the power to influence anything at all significantly. Many people constantly produce negative thoughts yielding corres pondingly negative consequences and often negative karma, particularly if those thoughts are directed at or affect others. As a very basic illustration of how people create their own realities, let us look at two people visiting a ma jor city for the very first time. The first person has no real control over their own life, usually tends to think in a cynical, negative and unfocussed way, and generally therefore always sees the negative side of everything. The second person always understands and has full control over their own"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 589 reality, and accordingly always sees the positive in everything and everyone. When arriving at the city for t he first time the first person immediately sees only a noisy, grimy, depressing place, with crowded streets, overpriced shops and miserable looking strangers. The second person arriving in the ve ry same city for the first time immediately sees many wonderful places of interest, a vibrant atmosphere, lots of inviting pl aces to shop for bargains and all manner of delightful goods, a pl ace where everyone is always happy, smiling and friendly. The first person has a miserable time during their visit to this city, whereas the second person has a wonderful time. This city is exactly the same place in both cases, but the first person has created a completely negative reality whereas the second person has created a positive reality. In this particular example neither person has tangibly altered the physica l reality of the city but rather the way in which they perceive it to be very different, and which has a profound effect on each of them in accordance with their own individual perceptions and focus, and therefore control over their own respective realities. When these people interact with the residents and places within this city, their individual realities will affect others in the same way. If many such people were to visit exactly the same city, these people would in turn begin to affect the reality of the entire city by propagating either positive or negative vibrations of Energy, which in turn have their effect on the plane of the human Mind of the people in that location. This is a simple example of how people can profoundly affect their own immedi ate reality and t hat of everyone around them. As discussed before in this book, the reality of this can be extended to encompass the entire planet Eart h. If everyone on Earth were to stop focussing their attention on ever ything in physical existence on the planet, then everything on Earth that was previously created by"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 590 the Mind of humans would simply di sappear as a physical reality, because the collective, consens us human Mind would no longer be influencing the Energy that sustains physical things, which, as with the Astral worlds, are nothing more than an illusion on a large scale perpetuated only by the Mind of the beings residing there. Of course it often takes more time to affect realities than with these particular examples. As we already know, positive and negative thoughts, emotions, imaginations and other powers of the Mind will first manifest within the inner sp heres of life before subsequently manifesting into the density of t he physical world as a reality in accordance with the Universal principle of correspondence, observable in turn by the five physical senses. In this way all thoughts, emotions, and imaginations, however large or small, however positive or negative, will always manifest into your own reality sooner or later in accord ance with immutable Universal laws. The person in full control of their own life and destiny will be Mindful of this always, and will live, think and behave accordingly. People who are fully aware of the ways of the Universe and of Spirit, consciously living their own reality, can make use of the immense powers of imagination, creative visualisation and concentration in order to alter any as pect of their own reality to suit their own particular ongoing needs simply by focussing on the desired result and willing it to be so . Living your own reality is not therefore simply a matter of manife sting your own desires into your life, healing, protection and influ encing your own life and those of others, but also consciously in fluencing the way in which you perceive and interact with your environment, and in particular the Energy from which it is constitut ed. Once a person knows that at a quantum level everything without exception is Energy that is influence and shaped by the immense powers of the Mind, that person will know that any thing and everything is truly possible. This knowledge in turn profoundly affe cts overall states of ongoing happiness, tranquillity, peace, ha rmony and personal evolution along the sacred path back to The Source, The First Cause, God, to evolve back to Whom is the true meaning of life."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 591 Of course most people do think posit ively from time to time, for example in moments of optimism, but any unstructured negative thoughts will always cancel out co rrespondingly positive thoughts and ultimately result in an overall negative bias if negative thoughts are allowed to predominate. Unfortunately due to the often materialistic, cynical and egotistic world of today, many people tend to exhibit a predominance of negativity which will in turn inevitably result in a negative emphasis on their own individual realities and that of those aroun d them. This predom inantly negative or indifferent attitude towards the environment, other people and life generally is one of the major probl ems confronting mankind today on a global scale, and a major cont ributory reason why the world is in the state it is in today. By being totally conscious of and living for every moment with complete realisation of the pr ofound importance of consciously experiencing and creating every single moment, you can make every such moment really make a difference, thus ensuring the emphasis of your own reality and that of those around you is overwhelmingly positive and effect ive. You will not only manage and be the master of your own r eality but will also become immune to the Energy influence as a result of the negative thoughts, attitudes and effects generated by the other people you come into contact with every day while at work, shopping and everywhere else you need to go. If only everyone were to live in conscious and full positive control over their own Mind and therefore individual re alities, always living for their own true destiny, for thos e around them and that of all of mankind, the world of today would inevitably be a vastly better place, the “kingdom of heaven on Earth” it was always destined to be, and which one day, hopefully soon, will sure ly become an absolute reality.

You should therefore not only therefore perform the manifestation of your desires, healing, protection and everything else discussed in the previous sections when you have a particular need, but always endeav our to think consciously and positively, always striving to integr ate these into your life at both conscious and subconscious levels. Always see everything around you in the most positive ligh t, with peace, harmony, and happiness, in the certain knowing that you are in the flow and an integral aspect of the entire Universe, of God, in all dimensions, spheres and realms of reality, and your world will equally be peace, harmony and happiness.   "},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 593 Chapter 100: Our Ultimate Destiny Everyone should know that first and foremost that we are all, without exception, a Son or D aughter of God, The One, The Source, The First Cause, The Pr ime Creator, an immortal Spirit made in the true Spiritual image of God, to Whom it is the ultimate destiny of everyone to return as perfected human beings, God people. This is the true, absolute and ultimate meaning of life. When end of the path is reached, each and every person will have the opportunity to relinquish indi viduality and reunite with God from whence you came as a perfected human being, or of retaining individuality and continuing as a “God person”, working within the Universe in all spheres assist ing people from planets further down the path to continue their own ascent, just as humans continue to be assisted in turn, and just as with all of those races of the Universe that have gone before. Those who do choose to reunite with The Source, The First Cause, with God, will experience an expansion of Consciousness encompassing The All, and finally A ll in the Universe will become known. It should be mentioned at th is stage that as we are already integral as aspects of God, when we speak of “Unity with God” we really do mean Unity with The Sour ce, the First Cause, The Prime Creator, the very highest, and most incomprehensible Being of all which some refer to as the “Godhead”, the most supreme intelligence, intellect, Energy, vibr ation, the true Master and Creator of the entire Universe in all of its magnificent spheres of reality in which we live and breath and have our being. Unity with God is therefore not at all the end of existence, or is it the end of Consciousness awareness, but rather the end of the individual path and therefore of indi viduality. Before being born into the physical world for the very first time, we all and still do exist as Spirit, but unified with T he One. Being born for the first time is to be receive individuality, a means of expression of God, first in the physical world and then through the inner spheres of life, and the means by which the journey back to The Source can be attained."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 594 The path to perfection is a very long one, but nevertheless a path which everyone should journey with absolute joy, passion and happiness, and a total Mindfulness of the ultimate and most sacred destiny. The more inwards along t he path reached, the more Light, peaceful, harmonious, glorious and b lissful will be the conditions prevailing, with realms and states of being that are completely beyond the wildest comprehensions of earthly humans. As mankind ascends ever further along the path, the greater will be the abilities acquired along the way; abilities beyond the very wildest dreams of mankind at the lower levels, abil ities even far and way beyond those any human would believe the Gods to possess. During the great ascent on the path to perfection, people are willingly of service to others, always assisting those further along the path progressing ever inwards in turn; a process continuing at every level of the Univer se from the very highest to the very lowest, as even now beings of the inner worlds are assisting humanity on Earth. Everyone living now, who has ever lived, and will ever live, has always existed as an immortal aspect and expression of God. When a human being becomes an indi vidual person for the first time, at the time of t he very first incarnation into the physical world, a Divine spark of Spir it of God descends from the Logos and unites with an embryo in an as yet unb orn human body, thus commencing a very first life as an incarnate, individual physical human being, an expression of God, ju st embarking on the jour ney of the glorious path to perfection back to God. Fr om that moment forth the person becomes an individual aspect of God, and from that moment forth has set foot on the sacred path ultimately leading back home to our Divine Creator from Whence we came, the ultimate, truest and most sacred meaning of life. The physical world can be likened to a kindergarten while the inner spheres of life ultimately leadin g back to God can be likened to post graduate University. No person can ev er be born as a child into the"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 595 physical world and then attend and graduate from University on the very same day. During the first fe w years of physi cal life a child learns to survive in the physica l world by learning the basics and physical skills necessary for livi ng and survival in a world of physical matter, eventually progr essing through all levels of education until finally leaving Un iversity with the necessary qualifications to assist him or her through the remainder of that particular physical life, s hould that be their choice. And so it is with the evolution of all mankind but on the grand, Universal scale. Before any human being can graduate to the inner, more blissful, harmonious, glorious spheres of life it is first of all necessary to learn the fundam ental lessons and to balance accumulated negative karma. Over the course of numerous lives on Earth more lessons are learne d and karma balanced. Over time each and every person will begin to realise the physical world for the illusion what it really is, will learn more necessary lessons, will accumulate more positive karma than negative karma, and eventually the greater realities of the Univ erse now seeming so much of a mystery will become k nown. Thus released from the rigours of the physical world a person can focus on the sacred journey towards the inner worlds on the sacred path back to our Divine Creator, The First Cause, back to God. There are many paths leading back to God. While no path is correct or incorrect the ultimate requi rements are always the same, only the means of achievement differing. While many people might well currently believe they enjoy t he physical world with all of its materialism and stimulation of the five physical senses, such people in reality have absolutely no c oncept whatsoever of the true glories, peace, Light, bliss and ha rmony as taught by inner Spiritual intelligences throughout the ages of the inner wo rlds. Those who are aware of and understand the natur e of these inner realities will never delay; the need to make progress, to escape the illusion and density of the physical world wi ll become a passion and a sacred task. Those who do choose to turn their back on these realities, thereby delaying their own ascent for whatever reason, will trail"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 596 ever further behind on the sacred path, while fellows of the human race are attaining, discovering, and experiencing conditions of glory, splendour and Love, far, far and away beyond the comprehension of those left further behind. When humans ascend to these levels, the physical, and indeed the Astral worlds are seen and underst ood for what they really are, and what they really represent. As the great ascent continues, those inner along the path will in turn assi st those further down the path in their own ascent, such is the way of the Universe at all levels of life and reality from the physical world to The Source, The First Cause, God. There is nothing whatsoever to be gained by delaying, thus ensuring a continuing cycle of reinca rnation into t he physical world of matter. Everyone can make ve ry real progress towards true destiny, ultimately unity with G od should that be desired, and to which most sacred destiny the remainder of this book is dedicated.  "},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 597 Chapter 101: Know Thyself An absolutely fundamental requ irement for achieving permanent, genuine and real progress is to “know yourself”. This truth has been taught by the sages of many ancient sources of knowledge throughout the world for many thous ands of years as an absolutely fundamental aspect of achieving true, ongoing, enduring progress. Many people unfortunately do not know themselves, merely existing through each life without any sense of purpose, merely reacting to circumstances in an incoherent and unstructured way, often not even realising what they are doing or saying, or why they react as they do. Indeed, most people do not even think about these things or the consequences of the way in which they choose to live. Knowing yourself is an extremely important aspect of personal evolution, not only for making genuine progress on the path but also for achieving true harmony and peace in your life and in the life of those around you. Knowing yourself can often be a ve ry difficult task requiring much discipline, honesty and self-exa mination. This process can sometimes be very upsetting at first for many people as they discover and face aspects of them selves they really do not like. Nevertheless, these are often t he very same aspects that can cause the most problems in pr eventing ultimate happiness, and a smooth, harmonious progress through each and every life and on the path. To actually know yourself is really only the start. It is extremely important to identify and recognise those aspects of self that are holding you back, and to eradica te or transmute those negative aspects of self until finally your body, Soul and Spirit exhibit only the most positive and purest of a ttributes. This process requires much courage and perseverance, but the rewards are very considerable, both in life and for ongoing progress; indeed, without dealing with the negative aspects of self, enduring, true progress quite simply cannot be made, progre ss which sooner or later is the destiny of everyone, and should therefore not be delayed or"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 598 compromised. Until true progr ess is made, the cycle of reincarnation into the physical wo rld of matter continues until all lessons have been learned, fu lly integrated and applied. The process of ennoblement on the path to perfection back to The Source, The First Cause, back to God is so important for ongoing progression that there have been num erous references to it over the ages from many ancient source s around the world. The ancient art of “alchemy” is not merely t he transmuting of base metals into gold as most people suppose, but ra ther the transmutation of base human imperfections into purit y, the gold of perfection. With knowing self comes a further and very important responsibility; that of never judging others. People who judge others also judge themselves to exactly the same extent. Of course everyone should also assist each other on the path when appropriate and possible to do so, and in particular when r equested to do so, but such help must always be extended both out of Unconditional Love and a genuine and sincere desire to be of service to others without any thoughts at all for self, reward or gain.  "},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 599 Chapter 102: Transcending the Ego One of the very biggest challenges facing the evolution of any person is in overcoming the demands of the individual ego. It is simply not possible to achieve enduring and genuin e progress until the ego has been well and truly brought under control to the extent that it no longer exerts any negative or detrimental influence upon self or anyone else. The ego is that aspect of a person striving to make its presence felt both on the individual perso nality and upon others. The ego constantly demands to be sa tisfied and satiated otherwise discontent and personal disharmony will be the result if the demands of the ego are not fulfill ed. The ego is responsible for many negative human traits, includi ng but certainly not limited to being critical and judgemental of ot hers, being rigid and inflexible, being manipulative, need to feel superior, feeling anxious and fearful, mood swings, taking ev erything too personally, taking everything too seriously, const ant need for approval and praise, feeling hurried and driven to do th ings, competing rather than cooperating, feeling resentful and guilty, unable to live in the present moment, addictions to al cohol, tobacco and other Mind altering substances, overly co ncerned with personal appearance, overly concerned with success, fee ling insecure, constant worry over trivialities, clinging to the past, feelings of despair and hopelessness, feeling life is mean ingless, and the need for power over others. All of t hese are seriously negative human traits, and ones that can easily make a persons life a misery. The ego causes an illusory focus on those aspects of the physical world that are really not at a ll important for peac e, harmony and happiness, and most importantly for enduring and true evolution and progression. Without true inner peace, harmony and living in Spirit, true progress quite simp ly cannot be made. The ego must therefore be considered to be an unwelcome adversary, focussing on the individual self ra ther than absolute rea lity, and above all one"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 600 that focuses on self rather th an the most sacred path and true meaning of life. Many people are very quick to blam e others or the world in general for their own problems; it is always much easier for people to blame everything and everyone else rat her than having to face up to everything themselves, thereby ta king full responsibility for their own thoughts and actions. Whenever anything adverse happens the immediate reaction of many is usually focussed towards looking for scapegoats rather than looking in wards towards self for the real cause of the corresponding effect. Some people are so much under the control of their own ego t hat they really are absolutely convinced they are always right and everyone else, and indeed the rest of the Universe must always be completely wrong; a level of ego which can have most detrimental consequences indeed for such an individual. The ego constantly strives to ha ve people believe they are not responsible for their own actions but are rather a victim of circumstance or of the state of the world in general. Such a person might blame family, friends, politici ans, people they work with, work bosses, or simply ascribe negativ e effects to such non-existent notions as “bad luck”, “fortune” or “chance”. In fact absolutely anyone and everyone they can associate with a situation which was ultimately caused by their own personal actions will be blamed rather than blaming the tr ue cause; themselves. The ego constantly strives to be always right, always superior, never wrong and never inferior. The ego constantly seeks self- importance, power and superiority ov er others, often at any cost, and regardless of who they are a ffecting or hurting at the same time. The ego is not something that can si mply be destroyed; it is rather a vital aspect of individuality, for life and indeed for conscious awareness. The ultimate objective therefore is not to attempt to destroy the ego but rather to tr anscend the influence of the ego,"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 601 thereby bringing it under complete control in order to serve its intended purpose by accentuating it s necessary positive attributes while suppressing the negative and destructive attributes so detrimental to genuine peace, happiness, harmony, and most importantly personal ev olution and progress. The ego can be likened to a telescope on the world collecting sensory information, and delivering such information to the five physical senses and the Mind. The fact is however, many people still do not simply accept the information being received through the ego as a necessary part of consci ous existence, they also proceed to analyse or very often even ove r-analyse the information received through the ego, reacting or over-r eacting to it accordingly. The ego can be likened to a postal service, delivering letters to the Mind for advisory and information purposes. These letters should be immediately ackn owledged and then filed away for future reference if appropriate. Instead, m any people will actually open the letters and then proceed to tell the ego how to respond to the sensory information received. Furthermore, many people have a tendency to see only those things t hey want to see, and accordingly are selective over which letters to the Mind they will open and which they will subsequently respond to. The ego likes to make comparison s, particularly with other people. In an of itself making comparis ons is fine for the purposes of making a necessary choice, the pr oblems really ar ise when the ego is not satisfied by merely making comparisons but is allowed to extend the comparisons to incl ude comparative judgements about other people, possessions, and everything else the ego erroneously regards as important. The ego wi ll for example encourage people to take up various sports, hobbies and skills, often not merely for the benefits or health, happiness and relaxation which they can surely bring, but also as a means of seem ing superior to others by means of making comparisons with others relative to these pastimes. "},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 602 The ego however does need to make comparisons as a function of living in the material world. For example, when walking around a supermarket, comparisons need to be made between the quality and prices of items to be purchased. This sort of comparison is very useful and is being applied for positive reasons. The problems would arise in this ca se however when comparing an item, not for genuine reasons of price or quality, but rather with view to making a purchasing decision based on the perception that the item is superior to an equivalent item already owned by a neighbour, friend or relative. The same example would hold true in purchasing a new car for example, and indeed any highly visible object by which people believe they will be personally judged. In the example of the car, subjective comparisons must of course be made between all of the options available in order to ta ke account such fundamentals as fuel economy, insurance costs, servicing costs and many other necessary and relevant factors, a ll of which need to be justifiably reconciled before such a signific ant purchase can be justified. The ego will take over if allowed to do so however by endeavouring to ensure the car is bigger th an those of friends, neighbours, relatives and others, has more seats, a bigger engine, better acceleration and top speed, more in ternal luxuries, better electronic equipment and so on. The ego in this case has clearly caused the purchaser of the car to make a si gnificant purchasing decision over and above that which was fundamenta lly justifiable, based almost entirely on egotistical reasons; t he need for a feeling of perceived superiority over others. The ego often exerts a particula rly strong influence in personal relationships. Everyone should be attracted to a partner for individual personality and other genuine qualities and virtues, because they share common interests for example, and in general because they are very well suited to each other. Some people however will be attracted to a part ner for much more superficial reasons, often because they perceive the partner to be glamorous,"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 603 handsome, appears to be generally attrac tive in the eyes of others, or very often because they are per ceived to be wealthy. In these cases the ego is in full control over something as fundamentally important as choosing a partner, or even a future husband or wife. This of course is a very major contributory reason as to why so many marriages result in separation, divorce or ongoing unhappiness, a situation that is escalating due to the demands of the ego, and the focus and priorities of mankind generally, often motivated by materialism. The ego has delusions of grandeur and likes nothing more than to be noticed, flattered and admired. In reality of course nothing ever makes anyone better or in any wa y more superior as compared with anyone else. Every single person without exception is an equal aspect of God, made in the true Sp iritual image of God, but each having unique characteristics, abilitie s, shortcomings to face and so on. If we judge others then we equally judge ourselves. Acceptance is a most important aspect of life, acceptance of everyone for what they really are and what they represent, and most importantly as an equal expression of God, The Sour ce, The First Cause of Whom we are all equal aspects. The other side of the ego is in feeling worse or inferior by comparison with others. People might perceive themselves for example to feel useless, unworthy, unwanted, and many other such negative perceptions of self. There really is no difference at all between this side of the ego and the one suffering from delusions of grandeur; they are all posit ive and negative aspects and degrees of the same thing. Ultimately to transcend the ego is to know beyond any doubts whatsoever that everyone without any exceptions are equal, and to li ve and interact with people and situations accordingly. The Source, The First Cause, God is perfection, and everyone without exception is an inseparable expression and equal aspect of that same perfection."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 604 The ego will revel in exerting its influence over many other aspects of peoples lives. For example many people like to feel sorry for themselves by feeling they are a vi ctim or a martyr in some way. Such people will often f eel everything is hopel ess, that they are burdened with demands and responsib ilities they cannot handle, feel unappreciated, misunderstood, feel badly treated and generally believing they are the victim of bad luck, ch ance, fortune and other such non-existent notions. The ego does not like responsibilit y and will often do whatever it can to deny and avoid responsibilit y. Typical signs the ego is in control of responsibility ar e when people blame others for everything that goes wrong in their own lives. The ego will typically blame anyone and ever yone except themselves for anything happening they do not like or will not accept respons ibility for, be it by the government, a friend, a nei ghbour, a family member, a work colleague or indeed any one else who happens to be nearby at the time and can conveniently be blam ed. As we already know, each and every person creates their own reality, and thus to blame others is quite simply futile. This is not to say however people are knowingly creat ing situations giving rise to the response of the ego, but are rather doing so subconsciously. It is not until all negative situations are accepted and fully analysed can the realisati on be reached as to the origins of the situation, and thereby posit ive actions be taken to make the necessary corrections. Accepting and taking full responsibi lity for all such situations is empowering, and those wh o can achieve this will have considerably more control over every aspect of their own lives, will be in conscious control of creating their ow n reality, and as a direct result experience a much ha ppier, more peaceful and harmonious life. The ego also revels in the illusion of always being busy. People often like to believe they are so busy with daily work, chores and other responsibilities that they have no time available for anything"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 605 or anyone else, often including themselves. The more a person dwells on this illusion of busyness, the busier they will believe they really are; a situation that can quickly escalate into a full busyness martyr syndrome. Worse still, if the ego believes a person is not busy enough it will create work in or der to justify the illusion of busyness, often repeating the same chores and tasks over and over again until they are perceived to be satisfactory, and the need for feeling busy has accordingly satisfied the ego. Such people always consider themselves to be very busy, always endeavouring to make the people around them belie ve they really are busy, and yet still getting nowhere in particula r and not achieving much of any real significance, certainly not in proportion to their perceived workload. The ego also often revels in disa ster, particularly when it happens to people who are not liked. People unfortunately often revel in the misfortunes of others on whatever scale the misfortune occurs, whether it is a problem at work , someone losing their employment, a marriage breaking up or simply a general lack of ability by someone to accomplish something. Unfortunately, people generally find it much easier to revel in the misfortune of others than to equally share in their happiness when good and positive things happen to the same people. This is again another extremely negative and insidious attribute of the ego, believing itself to be always superior and revelling in t he misfortune of ot hers in order to satisfy itself and to create an illusi on of perceived superiority over others. Notwithstanding all of its insi dious influences, the ego is nevertheless a vital aspect of conscious awareness and can therefore never be des troyed. At the same time the ego is frequently responsible for considerable misery and suffering, and a lack of peace and harmony generally. It strives to dominate and feel superior, and always insists on getting its own way if at all possible. The ego can, and profoundl y will hold people back both in everyday life and in personal ev olution and progression on the path. Until such time as the ego is tamed and its influence fully transcended,"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 606 true and enduring progress, peace, happiness and harmony quite simply cannot be achieved and maintained.   "},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 607 Chapter 103: Practice of Transcending the Ego In order to transcend the negative influe nces of the ego, it is first of all necessary to fully recognise the presence and influence of the ego and the insidious effects it can exert over our own lives and the lives of others, and t hen to systematically neutralise all of those negative effects originating from the influence of the ego. Commence the practice of transcendi ng the ego by writing down in a suitable notebook or journal of the type eas ily maintained and referred to, a list of all of those th ings in your life that makes you feel better or more superior than others. Do not hurry with this exercise and be completely and utterly honest with yourself at all times; think and meditate deeply, ensuring that absolutely nothing is left out of your list. There is nothing at all to be gained by being less than totally honest with yourself during the important initial stage of these exercises. There is no rush, it would be be tter to compose your list over the course of a few days or even weeks, giving yourself plenty of time to identify all of those areas where you might feel superior to other people; no item of such superior feelings should be left out of your list. It is a very good idea indeed to carry your notebook or journal with you, and whenever you feel s uperior or better than others in any way whatsoever immediately wr ite it down before you forget about it. You really do need to be totally hones t and hard on yourself while compiling this list of egotistical tr aits. Do not convince or flatter yourself in any way t hat you do not really feel superior in any particular way if in fact you really do, or worse believe you really are indeed superior and therefore should not note that particular aspect of ego in your list at all. Every single aspect of your ego causing you to feel superior to others in any way whatsoever should be immediately noted without any hesitat ions at all. Continue this process until you are abs olutely sure that you have your complete and definitive list of areas where you in any way feel superior or"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 608 better than others. Put aside at l east ten minutes each and every day for this next stage of the process of transcending the ego until the process is complete and you have your definite list of ego driven influences in your life. For the next stage in this proce ss of transcending your ego, sit down quietly and relax in a place where you know you will not be disturbed. Now look at the first item on your list of feeling superior and deeply consider, with as much sincerity and emotion as you can possibly summon, just how absolut ely ridiculous it is to feel superior over such a thing. Unde rstand exactly why you believe in your own Mind you are superior in this particular area and know the reality and the truth that you are really are not superior at all. Know beyond any doubt that it is rather only your ego causing you to feel superior in this way in order to satisfy its own selfish demands. It is most important in this process of considering exactly why you feel superior to others to always be Mindful of the fact the people who you are comparing yourself with might have chosen to not to place any particular relevance or importance on the same thing. For example, if you believe yourself to be a superior cook to your neighbour, friend or relative, be Mindf ul of the fact they might not consider cooking to be very import ant at all, and t herefore always prefer to choose more simply prepared foods. This does not make you in any way superior to your neighbour, friend or relative in terms cooking, but rather they have used their own freewill in order to create for themselves a reality whereby cooking is simply not a priority, and is therefore not as important to them as the emphasis you place upon your own co oking; they quite simply prefer to enjoy simple, easy to prepare foods. You should then be able to see your perceived superiority for the illusion it really is, entirely created by your ego. Continue down your list thoroughly and honestly, analysing and reconciling every single area where you believe yourself to be superior to others. Again, you have to be completely, utterly and totally honest with yourself in every respect, no matter how much it affects your feelings and in"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 609 particular your ego. Your ego will pr otest most emphatically at this scrutiny of the areas in which it revels in causing you to feel superior; simply disregard it and c ontinue with this important task; you ego will sooner or later have to accept it. Always remember; true progress si mply cannot be made, or true happiness, peace and harmony achi eved until you know yourself completely, regardless of how many lifetimes this process takes, and that transcending the ego is an integral and vital aspect of this process. While contemplating upon and analysing each item in your list, look at every single aspect as to exactly why you might feel superior in that particular area. It might not for example be something caused by your current circumstances, it might rather be something from your past such as a long held desire to be superior in that particular area, thus causing the ill usion you really are superior in that area. It might be a subconscious desire to be superior in that particular area that is already causing you to feel superior. Remember once again the extremely im portant truth that we all create our own reality , and you might well in these circumstances have already created the reality of superiority in t hat particular area of your life, in which case the reality will need to be converted in order to be compatible with your overall true reality. Each area where you feel superi or will be differ ent and be caused by different reasons from your pa st, present, or perceived future. It might have an emotional basis, it might be based on a deeply held desire or it might be based on j ealousy or on any one of a wide range of other such possibilities. Not until you have completely reconciled each and every ego induced item on your list, and rec ognised it for the ego generated illusion it really is, and above all resolved to completely reconcile each such item to the extent it no longer infl uences you or your life can you move on to the next it em on your list. Until you know beyond any doubt whatsoever you c an proceed without ever feeling"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 610 superior in that particular area again, then do not progress to the next item. You might find some items to be relatively easy to reconcile and others which are mu ch more difficult depending on the origin, reasons and strength of the ego in that particular area where you feel superior. Once you have fully and completely reconciled your entire ego list of where you felt superior and have seen each item for the illusion it really is, and determined never, ever , to feel superior in those areas again, you can then proceed to the next stage of this process. It should be noted first however that this is very much an ongoing process. If you ever find yourself feeling superior about anything at all then immediately write it down and reconcile it at the very first opportunity. The ego will not be at all happy at being deprived of its perceived superiorities and might cons tantly strive to replace them with more. Be constantly vigilant t herefore reconciling all feelings of superiority as they arise, and over time the ego will get the message and reach the realisation that creating any more superiorities in your life is futile. The next stage in tran scending the ego is to make use of your notebook or journal to list all of the situations in the past or present causing you to feel like a “mart yr”. Note down all of the exact circumstances surrounding your feelings of being a martyr, including whether each feeling is an isolated or an ongoing situation, and as to whether it is a particular situation, person or even thought that causes you to f eel like a martyr in these areas. These feelings might include for example feeling unfairly judged by people, feeling wrongl y treated, feeling mi sunderstood, feeling hopeless, feeling desperate, feeli ng overcome with burdens, feeling too many demands are being made of you, feeling completely innocent of all responsibility, feeling unappreciated, feeling burdened by problems you believe cannot be resolved and everything and anything else which makes you feel like a martyr. Also make detailed notes of who, if anyone, ha s made you angry and why, and indeed anything and everything you can possibly"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 611 think of associated with any situati on where you feel or felt like a martyr or generally feel or felt sorry for yourself. Again, as before, immediately add to your list as appropriate as and when they occur, any new instances of feeling sorry for yourself or feeling like a martyr. Also add to your list any such feelings you might recall from the past. All mart yr feelings from the past or present should be listed without any exceptions. For the next stage of this process, as with the previous list of feeling superior, put aside at le ast ten minutes each day where you can completely relax without be ing disturbed, and where you can analyse and reconcile your mart yr list. As before, analyse each situation with complete honesty, asking yourself why you felt sorry for yourself as you did, or felt like a martyr for that particular situation. Ask yourself; do you enj oy feeling sorry for yourself? Does it make you feel superior in any way? Do you feel people are more likely to take pity on you? Does it make you feel better or more able to handle the situation? Do you feel you will receive some sort of perceived benefit or reward for being a martyr? Do you believe feeling sorry for your self and making yourself suffer is noble in some way? Is feeling so rry for yourself an excuse for avoiding the responsibilities in y our life? Write down everything you can think of where feeling sorry for yourself or feeling like a martyr makes you feel different or specia l in any way whatsoever. Nothing must be omitted from your martyr list. For the next stage in this proce ss write a further list in your notebook or journal of how you would feel if it where not for the fact you feel like a martyr or feel so rry for yourself. Think very deeply about all of the positive effect s resulting from shedding these insidiously negative feelings. Consider all of the happiness you can bring into your life by focussing all of your Energy and emotions in a positive way that benefit s both yourself and ot hers. Make up your Mind to never feel sorry for yourself again. If you do catch yourself feeling like a martyr or feeling sorry for yourself in any way, immediatel y consult your notebook or journal"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 612 and remind yourself of how destruc tive, negative and futile your feelings really are. Most of all, t he very moment you start to feel like a martyr or otherwise feel sorry fo r yourself in any way, transmute those feelings immediately into positive, happy feel ings. Think of someone you love, feel how wonderful it would be to help someone in some way, and if you have the opportunity, actually do help someone or extend some tangible display of kindness. Think deeply about all those people in the world who really are worse off than yourself, and know to feel sorry for yo urself or feel like a martyr is fundamentally inappr opriate by comparison to all of those other people with genuine problems; feel deeply appreciative for your own life such as it is. Be constantly on your guard for feelings of being a ma rtyr or feeling sorry for yourself to creep up on you unawares. The ego will revel in catching you out whenever it can. Whenever you catch yourself becoming influenced by your ego by feeling sorry for yourself or feeling a martyr, immediately and without any hesitation replace those feelings with love, forgiv eness, gratefulness, hope, courage and a sense of responsibility. The next stage in transcending the ego is to deal with the issue of responsibility. The ego revels in st riving to avoid responsibility or passing responsibility ont o others; it must nev er be allowed to do so. For this exercise, take up your journal or notebook once again in a place where you can relax a nd will not be disturbed. Now think back as far as you possibly can and write down all of those times where you blamed others for your own actions. Write down all of those situations you have been confronted with where you refused to accept responsibility. Consider your daily lif e with complete honesty and write down all of those areas where you consistent ly seek to avoid or deny all responsibility. In compiling this list, as always you have to be totally honest with yourself; do not let your ego convince you it is acceptable not to take responsibilit y for some things; as we know,"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 613 we all create our own realities a nd accordingly we are all directly responsible for our own actions. Next write a further list of all of those situati ons where you actually did accept responsibility for your own actions. Write down how positive and empowered you felt at the time and afterwards. Write down all of the positive benefits di rectly arising from taking full responsibility in each of those si tuations. Write down the reasons you believe that actually caused y ou to take responsibility for your own actions in those particular cases and how you felt afterwards. What was your motivation? Why were you prepared to accept responsibility for those particular situations? Were you motivated by the desire to succeed, for example in anticipation of a tangible benefit? Were you motivated by the fear of something negative occurring in your life by not acc epting responsibility? Were you seeking to impress someone els e? In all of these cases ask yourself exactly how you succeeded in accepting responsibility and analyse and understand those successes fully. Finally, over the next few days, resolve to accept the fullest possible responsibility for absolutely everything in your life without exception. Do not to shy away from any situation where decisions need to be made and positive actions to be taken. Do not hesitate for a second; the very moment a situation arises requiring responsibility, accept that respon sibility there and then, gladly and unhesitatingly, taking all appropriat e actions to reconcile it. Make use of your notebook or journal to write down how you felt by accepting such responsibility. The sense of relief, empowerm ent, satisfaction and happiness in knowing that by accepting res ponsibility and taking action, you have created your own real ity in all of these si tuations. Enjoy your new freedom and resolve never, ever to avoid total responsibility for your own actions again in the future. The next aspect of ego needing to be addressed is that of always feeling busy, overworked, clu ttered and generally overwhelmed with everyday activities. As before, write down in y our journal or"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 614 notebook all those areas and aspects of your life where you feel you are always too busy, never hav e enough time, feel cluttered, and where your life is generally encroached upon by other people or circumstances. When your list is complete, set aside at least ten minutes each day in order to revi ew and reconcile your “always too busy” list. Consider as deeply and honestly as possible the reasons you feel like you do in these aspects of your life. Why exactly do you always feel so busy? Is it because you are genuinely busy? Is it perhaps due to a lack of organisat ion in your daily life? Or is it perhaps the fact you are not really too busy at all but still feel the need to be busy thereby allowing yourself to be convinced you really are busy? Perhaps you feel you should be busy in order to meet your perceived obligations at work or at home, or to impress your boss, spouse, or partner? Perhaps when you are not working you feel guilty? Why does your life and space feel cluttered? Is it actually cluttered or do you feel enclosed in some way? All of these questions need to be c onsidered in depth and with total and complete honesty. You will need to take a very close and sincere look at all relevant aspects of your life in order to determine the reality of your feelings and sit uation, and as to whether they are indeed really justified in any of the areas you have noted. Next ask yourself ho w you can simplify your life and become more efficient. If you are seeking to impress someone, or are feeling guilty, is it the ego causing th ese feelings? Ask yourself honestly why you are endeavouring to impress people; is it for some sort of perceived gain or to prevent yourself from feeling guilty? Are the people you are endeavouri ng to impress actually noticing and responding to you? Are they ever likely to respond? Are the people you are endeavouring to impre ss being unreasonable in their demands or expectations of you? If so it is time to talk frankly with these people and discuss the situation; a situation which must be resolved for your own peace of Mind and to suppress the ego in those particular areas of your life."},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 615 Next, review your daily activities in as much depth and detail as possible. Ask yourself how you can make better use of your time and become more efficient. What could you stop doing altogether that is unnecessary, or ask so meone else to do for you if appropriate? If you are making work for yourself out a sense of guilt, or endeavouring to impress someone for whatever reason, then resolve to stop making work for yourself and stay with the daily ongoing necessities of your job or housework. This does not imply simply doing the absolute minimum or not working to the best of your capacity and ability, but rather not overdoing these things for all the wrong reasons. Finally, and most importantly for th is particular aspect of the ego, review your circumstances and deci de exactly where your priorities should really and ideally be. Much of the day for many people is taken up in the pursuit of materialis m in all of its multiple aspects, which, as we now know, really is detrimental to true progress, peace and harmony in this life and future lives. Being a slave to materialism in order to maintain t he illusion of material wealth in order to satisfy yourself, your ma terial desires and demands of the ego generally and to impress other s, to “keep up appearances”, to do things because “it is the wa y things are done” will always inevitably lead to miser which t he ego will delight in accentuating, thereby causing you to always f eel busy, pressured, inadequate, cluttered and of course miserable. Remind yourself of the true purposes of this life; peace, harmony, happiness and health for yourself and those around you, and above all for true progress along the path back to our Divine Creator, The Source, God, which after all is the true and ultimate reason for being on Earth. Everyone is here to learn, equilibrate karma and evolve as an individual human being, not to conform to the expectations of others. Of course everyone needs suffici ent money, food and most basic possessions in order to live comfortably, and in peace and"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 616 harmony, but beyond that consider just how superfluous material possessions really are and how very littl e they really add to your life and progress. Consider how you can manage your life to encompass all of these factors and then resolve to manage your life accordingly. The ego will protest and might well cause you to feel concerned about what others are thinking of your life, actions and material possessions. Transcend and silence the ego; this is your own life and your own ascent on the path, and you must never, ever allow the ego or any other negative influence to prevail and therefore to slow or prev ent your own progress. Always keep in Mind that for ev ery life where progress was not made means returning to Earth again in order to repeat those lessons until fully learned. The imp lications therefor e of allowing the ego to maintain control as well as being influenced by materialism and the expectations of others are to accept a further full lifetime on Earth to repeat everything once agai n until the lessons are finally learned. The final task in transcending the ego is to take a very close look at those areas of your life or y our past where you have revelled in disaster in some way, whether it has happened to you or to others. Also, take an honest and hard look at your fantasies for self- destruction or the destruction of others. Put aside at least ten minutes each day in order to cons ider and write down in your journal or notebook all potential disasters, melodramas or misfortunes your Mind has flirted with over the years, involving yourself or others. Having written down all such sit uations, relax as completely as possible in a place where you wil l not be disturbed, and then, as realistically as possible, visualise y ourself actually in each of these situations one at a time. Do not pr ogress to the next situation until you have fully dealt with the cu rrent one. Become completely involved with the scenario making use of all senses of the imagination as realistically as possible. "},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 617 Next consider your true feelings about the situation. Why do you feel as you do? What r eal benefits could result from this situation? If it involves others, why would you wish to see them in that same situation? While considering thes e factors you must as always be totally and completely honest with yourself at all times. If the situation generates fear or suffering, ask yourself why your ego apparently wishes to subject you or someone else to this particular experience. What does y our ego really have to gain from this? How would it really add to your life? If this is a situation you wish on ot hers, ask yourself why you would wish to subject them to such a situation. Also, consider very carefully the karmic consequences upon yourself as a direct result of wishing these things to happen; remember that all negative thoughts as well as negative acti ons will create negative karma. Negative or destructive thoughts ar e equally negative or destructive causes, in turn resulting in the correspondingly negative or destructive effects for the originator of those thoughts, either in this life or a future life; there is quite simply no escape at all from the immutable Universal law of Cause and Effect of which karma is an integral aspect. If you wish some thing negative on others, it will return to you. If the thoughts or fantasies, di saster and misfortune involve yourself, ask yourself why you would wish to suffer this in your perceived future. Is it perhaps because you wish to be noticed? Is it perhaps a shout for help? Is it bec ause you really do have a self- destruction wish? All of these fact ors and situations must be considered and analysed very closely, and always with considerable honesty and sincerity. You must then know beyond all doubt these feeling are yet more situations where the ego is in control and driving you in this direction. Finally, you must reach the leve l of understanding required in order to dismiss these destructive, counter-productive, thoughts and fantasies, knowing them for what they really are, and never to allow them back into your Mind again. Such thoughts and fantasies can"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 618 only be destructive to yourself or others sooner or later. Always remember; everyone creates their own reality and therefore their own karma, and the thinking of destructive or negative thoughts or situations can only ultimately result in disaster, suffering and disharmony sooner or later. Never entertain these thoughts again; if the ego attempts to raise them in your Mind you mu st bring the ego back under control immediately. Ma intain only the purest thoughts of peace, harmony and Un conditional Love at all times, and in accordance with the Universal Law of Correspondence you will attract these things into your own reality and your life will be enhanced dramatically as a direct result. Transcending the ego is extremel y important as will now be apparent from the foregoing. By following these simple exercises for just a few minutes each day y ou will have taken a large and very valuable step in transcending the insidious influences of your ego, which will be of immense value both in your daily life and on your evolution and progress along the path. Always be vigilant. The ego does not like to be suppressed and controlled, and will do its best to catch you out whenever it can. It is important to recognise the acti vities of the ego and to react immediately it attempts to control you in any way. If you cannot deal with the demands of the ego at t he time, write everything down as soon as you possibly can and put time aside to process these demands, dealing with them perm anently and without any delay.  "},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 619 Chapter 104: Equilibrium of the Soul One of the most fundam ental aspects to genuine progress, as well as true peace, harmony and happiness in your life is not only to know yourself, but also to achieve full equilibrium of the Soul, the Astral body. Without such equilib rium true progress cannot and will not be made in your current life towards the true meaning of life, our ultimate and most sacred potent ial of perfection and Unity with our Divine Creator, The Source with God. True progress to, and within the inner spheres of life, t he ongoing destiny of all mankind, is therefore immediately dependa nt upon personal ennoblement. Ennoblement of the Soul will result in higher vibrations, and it is these vibrations that will largely influence the level of the Astral worlds and ultimately t he Spirit worlds in which a person will reside after physical death; your own place in “heaven”. Only when the Soul has been fully balanced and cleansed can the cycle of reincarnation be transcended, and the journey continue within the glories, splendours and magnificence of the i nner spheres of life and reality; the Mental planes of the Spirit worlds. Those who make the most sinc ere efforts towards ennoblement and perfection now will be the leader s of humanity on the path of the great ascent back to The S ource, The First Cause, back to God, and will be among the first to reach and enjoy the profound glories and splendours of the inner worlds; worlds far, far and away beyond the comprehension of Earthly man, indeed far beyond even the concepts Earthly man might hav e of “heaven”. Those who do not devote time and effort towards this important objective will find themselves occupying the lower to mid-levels of the Astral and Spirit worlds after passing on, and will need to continue to reincarnate on Earth time and a gain until ennoblem ent has finally been achieved; earthly lessons learned and karma equilibrated. This is not of course a race, but no time at all should be lost in the ascent to the inner spheres of rea lity, and ultimately back to God, thus fulfilling the tr ue meaning of life."},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 620 Ennoblement includes transcending the ego as practiced in the previous section and also includes complete balance of all personal characteristics. Ennoblement is no t, in and of itself an easy process and neither can it be; there can be no true progress without full realisation, effort and commitment. The process of ennoblement fundam entally involves two main stages; full recognition and acceptanc e of all imperfections, and the removal or conversion of thos e imperfections into the opposite noble characteristics. This is also a solution to the true meaning of “alchemy”, including the legends of the “philosophers stone” which most people will have heard of. Al chemy includes, and is analogous to the transmutation of base metals into Gold. This is symbolic and in turn is analogous to the tran smutation of base, course human characteristics into the gold of perfection and ennoblement. As previously menti oned, in order to progr ess with this most important task of ennoblement, it is absolutely fundamental to completely “know thyself” in every possible respect, and in the finest detail. Without this true pr ogress cannot be made. This might well prove to be a painful prop osition for many, as most people harbour aspects of themselves whic h, to greater or lesser extents they particularly dislike and find most unattractive. Nevertheless, absolutely every negative characte ristic, no matter how bad, small or seemingly insignificant, mu st all be realised, faced and transmuted. Of course, an equally important aspect of knowing yourself is also to recognise the positive, good and noble aspects of your Soul, characteristics that ca n and should be fully and joyfully embraced. To commence the important task of ennoblement two lists need to be composed in your journal or not ebook. One of these will be a list of all your negative or bad attributes and the other a list of all of your positive or good attributes, how ever large or small, significant or insignificant these might seem. "},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 621 Start by setting aside as much ti me as possible each day for this task in a place where you will not be disturbed. Re lax and consider very deeply and with considerabl e honesty all of your own shortcomings, your negative charac teristics, and write them all down in a list. You should not only list those negative traits and characteristics appearing in your lif e today, but also those that have ever appeared in your life in the past. Start by listing all of your cu rrent, easily recognisable negative attributes, however large or small, significant or insignificant these might seem. Think very deeply and li st absolutely everything in their finest variations and with comple te honesty. All of your negative attributes, shortcomings, failings, weaknesses and any other negative character traits should be recalled and noted down without any hesitation or reservation. Nothing whatsoever should remain hidden within your Soul, absolutely everything should be revealed and included in your list. Again, total honesty and sincerity is extremely important for this process; omitting negative attributes simply because you do not like a particular aspect of yourself wi ll defeat the objective and benefits of this exercise, and this will be reflected in your ongoing progress. All negative attributes will have to be faced and transmuted either in this lifetime or a future lifetime, so it is best to face this reality now. Having completed your initial list of existing negative attributes take yourself, in your Mind, gradually back in time, noting down all of your negative traits from your pas t. Place yourself in different situations and remember how you r eacted in those situations. If you reacted adversely then it mu st be noted down immediately. Continue this process until you hav e taken yourself as far back in time as you can remember. This process should not be hurried and might well take several weeks to complete thoroughly. Should another negative attribute not al ready on your list appear during your daily activities, note it down immediately before it leaves your Mind. This is very much an ongoi ng process and one that should"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 622 never be disregarded. Ideally you should be able to include at least one hundred items in your list of negative attributes. If your list has not yet reached a hundred or more such attributes it is well worthwhile continuing until your list does include at least one hundred items. Some people can list many hundreds of negative attributes in their finest details and variations. Again, never shy away from noting any negative attr ibutes in your journal or notebook, however negative, bad or painful t hey might seem to you. Every single negative attr ibute must be noted and faced up to without any exceptions; there is absolutely nothing whatsoever to be gained by deceiving yourself. Should you fail to list any partic ular negative attribute simply because you cannot face it, that particular negative characteristic might well be the one causing y ou particular problems, and failing to confront it will accordingly particularly restrict your progress and overall balance. Faci ng these realities might well be painful, but faced they must be if you are to tr uly know yourself and to make the progress you and every other member of the human race will have to achieve sooner or later; sooner is most preferable. It is most important to always remi nd yourself that no human being can progress without ongoing perfe ction and ennoblement. As previously discussed, the very reas on for individual existence is to evolve back to The Source, First C ause, God, to achieve a state of perfection approaching that of God until finally such perfection is achieved as to realise the possibilit y of Unity with God. This is the very reason why God originally sent an aspect of Him/Her Self, a particle of Divine Spirit that is yourself, to become an individual Spirit, endowed with the freewill to progress based upon your own existence, decisions and actions on the journey back to God, where you will ultimately be received as a perfected individual, potentially adding to the whole perfection of God. Only each individual can and must achieve this ultimate desti nation and reality for themselves, and must do so as the most sacred dut y for the gift of individual life,"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 623 an individual immortal Spirit, ma de in the true Spiritual image of God. Your notebook or journal is your own personal priv ate property and should never be shown to anyone else or left where someone else might find it and be tempted to read it. Keep it safely hidden away when not in use. Some people might have difficulty in determining which attributes can be considered to be negative; if in any doubt note them down anyway. There are literally thousands of po ssible negative characteristics, some of which might include for example; anger, thoughtlessness, laziness, irresponsibility, shyness, quick temper, hate, apathy, carelessness, defiance, vengeful ness, conceit, inconsistency, thoughtlessness, selfishness, hat e, jealousy, boastfulness, melancholy, being easily offended, wastefulness, acquiescence, judgemental, compulsive, voracity, addi ctions, constant thinking of or wanting sex, irritability, quarrelsomeness, immoderation, destructiveness, disinterest, intrans igence, shallowness, disdain, indifference, idleness, dishonesty , fickleness, passion for gossip, discrimination, materialism, argu mentativeness, disrespect, feeling low, obssesiveness, gambling, and much more. These are but a very few examples of possible negat ive attributes. It is for you to probe deeply into your Soul, past and present in order to reveal absolutely all negative attributes in their finest manifestations, nothing at all must be left lurking in your Soul and therefore omitted from your list. Balance is an extremely important aspect of knowing yourself, and therefore the next task , and an altogether more enj oyable one, is to list all of your positive attributes . Your positive attributes should be listed in a separate section of your notebook or journal. Positive and negative lists must be maintained separately, mirroring the dark and light sides or polarities of your Soul. Proceed in exactly the same way with listing your positive attributes as you"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 624 have already done for your negativ e attributes, noting absolutely every positive attribute you can thin k of from your past and present. Again, there are many thousands of possibilities for positive attributes and each and every person will be different. Examples of such positive attributes might include; respect, modesty, bravery, enthusiasm, responsibility, kindness, generosity, charitableness, humility, eagerness, diligence, opt imism, determination, endurance, moderation, lightness, absence of worry, thoroughness, efficiency, circumspection, cheerfulness, daring, courage, optimism, humbleness, joy, soberness, punct uality, prudence, forgiveness, contentment, tenderness, sympathet ic, proficiency, willpower, ardency, compassion, mercy, modesty, seriousness, trustfulness, tranquillity, creativeness, lucidity, watchfulness, conservationism, conscientiousness, firmness, endurance, sobriety, lovingness. Just as with the dark attributes it is most impor tant not to be tempted to exaggerate these attributes. Whereas with the negative list the temptation would be to deny some of the worst characteristics, the tendency with the positive list might be to glorify and glamourise your positive attri butes. Once again it cannot be stressed enough that total honesty is required at all times in your introspection and at all levels, both positive and negative, if true and enduring balance and harmony ar e to result. This is an exceedingly important exercise for progression and for personal peace and harmony, and must be per formed with absolute honesty at all times. The more negative a c haracteristic is, the more it needs to be dealt with, and should theref ore never, ever be ignored or overlooked. The next and most impor tant task is to deal robustly with all of your negative attributes, the objective being to eliminate or transmute every single negative attr ibute until only all your positive attributes remain. There are several ways in which this most important task may be effectively approac hed, either separately or in combination. Each person will find that a di fferent method or combination of methods will be effective depending on the individual, and also on"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 625 the characteristics of the negative trait to be addressed. Many will find some negative attributes are more easily dealt with than others depending on the effect currently exer ted by that particular attribute in daily life, and for how long it has been exerting its dark influences. We will now discuss three fundamental methods by which these negative attributes might be dealt with initially, and also kept away in the future.   "},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 626 Chapter 105: Autosuggestion Autosuggestion is an extremel y effective method of not only transmuting negative attributes into their opposite positive attributes but also for achieving anything in y our life relating to the Mind, or more specifically under the influence of your subconscious Mind. Very damaging habits such as smok ing tobacco, drinking alcohol or indulgence in any other Mind-alteri ng or addictive substances, over- eating, over-indulgence in sex or any other ph ysical activity would fit into this cat egory for example. As we already know, everything in the Universe has its polar opposites and human characterist ics are no exception. These characteristics are not always di rect opposites, but in accordance with the Law of Polarity are degrees of the same thing along the same polar axis, and where there is a point along that axis where negative human attributes, notably those that prevent progress, become positive human attributes, those that fac ilitate progress. Consciousness is an extremely important example of this, with the subconscious being the polar oppos ite of waking Consciousness while being degrees of the same thing. The subconscious is also the orig in of every unwelcome thought, causing negative attributes to appear and to accordingly influence normal waking Consciousness includ ing all weaknesses, passions and other detrimental influences. It is the subconscious Mind that might for example encourage people to smoke tobacco, drink alc ohol, eat too much food and to generally over-indulge in many ot her perceived pleasures of the physical senses. These and all sim ilar negative attributes are only considered to be pleasurable under the influence of the subconscious Mind. This equally applies to all negative attributes and human characteristics. The origin and driving force behind"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 627 everything people do not want to do or should not be doing is therefore the subconscious Mind. The subconscious Mind however c an not only be tamed and its effects neutralised or transmuted, but can also be trained to realise only our most positive wishes and obj ectives. It is clear therefore that the subconscious Mind should ultimately and most rightly be considered to be our friend, but on ly after it has been brought under complete control of the consci ous Mind by means of the will. Aligning the conscious and subcon scious Mind at all levels by means of focus, will and concent ration must ther efore be regarded as a top priority, the benefit s of which will be profound. In the physical world the subconscious Mind requires space and time in order to exert its influenc e. If however time and space are withdrawn from the sphere of the subconscious Mind it can no longer operate effectively and theref ore exert its influence within the physical world. The way to influence the subconscious Mind therefore and to bring it under the full control of the will is to disengage it from space and time where it cannot influence the physical aspects of the Mind, and where it can then be favourably influenced in the direction of the desired positive attributes. This is exactly the same reason as to why manifestation, healing, Astral projection and many other such exercises are so effective just after awaking and just before sleep. Contact with the subconscious Mind at these times is much closer than during normal waking Consciousness, and accordingly the subconscious Mind is much more conducive to acc epting the will of the conscious Mind. The withdrawal of space and time from the sphere of the subconscious Mind is therefore the most effective time to utilise autosuggestion in order to remove negative characteristics or to transmute them into their polar opposite positive characteristics. Without this withdrawing of spac e and time, whichever method is used to impress upon the subconscious a particular desire, for"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 628 example to avoid smoking tobacco, or drinking alcohol, or an over- indulgence in food, the subconscious Mind would have all the time it requires in order to place obsta cles in the way of the objective and to thereby generate and perpet uate the adverse desires. If for example you decided to st op smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, eating particular foods or to cease any other negativ habit you wish to remove from your life, and intend to start doing so from a particular time the following day , the subconscious Mind then has all the time it needs in order to place obstacles before you. The subconscious will form all sorts of reasons why you should not cease smoking, should not ce ase drinking alcohol, should not cease consuming a particular f ood or eating excessively, and will generate physical urges in the form of passions, cravings and other physical and psychological effects in order to support its actions. Unfortunately in many of these cases the subconscious Mind will prevail, particularly where a per son has weak or under-developed willpower, concentration, and general self-control. As previously mentioned, the mo st effective times to employ autosuggestion are at night just before going to sleep, and first thing in the morning just after awaking but before arising. At these times the Mind is more tuned into the inner spheres of Consciousness where space and time do not exist, and therefore the subconscious Mind cannot exert its influences to the same extent as it can during full waking Consciousness within the sphere of space and time. During these times the conscious and subconscious Mind will be much more coordinated. The use of autosuggestion involves the repetition of a short phrase stating the desired objectives. The construction of this phrase is extremely important for success and should, as with affirmations which function in a very similar wa y, always be stated in the present tense as if already a co mplete reality. For exam ple it is incorrect to state, “I will stop smoking” or, “I will stop drinking”, or “I will no longer over-indulge in food”. Stat ements phrased in this way will merely serve to impress upon your subconscious Mind the fact that"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 629 you are already a smoker , or a drinker, or eat too much, and it will further exert its influence accord ingly, thereby perpetuating the problem rather than eradicating it. As with affirmations, the correct phrase must be in the form: “ I am a non-smoker”, or “ I am a non-drinker, ” or “ I eat healthily ”, or alternatively, “ I have no desire to smoke”, or “ I have no desire to drink, ” or “ I have no desire to eat very much ” and so on. As can be observed from these examples, the phrase is being impressed upon the subconscious Mind in the present t ense as if it is already a complete reality, and not as a request or statement of intent in the future tense. The importance of formulating the correct phrases for autosuggestion is most crucial for success. As we have already noted, the most effective times for the practice of autosuggestion are just before sleep at night and just after waking in the morning where the conscious Mind has largely been withdrawn from the influence of t he subconscious Mind, and before therefore space and time are exer ting their maximum influence. For this very reason it is extremely unwise to go to sleep at night with negative thoughts, concerns, stress, sorrow, or worries on your Mind. These negative thoughts will be ta ken straight into the sleep state, to an inner state of Consciousness beyond space and time and will subsequently adv ersely influence the subconscious Mind. This will in turn accentuat e and perpetuate these negativities causing them to manifest more profoundly in your waking physical Consciousness and reality, subsequently negatively experientially affecting the peace and harmony of your life. It is extremely important therefore that all negative thoughts should be totally dismissed before sleep time, and r eplaced only with the most harmonious thoughts including thoughts of complete, total, absolute success, health and peace. Autosuggestion can also be practi ced if waking up temporarily during the night, this being a ve ry effective time as the"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 630 subconscious is still most suscept ible to be influenced, being much more connected at these times with the inner spheres of reality, beyond the influence of space and time. Autosuggestion also can be performed at any time of the day , but will be less effective from a normal waking state. If autosuggesti on is to be carried out during the day, a state of deep physical relaxation and concentration would be required for significant su ccess. It is nevertheless most worthwhile during the waking day to be diligent for any manifestation of a negative attribute you are seeking to suppress, and to firmly suppress it at that moment and without hes itation. This is where single Mindedness of t hought is a most valuable ability together with the concentration and willpower to act on those thoughts. It is also a very good idea to rep eat your autosuggestion statement as an affirmation whenever possible. These all help to reinforce whatever it is you are impressing upon your subconscious Mind, in turn being compelled to take action in the same direction. The actual practice of autosugges tion is very straightforward indeed. Having formulated a specific objective in the form of an affirmative phrase in the present tense, simply repeat the phrase continuously as you drift off to sl eep, the more times the phrase is repeated the more effective it will be, and the sooner it will manifest into your reality. The autosuggestion affirmation you choose should wherever possible ideally be formu lated to transmute any of your negative attributes into their pol ar opposites. For example, instead of, “ I am not thoughtless towards others ”, it would be better to affirm, “I am always very t houghtful towards others ”. In this way rather than removing a lack of th oughtfulness you are transmuting it into its positive attribute of affirmative thoughtfulness. The effectiveness of autosuggestion can be greatly enhanced considerably if it is accompanied by a direct physical action that helps to reinforce the suggestion on the subconscious Mind. An excellent and very effective method of doing this is to obtain a good length of fine string, cord, yarn or similar, and then to tie a knot"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 631 every five centimetres along its ent ire length. The string, yarn or cord should be long enough to contain at least fifty of these knots, and so a total length of two hundred and sixty centimetres, accounting for five centimetres free at each end would be ideal. To proceed, hold one end of t he length of string between two fingers of one hand, and then ev ery time you repeat your autosuggestion statement pull the string until you feel one knot pass through your finger s. You will know that after you have pulled every knot through your fingers you will have repeated your autosuggestion statement fifty times which should be the objective. Should you drift off to sleep du ring this process don’t worry. The purpose will have been fulfilled in t hat you will take your suggestion with you from the waking state to t he sleep state where it will have its effect on your subconscious Mind beyond the influence of space and time. Proceeding in this way you ca n progress through your list of negative attributes and either er adicate them completely or transmute them into their polar opposite positive attributes as appropriate. It is very important indeed however to not progress to the next autosuggestion until the pr evious one has been fully dealt with. If you rush this process and fail to transmute a particular characteristic, then the subcon scious Mind will be raise the characteristic again, often when you least expect it. So it is extremely important to be totally honest with yourse lf and know beyond doubt that each negative characteristic has been fully transmuted into its polar opposite before progressing with the next. As with affirmations it is extremely important to always state autosuggestion phrases knowing beyond doubt they have already become an absolute realit y, and to feel the intense gratitude as a result. It is not very effective at all to merely state the phrase mechanically over and over again wit hout meaning or emotion, it is rather necessary to repeat th e autosuggestion with as much sincerity, and with as much em otion and gratitude as you can"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 632 summon, above all knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever in your Mind that the objective of your phrase has already completely manifested into your physical, ex periential reality. There should be absolutely no doubts in your Mind whatsoever about this. As previously mentioned, never, ev er move onto the next negative attribute on your list until the pr evious one has been totally and completely dealt with first, not only believing it has been dealt with but when it also appears in your daily life as the desired positive attribute, or a complete lack of a previous negative attribute. It might well be worthwhile sorting your list into an order of most negative to least negative attribut es or the other way around. You accordingly have a choice as to whether to deal with the most negative attributes or the least negat ive attributes first. This is a matter of personal preference, but for some people it might be preferable to commence with the leas t negative attributes, as these will be the simplest and quickest to eradicate or to transmute. This choice also largely depends on t he degree of willpow er you have at your disposal. If you have strong willpower it is generally better to start with the most difficult and pervasive attributes, the attributes that are causing you the most physical issues, and then to work your way through to the least pervasive negative attributes. In this way considerable progress can be made in the least amount of time. If you do not yet have strongly develo ped willpower at your disposal it is better to start with the least negative attributes and to work your way to the most negative attributes. In this way each success will provide you with the enc ouragement to deal with the next and more difficult ones. This in and of itse lf is an excellent exercise in strengthening willpower. This entire process of ennoblement of the Soul, by eliminating all negative attributes, might take many months or even years to fully accomplish, but it is advisable not to stop until every single negative characteristic has been completely dealt with, no matte r how long it"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 633 takes. The benefits in daily li fe and ongoing progression on the sacred path back to The Source, The First Cause, God will be profound, and indeed as already mentioned, true progression cannot be achieved otherwise, wit h the cycle of reincarnation continuing until the necessary level of per fection, progress and evolution has been attained. Remember; progression is progressi on to the true “heaven worlds”, the worlds of pure Spirit beyond the illusions of the physical and Astral worlds and there corresponding bodies of Energy. Only true evolution and true ennobl ement can achieve this; holding to a belief system, attending a church or a ccepting Jesus as your saviour alone will not result in significant if any progress. Every single person without any exceptions wil l have to go through the process of ennoblement of the Soul on the pat h to perfection at some time during their ongoing evolution as an immortal Spiritual being, a true son or daughter of God Who is absol ute perfection, whether it is during this life, the next life or many lifetimes from now. The next method of eradicating negative characteristics is by means of meditation. We have al ready discussed the process of meditation and achieving an expanded state of conscious awareness through vacancy of Mind, thus becoming aware of the inner Energy spheres of reality. While in a state of meditation thought processes are also enhanced dramatically due to a slowing of brainwave frequencies. A deep medi tative state ca n therefore be used to consider negative characte ristics deeply, their affect on your life and the effect on all t hose around you. You might well receive inspiration and guidance from your Higher-Self, a Spirit guide or other inne r beings, especially if you request such assistance with complete sincer ity and with much meaning and emotion as possible. Consider deeply how in sidious your negative a ttributes really are and how they are negatively impacting your own life, the lives of those around you, as well as most importantly your own onward evolution. Meditate deeply on how much better your life would be,"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 634 not only without being burdened by t hese negative attributes, but also if they were the polar o pposite positive attributes. Place yourself with your imagination into the resulting state of peace and harmony, knowing beyond doubt you are also making progress on the path, and therefore with y our own personal evolution. Finally and most importantly, resolve to actually take positive action in your daily life in order to r ealise these most profound benefits, taking all necessary actions to transmute all of your negative characteristics into their positive polar opposite characteristics once and for all. Should you ever find yourself falling foul of a negative characteristic, stop yourself right there and then, sit down, relax and recall your meditations. Resolve to learn from experience and even welcome any negative thought or experience as an opportunity to transmute any such attribute in to its polar opposite positive attribute, and to see, enjoy and know how much better your life and the life of those around you will be as a direct result of your commitment. The final method of eradica ting and transmuting negative characteristics is by means of diligence, willpower and circumspection during your daily life. This involves recognising and unhesitatingly dealing with any negative attributes the instant they arise. Should any negative attribut e appear in your waking reality it is absolutely vital to deal with it robustly right there and then using the sheer power of your will. Yo u must always be totally honest with yourself at all times keeping in Mind the following three important requirements: Diligence: to instantly recogni se the appearance of any negative trait. Circumspection: in being totally honest with yourself, always accepting the existence of a negat ive trait to be d ealt with without question."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 635 Willpower: to immediately deal with the negative trait, either by eradicating it or by transmuting it into its polar opposite positive characteristic. Never be caught unawares by your negative characteristics which can be insidious; the subconsciou s Mind will revel in catching you out and causing you to do or think something you might later regret. All appearances of negative charac teristics must be recognised, resolved and dealt with instantly with no exceptions. This method calls for considerable concentrati on, self-awareness and willpower, but which attributes will also be va luable generally, both for daily life and for personal evolution. It might well be beneficial to concurr ently integrate all three of the forgoing methods of ennob lement into your lif e, in which case progress and success will almost certainly be correspondingly quicker and more effective. Finally, and again this simply ca nnot be overemphasised such is its greatest importance for everyone; the complete process of ennoblement might well take many m onths or even years to fully accomplish. This is not a race however and it should never be perceives as such; simply continue to persevere for as long as it takes for success, always enjoying the current benefits in your life and the life of those around you, knowing beyond doubt that you are making true and real progress as an immortal Spiritual being. You have a physical lifetime ahead in which to accomplish this important task, a major reason you made the decision to return to Earth at all, and should this lifetim e not prove to be sufficient then you may continue during your nex t lifetime. The sooner true progress can be made, the happier, mo re joyful and fulfilling your life will be, and the near er you will be finally transcending the cycle of reincarnation on Earth that you can experience the joys of life as a Spiritual being within Spiritual realms, the glories of which are beyond the comprehension of most people on Earth. It is the destiny of every single human bei ng to experience the glories, joy"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 636 and Unconditional Love of the Spirit worlds on the way back to The Source, The First Cause, God, the potential to reunite with Whom is the true meaning of life, and our ultimate reality.   "},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 637 Chapter 106: Dreams When we achieve a certain state of sleep, normally at night, our Astral Body, our Soul, together with our integrated immortal Spirit actually leaves our physical body. During this time Universal Energy is received in order to replace the Energy used during the activities of the previous day, and also to increase reserves of Energy for the day ahead. This is one reason why we normally awaken in the morning feeling comp letely refreshed. During this time our Astral and Mental bodies interact directly with the inner spheres of reality. This process can be considered to be the same as Astral Projection, the major difference being there is usually no conscious awareness of the ex perience actually occurring. With the normal sleep process both the Mind and the body are asleep and there is no conscious awareness. However, with Astral Projection, the body is asleep bu t the Mind, conscious awareness remains fully awake. Astral Projec tion is therefore as natural as sleeping and dreaming an d is the reason why dreams are such a natural aspect of these sl eep time Astral Projections. Although the Astral Body retains full awareness and control during these night-time unconscious travel s within the Astral realms, the physical level of Consciousness is in a state of deep sleep. In the case of light or interrupted sleep the level Consciousness is such that the Astral Body is content to simply recharge it self with Energy with only a low level interaction with the Astral world, corresponding to the area the personal psyche. At other times the Astral Body will engage in full interaction with the As tral worlds result ing in vivid or Lucid Dreams. There are also several interim st ates of Consciousness where for example the Astral Body, the Soul, will travel to the level of the Astral planes corresponding to the collective human Consciousness of the sleep state, and interact with other people in a sort of collective fantasy land. Normal low-level dreaming takes place at the lowest level of the Energy c ontinuum, just below that of the"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 638 human group Consciousness and in the area of the personal Consciousness sometimes known as the psyche. Here the unconscious Mind will create its own scenarios within the Astral Ether, often based upon waking thought s, and in particular the last thoughts on the Mind before drifti ng off to sleep, appearing as dreams of varying intensities. This is another reason why it is ex tremely important to take only the most positive, peaceful, harmoni ous thoughts to sleep with you. Should you carry inharmonious, negat ive or chaotic states to bed and into your sleep state, these wil l be reflected in your dreams and be subsequently carried into your normal waking state the next morning. During particularly light sl eep the level of interaction might only be at the level of the personal subconscious Mind in which case dreams will reflect the actions and aspirations of the subconscious Mind. This is still well worth keeping in Mind. There are many states of dream experi ence and recollection varying from no recollection whatsoever to a st ate known as “Lucid Dreaming”, where not only is everything extr emely vivid and real, because in fact it is indeed very real, but the lucidity aspect arises when a person becomes fully aware of the fact they are dreaming and can then assume full control over the dream. In this state the Lucid Dreamer can create any scenario they wish simply by means of the imagination, the same primary method of creation as when consciously living in the inner spheres of life and reality. Lucid Dreaming is an ability that can be learned, and is used by people for such purposes as enter tainment, creating and living within their wildest fantasies and fo r healing. Lucid Dreaming is also valuable for facing up to and def eating waking fears and phobias. For example, a person who has a fear of spiders or any other creatures can create dreamscapes containing these creatures and then face them within the dream . In this way phobias and other problems can be faced and conquer ed within the psyche, later taking the resulting confidence in t hese situations into the waking world."},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 639 Many people have experienced a state known as “waking paralysis” or “catalepsy”. This usually hap pens immediately upon waking in the morning whereby a person finds it very difficult or even impossible to move any part of th e physical body. This is due to the fact that the Astral an d Mental bodies have not yet fully returned to the physical body, and t herefore the centre of conscious awareness and control still resi des within the Astral Body. Any attempt therefore to move any part of t he physical body will not usually succeed. There also is another possibility t hat might occur in conjunction with episodes of waking paralysis or be separate from it, and that is “seeing” through closed eyelids; that is to say the physical eyes are fully closed, and yet a person can st ill vividly see their surroundings as if the physical eyes are fully open. This is a much more common occurrence than people realise, and is again due to the fact that the Astral and Mental bodies have not yet at that stage completely reunited with the physical body, being slightly out of phase with it. This situation is known as “Astral si ght”, due to the fact that “vision” is being received through the Energy of Astral senses directly rather than through the physical eyes. During this time the centre of vision is still based in the Etheric plan e, and therefor e the vision or impression of viewing the surr oundings is actually an Etheric reflection of the physical surroundings rather than the actual physical surroundings. During these situations it is sometimes possible to see other beings such as deceased people or being s from the Astral worlds. Deceased relatives are sometimes seen in these circumstances for example. If this happens do not panic; they usually mean you no harm whatsoever, and in any case simply cannot harm you; the best thing to do is to simply observe without any emotion and communicate if appropriate. To interrupt waking paralysis and As tral sight it is necessary to cause your Astral and M ental bodies to rejoin your physical body by willing yourself to become fully awak e. If this does not work moving"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 640 one of your big toes often to causes the physical body to awaken. These episodes do not last long and are nothing at all to be alarmed about, especially now you know why they happen; it is a completely natural process invo lving your physical and subtle bodies, and state of conscious awareness. Those who practice out of body experiences will often welcom e such a state of catalepsy as an ideal state to completely projec t from the physical body in order to enjoy an out of body experience, often then projecting inwards to the Astral worlds. One extremely useful aspect of As tral travel during deep sleep is the possibility of receiving valu able teachings and other information from inner beings, sometimes by a ttending places known as “Spirit schools” where valuable lessons ar e learned, often about Spiritual matters either in general terms, or relating specifically to the individual person attending the school. Although such lessons are not usually remembered in the ph ysical memory in the morning after waking, they are neverthel ess firmly and permanently stored in the memory of the inner bodi es of the causal spheres to be recalled whenever the time and circumstances are appropriate. These are all ongoing aspects of Spiritual progression. Just as learning lessons at physical school and during life generally is vital for progression in the physical world, so too are they in the Astral and Mental worlds. At ot her times during sleep ti me Astral travels it is quite possible to meet deceased relatives or friends or to simply explore the Astral worlds. Recent ly deceased relatives frequently make use of the dream state of loved ones in order to make contact and provide assurances of t heir presence, well-being and happiness. One of the most important aspects of interaction with the inner spheres during sleep time is in receiving valuable information relevant to waking life. This information might also be in the form of warnings, for example of drinking or smoking, or of other possible sources of danger."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 641 Sometimes dreams can be “pre-cogniti ve”, in other words a vision of the future whereby you view a situation you might wish to avoid by altering the course of your future. This information received during sleep time can arrive in many different forms varying from highly graphical dreams involv ing various scenarios through to much more symbolic imagery that might require interpreting. Whatever the form of information re ceived in dreams it is a most valuable ability to be able to fully recall dreams in the morning soon after waking, and to subsequently analyse them. Dream recollection is also very us eful in developing the abilities of Astral Projection. You might well be recalling anything from Astral travels including meetings wit h deceased people, information received from these people and from other beings, pre-cognitions, all the way through to symbol s and other imagery requiring interpretation. In lower level dreams where deep sleep was not involved you might be recallin g dreams generated by your own subconscious Mind, again most useful in interpreting the actions of your subconscious Mind or psyche, and also in providing clues as to what influences your subconscious Mind is seeking to exert over you. Examining the subconscious is also valuable in determining the results and progress of the process of ennoblement as discussed in the previous section. Recalling dreams is clearly therefore a most valuable and most worthwhile ongoing exercise. An additional benefit of dream recall is that your dreams will become pr ogressively more vivid, and more interactive. "},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 642 Chapter 107: The Dream Journal The process of dream recall is very straightforward indeed, involving the maintenance of a dr eam journal that can be in the form of a diary or a notebook, or indeed in any other suitable and convenient form. Whichever you c hoose it is most advisable to obtain the largest possible book in order to accommodate the most detailed entries; dreams can often be very long and intricate, involving many different aspects, and it is important to note down as much detail as possible. A large blank notebook is the most flexible for this purpose as you can simply place the date at the top of each entry and write as much as you need to without bei ng restricted for space. The ideal arrangement for a dream diary is to use a large notebook, placing your dream recollections on the left side pages and the corresponding notes and interpretati ons on the right side pages, thereby keeping everything in cont ext for easy future reference. Each pair of pages will therefore be dated and headed “Dream recollections” on each left side page, and “Dream analysis” on the corresponding right side page. Arranged in this way everything you write is maintained in complete context, and will always make sense when reviewed in the future. Before going to sleep it is an excelle nt idea to get into the habit of repeating an affirmation such as: “I always have total recollection of my dreams when I awake” . This will impress upon y our subconscious Mind the fact that you are to remember your dreams afte r you awake, and soon your subconscious Mind will exert its influence accordingly. Your dream journal must always be kept easily available next to your bed with a pen to write with. As soon as you awake, either in the morning or during the night, or after a nap, immediately and without any hesitation recall your dreams. Write down everything"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 643 you can remember of your dream or dreams, not leaving out even the very slightest detail. Often it is the smallest details that have the most significance. This should become a daily habit from the very moment you awake. You will quickl y find that recalling your dreams will become progressively easier and more automatic as time goes by, and the action of recalling and writing down your dreams will become a welcome habit. As more time progresses, you will very likely find your dreams becoming pr ogressively more vivid, and sometimes you might even start to enjoy fully interactive and controllable Lucid Dreams, all as a direct result of maintaining your dream journal. During the day put aside some time to analyse your dreams of the night before. It is best to do this while relaxing completely in a place where you will not be disturbed. Those who have advanced to the stage of the ability of deep meditation will fi nd it particularly beneficial to consider the meaning of dreams while meditating, especially where the dr eams are symbolic and further interpretation is necessary. First of all, look at each in dividual dream as a whole and understand its meaning. Sometimes the dream will have no particular meaning being simply a scenario generated by the subconscious Mind, or a fantasy in which you became involved within the Astral spheres. It is also very important therefore not to attach meanings to dreams that might not exist at all. This all takes practice, but soon you will begin to differentiate the meaningful dreams from the fantas ies, and indeed very often even a fantasy has a symbolic meaning. For exampl e, a dream involving a fantasy scenario of being at sea in a luxury liner might represent a deeply embedded desire to go on a world cruise. As with all types of introspection and self-analysis it is extremely important to be totally and comple tely honest about this process and not to convince yourself of sc enarios that really do not exist. Compare each dream with your curr ent life, your aspirations, including all problems, hopes and wo rries, and see if there are any"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 644 similarities. If there are similarities write them all down and determine what the dream is saying about your life or any particular aspect of your life. If you are able to determine a definitive message within the dream, then you should follow the guidance contained within the message straightaway if appropriate to do so. Dreams are a very important mode of receiving messages from the inner spheres of reality or even from your Higher-Self. If you are not immediately able to determine a lin k between your dream and your life as it is at the current time , then see how the dream might be related to your future aspirati ons. If your dream has no seeming relevance to the past, present or future as relates to Earth time, then you should keep the possible message conveyed by your dream in Mind, and remain diligent as you go progress your daily affairs for circumstances appearing wh ich might be relevant to your dream. Remember, dreams often originate within the inner spheres of life and reality beyond the confines of space and time, where the past, present and future relative to the physical world all exist concurrently in the “Eternal Now”. Your dream might therefore be te lling you something about your future, possibly even your immedi ate future. The most powerful and therefore important me ssages are often delivered by recurring dreams; dreams which have the same theme for more than one night, and it is within these dr eams where particular attention should be focused. Sometimes dreams can represent a whole series of messages that will need breaking down into sect ions in order to analyse the meaning of each section effectively. Again it is important to note that not every dream has a parti cular meaning, but in order to determine which dreams do have a m eaning, no dream or aspect of a dream should be overlooked. The aspect you might choose to overlook might be the very aspect of the dream containing a particularly important message."},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 645 Again, it is also important to remember that dreams can be highly symbolic and not contain specific details that are readily apparent for what they really are. An example of this might for example be where you are experiencing a se ries of dreams containing blockages; blocked pipes, blocked sinks, blocked appliances and so on. These blockages might we ll symbolically represent an Energy blockage in your life at eit her a physical or emotional level. You might for example have a blo ckage about going to see your doctor about a medical condition that is causing you some concern. It might be a blockage at the emot ional level where for example you are intentionally dela ying contacting or s eeing someone about an important matter. It might be a bloc kage at the ment al level where you are having problems with th inking about certain things, concentration, motivation and so on. Some symbols might appear in dreams in much more subtle ways such as particular shapes, sounds or smells; all of this sym bolic imagery is meaningful, and accordingly well worth the time to fully interpret and to understand. The value of dream recollection c an be most profound as may be clearly seen from the foregoing, and is therefore a mo st worthwhile exercise. Messages are continuously being delivered by everyone ranging from your Higher-Self, from all levels of beings in the inner spheres of life and reality incl uding human beings, and also from your subconscious Mind, all of w hom often use dreams as just one of many means of delivering im portant messages often requiring urgent attention. As you pr ogress however and pursue the exercises detailed in this book y ou will find that messages can be delivered more directly into yo ur waking Consciousness at any time, particularly during meditation, and even during full waking Consciousness by means of impre ssions, inspiration, and in the inner voice. "},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 646 Chapter 108: The Inner Voice The inner voice, an ex tremely valuable and important source of infinite wisdom and guidance in lif e is unfortunately unrecognised, ignored and suppressed by many peop le, very often to their very considerable detriment. The origin of the inner voice is usually the Higher-Self, that aspect of our Being that is truly Divine, being our direct connection with The Divine, The Source, God. The Higher-Self has access to the infi nite Universe in all spheres of life and reality beyond space and time as well as every aspect of your existence, including past, present and future physical lives relative to the Earth concept of time. The Higher-Self is most important, both in day to day lif e and for the ongoing journey along the path back to God, constantly advising, guiding, prompting, inspiring, and alerting whenever appropriate. The Higher-Self manifests in the individual Consciousness as the “inner voice” which can be “heard” by anyone who listens and recognises it for what it really is. Your Higher-Self is sublime; it does not have any particular agenda beyond your ongoing well- being, and is completely incapabl e of misleading or providing incorrect guidance. The Higher-Self is ultimately concerned with your smooth, ongoing journey al ong the sacred path, the ascent back to The Source, The First Cause, God from whence we all originated, and is completely devot ed to that most sacred task. The Higher-Self can and should always be totally trusted. The inner voice of the Higher-Self is constantly “talking” to you. It is not always a loud voice “shouting” withinin your Consciousness, but rather a much more subtle voice that only becomes really apparent when you actually listen for it, and l earn to recognise it for what it really is. The more you listen and recognise the inner voice, always respecting and taking heed of its wisdom and guidance, the more apparent it will become wit hin your Consciousne ss, and the more it will become an important source of guidance, intuition and inspiration in your life."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 647 Listening to your inner voice and consulting with your Higher-Self is one of the keys to a smooth, ha rmonious progression through all physical lives, and onwards through the inner spheres of life and reality on the relentless and mo st sacred path back to God. Everyone experiences the guidance of the inner voice from time to time. If you are about to make a decision or do something in particular you might suddenly receiv e a “feeling”, or “hear” the voice in your head saying, “yes, do this immediately”, or “no, don’t do that”. If the situation is particularly important or can have a profound affect on your life the Higher-Self c an make itself k nown even more strongly by means of other sensat ions, for example a sensation in the stomach often known as a “s inking feeling” if something adverse is about to happen in your life. This “sin king feeling” in the stomach actually originates from the solar plexus chakra in the region of your navel which is c onnected directly to the Universe, which is why particularly strong mess ages are felt in that region of your body. If you ever experience that “sinking feeling” in the navel area of your stomach before maki ng a decision or doing something in particular, then stop, don’t do it, either delay what you intended to do until you have had time to c onsider the consequences more deeply, or preferably do not do it at all. Most messages from the Higher-Self are more subtle, arriving in a variety of ways, often as that little voice in your head or sometimes simply as a feeling, impression, in spiration, intuition or idea. The Higher-Self of course does not only warn about potentially negative situations but is also a most valuable source of encouragement for positive situations. Very often for example when you are considering doing something potent ially important you will often know beyond any doubts it is exactly the right thing to do. Again, such knowing will arrive either by means of impressions, intuition, or the little voice in your head providing encouragement, assurance and the confidence you need to proceed. Many people might regard “voices in the head” as unnatural or even a sign of psychiatric problems, but this is only due to psychological conditioning in physi cal life and a lack of experience"},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 648 and understanding as to the true nature and import ance of the Higher-Self, and of the communications and guidance we are all constantly receiving from the i nner realms of life and reality. Whenever the Higher-Self communica tes by means of the little voice, it is in fact a telepathi c communication between your lower and Higher-Selves in the same way that telepathy is possible between different beings, including people. The little voice should therefore never, ever be suppressed or shut out as being unnatural, unwelcome or undesirable in any way; to do so would be to cut off your most valuable and reliabl e source of guidance through your lives. Those who are vigilant to, rec ognise and act immediately on the guidance of the little voice of the Higher-Self will enjoy a considerably smoother, peaceful and harmonious journey through life, and without the probl ems that will inevitabl y be experienced by those who choose to shut out the Higher-Self. Those who choose to ignore the inner voice usually do so to their own detriment. Ask yourself this; how many times ha ve you ignored the whispers of your inner voice, or the impressi ons, inspiration or intuition you received, perhaps as a sinking f eeling in the st omach, and later regretted it, sometimes deeply? You instinctively knew at the time that it was the right or wrong thing to do but yet you went ahead and did it anyway and came to regret it. This happens to very many people all the time, but alas most people to their detriment fail learn from their own negative experiences. Very often it is the ego that has the upper hand and drives people on to doing all manner of things for purely egotistical reasons, and the ego, working with the subconscious, will do its very best to silence the guidance of the inner voice in order to get its own way. It should absolutely clear by now t hen that your Highe r-Self is your very greatest friend, ally and sour ce of Divine guidance. It is a Divine aspect of yourself and can therefore be trust ed above all. Of course it must be pointed out t hat there are ot her Divine beings within the inner sphere s of life and reality who also have your absolute best interests to heart, including high Spiritual"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 649 intelligences, Spirit guides, Guardi an Angel and many others, all of whom should always be respected, and never overlooked or disregarded. It is clearly worth every possible effort to create the strongest possible links with the Higher-Self and to make the Higher-Self your best and most trusted friend and s ource of guidance. There are many ways of accomplishing this. Fi rst and foremost it is extremely important to learn to recognise the inner voice and therefore the promptings of the Higher-Self. Whenever you are about to make an important decision or take an im portant action, stop for a moment and listen to your inner voice. Be vigilant for any intuition, inspiration, impressions or any other feelings you might receive which will be unmistakable for what they are. This should be very straightforward indeed for those who have followed the control of thought exercises earlier in this se ction and therefore have a clear and focussed Mind uncluttered by hundreds of random thoughts. It is when the Mind is completely silent and focussed that the inner voice of the Higher-Self can speak with the highest clarity. For those who have not yet advanc ed to the stage of complete Mind control, a serious attempt s hould be made at important times to silence the Mind, even for just a few moments at first, and be vigilant for the inner voice or ot her impressions, or signs such as the sinking feeling in the stomach, intuition, insp iration, or of course a knowing in the Heart; these will never let you down. There will always be situations in life or decisions to be made that were not anticipated and can occur very suddenly without any warning. In situations such as these never do anything impulsively; stop for a moment, relax, quieten y our Mind, listen and be vigilant for the guidance of the Higher-Self. You might hear or sense the inner voice giving you guidance or you might feel positive or negative feelings, intuition, inspirat ion or impressions; whichever it is do not hesitate, proceed accordingly with the guidance you are receiving even if your ego strongly protests. Always remember that your Higher-Self is sublime, always has your very best interests to"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 650 Heart, and is never, ev er wrong despite how your ego might react to the contrary. As well as being cons tantly vigilant for t he guidance of the Higher- Self during your daily affairs, it is also extremely valuable to consciously establish stronger c onnections with this Divine aspect of yourself during deep relaxation, or better still during meditation. While deeply relaxed or in an est ablished state of meditation, the deeper the better, start to communi cate with your Higher-Self. This will not only provide you with a source of the highest guidance whenever you need it, but will also bring additional calmness, peacefulness and resourcefulness into your life. Not only will these in turn improve the emotional aspects of your life, but your Higher- Self can also help you to manifest into your life all those things you truly need. Again, we mu st at this stage stop to consider the most important fact with manifestation; never, but never, ever be driven on by the ego, materialistic desire s or under the influence of others to be greedy by manifesting things you simply do not genuinely need in life, and never, but never do anything that will potentially or actually harm others. By now you should have reached a very good understanding of the true meaning of life, of the Univer se, of your own true destiny and therefore of the illusi on of the perspective of the five physical senses of the material world. Materi al things for the sake of them or for egotistical reasons or simply to conform to the expectations of others will dramatically slow your progress, and will most assuredly not make your life any more harmonious, happier, or peaceful. Only focus always on things you need to manifest your basic needs for living in the physical world, to evolve and progress on the sacred path, and most importantly to be of service to Brother and Sister human beings of all nationalitie s, cultures and traditions. That said, the Higher-Self with acce ss to the infinite resources of the Universe and the Divine Connection to The Source, The First Cause, to God, can assist you to manifest anything you need or desire into your life, and will at the same time advise you whether it"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 651 is the right thing to do or no t. During meditation, deep physical relaxation or just before drifting off to sleep at night, ask questions in your Mind. It is most important to have complete peace and quiet for this exercise, both around you and within your Mind. At first you might have difficulty discerning your inner voice or it might seem very quiet. Be patient and over time your inner voice will become stronger and louder, you only have to listen with sincerity and an open Mind. If you ask your question just before drifting off to sleep, the answer might arrive in the morning as you are awakening, or even during sleep in a dream. Once you have established contact with your Higher-Self you can also make requests for guidance, inspiration and for manifesting the things you truly need in life. Over time, communion with your Higher-Self will become a daily joy, and one you will always look forward to. Do not treat your Hi gher-Self as an occasional friend, only when you have a need or when a situation arises requiring guidance, instead endeavour to es tablish a permanent and strong relationship with your Higher-Self in perfect faith, perfect trust and Unconditional Love and you will find that y our life, reality and personal evolution on the sacred path back to God will be enhanced dramatically.  "},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 652 Chapter 109: The Flow of Life To be in tune with the flow of lif e and the Universe is to live in, and with Spirit. The Source, The All, The Prime Creator, The First Cause, God is absolute perfecti on and which perfection includes every aspect of the Universe including every human being. Most people tend to force their lives in one direction or another by physical means, very often driven on by the relentless urgings of the ego and by the subconscious Mind, while ignoring the promptings and counsel of the inner voice. Your inner voice is your Divine connection to the ultimate perfection and order of the Universe, and as we have alread y discussed should never, ever be ignored. Many people also allow negat ive thoughts and emotions to dominate their existence, wh ich again will work against the perfection of the Universe by infl uencing Energy in a negative way, which will in turn manifest as co rrespondingly negative situations in accordance with immutable Universal Laws, in particular the Law of Attraction. The more a person ignores the guidance, wisdom and natural flow of the Universe, the more negative wi ll be the impact on the life of that person, eventua lly resulting in a vortex of negativity and negative situations caus ed by disharmony in the flow of Universal currents. To know the Universe is perfec tion and to know beyond any doubt that your Higher-Self is always connec ted to the perfect order of the Universe is to know that your ent ire existence is in the best possible hands. It is extremely important t herefore, with Un conditional Love and unconditional trust, to allow G od and your Higher-Self to guide your life in the direct ion that you always inte nded it to be before you even commenced your current inca rnation on Earth. Many people, after being born into the physica l word, become so steeped in the material world so rapidly, and be come so influenced by the ego and the expectations of others, that their real purpose for the current physical life on Earth is almost completely subsumed. The most powerful force, Energy, vibration in the Universe and therefore of"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 653 God is Unconditional Love, and it is with Unconditional Love that your entire being will be guided within the immutable flow of the Universe. Living in Spirit, going with the flow of life no t only includes listening to and obeying the inner voice of y our Higher-Self, but also being constantly vigilant for those promptings and impulses that seem to be pushing you in a certain direction. On a simple level it might well be for example that you are look ing for something specific on a shopping trip. You have just decided to go into a particular shop when a sudden impulse causes you to continue walking, and instead of going into this first shop, further down the street you find another shop with exactly what you ar e looking for. This is a very basic example of something that happens to most people, and although most still do not recognise it they ascribe these situations to luck, chance, coincidence or other such intangibles, none of which exit in the perfection of the Universe. Of course there are much more important examples of such guidance involving every possible aspect of life. A more far- reaching example might for example be in buying a new home. After many weeks of searching y ou finally find a home you really like and make the decisi on to place an offer with the agent; an offer that is subsequently accepted. S uddenly you feel an impulse to withdraw the offer and not proceed with the purchase of the home. Again, your Higher-Self with its connections to the Universe is guiding you away from this situation, in this case the new property, and the wise thing to do would be to take heed and to therefore withdrawyour offer. You might we ll never know why you were compelled to not proc eed with the purchase of the home, but had you failed to follow your intuit ion and had proceeded to purchase the home anyway, you would most surely sooner or later have found out the reasons the hard way. Going with the flow of life, living in Spirit should become a way of life, always being consciously awar e of the forces guiding your life in the right direction and always obeying such guidance. Always"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 654 live for the present moment rather than being tempted to plan your life ahead as so many people like to do. The Universe, The Source, God is the Eternal Now, existing beyond the temporal confines of space and time. Your Higher-Self ex ists in the Eternal Now having a complete perspective of your past present and future, of all physical lives you have lived and ev er will live, as well as all probabilities that might re sult from any particular action, decision or thought. Living for the present moment, a lways listening to your inner voice and obeying without question the inner promptings, intuition and guidance received is therefore extremely important, always knowing beyond any doubt whatsoever that your destiny is in the very safest possible hands, those of absolute perfection. Follow your Energy, your instincts, y our intuition, your impulses, and therefore your inner guidance with complete confidence and joy, always knowing your very best in terests are being cared for with Unconditional Love, as an integral aspect of the flow of the infinite Universe. Never let anyone or anything di stract or persuade you from following the flow of your own life; it is your own life and accordingly your own path to follow onward s, to realise freedom, peace, harmony, success, and the ever onwards journey through the inner spheres of reality to your ulti mate destiny with The Source, The First Cause, with God, and will ve ry soon enjoy the freedom of going with the flow of life. Freedom from having to plan your days and weeks ahead, freedom from the pressures of being forced to make decisions, freedom to fulfil your own purpose and ultimate destiny while always knowing, be yond any possible doubts that you are an integral aspect of the stream of Univer sal life, and you are going with its immutable natural flow of complete perfection. Going with the flow of life, living in Spirit, does not only mean doing so in the context of your own life, but also with the flow of nature and therefore of t he entire Universe.

When y ou are enjoying the c ountryside or anywhere in nature, sit down, relax and a llow your Mind to become silent. Feel the powerful Ener gy around you and int egrate it into your being. Become aware and know that everything around you is Energy and has Consciousness as aspects of the ultimate Mind; everything you can see, hear, feel , taste and smell is an integral aspect of the magnificent Universe , all existing within the infinite Mind of the Divine Source, The Firs t Cause, God. We already know the entire Universe is Energy, vibration; feel those vibrations and tune your own vibrations in har mony with the glories of nature around you. Always be completely Mindful of the present moment feeling the peace and harmony and the most powerful vibration of all Unconditional Love, sustaining you, nature and everything in the Universe. Focus your attention on something that catches your eye or you feel particularly attracted to. Send to it positive Energy and Love and await the response. The response might arrive in the form of a feeling such as warmth, or you might see colours or hear music. However you personally perceive the response always know beyond any possible doubt that you are connected to each other, and in turn with everything and ev eryone else in the magnificent, infinite Universe. Now find a plant and feel its unique Energy. As we know, absolutely everything in the Universe is Sp irit, Consciousness and everything is life as an expression of the infi nite Mind of God. Hold your hands together, side by side, palms faci ng downwards a few inches above the plant and relax as much as possible. Soon you will feel the Energy of the plant as a warm glowing feeling over the palms of your hands. Attune yourself to the Energy of the plant and know it too is every bit as much an aspect of the Universe, The Source, of God as you are.

Nothing whatsoever in the entire infinite Universe, in any sphere from the very highest to the very lowest is separate from anything else in the Universe, and accordingly everything is an integr al aspect of everything else; this applies to all beings, Energy and life without an y exceptions. Nothing exists outside of The S ource. We also know that The Universe, The Source, God is Energy in the form of vibration, and accordingly everything in the Univer se is an integral aspect of the very same infinite, living Energy field of vibration When we know and understand these truths beyond any possible doubt, the realisation brings with it new and extremely important responsibilities; whatever we do to anything or anyone we also do equally to ourselves and therefore also to everything else, to Universe as a whole and to God. Everyone should think about the implications and consequences of this reality very deeply indeed because it can and will have a profoundly positive effect on your own reality. Everything in the Universe includi ng all animals, plant and mineral life is therefore an integral, inse parable aspect of every single one of us. Those who hurt or kill animals, plants or indeed any living organism, however small, also equa lly hurts or kills a part of themselves. This is an extremel y important and prof ound truth that everyone must fully understand. Whenever mankind thoughtlessly dam ages the environment by for example mining, building developm ent, pollution, and in many other destructive ways, those respon sible are equally damaging an aspect of themselves at the same time. This is one very important reason why the Earth and humanity simply cannot withstand the current levels of wanton dest ruction by mankind over the environment for very much longer. This is particularly evident when c onsidering the rain forests of the world and the global, wide-sca le building and agricultural"},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 658 developments that are being continuously carried on in the name of materialism, mostly in order to satisfy the relentless greed and satisfaction of the physical senses of much of m ankind, and also the ongoing craving for bigger and better material possessions, possessions that are totally meaningless in terms of ongoing progression, possessions that are completely irrelevant within the inner spheres beyond the physical world, to which everyone is ultimately destined. A single physical life is but a temporal moment in the context of the great path, and to grasp, crave and become a slave to material possessions during this moment is to not recognise these fundamental Universal realities. Only when mankind as a race fully understands the implications of a ll of these actions and of their complete futility and irrelevanc e in the context of the entire Universe and the individual path of evolution, will this terrible and needless destruction cease, and the Earth finally have the opportunity to recover. Hopefully, in the fullness of time, Earth can be restored to its former glory of before the days of so called “civilised man”. This can only occur however when mankind finally understands the complete and utter futility of the constant demand for temporal, meaningless, material possessions, acquired for no other purpose than for the gross gratification of the five physical senses and the uncontrolled demands of the ego. Everyone should be Mindful of thes e Divine responsibilities during every waking moment of every day. Whether at home, at work, in the garden, in the countryside, on vacation, we should always view and treat everything around us as an integral aspect of ourselves. When out in the garden, walking in nature or indeed anywhere else, we should always be sure we do not harm any living thing, either accidentally or deliberately, by for example plucki ng flowers or treading in places where other wildlife might be peacefully established. We should never, ever harm any living creature, however small; each and every cr eature without any exceptions"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 659 whatsoever is an equal aspect of ourselves and therefore of God, and all have an equal right to enjoy it s rightful place in the Universe and to live without unnatural inte rference from others while following their own path. Everythi ng and everyone in the Universe is constantly evolving, and ther efore everything and everyone has a path. All creatures, like everyone and everything else in the entire Universe in all spheres of life and reality are a Divine creation, expression and aspect of G od, and no human being, no Son or Daughter of God should ever for get these realitie s and the Divine responsibilities accompanying them. People often refer to some small creatures as “vermin”; again this is simply a derogatory human concept arising out of a complete and total lack of understanding and respec t for the position which every creature or being without except ion, however large or small occupies within the Universe. A lack of understandi ng all too often motivated out of gross selfishness, materialism and the uncontrolled demands of the ego. These creatures are only considered to be “vermin” becau se they happen to be perceived as interfering with the selfish materi al existence of people. In fact these creatures are really on their own path of evolution, involved with their own natural existence in the grand Universal scheme of things; these creatures are living their lives on their own path, and in no way trying to be vindictive. These small creatures are only “vermin” as perceived by the selfish ego driven materialism of mankind. Every single being without exception, as with all life withi n the infinite Universe, has an absolutely equal God given right to exist and to live life without any fear of unnatural interference, harm or persecution from others. If you are privileged to have smalle r creatures in your home such as mice, spiders, insects etc., they are not in your home with the idea of being vindictive, or to caus e a “nuisance” or to annoy you, they are simply aspects of your self seeking shelter, food and a place to breed and raise their offspring just as human beings do. People might claim that these creat ures are harmful in some way,"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 660 for example in the spreading of diseases, but as compared to mankind these creatures are extremely clean and advanced; and much more perfect than many humans in many respects. If you destroy the habitat of a sma ll creature, for example a spiders Web, you have destroyed a part of yourself equally. It is no different at all to someone arriving at yo ur home because they do not like the look of it, or believe it is in an inconvenient location, and levelling it to the ground with heavy machinery. How would you feel? Every aspect and expression of The Source, The First Cause, God has feelings by virtue of t he same Consciousness, life-force, Energy that we all share, and that applies equally to animals, plants and other expressions of Universal life. Fear, hate or worry about the c onsequences of allowing these creatures, these same aspects of yourself and of G od to share your home will attract to you the very consequences of your worry in accordance with Universal laws and in particular by The Law of Attraction. If you believe that sharing your home with other creatures will result in disease, damage or other undesirable, from your perspective consequences, t hen you will attract that same reality for yourself and it will become self-fulfilling. The way to proceed is simple an d unambiguous. If you honoured to share your home with other creatures, other aspec ts of yourself and of God that have chosen of their ow n freewill to live with you, then welcome them with complete sinc erity and if necessary provide them with food, and anything else they might require. Above all send them Unconditional Love in the knowledge t hey will return that Love unconditionally, and never c ause any problems for yourself, family or home. These same truths apply to pl ant and even mineral life. In a previous chapter discussing the plane of the animal Mind we saw conclusive proof that plants are indeed intelligent and fully capable of thought, even though they do not have a physically observable brain. This is no surprise cons idering plants and minerals, like"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 661 animals are all expressions and in separable aspects of the same infinite intelligence and Consciousness of The Source, The First Cause, God. In that particular ca se, as we discussed, the plant was connected to sophisticated lie detector equippment, and a series of experiments proved that the plant could readily think and rationalise as well as recognising danger and correctly identifying different human beings. Again, it is erroneous to equate any form of intelligence with the presence or size of a physical brain. The physical brain is simply an organic interface of non-permanent physical matter interacting between the Energy level of the human body at a low level of vibration, and the much higher level of vibrat ion of the Energy and other inner bodies. Without such a physical interface, the much higher Energy vibrations of the inner spheres of life could not be mediated with the much lower Energy vibrations of the physical human body. A plant has no need fo r a physical brain due, but still requires the same Energy interface between its physical presence and its inner existence on the plane of the plant Mind. Beyond the illusion of material observations ev erything in the Universe is life, intelligence and Consciousness, all integral and inseparable aspects of, and within the supreme Mind of The Source, The First Cause, of God. To destroy an animal, plant or mineral is to equally destroy a part of yourself and of God. Plants do ha ve feelings; they know when they are about to be hurt or destroyed and do not differ from human beings or animals in that resp ect one iota. The grand Universal scheme of things does of course recognise that the Earth life system and all that participate in it require food or sustenance and that plant life is a major part of that sustenance. However, motive is everything and is always fully acc ounted for by the laws of karma, an aspect of the Law of Cause and Effect. If the primary motive for destroyi ng a plant is to eat for basic survival, then that, being in keepi ng with the great processes of Universal life is acceptable. If howev er a plant of any kind, or even"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 662 vast areas of plant life such as t he great rainforests of the world are wantonly destroyed for greed or other motives then there will always be a karmic price to pay. The pre-meditated destruction of any expression of The Source, T he First Cause, of God, be it animal, plant or mineral is again st immutable Universal laws, and the Law of Cause and Effect will al ways prevail. It is quite simply not possible as a cause to wilfully destroy any aspect of God and therefore of all creation without equally experiencing the same effects. Just because mankind egotistically perceives itself to be the dominant form of life on Earth does not render the lives of other living beings any less important or any less significant. Every living creature without any exc eptions whatsoever has its own part to play in the grand Universal scheme, and all should thus be equally respected. Everyone should know therefore that deliberately damaging the environment or hurting any form of life in any way whatsoever will inevitably yield karmic consequences in accordance with the Universal Law of Cause and Effect; there are simply no escaping these laws. An yone who believes that they are beyond these Universal laws are deluding themselves and will in due course discover these r ealities by experience. Just because someone can rational ise the destruction of the environment, or the hurting or k illing of other living creatures, usually motivated by material and very often highly egotistical interests as is the case of fo x hunting, deer hunt ing, big game hunting and other forms of “blood sports” for example, does not make it right in the eyes of G od or the flow of the Universe. The perceived need for material po ssessions often exclusively for the purpose of the gratif ication of the ego and of the five physical senses, the often blatant disregar d for non-human life, and indeed sometimes in fact blatant disreg ard and disrespect for even fellow human beings are extremely serious human weaknesses which are never excused by the immutable la ws of Cause an d Effect which"},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 663 exist to maintain balance and harmony in the infinite Universe of which we are all an integral aspect. It should be known that by com parison with the highly evolved beings of the inner spheres, manki nd of the planet earth are as the most basic life forms on Earth. To these beings mankind is little more than a single celled organi sm barely capable of thought processes. And yet the beings of the inner spheres always view mankind with Uncondit ional Love, and do whatev er is necessary to assist the progress of mank ind along the sacred path. One day every human being will evolve to these same levels as these inner beings, and further still, the inner always assisting the outer along the gr eat path back to God. It is incumbent on mankind therefore to view and tr eat all life, however appar ently primitive they appear to be t the perceptions of m an, as sacred, and just as the inner beings selflessly assist mankind, mankind should also selflessly assist and live in harm ony with all creatures on Earth in the certain knowledge they are ju st as much brothers and sisters before God, all striving for progre ss on their own path in this great Universe that we share in whic h we all live, breath and have our being. These important facts should also extend to the fundamentals of eating for sustenance. Food is a requirement of every form of physical life in order to maintain it s existence. It is perfectly natural therefore to obtain food from the Universe in order to live and exist healthily. This is all a complete ly natural aspect of the natural Universal scheme of things. Most animals, except usually human beings, normally consume only those foods and in those quantities required in order to survive in a healthy state of being. In the case of humans however a trip around any supermarket will instantly reveal how the requirement for basic, necessary sustenance has grossly degenerated into a materia lism inspired food-fest designed for the most part only to satisfy the demands of the ego and of the human physical senses, and in particular the senses of vision, taste and smell."},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 664 In most parts of the world wher e a reasonable standard of living can be enjoyed, t he average person w ill consume very considerably more food and drink each day than is actually required for healthy survival. This fact alone is a major cause of health problems of numerous types includi ng obesity, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in many so -called civilised countries of the world. Food manufacturers and supermarkets always endeavour to ensure food is packaged in bright ly coloured, tempting wrappings and containers in order to tempt people to indulge in even more excesses, that in turn material profits may be further increased in order to satisfy the pockets, ego a nd demands of shareholders. It is no wonder therefore we are wit nessing ever increasingly serious health problems as a direct result of these gross excesses, problems of the sort that are increa singly evident in the world today, and which should accordingly no t need to be explained to most people. One of the most unfort unate aspects of these ex cesses is the effect on the heath of children. From a ve ry early age children are fed all manner of unhealthy foods with high sugar, fat and chemical content. These foods not only adversely affect the metabolism and body of the child, but also consid erably boost the production of fat cells, which once produced will be with the child for life. These fat cells are then utilised by the body to store fat, and as a direct result the child becomes obese from a very young age, and is then fighting obesity for the rest of t he child’s physical life. Unfortunately parents are still for the most part obliv ious to this as they fee their children ever more sugary and fatty foods, and in pa rticular “fast foods” which are currently one of the biggest nutritional issues facing mankind. People generally, with the e xception of vegans and many vegetarians usually view meat products on supermarket shelves as mere food, an object, a meaningless commodity to be cooked and eaten, usually without any thought whatsoever for the suffering of countless creatures on Earth dying each year for reasons going far"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 665 beyond the need of basic sustenance; creatures dying mostly in fact in the interests of the gratification of the human physical senses. Again, not much more need be about this sad state of affairs; it should be totally ap parent to anyone and everyone who takes the time to think about it objectively, and with complete honesty. Introspection in these matters is an extremely worthwhile exercise. Suffice it to say, shelves upon shelves of meat products equate directly to suffering and physical death on a massive scale of innocent creatures throughout the world. As the most true and highly appropriate expression goes, “man should eat to live, and not live to eat”. The appalling treatm ent of animals is a cause that will always have its corresponding effect according to immutable Universal laws. Those that partici pate in the harming of any life form, any expression or aspect of God, will pay the price in accordance with the immutable Law of Cause and Effect of which karma is an important component. Another aspect of progression and lessons to be learned in the physical world, lessons everyone wi ll have to learn in this or a future lifetime, is the need for tr eating the physical body properly and eating only those foods and only in those amounts strictly necessary for a healthy existence. As we have already observed, most people consume many times more food each day than is actually required for healthy living, much of which consists of food of low nutritional value, but at the same time high in components harmful to the body incl uding both natural substances such as fats and manmade chemicals such as preservatives. Eating should be about healthy, natural living, and always with complete conscious respect for other living creatures and for the environment. Any human being can live very healthily indeed on a very modest daily diet of natural foods, just as The Universe and evolution intended, a nd none of which require fancy packaging designed to stimulate the physical senses. Such sensible, natural, healthy diets are beyond the scope of th is book but there are plenty"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 666 of information sources available on the subject of healthy eating and natural foods. In conclusion, everyone can live ex tremely healthily in the way The Source, The First Cause, God int ends, on a modest diet of natural foods that are not specifically desi gned to appeal to and satisfy the demands of the senses and often of the ego. Everyone can and therefore should do so with an abs olute respect for all creatures and for the environment of the physi cal world of which we are all integral and inseparable aspects with God, and accordingly share a collective and equal responsibility to everyone and everything in the Universe.   "},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 667 Chapter 111: Selfless Service One of the most important aspects of progression in all spheres of life is the offering and provision of service and assistance to others without any thought whats oever of reward or self-gratification. Selfless service is absolutely fundamental, both from an individual perspective and from the perspec tive of the entire human race, without which there can be no true progression. Selfless service should be offered and provided out of a genuine and deep desire to help ot hers. Inner Beings of the Astral, Mental, Celestial and Cosmic s pheres of life are cont inually involved in service to humanity by selflessly pr oviding their services, the inner always assisting the outer, from t he very innermost sphere closest to The Source, The First Cause, G od, out to the physical Universe of matter; such is the way of pr ogression in the entire Universe. Although those in the lower s pheres cannot comprehend the glories, splendours and magnificence of the inner sphere s of life, or of the advanced beings residing ther e, and of their abilities, those of the inner spheres who already know and experience such conditions deeply wish to raise those liv ing in the outer levels of the Universe to the ever inner levels , that they may also enjoy the same conditions of Love , light and bliss; cond itions far beyond even the remotest comprehension of earthly humans. Only when a person arrives at the next level in his or her development can they truly experience and fully apprecia te the glories, splendours and magnificence of those inner worlds and of those who dwell there. It is an unfortunate but yet true fact that many people today will not consistently help others without ant icipating something tangible in return, very often money. Ther e are of course many notable exceptions, for example the excellent work carried out by charities and other volunteer workers and or ganisations involved in a wide range of humanitarian services, as well as services to assist other living creatures and the environment."},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 668 Of course, people are understandably co mmitted to their own daily needs, families and friends, often helping each other whenever appropriate. This is of course as it should be between families and friends. Selfless service however should extend far beyond family and friends. The meaning of selfless service is to unconditionally serve others whenever the need fo r such assistance is apparent and appropriate, and whe never it is possible to do so, without any thought whatsoever for self or gain. Selfless service also includes the progression of all humanity and life. Just as the inner are always assisting the outer within the inner spheres of life, the fortunate s hould likewise always help the less fortunate within the physical world. Such help can be offered in numerous, unlimited ways, ranging from financial assistance to direct physical help, through to advice, support, healing and teaching. If all mankind would em brace these extremely important Universal principles, al l of which are require d for true progression, then the greed, avarice, materialism, egocentricity and self- gratification so prevalent in t he world today w ould disappear, and the world would be a vastly bette r place; the “kingdom of heaven on Earth”. As it is, we frequently witness self-interest being placed before selfless service in the seemingly relentless race, and often obsession by humans generally to accumulate wealth, material possessions, power, fame and notoriet y, all motivated entirely for individual benefit. Within the inner spheres of lif e and reality commencing with the Astral worlds where people will tr ansition to after passing from physical life on Earth, everyone at any particular level of density and vibration exists at fundam entally the same level of ennoblement, advancement and beliefs, and as a result, in the mid- Astral and inner worlds, peace, harmony and tranquillity always prevail. In these inner Astral worl ds to which people transition after the death of the physical body, t here are no formal leaders, no formal work, no money, no self-int erest and no greed, everyone always working together in onene ss of Spirit for the benefit of"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 669 everyone else around them, and very often for the benefit of those living on Earth. However, those on Earth who lived a life of selfishness, greed, avarice, gross materialism and di sregard for others or worse will find themselves in a very simila r world after passing. Everyone will transition to a world that is completely analogous and a very precise match to the physical lif e lived on Earth. No one can take their Earthly material possessions with them to the Astral worlds, and accordingly after passing such people who on Earth lived by greed, selfishness and disregard for others will find themselves in the company of similar Souls in the outer Astral worlds, all striving to gain advantage over everyone else in exactly the same way as they did on Earth. These are the “greed worlds” of the Astral realms where those dwelling there will pot entially spend hundreds or even thousands of years as measured in Ea rth time striving to gain from each other just as they did on Earth. These outer Astral worlds might well be analogous to a type of “hell” in religious terms, worlds were greed, avarice and selfishness prevail. Eventually however, sooner or later, these people will also learn their lessons and the futility of their selfish personalities, and will either reincarnate for another life on Earth where the lessons learned can be exercised, or transition to the inner, more harmonious, peaceful Astral worl ds, where everyone assists each other without any thought of reward or other benefit, until such time as reincarnation takes place once again. The purpose of these outer Astral worlds are not as a form of punishment but rather places of learning, an environm ent perfectly matched to the character and therefore Energy vi bration of the people dwelling there that they may ultimately learn and move on. Those who believe “death” will release them from their attitudes and actions within the physical world had therefore better think again because “death” is no escape. Everyone will transition to the Astral worlds, to a realm that ex actly matches their character and other attributes, and where life c ontinues eternally. Knowing these"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 670 important facts, everyone has the opportunity to review their own life, character and ennoblement in the years before physical death, the sooner the better, and to take al l necessary actions to transition to a decent life of selfless ness and service to others. It should also be well and truly noted by those who are mostly concerned with, and motivated by their own self-interests, that selfishness is one of the very mo st serious transgressions against Spiritual progression, and is hi ghly karmic. Notwithstanding the conditions awaiting a persistently selfish person after physical death, all transgressions will have to be balanced sooner or later. Universal laws apply equally to every single person without exception, regardless of perceiv ed status on Earth, a status counting for absolutely nothing in the inner Astr al and Spiritual worlds. While the victims of the physical world will likely enjoy a peaceful, harmonious existence a fter passing on to the Astral worlds, those who transgressed against them will find themselves in an outer, “hell” like Astral world among like-Minded people, with karmic debts to pay in full. We should all therefore live our lives in a positive manner, in complete peace and harmony with t he world, going with the flow of life, always offering selfless service out of Unconditional Love whenever and wherever t he need or opportunity arises and it is appropriate to do so. Living a sha llow life where token efforts are made to help others, or to be less selfish simply in the knowledge of the life awaiting after passing from the physical world and in the hope of enjoying a better “afterlife” will be completely futile. Relinquishing the habits and characteri stics of a lifetime on Earth or “death bed confessions and concilia tion” just prior to passing on mean absolutely nothing whatsoever , and will absolutely make no difference at all to the Astral world to which a person will transitioned after physical death and the environment encountered there. This also equally applies to religi ous people, many of whom believe that their religion, faith and acc epting Jesus as their saviour will"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 671 ensure their place in “heaven”. Some even go as far as believing if they “embrace Jesus” on the deathbed then they will be “saved” and go to “heaven”. This of course is a complete de lusion, brought about by the most part by the creed, dogma and in doctrination of the church. True progression includes transc ending the ego, ennoblement of Soul and Spirit, respect for all life, Unconditional Love and selfless service. No one knows precisel y when their current lifetime on Earth will be completed, and when therefore the transition inwards to the next sphere of life will occu r, and accordingly no time should be lost in fully embracing and living life in full knowledge of the true meaning of life.  "},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 672 Chapter 112: The Lessons of Life Each and every physical life on Eart h is can be likened to attending the kindergarten of the Universe, in a learning process that never ends until the end of the path to our Divine Creator is finally reached. Even when the cycle of ph ysical reincarnation on Earth has been transcended and the student progresses to the primary school of life, the path ahead back to our Divine Creator is long, but much more tranquil peaceful a nd harmonious, with none of the trials and tribulations experienc ed within the physical Earth life system. It is the destiny, and shoul d be the primary objective of every single person without exce ption to graduate from the kindergarten of Earth wit h honours in order to progress to the next phase of Divine education. Always keep in Mind that the true meaning of life is to evolve back to The First Cause, The Source, God, from Where we first ca me, and of Whom we are all expressions. We have already discussed in th is book many of the factors facilitating true and enduring progress during each physical life. It is also very important to realise howe ver that life is one long learning process from the moment of birt h to the moment of transitioning back to the inner spheres of reality where the work and achievements of the past life can finally be reviewed and reconciled. Every single moment, both awak e and asleep, is a valuable opportunity to learn and to pr ogress, and none of these lessons should be disregarded or wasted. Du ring life we all interact with many different people under many different circumstances, encountering many differ ent situations, all of which are valuable opportunities for learning, prog ression and personal evolution whether they are recognised as such or not at the time. Numerous such opportunities are presented to everyone each and every day, and no such valuable opportunity should be wasted. If such an opportunity is not recognised or is ignored, the same lesson will present itself again in the future , either during the current physical"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 673 Earth life or will be carried over into a future physical life where the opportunities will arise once again. It is most important therefore to consider each and every situation, and to understand it’s tr ue meaning, learn the lessons and to take any necessary actions associated wit h that lesson. Situations, Spirit guides, your Higher-Self and others living within the inner spheres of life will all assist yo ur learning process by creating situations and symbols for ongoing evolution. For ex ample, if you suddenly find blocked sinks, blocked drains, blocked pipes and other blockages appearing in your life that never happened before, t hey might well be symbolic representations of a more fundamental blockage in your life involving your Soul or Spir it. It is as well to take time to identify where this blockage might be arising and to accordingly take the appropriate steps to reso lve it. You might well for example be putting off something that could be important in your life such as moving to a different a different location. Whatever it is the blockage must be identified and remedied. There are many other such situations in life, a common one of which is conflict with others. Frequent ly, situations will arise that you feel are unjust, unfair or quite simply completely wrong. Most people would react strongly to t hese situations, perhaps by engaging in arguments wit h others, complaining, or simply by experiencing emotions of anger, or worse, hate. When these situations occur they are valuable opportunities for learning, growth and progression. When faced with such a situation, before reacting, stop yourself, take a very deep breat h, count to five, and take the time to consider the situation fr om all perspectives. Ask yourself; “maybe it is I who is wrong in this situation after all”. Consider the situation from the perspective of the other person or people involved and ask yourself what you would do in these same circumstances. The ego is a very powerful adversary as we have previously discussed, and will always cause you to insist that you are right and everyone else must therefore be wrong, if allowed to do so. This is just one reason why it is so exceptiona lly important to"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 674 transcend the influence of ego and to assume full control over your own Mind and actions at all times. The ego will revel in causing tr ouble whenever and wherever it possibly can, and must never be allowed to do so. If the uncontrolled ego is allowed to exert its influence in this way, life lessons will not be learned, karma will not be equilibrated and progress in this and future physica l lives will be adversely affected. There is quite simply no avoi ding the lessons needing to be learned. Accumulated karma al so needs to be balanced, and therefore must be fac ed and addressed as soon as possible while further negative karma is avoided, all by means of vigilance and self-control at all times. Those who continuously fail in these objectives will need return to Ea rth time and again for another physical life, never making further progress on the path, thus missing the glories, splendours, tranquillity, peace and harmony of the inner spheres of life; t he next stages of learning and progression awaiting everyone wit hout exception. If every human being knew the glories that awai t them further along the path, beyond the cycle of reincarnation in to physical lives on Earth, no person would delay for a momen t. It would become a passionate desire to learn the physical lessons of the kindergarten of Earth, and to progress to the glories, splendours and magnificence of the next phase of life. Each situation you are presented with should be faced with complete confidence, always knowing beyond any doubts whatsoever that you are an immo rtal Spiritual being, a Son or Daughter of God made in the tr ue Spiritual image of God, and nothing can ever harm you. Never miss an opportunity to help others or to provide selfless serv ice; opportunities presented each and every day if only y ou are vigilant for them. Always give thanks for every single such opportunity ar ising in your life; thank the Universe, The Source, God, as well as your Higher-Self and all of those many unseen beings of the in ner spheres of life who dedicate themselves to your well-bein g and progression out of Pure Unconditional Love."},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 675 Chapter 113: Pure Unconditional Love Pure Unconditional Love is the most powerful vibration, force, Energy, in the entire Universe, in all spheres of life and reality. Without the all-pervading power of Unconditional Love the entire Universe could not and would not exist. If Unconditional Love where to be withdrawn, the entire Universe would collapse in an instant. Unconditional Love should never be confused simply with sentimental love, attraction between tw o people, sexual love or lust, love of family or friends, or wher e the word “love” is used very loosely as a sign of friendship, affection or simply as an expression of endearment. Unconditional Love is best described as a state of Energy, vibration, a powerful forc e, ultimately the very highest expression of Energy and vibration of all emanating as it does from the very highest, purest, most perfe ct and most Divine Energy of The Source, The First Cause, of God, a vibration sustaining all creation within the entire Univer se without which there would be nothing. In order to live in complete harm ony with the Univ erse and become an open channel of expression of God, it is necessary to attune to a personal state of Unconditional Lov e in order that our body, Soul and Spirit can resonate in harmony with this same Divine vibration of Energy. In order to maximise our abilities of manifestation, healing, and other inner abilities , and to truly live in Spirit, Unconditional Love is not somethi ng we should simply be aware of, or claim to practice, but rather so mething we should actually feel and become as an integral part of our very being. Many people might claim to practi ce Unconditional Love, but very often this is very far indeed from r eality. True, Unconditional Love is not merely about feeling good towards yourself or others, romantic love, showering everyone with affect ion or other su ch sentimental behaviour, although of course thes e are perfectly harmless and even good things to do when appropriate , it is rather a much higher"},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 676 and ongoing state of bei ng rather than mere words or a temporary or notional display of emotion, or affection. True, Pure Unconditional Love is the very Energy behind all creation from the very beginning; it was out of Pure Unconditional Love that God created and sustains the entire Universe in all spheres of life and rea lity; Pure Unconditional Love is therefore the very highest and most Divine expression of God. Those who wish total peace and complete harmony with the Universe, and wish to maximise t he practice, effectiveness and benefits of those abilities discussed earlier in this book, should strive to become the individual epit ome of Pure Unconditional Love; Pure Unconditional Love must becom e an integral part of your very being. Unconditional Love really does mean “unconditional” in every possible sense, that is to say without any conditions of any sort attached. Of course it is not possible to become Unconditional Love overnight, it is rather a process commencing with a total and sincere resolve, integrated into daily life, and practiced increasingly with genuine and complete dedicati on, until Pure Unconditional Love is fully realised in every as pect of your life and being; body, Soul and Spirit. Before setting a date in which to commence practicing and becoming at one with Unconditional Lov e, it is first necessary to contemplate and meditate deeply about exactly what Unconditional Love really means and how you will proceed with, and ultimately achieve your objective. It is nece ssary to fully understand the true nature of Unconditional Love to the point where it is not something you ever need to consciously think about, but is rather an integral aspect of your very being. To practice Unconditional Love is to see and love the Divine essence of absolutely every one and everything without any exceptions, not only the superfici al shell that is the temporal physical vehicle by which to ex perience earthly matter, but in particular the immortal Spirit wi thin, the true image of God. You"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 677 must know beyond any doubts in your very heart and Soul that everyone without excepti on, regardless of race, creed, culture, personality, individuali ty, characteristics and earthly status is an integral and equal aspect of God, our Divine creator who has given us all the precious gift of immortal life. You cannot be selective about “Unconditional” Love. You must radiate and be Pure Unconditional Love to everyone and everything including those who you might hav e previously perceived of not being worthy of such love, including but not limited to terrorists, murders, bank robbers, difficult neighbours, annoying co-workers, and all of those with whom you mi ght have had or are still having major disagreements, or generally hav e simply not got along with in the past for whatever reason that mi ght be; the reason simply does not matter. Every single one of these people without exception is also an equal aspect of God, an ex pression of God, and to hate them is also to hate God, yourself and the entir e Universe in all of its magnificent spheres and dimensi ons of life and reality. Every single one of these people without exception has the same ultimate destiny, and one day even the peopl e considered to be the most evil of humans on Earth will asce nd back to our Divine Creator. God never, ever discriminates against his children anymore than any human being would discriminat e against their own children, and therefore as true sons a nd daughters of G od no human being should ever discriminate agains t any other human being. Many might say, “but we are only human after all”. Yes, but therein is an extremely important point; people mi ght well believe a nd think as if they are “only human”, however in reality, we are God and God is us, and one day upon attaining such a level of perfection everyone will realise the opportunity to assist in the harmonious operation of the entire Universe in all dimens ions, spheres and realms as “God people”. When you begin to practice being Unconditional Love, you must pour the high Energy vi bration of genuine Pure Unconditional Love into everything and everyone, your entire surroundings without any"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 678 hesitation or condition. You will very quickly discover that Unconditional Love is very expa nsive and pervasive due to being an integral aspect of the group human Mind, and very soon people around you will begin to receive and to assimilate the vibrations of the Energy of Unconditional Love t hey are receiving from you, and will respond accordingly. People wi ll seem to become much happier and more peaceful around you, sm iling more, and being generally more relaxed. As the people around you respond in this way, they will in turn radiate much more peaceful, harm onious feelings, again which will in turn be absorbed by people ar ound them, and very soon your being Unconditional Love wi ll directly or indirectly touch the hearts of many people. In this way it does not take too many people being Unconditional Love to raise the ent ire world to this most Divine vibration, with profoundly positiv e consequences. While practicing Unconditional Love, be vigilant for and reject all negative or unloving thoughts immediately they occur. Remember; a very important aspect of Unconditional Love is also unconditional forgiveness. Always unconditional ly forgive those who have wronged you, however bitter or resentful you might feel, and project Unconditional Love in pl ace of any anger or resentment while also remembering to learn any lessons you can from the situation. It is very important to remember and to know that Unconditional Love is much more than a sentiment or something you might say to yourself, such as “I practice Un conditional Love”; it must radiate from the Heart and be an absolute knowing without thought or effort. Unconditional Love must literally be a st ate of being, inseparable from your Soul, Spir it and your Higher-Self, your Divine self, connected directly with the most Divine vibration of Energy of The Source, The First Cause, of God. Always know that Unconditional Love is projected by God through your Higher-Self, through your immort al Spirit, through your Soul and finally to your physical bo dy, through which you send the vibrations to everyone and everything. Very soon your vibration and"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 679 very Being will be raised to a new level, and you will begin to instinctively understand ho w to overcome limitat ions in your life. The door will open for many more possibilities you would ever have considered or thought possible bef ore. Your abilities of creating your own reality, healing and many other powers of the Mind will open wide to you without effort . Not only will you be positively affecting other people, you will also be raising the vibration and therefore Energy within your own life, experi encing a new level of happiness, peace and harmony with th e world, Universe and all those around you. The first few days of practicing Pure Unconditional Love might prove to be difficult, but as you persevere over the course of weeks and months it will become a way of life, and you will never want to return to the lower Energy vibrat ion of your previous state ever again. While relaxing or meditating, focus on your heart chakra, the centre of Unconditional Love in your Etheric or Energy Body, and see it glowing, sending out its rays to the world. Take every opportunity to perform the Twin Hearts meditation as detailed earlier in this book, sending Pure Unconditional Love to the entire world. The more you become the epitome of Pure Unconditional Love and perform the Twin Hearts meditation, the more your heart chakra will expand and glow brightly ; you will very clearly feel the warmth and the peace as your heart chakra vibr ates to the highest Energy vibration of all, t he Divine vibration of God. After some time you will feel an d know beyond any doubt you are connected directly to this ultimate, Divine source of the vibration, of Unconditional Love, and know beyond any doubt w hatsoever you are an integral aspect of this sour ce; such a level of realisation is extremely important to the development of m any positive abilities and for ongoing growth and evolution along the sacred path back to God, the very source of Pure Unconditional Love. In time you will become a much calmer, happier, peaceful person, which will be reflected in your life. You will feel and know you are in tune with the Divine Sour ce of the very highest vibration of all,"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 680 which will in turn manifest into your life in many positive ways. You will sleep more peacefully and soundly, and your dreams might well be much more vivid, harmonious and intense, opening you to a fuller understanding of your true purpose. Your raised vibrations might well also open you to many higher-level abilities such as Astral Projection, clairvoyance a nd psychic abilities, although these should never be a primary motivation. Remember, unconditional means truly unconditional, whether it re lates to yourself or others. During the first few days and weeks maintaining Pure Unconditional Love might well prove to be a variable experience, especially for those who are still working on tran scending the ego. The ego will protest at every turn and will demand getting its own way. Perseverance is the key; acknowle dge the protests and efforts of your ego to upset your equilibriu m of Unconditi onal Love, but without ever giving into to it. In the fullness of time your ego will have to accept your desires a nd cease to protest and place obstacles in your way. Above all, never become dishear tened or give up altogether. Always know it is your Divine ri ght as a true Son or Daughter of God, made in the true Spiritual image of God to be Pure Unconditional Love at all times, and thereby doing your part in keeping the fabric of the Univer se intact. Also, always remember the love God has for you is Pure Unconditional Love; God never, ever, ever judges anyone, no matter where a person is on the path, or however “bad” or “evil” they are perceived to be by judgemental people on Earth. God always embraces Pure Uncondi tional Love for all of His/Her Children and creations within the ent ire multi-dimensional Universe. Unconditional Love has been recognised throughout the millennia as one of the ultimate mysteries of life and of the Universe, and yet most people in this stage of their evolution do not recognise or attempt to become as one with Unc onditional Love. Those who do recognise Unconditional Love and live their liv es as Unconditional Love will realise these profound truths; it can shake you free from"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 681 the influence of the ego and allo w you to enjoy a new freedom and state of being which most people might find unimaginable. Only those who become Pure Unconditional Love will know the absolute truth of this reality. To conclude this section, here is a passage contained within Corinthians of the Christian bible. While this is text is contained within religious source, it is nev ertheless extremely appropriate. “ And now I will show you the most excellent way. If I speak in the tongues of men and of Angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a cl anging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all myst eries and all kno wledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wr ong. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophesies they will cease, where there are tongues they wil l be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when perfection come s, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child I talked like a ch ild. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we s ee but a poor reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain; fait h, hope and love. And the greatest of these is Love."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 682 Chapter 114: Our Ultimate Reality During the course of this book we have discussed the true nature of the magnificent infinite multi-dim ensional Universe also known as God, The All, Spirit, and by nume rous other names in accordance with the many and diverse traditions and cultures of the world. We have discussed the true nature of the inner realms of life and reality beyond the physical planet Earth through which we will all journey sooner or later on the way to rea lisation of our ultimate and most sacred destiny. We have also observed how each and every person without exception creates t heir own reality, thereby each managing our own individual evol ution and our own ultimate destiny, all by virtue of the freewi ll granted by our Divine creator to Whom it is the most sacred task for each and every person to return. It will be apparent to everyone by now that hitherto it has been due to a lack of true knowledge that t he current course of mankind has been leading inexorably and increasi ngly leading away from God, away from the Light, away from the glories and the splendours of the inner spheres of reality, t he true destination of mankind, and instead towards the darkness, an insidious darkness fuelled by creed, dogma, indoctrination, unchecked rampant materialism, the uncontrolled ego and many other dark human traits, all of which continue to blight mankind.

Then and only then can the physical world, God’s kindergarten of the Universe to which people return time and again, eventually become the “ki ngdom of Heaven on Earth”, the place of health, harmony, happine ss, peace and plenty for all, the heritage with which all mankind has been entrusted, but upon which heritage mankind has hitherto for the most part turned its back."},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 683 It is the most sacred duty and des tiny of every single individual without any exception to travel t he sacred path back to The First Cause, The Source, back to God, our Divine Creator, while always selflessly assisting others further behi nd on the path, in the Spirit of Pure Unconditional Love, the most powerful force in the entire Universe. Everyone should be absolutely clear that without any exceptions whatsoever, every single person who has been born into the physical world, has ever been born or ever will be born will, sooner or later, set foot firmly and c onfidently on the Divine path and embark on the most sacred journey of all; such is the ultimate destiny of all mankind and that of our Brothers and Sisters throughout the Universe, and such is the ultimate and true meaning of life. No time on Earth should ever be wasted. The sooner true and permanent progress can be made, the sooner the cycle of physical reincarnation will be transcend ed forever as the sacred journey continues in the inner reality; wo rlds, planes, spheres, realms and conditions of Pure Unconditional Love, Light and bliss far, far beyond even the remotest compr ehension of people still living on Earth. Those focussed within the outer spheres of life quite simply cannot comprehend the sheer magnificence and splendours of the inner sphere of life and reality until arriving there as a result of ever increasing individual perfec tion, in turn raising the Energy vibrations of our Spiritual bodies, always matching the vibrations and density of the inner spheres of life and reality equivalent to level of perfection. As more and more people on Earth begin to awaken to these inner realities of true purpose, destiny and of the true and ultimate meaning of life, an expansion of Consciousness of the group human Mind will progressively occur, which in turn will continue to be the catalyst for yet more and more people awakening to these Universal realities and individual destiny. Eventually, in the fullness"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"Our Ultimate Reality Life, The Universe and the Destiny of Mankind 684 of time, everyone on the planet will become fully aware and conscious of individual true pur pose, nature and destiny, and will not waste any Earth time arranging their own lives accordingly. This process has already begun and is one of the reasons why today we are witnessing increasi ngly more “phenomena” such as psychic abilities, clairvoyance and Astral Projection arising in people who might otherwise have not even believed in, or even been aware of such possibilities. This process is always being assisted by advanced Beings of the inner spheres of life, including evolved humans and other intelligences who have chosen of their own freewill to assist human bei ngs in this Divine process. It has often been said that the timing of this expansion of Consciousness might be due to a prophesied event affecting the entire planet Earth, t he Cause and Effects of which are the subject of much speculation a nd debate. Many believe fo r example this will coincide with the end of the Ma yan calendar in the year 2012, others believe the process has star ted even now and is very much ongoing. If such an event were to occur it is prophesied to involve an “Etherealisation” of the physical world, thereby causing the entire physical planet Earth to incr ease its Energy vibrations thus becoming less dense, moving towards vibration and density of the Astral worlds. If this situation were to occur as prophesied only those human beings who are sufficient ly Spiritually evolved, with vibrations of the subtle bodies bei ng equal to or gr eater than the higher vibrations of th e physical world would c ontinue to survive on the planet Earth. This would result in the end of the physical lives of everyone else on Earth and a trans itioning to the Astral worlds where further progress woul d be much more difficult. Of course, although the subject of several independent prophesies, the likelihood of this situation oc curring is still very much unknown, and is likely to remain so until and if such time it begins to occur.

Finally, please always remember t hat you are not merely a physical person experiencing a single life in the physical world, housed within a physical body of matter; you are, always have been and always will be an immortal Spiritual being of the infinite Universe in all spheres of life and r eality, an integral an d inseparable aspect of the Divine; The First Cause, The Gr eat Spirit, The All, The Source, our Prime Creator and a ll of His/Her other names, mostly often known simply as God. Finally, I personally wish you ever y possible success in Light, truth, peace, harmony and Unconditional Love on your own individual onward journey through this and any future lives on Earth, and onwards through the magnificence, glories and splendours of the inner spheres of life as you fulfil the ultimate reality, your own ultimate destiny, your individua l return along the sacred path back to the Divine of Whom you are an inseparable, integral aspect, and in Who’s image you are truly made as an immortal Spiritual being."}]
