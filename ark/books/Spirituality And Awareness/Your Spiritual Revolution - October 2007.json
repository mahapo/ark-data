W ith this \"hereditary dissatisfaction\" theory in mind, I'd like to suggest that even if you do feel dissatisfaction with certain elements in your life, this does not mean that you have to consider yourself to be \"unhappy\". This is important to contemplate, because our experience of happiness is generally dependent on how we interpret things. Basically , if we think we're unhappy , we are unhappy , and if we think we're happy , we're happy . If you experience certain dissatisfactions and interpret them to mean that you must be unhappy , then you are unhappy . An alternative approach would be to assume that your feel ings of dissatisfaction might be a helpful and positive signal that you are meant to impr ove your life. W ith this perspective, you can be happy , even amidst your dissatisfactions. W ith a positive frame of mind, you can also work more ef fectively to alleviate the sources of your dissatisfactions, whether those sources are outer circumstances, or your own inner habits. In fact, many seekers begin their spiritual search because they have experienced some dissatisfaction with their lives, and want to feel more satisfied, complete, positive, whole, and happy . Therefore, rather than interpreting a sense of dissatisfaction as a sign of unavoidable unhappiness, you can choose to view it in a positive light - perhaps as a sign that you are growing and being prodded to create an outer world that better reflects and nourishes your evolving soul.

Even those who seem to have all that a good life can of fer can find themselves far from the happiness they seek. Abd Er -Rahman III, Sultan of Spain in the tenth century , spoke of the elusiveness of happiness while describing what one would think to have been among the happiest of lives: \"I have now r eigned about 50 years in victory or peace, beloved by my subjects, dr eaded by my enemies, and r espected by my allies. Riches and honors, power and pleasur e, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity . In this situation, I have diligently number ed the days of pur e and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot. They amount to fourteen.\" Several years ago, I learned an intriguing lesson about the nature of happiness while editing a video commercial about a discount store in one of the poorest areas in Southern California. Most of the customers interviewed for this video were Mexican immigrants who barely got by on minimal wages. These were not the kind of elegant or well-dressed folks that you'd usually see on a commercial. Some of them were way overdue for a haircut, while others could have used some heavy-duty dental work. The video production crew had approached these customers on their way in or out of the store, and asked them to share their thoughts about having a place where they could purchase second-rate clothes and home goods for a fraction of what they'd have to pay in lar ger stores. What struck me most was to see how many of these folks were simply , genuinely , and sincerely happy . Y ou could see it in their faces. Y ou could feel the sincerity of their happiness, as these humble immigrants beamed big, beautiful smiles, in spite of a few missing teeth here and there.

Money can buy the husk of things, but not the kernel. It brings you food but not appetite, medicine but not health, acquaintances but not friends, servants but not faithfulness, days of joy but not peace or happiness. --Henrik Ibsen Ultimately , happiness is elusive due to misguided ideas about what happiness truly is, and how it can be nurtured. After all, how many of us have really contemplated what ha ppiness is? W e put so much time and ef fort - first into years of schoolwork, and then into toiling long hours for our households and workplaces. Y et, how much time have we actually put into contemplating what thoughts and actions will create greater happiness in our lives and in the world? When is the last time you really sat quietly and contemplated what happiness means to you? In fact, when I was first asked to write this book, an old, for gotten, curmudgeonly , monastic mindset inside of me became somewhat annoyed, thinking, \"Happiness? Happiness? What do I have to do with happiness? I'm an ascetic! I'm too busy being spiritual to bother with being happy!\" Along with this bit of monastic curmudgeonry , I was also very happy to be asked to write about such a beneficial and fruitful topic. I'd had the blessing of spending time with a number of very happy spiritual beings - including my two spiritual guides, or gurus, who had shown me that spiritual attainment can indeed come along with great happiness. As my contemplations and preparations for this book continued, I also began to recognize more clearly that happiness is, and has a lways been, right inside my heart and soul, as it most certainly also exists fully inside of yo u. This is the level of happiness that I want to unfold with you in this book. Happiness Comes From W ithin Men and women ar e rushing hither and thither in the blind sear ch for happiness, and cannot find it; nor ever will until they r ecognize that happiness is alr eady within them and r ound about them, filling the universe, and that th ey , in their selfish sear ching, ar e shutting themselves out fr om it. --James Allen The first step in finding happiness is to understand that happiness always comes from inside yourself. Even if your experience of happiness appears to be coming from an outer source or experience, the actual hap piness is coming from within you. Happiness arises from within us, and dances with whatever appears to be bringing those apparently outer enjoyments.

This becomes clear when we discover that certain situations that had once brought great happiness no longer create the same ef fect. T ime and time again, each of us is given opportunities to learn and remember t hat it is not outer things that bring happiness, but the interactions of our inner thoughts and fe elings with those things. Our inner thoughts and feelings are the basis of both our happiness and our unhappiness. Because happiness comes from within, even when things don't appear to be going perfectly well outwardly , it is still possible to experience sincere happiness. It is our inner feeling that creates happiness, along with how we interpret the events of life. For one person, breaking a leg may be a horrible and unhappy tragedy , while for another it may be a trophy of great honor . Several years ago, I was shopping at an of fice supply store, when my car's license plate number was read over the loudspeaker . It turned out that a woman had just dented my fairly new car in the parking lot. The woman either didn't have insurance or didn't want to use it for some reason, so she of fered to personally pay for the repair costs, and gave me a phone number for where she worked - at a nearby Denny's restaurant. As soon as I drove away , I could feel that I didn't really want to take this woman's hard- earned money just to fix a bit of cosmetic damage. I mean, the car still ran fine, and I couldn't even see the dent while driving.

But mostly , I just didn't want to take money unnecessarily from someone who obviously worked very hard for every dollar . I wanted to for give my debtor just as I wished God to always for give me. When I phoned to tell the woman this decision, she ar gued at first, but eventually conceded to not paying for the damage. How wonderful it is to create a situation where two people in a car incident can be ar guing about wanting the other person to be okay . This is a great example of how one generous spirit can bring that same higher level of response from others, and perhaps eventually uplift the whole world. The woman and I both walked away from this experience feeling blessed. And now , whenever I see the dent - which is still there after nearly ten years - I feel a sense of happiness rather than upset. I get to remember my own kindness rather than feeling a sense of loss. If the dent had been there because I bumped into someone else's car , or from an accident with a lot of anger and conflict, then I most certainly would have wanted it to be fixed up right away so as not to be reminded of an unhappy memory every time I saw my car . This story shows how happiness is ultimately all in the interpretation.

Many people spend their entire life chasing after happiness and never find it. Many seek their happiness through other persons or objects in their life, unaware that true happiness comes from within and has much more to do with the attitude you have about yourself, life, your role in life and relationship with life and your fellow humans. When you have arrived to this awareness then you will not need to look for happiness because joy and happiness become a part of you. The secret of all success and happiness is to manifest in your own behavior whatever you would like to receive from others. The law of Happiness is very much connected with the law of Acceptance. The Law of cceptance This law is about truth. Because truth is absolute, acceptance of truth is absolute. T o resist such a reality will not succeed. T o resist is denial. In a practical way acceptance of things that we cannot change works to our advantage and makes our life easier to bear . For example, acceptance of the laws of the universe, acceptance of our birth circumstances, the acceptance of blows that fate dishes out to us over which we have no control. There are many situations in life that are imposed upon us that we have little A control of. W e cannot change nature and the dif ferences in races, color or culture, there fore, it is wiser to accept the fact that others dif fer from us and that there is nothing wrong with that. It was meant to be so because we cannot change it. Another example is that we accept the responsibility individually and collectively for our thoughts and actions and that we do not constantly blame others for our own mist akes and shortcomings. Accidents of nature, illness, death, are all situations that are not within our powers to change so we might as well accept each situation for what it is. Genuine acceptance of a situation, i.e. practicing non-resistance, is the first step towards finding the solution to turn things around for the better . This law does not mean you to sit back, to be passive and to allow everything just to happen to you. On the contrary , it requires you to be fully aware, to be able to distinguish between what you cannot change and that which you can change, to see things for what they are and to accept them. Once you have accepted the situation as it is, you know where you are. Knowing where you are facilitates you taking action in the right direction to change things for the better . See also the law of Attitude. The Law of ttitude Attitude is the only weapon that can harm an individual. Nothing, absolutely nothing, can harm a human being but his or her own attitude. Each experience is put in its proper perspective and is hopefully resolved in a favorable manner . How you react toward those experiences, your attitude about them, determines how the experience af fects you. Only you can control and change your perception and A 10 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"your attitude towards life and your experiences. The choice of your attitude is yours. It is our attitude that determines the quality of our life and having the right attitude is one of the main keys to having a balanced and pleasant life. Having success and achieving our goals or failure to achieve our goals in life depend very much on the attitude we have towards life in general. Our thoughts and feelings determine our behavior patterns. Our innermost attitude, that we do not necessarily reveal to others, dictates our outlook on life and our interaction with the world at lar ge. When we are in harmony with our inner self this has a positive ef fect on our thoughts. If we are in conflict with our inner self, no matter how much we try to hide it, it will show itself in our attitude towards others. If we deal with our self with love and understanding, our attitude will project the same as we interact with our family , friends and strangers. See also the law of Gratitude. The Law of ratitude Although the Creator allows us to create through the absolute principle of Grace, gr atitude is a function of free will. Compliance with t his law does increase our heart's desire and heals old patterns. The law of Gratitude is that sense of satisfaction in knowing that ener gy , which has been given, receives its certain reward accor ding to its nature. Ener gy that is given moves out on that curved and unequal line and when extended far enough, can only return to its source bearing i ts appropriate gifts. It governs the process of petal unfoldment and so it demonstrates a triple law , the law of Solar Heat, the law of Solar Light and t he law G of Solar Fire. Y ou have heard it many times that an attitude of gratitude has the power to get you realizing your dreams at record speed. Why? Because gratitude completes the cycle of knowing. Remember , you cannot know what is without knowing what is not. What you like and what you hate are two ends of the same thing. For example, if you like being with your spouse and hate being separated from them, realize that you are working within the same essence , which is your spouse. It is because of the moments of absence that you appreciate and recognize the moments of presence. When you are grateful for both what you like and what you don't like, you complete the knowingness and you are released from having to experience what you don't like. This cannot be explained logically , but some very significant shifts occur in your mind and soul and you can feel thi s releasing shift whenever you are genuinely grateful for all things, even the ones you don't like. Gratitude will speed you through your growth and success more than any amount of hard work ever can. Gratitude completes the lesson, and as a statement of completion rings that tone of success, pulling to you the end result desired. Another way to put it is that you cannot leave a situation permanently unless you appreciate the gifts it brings you, and all situations bring a gift, no matter how terrible the situation may appear to be. This law ensures that you will always complete your knowing and embrace all that is before moving on. The way to put this law into practice is to be constantly grateful and thankful for what you have, never to complain when the going gets rough, but to 1 1 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"show gratitude at all times.

The Law of ove Love is the key to everything, building and disintegrating of forms and gives the ur ge to progress. The law of Love is one of the seven laws of the solar system and is the law of the astral plane, the plane of emotions. This law aims at the transmutation of the desire nature and links it up with the greater magnetism of the love aspect on the Buddhic plane. On the astral plane, the home of our desires, originate the feelings which we call personal love, in its lowest form it shows itsel f as animal passion. In the highest form it mani fests as pure love. W e are unfailingly responsible to act with love in every thought, word, deed, intent, motive and action. The stages of love in the personality devel ops with a simple and selfish love for the self, then expands to love of family and friends and more people, until it arrives at the stage of group love consciousness which is the characteristic of the soul. At this level one is a master of compassion, loves, suf fers with and is loyal to his kind. This love gradually develops from love for humanity to love of the universe and all forms of divine manifestation. The first love in the personality is L love for the three worlds, the second love in t he soul is for the solar system and the third, which is love of the Monad, demonstrates Cosmic Love. Love was the primary motive for manifestation, loves bears all on the path of return and love eventually perfects all. When one is aware of divine love as more than just an abstract principle, then one will realize that one can generate it at will, and direct it consciously , to accomplish whatever one decrees. Divine love for the Ascended Masters is a Presence, an Intelligence, a principle of Light, a Power , an Activity , and a Substance. Love is magic. When we refer to that great Love of Life it is the Scepter of Power . It is the law of all that is perfect. It is the illuminating power of all wisdom, and it is ener gy without limit to produce whatever manifestation we command to appear in action. W e are required to live our life with love. Love is the key and the motor of life. When you live your life with love you cannot go wrong. The three expressions of love are, love in the personality , love in the soul and love in the monad. The law of Love is that law which places the welfare, the concern and feeling for others above the self. The law of Love is that close af finity with all forces that you associate with as good, it is a force that denies the existence of evil in the world that resists not. For love follows the course of least resistance. The greatest gift that an entity can give to another is that portion of themselves which is given with love, which no strings attached and no expectations. In giving yourself, unconditionally , the spiritual self moves in communion between you and the other . Love is the building block of all things. Lov e is ener gy .

It is an actual substance; in fact it is the only substance that exists, taking on the appearance of many forms. Love is also acceptance. It is acknowledging that All Things Are One. That is acceptance. The law of love ensures that you see this truth. Y ou cannot leave an experience permanently unless you exit with love and acceptance. That is why people tend to keep repeating the same types of experiences until the day they stop hating and fighting it and instead embrace it with love and see what the situation holds for them, and heal it with love. This could be a money , health or relationship issue. It doesn't matter . Y ou cannot leave a situation permanently until you exit it with love. Y ou can't permanently get rid of what you hate; you can only leave it or transform it through love. This law ensures that you recognize the truth of unity and drop the illusions of separation.

Just flow with it! Resistance creates time, accepta nce creates miracles. Look at all this again and you wi ll see how time and ef fort are the creations of resistance against these unbreakable laws.

A desire for union and mer ger only arises when there is some sense ...some degree of separation. When there is no separation where the desire for union? Do we yearn to be one with our self? W ith our toe? Nose? As long as we seek 'union'- till this yearning for 'oneness' remains -it implies 'another'! It implies a master or god to revere outside us; and paradoxically we remain in separation...the veil however thinned... rema ins ....and the Godself that I am that what we really seek- cannot be .. Lot of us talk in terms of 'meeting' God or 'becoming one' with God, but we all have to become aware - that there is no God 'out there' to meet or even become one with. W e are going to grow into our awareness of being God. In analogy it's like me saying “when am I going to meet my adult Self, or my older Self!” But I'm never going to meet them ... I'm just going to grow into them surely! So we have to become aware that we are going to grow more and more into our awareness of our God Self; but as long as we desire to meet God or even 'become one' with God then you are going to have a God outside you to do that. If there's no God and if there's no Master then there is no 'lover' outside me too! As long as I'm seeking a lover , someone to love outside me then the veils are on! All of us want this one (or more) special person whether it is lover , husband, child, friend... But as long as I'm finding love through another then I'm not love within.

But you will know you reflect self, and thus will you never 'ne ed' another to feel, experience, view love, you'll never 'yearn' for another , it'll just 'be'.

Then there is no 'need', no desperation- you know you can reflect when you want, and what aspect you want! That's the point of existence- to enjoy the infinite, infinitesimal abundance that I am...! Happiness covers many states which we tend to club together as happiness!

It can be sexual, it can be food, it can be of other senses , but it is experienced in the body . Thus not only does it run What about abundance...that gives me happiness? What is happiness? itself out, it is also dependen t on some on or something outside you... and in the long run that becomes the problem rather than pleasure. Pleasure is experienced in the lower chakras. Happiness is more psychological ... it goes beyond the body .... there is a shift to higher chakra's.... it is now shifting to the intangible. Y et something outside you allows you to touch this within you. Then there is joy; joy is spiritual. And dif ferent from pleasure& happiness...as it's source is within. Y es it will reflect around you, but you will be the source, not the other or outer circumstances. Thus is it is not as transitory or fleeting or undulating...more a pervading sense of being. Indeed it can co-exist with states where everything is not what we would call 'happy' or 'perfect'! And beyond joy is bliss. It is neither physiological nor psychological nor spiritual. It is what I de scribe as a state of 'it is it is'...or what Indian scriptures describe as 'neti neti'...not this or that... where there is no opposite state which we would call displeasure or unhappiness or lack of joy! Indeed it is our natural state of being....and when all that stands in its way disappears....we are bliss! It knows no division, no other , no time....it is not union with Godself... it is not awareness of Godself...there is no self in bliss! Enjoy ....all states dearest beloveds!

Spiritually empty , these images are inflicted upon you, usually with the ulterior motive of making you buy things. Call it coercive beauty . But beauty is best enjoyed when you make the choice to seek it. This kind could be called soul- awakening beauty . A third type is customary beauty . Even an exquisite painting becomes a mere possession if you habitually see it the same way . How can you make it come alive again? Be willing to look long enough, dif ferently enough. When you find something new , joy will be your signal.Y ou have rediscovered soul- awakening beauty . All three kinds of beauty are part of a Beauty Scale. It ranges from coercive through customary to distinctively lovely . Once you understand this, you can choose where to position yourself along the continuum. Intention can move you from a low-end beauty experience to the kind that thrills your soul. Each day you start toward the low end because familiar surroundings (no matter how gor geous) are dulled by habit. But you can easily re-position yourself S tart by choosing one sense. Which will delight you most a sound, a sight, a touch, a smell, a taste? Decide, then pick your beauty object. It could be something you never noticed before, like one square inch of a table. S tay with it long enough to find its lotus-like heart of splendor . Or begin with something you already find beautiful and deepen your senses by adding something new . Put on a favorite shirt or fragrance, then ask inside for an original idea to link with it, for example, “Through this I explore a new quality of God's tenderness.” A person can be undernourished though fat. Similarly , though bombarded by images, you can long for real beauty . What will happen when you switch it on, full and strong, early in your day? W ith experience, moving up high on the Beauty Scale can be done in secods. All it tankes is practice. Whenever you seek and find soul-awakening beauty , the process changes you, opening up a channel to beauty's Source. Each channel works in two directions, both to and from Source. So your game of hide-and-seek for beauty creates new ways for the joy of God to find YOU. Sneaky , huh? All around you, heavenly choirs sing. The trick is to hear them through human ears. Whether auditory or otherwise, beauty for hum ans registers only when we are willing to receive it. This is one way to distinguish a beauty experience from a pain experience. If you're walking down the street and a piano fal ls on your foot, you'll notice. Pain grabs attention. Real music, however , is never inflicted upon you. T o hear really beautiful music (the kind that awakens your soul) you must meet it halfway . Background music may rightfully make you snooze. Dispassionately you recognize what's playing, but so what? T o open up delight, you must open the ears within your ears.

It's the subtle essence of many vegetables, from aspar agus to zucchini. t Sour provides the obvious contrast.

The historical literature \"suggests that there are unusual physical, as well as psychological, consequences in humans to the attainment of the exalted state of mind known as enlightenme nt,\" writes biochemist Colm Kelleher in a fascinating article published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration entitled \"Retrotransposons as Engines of Human Bodily T ransformation.\" \"These reported changes include, but are not limited to, sudden reversal of aging, emer gence of a light body and observed bodily ascension.\" While many of these descriptions associate the lightbody with death, Kelleher makes it clear that a number of reports indicate that \"transformation of the body can happen Independently of death.” The path of physical transcendence or bio-spiritual HIST ORICAL & SCIENTIFIC OVER VIEW OF ENLIGHTENMENT By Sol Luckman 19 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"enlightenment through lightbody activat ion was embraced as a reality in most of the ancient world. The death and resurrection of Christ and Osirus are two famous examples from the Near East. In the Middle Ages, a group known as the Cathars from southern France claimed to possess the secret gospel of Jesus called the Gospel of Love, believed to contain linguistic keys for creating the lightbody . After the existence of this text became known, the Roman church began to torture the Cathars in one of its infamous Inquisitions, killing millions of innocent people--at which point the Gospel of Love mysteriously disappeared. Ironically , owing to the stringent proof requirements for canonization of saints, the Catholic church maintains some of the most detailed records of paranormal phenomena associated with the lightbody , including several instances of individuals levitating, flying, or bilocating. It seems that the Gospel of Love was, among other things, a manual for creating the merkabah . The merkabah, according to investigative mythologist W illiam Henry , is the \"light body vehicle of resurrection and ascension that is the foundation of Hebrew mysticism. These texts make it clear that the Mer -Ka-Ba is a vehicle of light that emer ges from within the human body .” Henry points to the Resurrection, following which the doubting fingers of Thomas appear to enter Christ's transfigured, luminescent flesh, as one famous description of the completely activated lightbody . In an article entitled \"Finding the Holy Grail,\" psychologists Barry and Janae W einhold make a similar claim, pointing out on the basis of decades of in-depth historical research that the \"individual human body is the Holy Grail. It isn't something 'out there.' Like a tuning fork, the body can be tuned to dif ferent frequencies,\" including that of Source, through DNA activation. \"Many indigenous traditions of Mesoamerica believe that [Source] emits a frequency or tone known as 'Ge' that not only heals the body-mind-spirit but provides immortality ,\" write the W einholds, adding that the Spiritual practices used in the ancient mystery schools of Egypt and Greece employed a variety of ... vibrational tools to attune people's DNA to Source. This caused the DNA to ring, sing or vibrate so that it resonated with the tone of Ge--the frequency of Galactic Center . This attunement activated a San Graal or Song Grail--a \"love song in the blood\"-- creating a rainbow bridge that synchronized an initiate's consciousness with Source. This love song ener getically united Heaven (Galactic Center) with Earth (initiates), opening human hearts and pumping crystallized Ge-tuned blood through their bodies. From this perspective, \"Ge-sus\" is a Master Being sent from T ula or Galactic Center to help humanity attune its DNA to the frequency of Ge so that we can return to Source. In a nearly identical vein, Leonard Horowitz in DNA: Pirates of the Sacr ed Spiral writes that \"DNA seems to be transmitting the equivalent of heavenly love songs. From this music, played through genetic equipment, variations in sacred geometri c forms materialize in space.” The profound and numerous connections between the Egyptian Osirus and Jesus have been noted by generations of scholars. Among many other similarities, both are linked to the phoenix or heron, represented in hieroglyphics coming from Galactic Center , also (as indicated in the above quote by the W einholds) called T ula , carrying the key of life. In Egyptian hieroglyphics this key appears as an ankh , which may have been a type of actual tuning fork for harmonizing with Galactic Center , or may have merely symbolized techniques for producing this celestial harmonization. In either case, the ankh or key 20 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"of life is of a musical nature and designed to be employed along with a type of inspired (and inspiring) speech known as the Language of the Bir ds . This powerful combination, properly performed, keys DNA to build the Holy Grail or lightbody . The Language of the Birds, according to the W einholds who cite Henry's research, \"is a vowel- only phonetic code ... Genetic and linguistic research indicates that the five vowels correspond to the five letters used to represent DNA and RNA ... Initiates of the Language of the Birds who are able to speak or tone these vowels in certain ways know that these sounds permanently activate the DNA of all those who are able and willing to hear .” At the genetic level, such a radical activation, according to Kelleher's research in the mutable components of DNA called \"jumping\" DNA or transposons, occurs through a transposition burst involving the molecular rearrangement of perhaps thousands of genes. Consistent with Bruce Lipton's evidence that consciousness can alter genetic expression ( The Biology of Belief ) and David W ilcock's compelling model of spontaneous evolution that simultaneously transmutes both consciousness and biology (\"A Scientific Blueprint for Ascension\"), Kelleher insists that true enlightenment, in addition to being a mental state, appears to have physical consequences. The \"appearance of a light body as a result of attaining enlightenment ... could be described as the emer gence of a new species in a single generation from humanity ,\" he writes, adding that a \"synchronized, non random transposition burst is the most simple molecular mechanism to account for the required new configuration.” While pointing out based on the historical literature that lightbody creation appears to occur only \"in humans who have attained spiritual mastery ,\" Kelleher emphasizes the existence of \"stages on the road to ... enlightenment [that are] experienced by a great number of ordinary pe ople.\" This supports the potential ef fectiveness of a step-by- step process, such as DNA activation, to bio-spiritual enlightenment in which transposons are incrementally stimulated in preparatory phases--culminating in a \"synchronized, non random transposition burst\" when, and only when, the individual is consciously prepared to experience it. In one apocryphal text known as the Pistis Sophia , Jesus (considered a master of the Language of the Birds) discourses on the afterlife in terms that appear straight out of the Egyptian Book of the Dead . Henry calls this \"the first lesson of the Mer -Ka-Ba mysticism.\" \"Y ou are to seek after the mysteries of the Light,\" Jesus is quoted as saying, \"which purify the body and make it into refined light.” Later , Jesus describes the connection between our dimension and higher dimensions as operating \"from within outwards\"--a statement, according to Henry , that \"refers to a transformation of consciousness that opens the door to other worlds.\" Similarly , in the Bible Jesus insists, The Kingdom of Heaven is within . Dr . Horowitz's meticulous research leads him to af firm the material truth of this assertion: \"The bioacoustic and electromagnetic matrix through which the Holy Spirit flows is real. It's what animates your DNA [by transmitting] the Kingdom of Heaven to you, and through you, right now , on Earth as it is in Heaven.” Another important figure from the Mediterranean associated with the lightbody is the Egyptian Thoth, called Hermes T rimegistus by the Greeks and considered the father of alchemy . Thoth is credited with the enormously influential phrase \"As above, so below .\" Of the many seemingly miraculous gifts he brought his people, ar guably the bird-headed Thoth's most important legacy is the doctrine of inner or spiritual light that can literally metamorphose the human body into a physiology of divine radiance. 21 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Interestingly , Thoth was also revered as the creator of writing and his alchemical science of transformation, like that of Jesus, is associated with the Language of the Birds. The lightbody is also a theme in the ancient mystical traditions of Central and South America. A variety of mythical figures exist similar to the Incan god-man Amanumuru, who according to legend walked through a portal called the Muru Doorway and returned via the Black Road to his true home among the stars. In what is today Mexico, a figure known as Quetzalcoatl embodied the higher light of divinity . Judith Bluestone Polich has called Quetzalcoatl \"the Osirus of Mesoamerica\" and sees him as symbolizing the bridging of duality , a being who \"represents light in physical form ... freed from the confines of matter .\" Daniel Pinchbeck's fascinating new book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl of fers another insightful perspective on this highly complex figure from myth, legend, and--perhaps-- reality . It seems poetic justice that Quetzalcoa tl is usually depicted as a serpent with bird wings--an obvious reference to the ability of DNA (symbolized by the serpent, as in Jeremy Narby's The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge ) to transform one into an angelic being capable of f/light, which is an excellent definition of the merkabah. Equally important is that Quetzalcoatl is thought to have revitalized the great ceremonial center of T eotihuacan, believed by some archeologists to be Earth's interdimensional gateway to the legendary T ula, the celestial home of Quetzalcoat l--and perhaps other \"messianic\" herons or phoenixes who arrived in this dimension carrying the key of life, or the knowledge of how to inspire (\"breathe life\") by speaking or singing the bio-spiritual Language of the Birds. © , all rights reserved.

It became a necessity because her beak was now crooked, her feathers old and tattered such that they couldn't keep her in flight, and her talons weak and weary . She could no longer hunt herself. Just as she had taken care of her children, now it was their turn to take care of her . In fact, some of them took care of her for another few decad es as she become incapable of doing it herself. Some of Anti's siblings left their new home to explore the world on their own, and Mother Eagle understood. She saved them on that night knowing that not all would stay . Some had to pave their own path, even if it meant they would die at a young age without their siblings or family to care for them when their own beaks would curve and talons would weaken. S till, it did not matter because when the soul calls from within an eagle, the eagle must respond. Upon reaching the 40th year of her life, Mother Eagle knew it was finally time to give her life to the Great Spirit. Anti and his few remaining siblings carried Mother Eagle to the highest rock within hundreds of miles and they laid her there to rest. Upon this rock, she knew there would be no food and so she continued to stand proud until she was so weak that her talons could no longer hold her up. Not long after her body collapsed onto the rock, wings hanging heavily over the sides like wet clothes set out to dry , she took her final breaths. And upon that last exhilation, she saw the green light of compassion eminating from the Great Spirit as it lifted her into the clouds above. Meanwhile, back at home only Anti and one other remained -- his brother Quidel. As the oldest, Anti's responsibility was to protect all of his si blings just as Mother had done, and Anti had done so with joy and diligence. That is, until, another storm came. Again, the lightning violently struck the tree that he and Quidel were perched upon. Anti knew his brother would be fine though because over the years he had taught him to be prepared for the worst. Anti leapt into the sky knowing Quidel would follow . But Quidel didn't. Anti looked back to see Quidel's body split in half and burst into flames in just the same place and way the tree had been. It was a perfect hit, a bull's eye as they say . Anti didn't see this as perfect, but he had no choice except to turn his head and continue back to safety . All the way back, he mourned and wondered why these storms often wrought havok among his family . Not long passed before Anti's talons began to become weary and his beak began to curl. His fe athers were becoming old and had dif ficulty sustaining him in flight, and he knew his time was now coming ju st as his mother's had before him. And just like the lightning had split Quidel in two, this new awareness struck fear into Anti's heart more fiercely than anything he had ever experienced before. Simply put, he wasn't ready to die and he knew it! Of course, what he wanted didn't really matter because his body was telling him it was time. Knowing he had very little time remaining, Anti spent his last ener gy flying to the same rock where his mother gave her soul to the Great Spirit. He found some solace in knowing that he and his mother will have departed in the same way , from the same place. Unfortunately , he could not make it there. He slowly floated back to the ground because his feathers were so worn that no matter how hard he flapped them, he could not lift of f again. Then an unmistakable vision came into his awareness... he saw himself on the fateful night of Quidel's death. Anti felt trapped in a cone of flame, his body burning to ashes as he saw himself flying away . Anti couldn't understand what this vision was trying to tell him, but he knew it was important. The vision 24 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"dissipated, and he was left again looking at the sky feeling as though he'd never make it back to the rock for his final meeting with the Great Spirit. Moments later , a giant bird unlike anything he had ever seen before dove straight at him fro m miles above. Anti shook his head at the irony because he intended to give himself to the Great Spirit, not to a giant bird! He quickly learned that life does not always turn out as he expects. The giant bird opened its mouth wide and picked Anti up entirely in it so that only the blac kness this bird's closed mouth could be seen. When the darkness finally left and the light returned, Anti looked to see the giant bird in front of him hovering next to the rock that Anti had been incapable of reaching on his own. As he looked into the giant bird's eyes he knew that he was looking at his brother , Quidel, reborn. Quidel understood that just as he had faced his own death and rebirth, Anti must face his own death. Quidel gave a nod, and like a lightning bolt, he left even more quickly than he had arrived. Over Anti's last numbered days he became weak and weary just as his mother did. His talons slowly became weaker and weaker , and his body drooped more and more. His feathers had become so ragged that even if he wanted to fly , even if he had the strength to fly , they would be unable to hold him in the air . As Anti slipped in and out of consciousness, he had an incredible vision. An aura of green light surrounded him and the rock he was slouched over and the Great Spirit's presence gave Anti the awareness that his life did not have to be over . His mother did not know this when she left, but there was another way . Then the aura faded, the Great Spirit left, and all that was left was a battered and torn eagle upon a rock in the sky . Suddenly , Anti knew what had to be done and he mustered up all the strength he had to repeatedly batter his beak against the rock. He did this so fiercely that half of his beak broke of f and brought forth the most excruciating pain he had ever known... a pain that reminded him of what Quidel must have felt when he was struck by the lightning. In this newfound understanding, Anti also realized that he could live for many more days without food. He didn't understand how this was possible or even how he could know this, but it didn't matter because he knew it to the core of his being. During the following days, his beak grew back to its original length, but without the curl it was now sharp and useful again. He then plucked all of his feathers, one by one, until he had none left. Just like his beak, over many days the feathers grew back in fresh until the final day when Anti pulled upon his last ounces of strength and gently glided down to the earth where he slowly fed his way back to full health. Anti lived another several decades and enjoyed raising his own family . He taught his children of the many hunting tricks he knew , of some stunningly beautiful aerial maneuvers, but most of all, he taught them what he had learned about being reborn. He told them the stories of lightning and thunder , of fire and rock, and he passed to them the deep understanding that even when their beaks curled and their feathers could no longer hold them in flight, death was not a guarantee. Anti made sure they understood that when this time of life comes, they will be faced with the most dif ficult decision of their entire lives.

In astronomy , as in all sciences, one can detect an object in one of two ways: either by observing it directly , or observing the ef fect that it has on other objects. This is a basic tenet of astronomy . It's always been known that there was matter in the night sky that we couldn't really directly see. When astronomers use telescopes, or even radio telescopes, they can only see objects that emit light or radio waves. Not all of the matter in the universe does this - for instance, we wouldn't be able to see planets like our own, because they would be too dim to see. The human body would be totally invisible in a darkened space for instance, as it does not emit light. All the mass of all the planets in our solar system is significantly less than one percent of the Sun's mass. So worrying about matter that didn't shine - non-luminous matter - wasn't of great concern. The first evidence that there was a significant amount of matter that we couldn't readily see was in investigating clusters of galaxies, which are simply aggregates of a few hundred to a few thousand clusters otherwise isolated in space. This by the way , constitutes a lot of matter . In the thirties, two scientists named Zwicky and Smith both examined closely two relatively nearby clusters, the Coma cluster and the V ir go cluster . They looked at the individual galaxies making up the clusters individually , and the velocities of the clusters. What they found was that the velocities of the galaxies were about a factor of ten to one hundred times lar ger than they expected. In other words, these galaxies were moving much faster than what they should have been. What did that mean? W ell, in a group of galaxies like a cluster , the only important force acting between the galaxies is gravitation. It is the pulling of the galaxies on each other that gives rise to their velocities. The velocities can indicate the total mass inside the cluster in two ways. The first way is simple; the more mass in the cluster , the greater the forces acting on each galaxy , which accelerates the galaxies to higher velocities. Cosmologists like to talk about the amount of matter in the universe in terms of a parameter called Omega . Omega is defined so that a closed universe - a universe that is massive enough that it eventually collapses back onto itself - has Omega lar ger than 1. An 'open' universe is one that expands outwards forever and has Omega less than 1. A 'flat' universe is perfectly balanced between the two and has an Omega value of exactly 1. The amount of visible matter in the universe is about Omega = 0.05; not very much at all. Theoreticians like to believe that for the universe, the total of all of the mass is Omega = I. This would mean that dark matter makes up the other Omega = 0.95. In other words, 95% of the universe would be dark matter! Most of us did not learn this in high school. W e learned that matter consisted of protons, electrons, and neutrons. Science has learned that there are literally thousands of dif ferent particles of matter that have never been seen before. Unfortunately , none of these make up dark matter either . Most of the universe is made up of a form of matter that no scientist understands!! This gives way to an intriguing question. Is the curr ent condition of the human body a natural state? 27 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Could it be that a more evolved, more exotic state of matter is the truly natural condition of the human form? Could that exotic state of matter be related to the human body of light? There has been wide spread speculation among scientists about what might constitute the dark matter . For thousands of years, mystics, philosophers, spiritual teachers, and theol ogians have taught that the universe as we see it is an illusion. They have taught that a lar ger , more complex universe exists beyond our senses and is the true home of humanity . What is this lar ger universe composed of? W e know that dark matter can be such normal things as planets; and while normal Earth-like planets aren't particularly massive, perhaps such things as Jupiter s could be the dark matter . There are a couple of problems with this scenario. First, we assume that planets only form around stars; and if that's the case, than even huge planets are dwarfed by the stars near them. They can only contribute a few percent of their mass - another Omega = 0.005 or so, which clearly isn't enough. Suf fice it to say , there isn't enough normal matter in the universe to explain the way things are, even with our best theories. Exotic matter doesn't have to be all that exotic; it just is matter that isn't electrons, protons, or neutrons. Lots of such particles are known to exist, and some have been theorized to exist to solve the dark matter problem. Unfortunately , none of these theorized particles have bothered to show up in our What might the Dark Matter Be? Ordinary Matter Planets 'Exotic Matter best experiments. Neutrinos are an example of a particle tha t is known to exist. It is currently thought to have no mass, but there has been recent evidence that it might have some very small mass. There are so many neutrinos in the universe, however , that even a small mass would be important for dark matter . So far however , we have not found this to be the case. Most other exotic matter candidates fall into the category of WIMPS , or W eakly Interacting Massive Particles. These are, as a class, heavy particles that only interact weakly with other matter (or else they would have been discovered by now .) There are many possible such particles, going under such exotic names as neutralinos, axions, and the like. One final possibility , although somewhat extreme, is that we don't really understand gravity particularly well. Perhaps gravity on lar ge scales, such as the size of galaxies, doesn't work the same way as gravity does on the small scales we can measure. Although that seems odd, it should be considered as a possibility . This leaves a lot of room for the existence of forms of matter yet to be discovered. Even more vexing and perhaps more closely related to the question of the body of light is the existence of dark ener gy . Dark ener gy hit the scene in the late 1990s when astronomers discovered the universe is not just expanding, but racing out at an ever -faster pace. Some hidden force, a sort of anti- gravity , must be pushing galaxies apart from one Neutrinos WIMPS Changes to Gravity Dark Energy 28 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"another in this accelerated expansion. Separate theories have been devised to try and solve each mystery . T o explain dark ener gy , for example, theorists have re-employed a “cosmological constant” that Einstein first introduced as a fudge factor to balance the force of gravity . Einstein called the cosmological constant a great blunder and retracted it. Y et many theorists are now comfortable re-employing it to account for the ef fects of dark ener gy . But it does not reveal what the force is. There have been quite a few attempts to find one explanation to both dark matter and dark ener gy . Dark ener gy , which many experts say is likely to remain mysterious for decades, might involve an outside “vacuum ener gy” that acts upon our universe, which many theorists suspect is just one www .tybro.com © , all rights reserved Mitchell Earl Gibson MD 29 YSR OCT OBER 2007 amid many . (1) So we have two very , very exotic forms of matter and ener gy that dominate the universe as we know it. Dark matter and dark ener gy are exceptionally abundant. They not only exist within the stars and planets, but also within the human form. Do spiritual exercises and meditations cause the rele ase of this exotic form of matter from our bodies? Does our DNA encode for a transitory connection between physical matter and the more exotic states of matter that possibly compose the body of light?

Did you develop the habit of imaging the day ahead as you would like it to be? Or did you come up with images and feelings for wishes FULFILLED, feeling as though you had your wishes already? If you have done it more than once, GREA T! If you happened to do it even for a week out of the month, you probably felt the results, giving you more joy in life. Best results happen if you set up a habit every day , best in the morning. Even three minutes will be rewarded. I was teaching the Living fr om V ision course in French during the fourth week we were in Key W est to be with dolphins. I taught a French-Canadian group. They were incredibly loving, which was a real gift at the end of four intensely packed weeks of 15 hours a day of work. In the first group we had a bad apple and it just wouldn't change. She felt she was above it all, knew it all, and tried to sow doubt in the mind of others. I couldn't do anything but keep imaging around me the kind of world I wanted to experience. I felt sorry for some of the participants as it took some time for some to see through her games, but in the end many did. The doubters sat in their misery at dinner , sending critical remarks to each other , while the other side of the table had people appreciating each other , laughing, sharing. It looked like I was sitting between heaven and hell. I don't get into such situations often, and Co-Cr eation Part IV By Ilona Selke 30 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"therefore I nearly doubted my self for having 'created' such a chasm around myself. But I kept on seeing and feeling myself in the company of love. The second group was already my dream fulfilled, but when it became such a symphony of love during the fourth week, when around me in very real terms, people poured love out to me and everyone around us, I felt almost like I couldn't believe my 'luck.' My question to you is: W as it luck, or did the world around me reflect my inner “feeling the future fulfilled”? Let me take this a little further . At the end of the stay in Key W est I ran across two men, each of whom were writers. One wrote a book, the other felt like he should be writing and I was in the process of writing a book. The two men, unbeknownst to each other told me about their version of luck. For some reason this was the most exciting topic they had landed on in their writing and thinking about life. The first man told me how he was into betting on sports-outcomes. He felt he had discovered that the human psyche was predictable, that masses of people acted like a wave and were predictable as a wave would be. He had risen above the seemingly separate events and realized the connectedness with all things. Remember the Newtonian scientists who had realized that life acted according to specific laws, seeing each thing as a separate item acting in concord with immutable laws? This man was more like the quantum physicist who came along and who observed that everything that looked like parts, really was part of a wave. Light was not only observable as billiard-balls but also as a wave. W e usually think of ourselves as individuals, but really we act unconsciously in unison. How often does it happen that within a few minutes we get 3 orders for the same item, and then not again for a week! This man who told me of his understanding of luck had discovered a way to perch himself above the billiard balls and instead of everything being separate, he was able to predict the wave. T rend-readers have that ability , or fashion designers, as well as music writers, who catch a current. The other writer told me his version of luck: He felt it was an ener gy , that inhabited a person, inexplicably lending him super - powers. Upon a touch of a knowing other person, he would suddenly loose such luck, which now instead was pulled into this someone else. He had observed gambling too. Gambling exhibits the belief in luck to the fullest. Now what does this have to do with you? I realized that our culture, and for that matter in every culture, you find humans who are hoping for better luck. They just can't figure out how to make it happen. W inning a lottery ticket, or winning at a gamble, is the hope for the masses for a better life. Believing in luck is like saying that one has not figured out how to co-create. And they don't exactly teach “How to Co-cr eate 101” in high school either . No wonder that we as humans, resort to a pleading prayer or it's cousin 'hope' for a lottery ticket. 31 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Ask yourself what you currently feel about luck, success, and how responsible you are for what you experience in your life. Believing in luck is like trying to give an inexplicable reason when we observe positive outcomes in our three-dimensional world, and we don't understand the connection between cause and ef fect. Imagine for a moment you are a Flatlander . This is a being that understands only two dimensions. Really if you had a shape you would be flatter than a piece of paper . Now imagine you could only observe reality between two flat surfaces, like the top of a table and a board that was six inches above the table top. Imagine you saw two fat fingers coming from above into view , until they hit the table top. Now remember you would only see two-dimensionally . What would the fingers look like? Y es, like to flat ribbons coming from above. Y ou would not see or be able to conceive of a hand that connected the two ribbons, which were actually two columns, both being attached to the same unit, namely the hand. W ell, as a flatlander your perception would be tied to the two dimensions you are capable of perceiving. W e would be rather hampered, but defend we would what we could know . After all, all our Flatlander scientific equipment would also be invented by our two-dimensional minds and would not be able to prove, other that in theory , that other dimensions existed. W e as humans are in the same predicament. W e usually can't go into the fourth dimension to perceive the unity there, and we cannot see how things go together . W e don't understand how our psychic or ener gy- body actually precedes the physical manifestation. But if we could, we would see how our thoughts and feelings pre-create a mold, a blue-print, so to speak, a pattern of ener gy , according to which we would find that the physical world shapes itself. Seeing luck is a similar way of observing seemingly unrelated outcomes, usually of good fortune, and not knowing how to create the outcome on command. W e don't see or usually understand, how our mind, emotions and our visions tap into the fourth dimension and co-creates the “luck.” Here is a little story of how one of our teachers of the Living Fr om V ision course in Germany utilized the methods of the course to manifest something he really wanted: An Audi convertible, at about $30.000 US at the time. He worked for three weeks with the CDs every morning, which helped him focus his mind and emotions in a particular sequence on his wish as if it was fulfilled. That Audi was giving him a feeling of being on top of the world, and instead of imaging the Audi, he imaged being on top of a mountain. (I have altered his imagery , but the content is the same). After three weeks the Lottery called him to let him know that he had won the grand prize of, yes you guessed it, an Audi. “What color is it?” he asked. “Red” they replied. “Oh, I had imagined a blue one,” he laughed. It was a red instead of blue like he had imaged but all the other details were the same. Now I ask you: W as it the Lottery that gave him the unbelievable luck, or was it his imagery that got him the results? If you start looking behind curtain for the workings of luck, you will see that it is not an arbitrary force, but rather the universal ener gy around you forming according to what you create as a blue-print in your mind and heart first. In ef fect, you are the designer that dreams your dream. 32 YSR OCT OBER 2007"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Her e is how you do it: Think of something you want.

When you are not sleeping, you are aware. When you are awake, you have the capacity to be aware. The fact that you are aware is confirmation that your Conscious Mind is dominant and in control. The Conscious Mind is the gatekeeper to the giant Subconscious Mind. God gave us a Conscious Mind so that we could decide which of God's miracles are for us. Y et, so many of us do not believe they are worthy of miracles.

Our Subconscious Mind controls how we breathe, the actions of our heard, the circulation of blood, digestion, all secretions and all excretions.

The Subconscious Mind carries out the best aspects given to it, providing your Conscious Mind does not intercept and change its course. The Subconscious Mind heals the body and keeps it in good health, it it's directed to do so by you. Y our Subconscious Mind is your soul, and this soul is infinite. Y our Subconscious Mind is in direct contact with the Universal Superconscious Mind of God. Y our Subconscious Mind is the creator , it will create into reality what ever the Conscious Mind commands and you control your Conscious Mind. Y ou tell God what you desire, and God tells you HOW to get it. Even the Bible states: “Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be open to you.” It's amazing that so few believe it and even fewer use it to their good.
