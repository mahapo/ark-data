cartes (1596-1650) took the liberty to divide our world into two domains, a material domain and a spiritual domain. The spiritual domain became the subject of religion and the material domain was allotted to science. It was the start of an independent journey of a scientific community of scholars freeing themselves from the hitherto dogmatically established scientific facts dictated by Christianity with the Bible in their hands as the only source of holy truth. Now after three hundred years since Descartes intro duced the segregation of science and religion, science seems to come full ci rcle; in a small but growing scientific community science has entered the domain of spirituality! The bridge between science and spirituality has already been c rossed! When quantum physics in the 20 th century could no longer rule out the possibility that human consciousness has a real effect on physi cal reality at the sub atomic level, scientists started to discover things about our reality that seemed to corroborate the tenets held by esoteric teachings. Esoteric teachings have been kept alive in spiritual traditions such as the Vedi c scriptures, the Jewish Kabbalah, and in secret Gnostic circles such as the Freemason ry, who counted many famous leaders and scholars in their midst. ( \u0001 ) The things you are about to read in this book are t he discoveries made by many leading scholars in various fields of science, amon g them celebrated professors of famous universities. I have come to believe that th e revolutionary scientific discoveries that were made in the last decades of t he 20 th century, of which only a fraction will be discussed in this book, will ult imately change our current scientific paradigms and along with it our societie s. Changes may not go fast, since science has become j ust as dogmatic as the religious roots it departed from! However in an eve r-increasing speed of our evolution, social changes happen much faster than t hree hundred years ago in the time of Descartes. The Cartesian materialistic w orldview, the blind belief that there is only a material cause for everything in th e universe is the inheritance of science and has dominated our Western beliefs about our reality for hundreds of years. However I believe our current worldview will eventually be replaced by a new vision that is dawning in a small community of scientific pioneers. This new scientific vision seems to come in a time that we desperately need new answers to the problems we’re facing. Humanity has come to a crossroad. If we continue to travel the road we’re on, we may not su rvive the end of the 21st century. We’re facing immense ecological problems a nd the climate changes that have become apparent seem already irreversible. The re is upheaval in every corner of this globe and the trend seems to be that this violence gets more and more extreme as the years pass. World cultures have become divided, polarizations between clashing religions tend to ra dicalize groups within our societies. The threat of terrorism poses a real dan ger to the world’s stability. We are perfectly able to destroy ourselves if we do no t take a different course. Globally the pressure is building to make some radi cal changes and head for a different course. Is there still hope for humanity?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 7 At first sight the idea may seem preposterous given the situation sketched above, but spiritual sources believe that Gaia, Mother Ear th is currently in the process of a transformation now she is moving from the Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius ending a 75,000-year evolutional cycle. Al l leading world religions have end-time prophecies and we’ve had many prophets pro claiming them, Jesus Christ, Mohamed, Nostradamus and Edgar Cayce to nam e a few. The transformation the Earth is supposed to undergo was given many names such as the ‘Second coming of Christ’, ‘the new Jerusalem’, ‘Ascension’. Our current time bears many of the hallmarks of the se prophecies, could it be we are indeed in the midst of these transformational c hanges right now? Many New- Age researches believe that this is exactly the cas e. The transformation on Earth is supposedly to have started somewhere in the eigh ties of the previous age and should culminate around 2012. When I first heard of such claims I dismissed them o ut of first hand, you will probably too if this book is the first one you read about the subject! After reading and studying a lot of material that s upports these claims, I’ve lost a lot of my skepticism and have come to believe that we live in a very special lifetime indeed. The topic itself vibrates with my core being. For as long as I can remember I have felt that things could be so much d ifferent in our world and it has finally brought me to write this book. It’s my little contribution to a better world by sharing this information with you such tha t it could make a difference in the world that needs it so badly in these troubled times. This book is not about ‘the end of the world’, the ‘Armageddon’; on the contrary, it’s about the end of the old world that you and I know today and the birth of a brighter new one. For the most part this book is based on sound scien tific ‘proof’ that may corroborate the claims made above, it is not based on popular New Age metaphysical ideas. However I will introduce in the final chapter some ‘unorthodox’ sources such as the channeled work of ‘the Law of One’ that may not appeal to you. I included this source since for many it may be very convincing. I invite you to use your intuition as well when you absorb the material discussed within this book. Many of the things you’re about t o read in this book are not easily accepted by our materialistic brainwashed mi nds. In the Western civilized world we’ve come to rely only on scientific facts ( left brain male logic), whereas in the East it is said to be true if it is personally experienced (right brain female intuition). I invite you to use both and find out w hat’s true for you! I can perfectly image you’re very skeptical about t he subject of this book and the things you’re about to read. Skepticism is a sound mechanism while evaluating new concepts. However I’d like to give you also the suggestion that skepticism may be used as a defense mechanism by the ego to pr otect us from being wrong. By being a skeptic we accept the world as it is, it is a safe haven, a status quo. If we don’t let in any new believes, we cannot be affe cted in our core existence and can go about our business as usual. Skeptics are of ten in good company since they join the masses. However skepticism may also b e a hindrance that stops us from learning. It takes courage to allow yourself t o ponder the new concepts in this book. In this respect this book is not an easy read and it will require an open mind. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 8 The majority of the material in this book is inspir ed and based on the works of David Wilcock. We’ll come to discuss him as we progr ess with this book. I think David Wilcock plays a vital role in the unfo lding of a new scientific awareness, a global shift in consciousness, for he is much more than just another scientist, we’ll reveal that later! He has written three important books available for download on his website www.ascension2000.com . His work is getting recognition in scientific circles. The author of this book does not have a professiona l scientific education and or background and therefore there may be errors in thi s book, my own misinterpretations of complex scientific matters. H owever I invite you to get the broader picture and not get stuck in the details of my little mistakes if such were the case. This book will also focus into the prophecies of Ed gar Cayce (1877 - 1945), the last great prophet who in the last century so accur ately predicted the ‘World changes’ that I have come to believe are now unfold ing. I hope this book will bring some hope and light in this world that needs it so badly. Personally, I have come to believe that ther e’s a shining and bright future waiting ahead of us, but it takes our belief and fa ith to shape it! I hope this book will fire a spark of wonder and cu riosity in you such that you will go out and find the truth for yourself! Jan Wicherink, 25 June 2004 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 9 Chapter 1 Earth changes Our dear mother Earth, Gaia is suffering under the stress of human endeavors that have become unbearable as the world population keeps growing at an unfathomable rate. The present world population cou nts 6 billion souls and will grow to 10 billion by 2030 and 20 billion by 2070 i f the present growth rate is maintained. Humanity alone already consumes 40% of the net prim ary production of food and energy that the Earth has available for its entire species on Earth. In the last thirty years alone more than a third of the natural resources were destroyed due to human endeavor. Our rivers are polluted and our oceans are dying. Gaia is no longer able to cope with the beatings sh e’s had and we are going to experience the results rather sooner than later, it ’s only a matter of time. We no longer have to believe scientist who claim tha t ‘global warming’ cannot be proven and that Earth is doing well. Everyone with eyes to see and ears to hear should have noticed by now that our climate is chan ging. By the end of this century the poles will have melted away, our oceans will be polluted to the core, the rainforests the lungs of our Earth will have go ne and two third of all animal species on Earth will be extinct! Even in this alarming state the most of us seem mor e bothered about our annual compensation for inflation and the results of our f avorite soccer club in the champion’s league than about the acid rain that’s f alling on our roofs. If we have a glance in the newspapers every day, we may get th e impression the word is getting more violent by the day. The Middle East is in a state of turmoil, and the threat of terrorism after 911 has become so imminen t that it affects the lives of millions already. The polarizations and intolerance between world cultures and religions are rapidly increasing. Many are also experiencing dramatic changes in thei r personal lives. Intimate relations and marriages seem to break up more easil y and frequently than ever before in the past. Our good old nine to five jobs that seemed to guarantee us an easy passage to retirement are gone and job rotatio n has become the buzzword! Burnouts among managers are commonplace and we see many drop outs in this rat race. Our Western economies that were so very stable for d ecades seem very imbalanced these days and employment in the West on a large scale is lost in favor of the developing countries that are waiting for their economic boosts! Economic developments seem to take place in an ever -increasing speed; the time to market for new products has become unbelievably short. In many cases the product is already outdated before its introduction on the market. And then there are these billion dollar state deficits of our worl d economies that have become so heavy that they may collapse under their own weight . Even our political structures, the established part ies that once were the corner stones and glues of our society have become unpredi ctable. New parties with radical political ideas arise out of the blue and t ake on loads of followers in their wake, much to the horror and surprise of the establ ishment. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 10 On a large scale corruption and money laundry scand als seem to surface in which prestigious global multinational companies are invo lved. Our world is changing, and it is changing fast, it even feels as if time itself is going faster isn’t it? What is going on in our worl d today and what is it leading too? Prophecies The world has known many prophets and many of them predicted destruction and despair at the new millennium which seems such a ma gical time for the world to end. This has not only been prophesised for the sec ond millennium but it was prophesised for the first millennium as well and as we all stand to testify, this catastrophe did not come to pass. Then there are other seers such as Nostradamus (150 3- 1566), who prophesised that mankind by the year 2000 would either suffer a n apocalyptic holocaust or would see unprecedented change and the birth of a n ew global consciousness. ( \u0001 ) Madame Blavatsky (1831-1891), mystic and founder of the Theosophical Society predicted that at the closing of a 5200-year period , the present Kali Yuga or Dark Age would be succeeded by an age of light. So there is still hope! The most prominent seer of the last century undoubt edly is Edgar Cayce (1877- 1945). He is the best-documented clairvoyant ever. Edgar Cayce, known as the sleeping prophet has performed 14.306 ‘readings’ wh ile asleep in an altered state of consciousness all of which were documented. Edga r Cayce became very famous for his medical ‘readings’, since he could w ith an almost hundred percent accuracy diagnose the ailment of his patients. In m ost cases he would even mention the name and address of the physician to co nsult! All of this while in a state of trance knowing only the name of the patien t whom he never met! In the latter days of his ‘career’ he began to pass on inf ormation about past civilizations such as about the Egyptian and Atlantean culture an d also foretold events of the future of this planet that became known as the ‘Ear th changes’. Edgar Cayce himself founded the ‘Association for Research and E nlightenment’ (A.R.E.) to preserve his own legacy. This organization still ex ists today and is very active. Edgar Cayce has been studied at length, more than t hree hundred books were dedicated to this mystical man alone. ( \u0002 ) Today Edgar Cayce still puzzles many people because already a great number of his predictions were proven right and a lot of scho lars mostly archaeologists and Egyptologists have learned to take his information very seriously and use it as a beacon in their scientific endeavors. Cayce suggested that the years between 1958 and 199 8 would be of a great global transformation, however these changes would not lead to the end of the world but to the dawning of a New Age. One of the s trongest arguments that Cayce used often was that the future is not predete rmined and that much depends on human intention to shape the future. In this respect he left room open for other outcomes of his own predictions."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 11 The sleeping prophet also glimpsed into the past of human history and gave detailed information about ancient civilizations su ch as the Egyptian. Hundreds of his readings discussed the lost continent of Atlant is that submerged in the Atlantic Ocean 10,500 years B.C. during a global ca taclysm, a flooding caused by the shifting of the Earth’s poles. He described the Atlantean civilization as the most advanced civilization of human history. Cayce also mentions the Hall of Records, a library of Atlantean knowledge that was saved after the inundation by survivors of the sinking Atlantis in two places on Earth, one of them should reside between the left pawn of the Sphinx and the Nile at the Giza plateau and the other place is Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula of the Ma yas. According to Cayce the Great Pyramid (pyramid of Cheops or Khufu) at the G iza plateau in Egypt, was built 10.500 BC by Toth the Atlantean also known as Hermes Trismegistus by the Greek and the high priest Ra-Ta both survivors of A tlantis. They built the Great Pyramid in order to preserve the Atlantean culture. Edgar Cayce explained that he himself is the reincarnation of Ra-Ta, the high pri est who joined in the construction of the Great Pyramid. According to Cayce most of modern-day science and t echnology is simply a rediscovery of technologies that once belonged to t he Atlantean culture. And as we will demonstrate in this book, indeed an ancient knowledge is resurfacing again shedding a whole new light on science and is helping to shape a new ether science. Bits and pieces of the Atlantean knowledge have been secretly preserved in secret societies such as the Freemasonry. A lot of the original knowledge however was lost, but the fundamentals of this new science has been preserved in an old art of science known as ‘sacred geometry’ that now has been reconstructed. Leonardo da Vinci was a member of such a secret soc iety who throughout modern history of man preserved the art of sacred geometry in his art forms. The Roman Catholic Church forbade this pagan knowledge since the Holly scriptures of the Bible was all that was required and allowed. The subject of Leonardo da Vinci’s secret society m embership has received worldwide attention since Dan Brown wrote a book abo ut it called the ‘Da Vinci Code’. Although the book is mostly about the suppos ed marriage of Jesus and Maria Magdalene and their offspring, it also hints at the fact that Leonardo da Vinci stressed the importance of the Golden Mean, P hi. In this book we will show you that scientists are using sacred geometry, the geometry of Phi, to create a whole new physics based on the importance of the Go lden Mean, Phi! The ‘Holy Grail’ that is being discussed in the ‘Da Vinci Code ’ I believe is neither about a physical object, the cup used at the last supper of Jesus nor his royal blood line (‘sang real’) but in fact is about the preservation of sacred geometry and the significance of the Golden Mean that humanity is no w rediscovering! Crop circles Among all above-mentioned Earth changes taking plac e in our tine of human history an almost neglected strange and ridiculed p henomenon is happening; the appearance of crop circles all around the globe in the last two decades. To date some ten thousand crop circles have been reported a nd cataloged. Many claim them to be hoaxes and indeed many of them probably are as the infamous couple Doug & Dave misled the world in 1991 flattening the c rops with their wooden planks. However the abundance of crop circles appearing all over the world cannot possibly be the joke of a few hoaxers alone. Crop c ircles have been thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 12 investigated and the real circles show no signs of crop damage only light burns at the stem as if bent by some unknown energetic force . Studies have revealed changes in the electromagnetic field surrounding th e crop circles. Whoever or whatever made these crop circles is irrelevant to t he importance of the message these crop circles are conveying. Crop circles are demonstrating to us the principles of sacred geometry! The elegant and often fractal shapes of crop circle s contain sometimes obvious sometimes hidden geometry. Crop circles are portray ing the knowledge that was partly preserved in ancient traditions that can sti ll be found today in the Buddhist and Hindu Mandela, the architecture churches and ca thedrals and many art forms such as in the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci. Recapitulation Our last century has been a busy one and especially in the last two decades many changes occurred that seems to create disharmony an d instability on social levels and in political systems. It also has become obviou s that our climate is changing and there is mass starvation of species many of the m becoming extinct. Edgar Cayce predicted in the thirties of the previous cen tury many of the events that are now unfolding. He also predicted that science e ventually would restore the scientific knowledge of the legendary lost continen t of Atlantis. Now something definitely is going on this planet an d surprisingly Edgar Cayce has forecast these events that came to be known as the prophecies of the ‘Earth changes’. Along with all of these Earth changes, as predicted by Cayce also a new scientific awareness is being born on this blue planet. Its bi rthing took place in a small circle of scientist mostly outside the ring of main stream science. This circle of scholars is expanding rapidly; among them are profe ssors of famous universities in the fields of physics, biology, and neurophysiol ogy. These scientist paint a whole new scientific vision that is breathtaking to say the least, however there is little public awareness of this new emerging vision since our newspapers and the late evening news hardly cover them. Of all the sci entists that ever populated this Earth, 99 percent of them now walk the face of the Earth, no wonder there are breakthroughs! The new vision reveals a wondrous universe in which human consciousness plays a far more important role than ever fathomed. It al so reveals that our civilization may not be the pinnacle of evolution after all, it is becoming more and more clear that other great and highly advanced civilizations must have preceded our current civilization. Atlantis is rising as Edgar Cayce pre dicted! Our knowledge seems to be speeding up so fast, that if we don’t change the school system, we will be teaching our kids history only in school! Probably sometime in the future, the history books will mark the end of the 20 th century and the beginning of the 21st century as the epoch of a scientific renaissance. So let’s proceed and see what it is that science has t o say. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 13 Chapter 2 The foundations of science are shaking The way we think about almost all subjects in our s ociety today is pretty much influenced by our scientific understanding of the w orld we live in. Darwinism has had a major impact in our belief that life is about the survival of the fittest. We see this belief reflected in our ca pitalist system where companies struggle to be the fittest to survive. The competit ion, the struggle for life is the motivating factor for companies to ever strive forw ards. Our society, by definition is always lagging behind scientific understanding. It takes a long time before old worldviews, old belief s and old habits die. However at the turn of the century Darwinism itself is dying . Biologists like Lynn Margulis no longer believe in the survival of the selfish ge nes, others are already calling Darwinism the biggest blunder of science ever. In this chapter we will see that the fundamentals, the paradigm, the holy sacraments of science itself; causal determinism an d objective reality, can no longer be defended. Science is firmly rooted in the belief that for every effect there is a cause. The effect is preceded by a cause that can be determined by science, this concept is called ‘causal determinism ’. Science also rules out the possibility of a God consciousness being a causal f actor in nature! Another holy sacrament is the strict segregation and independenc e of object and subject. The scientist (subject) by studying nature does not inf luence nature (object) itself by his observations. This concept is called ‘objectivi ty’. These very roots of science ‘objectivity’ and ‘caus al determinism’ have affected our way of thinking about our world immeasurable. S cience has annihilated the possibility of the existence of a God consciousness in nature altogether and has driven us into a blind belief of materialism. Now let’s delve into the history of physics and see how these very old and firm convictions of science started to tumble to give wa y for a much grander vision. Newtonian physics Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is regarded as the founder of modern western science that prevailed for at least 200 years until the ear ly 20 th century when Einstein finally ended the hegemony of Newtonian physics wit h his general and special relativity theory. René Descartes who bifurcated our world into the do mains of spirit and matter later inspired Isaac Newton. Due to man like René D escartes and Isaac Newton, the view that God was the only causation of physica l phenomenon in the outer world was finally abandoned and a science devoid of the burden of theological dogmas was born. The premise of Newtonian physics is causal determin ism. What this means is that it is assumed that the physical world can be studie d and determined just like we study the working of a machine. Let’s say we want t o understand how a clock ticks, the thing we need do when we want to know al l there is to know about the clock is to examine every cogwheel of the clock and finally we will understand the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 14 working of the entire clock. This is how nature was studied in the days of Newton and thereafter. In Newtonian physics, the atom is regarded to be a limited point particle in space. If we want to understand its inner structure we mus t take it apart and study the inner parts. When we’re done and discovered the last smallest sub particle, the smallest cogwheel of the clock so to speak, we will have finally come to understand all there is to know about the atom. Science has followed exactly this approach. They ha ve built huge particle accelerators such as the one at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland to study matter and take it apart. In the particle accelerator matter is bombarded with particles that are accelerated to close light speed. After an atom is hit by an accelerated parti cle, it breaks like fine China, rendering debris of smaller particles that are stud ied in a vapor trail chamber to reveal the inner structure of the atom. Science has discovered a whole bunch of particles t hat make up the atom, we have the electrons, the neutrons, the protons, in t erm neutrons and protons consist of quarks. The long list of particles goes on an on, and seems limitless. Physicists are still discovering new particles in t heir particle accelerators; these discoveries don’t make headlines any more! They hav e discovered and cataloged around three hundred sub atomic particles already! According to Newtonian physics, the outer physical world is strictly objective, meaning that scientific experiments are not depende nt of the observer performing the experiment. In this sense science formulated a protocol under which all scientific experiments must be performed before the y are accepted. The protocol stipulates that experiments must be reproducible by other scientists anywhere in the world. Newtonian physics states that all phenomena in the outer physical world must have a material cause; measurable forces or fields of energy interacting with the physical object must cause them. Consciousness is also believed to have a material c ause. In Newtonian physics consciousness is the epiphenomenon or secondary eff ect of the chemical and electrical processes going on in the human brain. H ence it is simply a by-product of the physical brain, it has no cause in itself. The worldview that is sketched above by Newtonian p hysics is by many still the most popular view today; it is how the majority of the modern western world views their world at large. No wonder since Newtoni an physics applies perfectly to the macrocosmic world of material objects that can be experienced by the human senses. It is how we expect the world to function w hen we wake up in the morning and open our eyes to go about our daily liv es. Newtonian physics is the physics that most of us we re taught in secondary school and it is still valid for the macroscopic world. Fo r instance, the orbital laws of the planets by Johannes Kepler are still used today by NASA to calculate the orbits of their spacecrafts and are based on pure Newtonian p hysics. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 15 Relativity theory In 1905 Albert Einstein changed the prevailing worl dview of Newtonian physics for good with the introduction of his special relat ivity theory, followed in 1915 by the general relativity theory. He proved that the Newtonian laws of physics were b y no means static, but that they are relative to the observer and the observed. Depending on the difference in speed between the observer and the object under observation, space starts to either shrink or expand and time starts to slow dow n or speed up. Strict objectivity of the physical reality that was a premise of Newtonian physics is maintained if the relativistic effects are taken into account that play a role between the observer and the observed. Einstein concluded in his relativity theory that sp ace and time cannot be seen as two separate things any longer, but that they must be regarded as one unified thing. He called it the space-time continuum. Relativity theory supports the principal of localit y, which means that all physical phenomena must take place in a limited time and in a limited space. Actions at a distance take time to travel as no material thing o r force can exceed the speed of light. Quantum physics The founder of quantum physics is Max Planck. In 19 00, he studied the spectral lines, the colors of heat emitted by a blackbody. A blackbody is an object that completely absorbs all heat radiation, reaches a te mperature equilibrium and next radiates the absorbed heat again. Planck discovered that heat radiated by the blackbody was not a continuous flow of energy but t hat the energy was transmitted in equal and finite bursts of energy pa ckets with a distinct frequency. Planck assumed that the vibration of the atoms was the source of the radiation. The discrete lines in the energy spectrum could onl y be explained if the atoms where excited into a higher energy state due to abs orption of heat send to the black body. Next the absorbed energy is released a gain and radiates electromagnetic energy packets when the atoms retur n to their ground state. These energy packets are called quanta and the ener gy of the packet is proportional to the frequency of the radiation. Planck’s concept of energy quanta conflicted with t he classical electromagnetic theory of Maxwell that predicted that electromagnet ic energy moves in waves that could assume any small amount of energy and wa s certainly not quantified. It took years before the impact of Planck’s discove ries were finally fully accepted and grasped. Planck always expected that someone el se would come up with a better explanation for the quanta than himself, how ever Einstein confirmed the quanta of electromagnetic energy radiation in exper iments with the photoelectric effect and called the light quanta photons. What Ei nstein proved was that light consists actually of particles, the photons. He rec eived a Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect. In 1905 Rutherford discovered the nucleus of the at om and in 1913 Niels Bohr who had been working with Rutherford, proposed a m odel of the atom similar to a miniature Solar System in which the electrons orb it the nucleus like our planets in the Solar System. The electrons like the planets orbit the nucleus in spherical layers called the electron shells at discrete dista nces from the nucleus. The"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 16 electron shell was Bohr’s answer to the discoveries made by Max Planck, he conjectured that an atom could exist only in a disc rete set of stable energy states. He explained that electrons can only orbit the nucleus in a given shell but they are free to make a quantum leap from one shell to another. When the electron jumps (quantum leap) from a higher shell t o a lower shell a photon of a distinct wavelength is emitted. The electron does n ot travel through the space in between the shells, it can only leap frog from one shell to another. Bohr explained the mystery why electrons don’t cras h into the nucleus by saying there is a lowest shell that cannot be trespassed. To this day quantum science has never been able to explain why the electron is forced to orbit in a given shell, they simply say it’s the magic of quantum science! Louis de Broglie in 1924 raised the question in his doctoral thesis ‘Recherches sur la théorie des quanta’ (Research on the quantum the ory) whether electrons could actually be waves as well? It was the introduction of the wave-particle duality in quantum physics. De Broglie proposed that particles (electrons) could be observed as solid objects and in other cases behave d like waves. Quantum physics was able to mold this strange duali stic behavior of matter into a consistent mathematical model, however they were ne ver really able to explain how an electron or photon for instance can behave l ike a particle in one situation and as a wave in another. When the particle, an ele ctron or photon is observed as a particle it is contained in a confined space, how ever when observed as a wave it is everywhere since the wave spreads out in space. Try to imagine this for yourself it’s utterly impossible! They came to call this wave-particle like atomic matter wavicles indicating their dualistic nature. Quantum physics is the weirdest of physics that eve r faced this world. It was discovered that at the level of sub atomic particle s nature seized to be deterministic. Up until this time Newtonian physics assumed that all properties and behavior of our physical reality could be deter mined, since it was assumed that all physical reality at all levels abides to w ell known physical laws of which there are no exceptions. Quantum physics proved this assumption to be wrong for elementary particles, at the microcosmic level. At the microcosmic level, na ture starts to behave fuzzy and is by no means deterministic anymore. Absolute certainty about the exact state and properties of a particle cannot be determ ined any longer, it can only be calculated in terms of a statistical probability. T his principle has become known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, named after W erner Heisenberg. It is paramount to understand that the non-determin istic nature of sub atomic particles is not due to the lack of accuracy of mea suring instruments but an inherent property of nature itself. At the quantum level, electrons jump into higher orbits of electron shells in the atom for no apparent reason at all. When they fall back to their ground state, a photon (ele ctromagnetic light energy) is released. This behavior is noticeable in all of our electronic equipment such as an electronic amplifier as noise. The random behavior of nature at the quantum level shocked and puzzled scientist since they had always believed in the Newtonian axiom that nature abides to well predictable laws. Physicist now had to live up with the uncertainty principle of quantum physics. Einstein who couldn’t believe it said; God doesn’t play dice! What was causing these quantum fluctuations of energ y at the quantum level that cannot be predicted? "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 17 Erwin Schrödinger determined the equation to determ ine either the speed (momentum) or the exact location of an electron in an electron cloud, determining both speed and location at the same tim e according to the uncertainty principle is not possible. You either k now the position of an electron and its speed (momentum) becomes uncertain, or you have determined its speed and its location will be unsure. To solve the enigma of the dualistic nature of a wa vicle, a particle that can be both a particle and a wave, quantum physics explain ed this paradox by saying that the particle only exists imaginary as a superp osition of all possibilities with a wave like probability distribution when it is not b eing observed. As soon as an observer, in most cases the scientist in his labora tory, measures the particle, the quantum state of the particle, the superposition of all possibilities, is said to collapse into just one physical state, one physical reality. In other words the particle does not exist in the real world before th e observer observes it. Before observation it exists in a transcendental realm of possibilities. When it is being observed it freezes in just one of those possibilit ies. This has become famous as the Copenhagen interpreta tion of quantum physics and was proposed by Niels Bohr. The Copenhagen inte rpretation says that the act of conscious observation by the observer is causing the collapse of the quantum wave, the quantum super position of all possibiliti es. Hence what quantum physics is saying is that our physical reality is s ubjective, the observer plays an active role in what nature is manifesting. In the q uantum realm of sub atomic particles we are co-creators of our own reality! Einstein once said ‘I’m not sure the moon is still there when I turn my head’. What he meant by this is that quantum science assume s that our physical reality only exists when it is being observed (particle sta te) and that matter returns to pure energy when no one pays attention (wave state) . Quantum physics meant the end of the Newtonian obje ctive and causal determinative reality since the conscious observati on of the scientist plays an active part in physical observations. Today this knowledge is being used to develop quant um cryptology for information transfer. The interception of a message can be detected by the act of observation alone since the unauthorized reader wil l have changed the contents of the message by his mere act of conscious observa tion. Quantum science predicted the existence of so calle d non-local effects. Non-local effects are effects that take place instantaneously between physical objects that are separated in space-time. There is no time invol ved between the cause and the effect. This is strictly against Einstein’s the ory that nothing can exceed the speed of light in the universe. Einstein when he fi rst learned that quantum science predicted the existence of non-local effect s called these effects ‘spooky action at a distance’. He just didn’t believe it. In a paper released in 1935 by Einstein, Podolsky a nd Rosen, together they proposed the so-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR ) correlation for quantum- entangled particles. Two particles are entangled wh en the quantum states of the particles are coupled. Quantum entangled particles react as one body, there seems to be no separation. When the quantum state o f one particle collapsed into a classical state, so does the other in exactly the same state. In order for this to happen it requires that the communication between t he two particles is instantaneous in other words non-local. In the EPR proposal however Einstein tried to disprove the non-locality of quantum entan gled particles stating that"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 18 quantum science must be incomplete and he came up w ith and alternative of ‘local hidden variables’. In 1964 John Bell in theo ry proved that the non-local effect of quantum-entangled particles was real afte r all and this became known as Bell’s theorem. So communication between the entangled particles wa s again assumed non-local and thus instantaneous. If the state of one entangl ed particle changes, so does the other to reflect the same state. Engineers at IBM as of 1993 have been working on qu antum teleportation using quantum entanglement as their corner stone. Quantum teleportation is a feat whereby matter is dematerialized in one location an d ‘faxed’ in a quantum state to another place to be reassembled locally. Althoug h we’re not expecting Star Trek science fiction scenes in the near future wher e Scotty is beamed up to the mother space ship U.S.S. Enterprise, the phenomenon is real. What the researchers at IBM are working on is not th e actual teleportation of matter itself, but its quantum state properties. Te leportation was long considered impossible since the measurement, the scanning of t he original would cause the collapse of the quantum state and hence destroy the original, degrade it to a classical state. However, the IBM scientist propose d a trick in which scanning takes place not fully in the quantum state but in a half classical, half quantum state such that the quantum uncertainty principle i s not violated. In April 2004 the BBC News reported breakthroughs i n quantum teleportation that were achieved by researchers in Austria. They successfully teleported quantum entangled photons over a distance of 800 m across the Danube River near Vienna using fiber-optic wires. This was the f irst time that quantum teleportation was proved outside of the laboratory. Quantum teleportation is a major feature that is re quired in the development of a new super type computer using quantum computing. Ou r current computers use binary states in memory called bits to store data. A bit can take on the value of either one or zero. In quantum computation the clas sical bits are replace by quantum bits or qubits. Qubits when in their quantu m state take on the superposition of both the one and zero value at the same time. While in the quantum state the computation takes place. Quantum teleportation is the feature by which data (qubits) is moved form one place in m emory to the next, just like what happens in our current computers. At the end o f the computation the quantum state of the computer’s memory collapses in to a classical state. All qubits in memory now will have a classical bit valu e of either one or zero! The advantage of quantum computers, provided they can b e constructed will be that they can achieve an almost infinite degree of paral lel computing that will render them extremely efficient and fast. Non locality and quantum entanglement only existed in theory until Alain Aspect of the Institute of Optics at the University of Par is in 1982 first proved the very existence of these effect is his laboratory. He man aged to produce a series of twin photons that were send in opposite directions. The quantum entangled twin photons traveled in their quantum state, meaning th ey have an infinite number of spin directions all at the same time as a quantum p ossibility. When one of the photons was intercepted and measured, the quantum s tate of spin of the photon collapsed into a classical spin state that could be determined. At exactly the same time with zero time difference, the other twin phot on was measured, the photon collapsed in exactly the same classical spin state as the first photon, no matter the distance between the two photons. The experimen t proved that a non-local"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 19 communication must have taken place between the two photons, how else was the twin photon to know the exact spin of it’s othe r twin? This discovery rocked the scientific community to t he core. If non-local effects are real than there must be either other hyperspace dim ensions, other physical planes of existence outside our physical world wher e this non-local communication is taking place, or Einstein’s assump tion is wrong that no local effect in our universe can travel at a speed greate r than light speed. ( \u0001 ) After Aspect’s discoveries, university of London ph ysicist David Bohm came up with a completely different explanation. What we se e as two separate photons may be illusionary; the photons may be united at a hitherto unknown different level as one. He assumed that our universe could be holographic in its nature. He explained this beautifully with an analogy. Suppose we place to cameras near an aquarium, one in front and one at the side. Suppose we show the separate images of the two cameras recording a swimming fish to a spectator on two separate video screens. What our spectator may concl ude after studying the images from the two screens intensively is that alt hough he sees two fish swimming, their moves are synchronized (entangled) since the other fish reflects every move of the first fish. What David Bohm is su ggesting with this analogy is that at a deeper level of reality the two photons m ay not be separate after all. He proposed an implicit order of the universe, a onene ss at a deeper level that is folded outwards as separate things. ( \u0002) The implication of quantum physics have been mind b oggling, it is showing us that we are co-creators of our own physical reality at least at the microcosmic level of reality since the observer plays a part in what is being observed. Niels Bohr, cofounder of quantum science once said, ‘Ever y one who’s not shocked by quantum physics, didn’t understand it’. We will provide abundant prove in this book of the f act that the effect of human consciousness in quantum physics is not limited to the microcosmic realm, but also applies to our macrocosmic world. Human though ts, emotions and intention have a far greater effect on reality than ever assu med possible. Quantum science is still to this day a prevailing s cience; it can explain many physical phenomena, except for gravity! String theory In an attempt to unify both Einstein’s relativity t heory and quantum physics, according to mainstream physics, the Holy Grail of physics today is ‘string theory’. String theory should deliver Einstein’s un ification theory that is supposed to bind the four existing force fields (strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism and gravity) into one unified theo ry of everything (T.O.E). In string theory, the building block of matter is a vi brating string that can either be a loose end or a one-dimensional closed loop. Dependin g on the various spins and frequencies of the vibrating string, different sub atomic particles manifest. In string theory there is only one fundamental cause, the vibration of a string, but it is the note that is being played on the string so t o speak that accounts for the different type of particle. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 20 The string itself is so small that it is impossible to imagine its existence! Now I want you to think in ratios; the string is said to have the size of an atom, if presumably the atom had the size of the Earth! This means the string is unbelievably small. If the theory ever works, it’s a question if scientists will ever be able to prove the existence of these strings in their laboratories! Non-locality in quantum science suggests that there must be higher planes of existence, other dimensions besides our physical wo rld since no information can travel faster than the speed of light in our dimens ion. String theory predicts the existence of at least 10 or more dimensions. Physic ists all over the world now agree that this physical dimension alone cannot exp lain our physical reality. The problem with string theory is that there is mor e than one string theory needed to get the model working and these string th eories have become so complex that only a few of the most brilliant scien tist are able to understand it, such as professor of physics at Princeton Universit y Edward Witten. Chaos theory In the seventies of the 20 th century, a new science emerged out of the blue, chaos theory! Where quantum science revealed that at the nuclear level objectivity doesn’t hold true, chaos theory went ev en one step further in disappointing Einstein who believed that God doesn’ t play dice. Chaos theory revealed that the unpredictability, th e uncertainty of quantum science is also true for what was believed to be pr edictable events. According to chaos theory scientists had been fooling themselves for centuries! By ignoring small deviations in measurements, calling them meas urement errors, they had missed the point all together! Predictable systems that could be fully explained with Newtonian physics such as the swinging of a pe ndulum of a clock and the orbits of the planets apparently behaved chaotic in stead of perfectly predictable. The reality revealed by chaos theory is that there is chaos, unpredictability even in the swinging of a pendulum! Our universe does no t abide to strict laws of physics at all. Physical laws only operate within c ertain flexible boundaries of choice, giving them a degree of freedom. Chaos theo ry showed that our universe by no means is deterministic; it is creative and et ernally evolving. Chaos in Greek mythology is the cosmic force that creates form fro m emptiness, nothingness. Physical laws themselves may not be static but evol ve over time. In this respect a better term for physical laws would be physical hab its, the natural habits that have evolved in billions of years to become just th e way the universe works. The universe is just an evolving system of habits. Phys ical laws are more or less a universal memory of how to do things. Chaos theory continues to explain that although eve nts may seem totally random at first sight, there still exists order at a deepe r level! Examples of random events with chaotic order are the irregular dripping of wa ter drops from a tap, the crystallization of ice crystals. Although the sequence of drops that will be falling from a water tap is completely unpredictable even by chaos theory, there is still a deeper order, a pattern to be discerned! Ice crystals are all similar but not ide ntical, it’s impossible to predict what the ice crystal will look like, however chaos theory is able to demonstrate that they have a hidden order. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 21 The founder of Chaos theory is Benoit B. Mandelbrot . Employed as a mathematician at IBM in New York, Mandelbrot discov ered that there is a hidden mathematical order in the seemingly random order of market price fluctuations. He studied the price of cotton, a commodity with a vast amount of price data, dating back hundreths of years. Mandelbrot found a pattern in the price fluctuations that was quite revolutionary. It baffl ed the economist, who couldn’t believe that something like the price of cotton cou ld be predicted. What Mandelbrot discovered was what he later termed a fr actal. A fractal is a recursive geometric pattern that is repeated at different scales indefinitely. The most famous fractal is the Mandel brot fractal. Fractals are often used in screen saver software of computers. They ke ep on repainting the screen eternally with an increasing complexity of geometri c patterns. The ‘order’ in the Mandelbrot chaotic fractal is qu ite simple it’s a formula: z -> z² + c, whereas z is a complex number and c is a constant. The formula is recursive; each new value of z is fe d into the formula again and determines the next value. The initial value is 0. Z is a complex number that consists of a real part and an imaginary part. The real and imaginary values of z can be plotted in an x-y diagram rendering these am azing pictures. Different values for c will render different fractals and giv es the fractal its degree of freedom. Fractals were found everywhere in nature, for insta nce in the arteries and veins in the vascular system of the body and the bronchi of the human longs. Plants have fractal symmetry; broccoli is a beautiful example a nd so are mountains When we zoom into an object that is fractal, we see the pat tern of the object at macro level repeated at the micro level, no matter how much we zoom in. Chaos theory has discovered the existence of four b asic cosmic attractors, the point, cycle, torus and strange attractor. We will n ot go into detail about the differences but mention that an attracter can best be described as the force in nature that creates order out of chaos. The chaos i s drawn to the attractor creating a hidden order. The four types of attractor work at every level of reality, creating our universe out of chaos. The world is not totally organized by fix ed physical laws as formally believed but it is self-organizing and the fourfold type of attractors organizes it. Chaos theory also makes an end to a centuries old p hysical law, the second law of Thermodynamics, the law of entropy that states that all order in the universe will eventually decay to disorder. The attractors of cha os theory prove that negentropy (negative entropy) creating order out of chaos must exist in the universe. In fact it seems to be the rule and not t he exception! The attractors of chaos theory completely reverse t he idea of cause and effect. Causality is based on the idea that every effect mu st have a cause that in time is prior to the effect. However in chaos theory, the c ause is the attractor, the unseen force in the future that draws the effects, the current and past time events to it. The attractors in chaos theory is a force that Gree k philosopher Aristotle called entelechie, the goal that draws the events of chang e to it. ( \u0004 ). "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 22 Recapitulation At the turning of the millennium it became more and more obvious that science is loosing it’s very foundations objective reality and causal determinism. The illusion of objectivity was removed by quantum science hat showed that the influence of human consciousness plays a role in th e quantum realm of subatomic matter. Quantum scientist have always had problems with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum science. The idea that co nsciousness has a measurable effect on reality just didn’t fit in the establishe d framework of science. Descartes and Newton founded science with the assumption that consciousness doesn’t have any effect on reality; consciousness itself wa s shoved aside to the domain of religion! This has lead to a blind belief that the universe could be explained like clockwork, a blind faith in materialism. No one eve r doubted it in the 19 th century. It was believed that everything in nature could eve ntually be explained by science in mechanical terms, the universe was regarded as o ne huge mechanical clock. Causal determinism already damaged by quantum scien ce’s uncertainty principle in the quantum realm was finally tackled by chaos t heory! Chaos theory simply states that all events in nature are chaotic and un predictable and that physical laws can only operate within confined boundaries gi ving them room for creativity and spontaneity. Cause and effect are reversed wher eas the fractal attractor as the cause draws the effects towards it. Chaos theor y lends credit to the idea that there must be purpose in the universe! But how strong is really the effect of consciousnes s on reality? Is it limited to the quantum realm of sub atomic pa rticles such that is remains for ever hidden for our personal experience or does it also play out in the macroscopic world of our daily experience as well? Let’s have a look at what science has to say about consciousness in the next chapter. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 23 Chapter 3 Science and consciousness On his return trip from the moon on the Apollo 14 m ission, astronaut Edgar Mitchell stared out of the window and had a peek at our blue planet Earth. At that moment something profound hit him. All of a sudden he was hurtled out of his normal consciousness and felt an intense oneness, a connectedness with planet Earth and in fact all of the universe. Never before had he had such an experience. His ego and the separate world outside of him merge d. There was no difference to be discerned any longer, he was the universe! Hi s thoughts seem to have an effect on the outer world and the outer world seeme d to have an effect on his thoughts at some deeper level. He was fully aware o f the fact that the separation of his ego and the universe at large does not exist . It is the experience described in quantum scientific terms by David Bohm whereas th e observer is the observed! Many people in all walks of life throughout the age s have reported such experiences; it is called a mystical experience. In a flash of higher consciousness a higher truth is revealed that dramatically change s the life of the person who underwent the experience. And such was the case wit h Edgar Mitchell. After his save return on Earth, he founded in 1973 a nonprofit organization the ‘Institute of Noetic Sciences’ aimed at studying th e nature of human consciousness. ( \u0001 ) After Descartes had called for a divorce between sci ence and religion, consciousness and science were never close friends. Science simply ignored the relevance of consciousness. Science is supposed to be an objective study of nature and holds no interest in the subjective cons cious experience of individual humans. To science, these are just two separate thi ngs. Anyway how is science to study nature if our personal experience plays a sig nificant role in it? Psychic phenomenon, such as telepathy, precognition , extra sensory perception (ESP), out of body experiences (OBE), lucid dreamin g and near death experiences (NDE), that were reported by so many people time an d again, were simply dismissed into the realms of myths and parables. No w from a scientific point of view where science is supposed to study every aspec t of our existence, that is a very unscientific approach! The skeptic attitude ad opted by science has created a taboo in our western society that still prevails to day. People who underwent these experiences often feel misunderstood and are not ta ken seriously. Many scientists even today are afraid to even consider examining th ese phenomena, afraid of jeopardizing their career since some who have tried were cast out of the scientific community. Fortunately quantum science has forced scientists t o change their minds about the subject and a more positive attitude has emerge d in the last two decades. A scientific taboo seems finally broken and thanks to people like Edgar Mitchell, consciousness has become a serious subject for scie ntific scrutiny after all. In this chapter we will provide some very interesti ng scientific insights in the enigma of human consciousness. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 24 The Quantum Brain Maybe the most difficult question raised in science ever is called the ‘hard problem’. It is also referred to as the ‘binding pr oblem’. It is the problem of how the immaterial world of our thoughts and feelings i nterfaces with the material world of our body. Emotional states caused by our t houghts and feelings (immaterial world) are immediately reflected in the physiology of our body (material world). For instance, when an immaterial thought pops up in your brain to raise your hand, immediately your brain starts to produce neur otransmitter messengers that are carried along the nervous system. Electrical im pulses are sent to the muscles in your hand that will finally respond to your init ial thought. Now how is this possible? How can something immater ial as a thought have a real noticeable physical effect? It happens all the time in your body! Since Descartes decided that there is a split betwe en body and mind we are not likely to get answers from Newtonian physics. Then how can the bridge between the immaterial world of the mind and the material w orld of the body be crossed? Maybe we can get some answers from quantum physics? All of our outer reality that is perceived by the b rain comes from the five senses, hearing, smell, taste, touch and visual perception. According to philosopher Ìmmanuel Kant (1724-1804) we should make a distinct ion between the noumenal world, the world in itself ( daß Ding an sich ) and the phenomenal world, the world as we perceive it. What Kant meant is that it is im possible to directly perceive the world; we can only perceive it through our senses. What outer reality really is nobody knows, because we can never directly perceiv e it. The question may even be raised if there is a physical reality at all? Ho wever Kant believed that physical reality, the source of our perceptions is real. Imm anuel Kant stated that what we know of the world at large is an interpretation mad e by our brain. To appreciate what Kant is saying, try to count the black dots in this picture: Don’t tell me you failed! Of course you did because there are no black dots in the picture! Your brain imagined the black dots that yo u saw jumping back and forth! The translation your brain makes from the external stimulus of the visual cortex to the picture that you hold in your head is all fr om external electromagnetic wave patterns. You may never have thought about it this way, but the color green does not exist! The color green like the blac k dots in the picture above are only a translation, a representation that makes sen se to you. The color green is a subjective construction of what is no more than an electromagnetic wave with a distinct frequency, amplitude and phase. A honeybee has a complete different subjective representation of the very same color th at you call green, since it is"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 25 colorblind and can only see in black and white. You don’t even known how your fellow humans perceive this color! This is what Immanuel Kant meant when he said that we cannot possibly see the noumenal world, the world in itself, we only see ou r personal version, our interpretation of a reality that is out there. By d efault it is restricted since we only interpret a few percentages of the whole spectrum o f electromagnetic energy that exists. We learned in school that our brain is a kind of sup er computer with loads of neurons firing at the synapses, processing the vibr atory information received from the five senses. Our thoughts are personal and supposedly no one has access to them but us! Our memories are engraved in to gray cells that constitute the brain. That’s what the majority of people were taught in school and still believes today. Science has progressed quite a bit from the time of the dusty old ragged schoolbooks and now uses quantum science to explain consciousness. In 1920 Wilder Pinfield believed that memories were stored as engrams at a specific location or address in the brain, just as a computer stores its data in a specific memory location. Karl Lashley on the hunt for these engrams found by experimenting on rats that memories are not stored at dedicated locations inside the brain at all. Memories seemed to be dispersed a ll over the brain and each part of the brain seemed to contain the whole memory. Si nce memory storage is distributed all over the brain and each part contai ns the whole memory, it may explain why people with dysfunctional areas in the brain still hold on to their memories. The concept of the ‘part contains the whole’ aspect of the brain’s memories triggered Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram w hen he learned about holography in 1960. He came up with a new explanati on for memory storage and believed that the brain stores memories as a wave i nterference pattern like a hologram. A hologram is three-dimensional picture t hat is stored on a two dimensional photo as a wave pattern. It is constru cted by splitting a coherent laser beam into two beams using mirrors. These two beams are recorded as a wave interference pattern on a photosensitive plate whereas the subject being photographed diffuses one of the beams and the othe r the reference beam is aimed straight at the photosensitive plate. When vi ewed in normal daylight the hologram doesn’t make sense, it contains a lot of b lurry circles! However when a laser beam is shone through the hologram, a three d imensional picture emerges that can be viewed from multiple angles. The three dimensional picture seems to be floating in the air. Now the brain’s memories are thought to be stored i n the same manner as the hologram stores a picture. Holographic memory stora ge can also explain the huge storage capacity of the brain of the order of 10 bi llion bits of information in an average human lifetime. Holograms are also very goo d at explaining how the brain manages to access and remember things very fa st from its huge repository of information. In a blink of an eye we recognize a face of someone we haven't seen for many years even if the facial expression o f the person has aged. Holographic images can easily be compared and match ed even when they are not a 100% identical. Pribram showed that not only our memories but all o ur cognitive processes, smell, taste, hearing and seeing may be explained b y holographic principles."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 26 Let’s take visual perception as an example. The cur rent view of science is that the picture of the world is projected through the lens of the eye onto a canvas, the retina in the back of the skull and that this pictu re is somehow 'digitized' by the brain and its pixels stored. Pribram proved that dedicated nerve cells in the ey e respond to certain frequencies of electromagnetic waves that hit the e ye. The picture is viewed as a set of frequencies and not as individual dots or pi xels. Now how can a picture contain frequencies you may ask? Well in a process called Fourier transformation, spatial information can be translated into a freque ncy spectrum. Jean Fourier proved, that any kind of waveform could be construc ted from pure sine waves. When multiple sine waves of different frequencies, p hase and amplitudes are superimposed, any kind of waveform can be construct ed. The process of determining the constituents of the wave is called spectrum analysis and is mathematically described by the inverse Fourier tra nsformation. The inverse Fourier transformation is used to create the origin al wave from the spectrum of sine waves. Now Fourier transformations can also be applied to 2D spatial information. What Pribram found was that the cortex of the brain conducts a Fourier transformation on the visual image in the e ye and distributes the constituent frequencies of the picture all over the neurons in the brain. So the picture is actually internalized and memorized as a wave interference pattern among neurons, just like the hologram stores the pi cture. The original memory of the picture can be reconstru cted from the holographic representation by the inverse Fourier transformatio n creating a visual image inside our head. The construction of an image from a spectrum of ind ividual sine frequencies is the technique used in the MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagi ng) scanner used in hospitals. The MRI scanner also uses Fourier transf ormations to construct a holographic image of the scanned body from the exci ted hydrogen atoms in the water molecules in the body. This technique has bee n developed by Walter Schempp who later contributed to the quantum brain theory stating that memories are not actually stored within the brain i tself but in the fabric of space, the physical vacuum. The brain is simply a store an d read out tool to write to and read from the physical vacuum where the holographic memory is actually stored as wave information. ( \u0002 ) When we combine Karl Pribram's holographic theory of the brain with David Bohm's theory that our universe as a whole is just a giant hologram, we get an interesting view of reality, called the holographic paradigm. In the holographic paradigm, the universe is seen as just a huge repos itory of frequencies encoding multiple levels of reality. The brain, using Fourier analyses, decodes one chan nel out of a blur of frequencies in the universe and from this construct s our inner representation of reality. Our brain is limited to receiving only a l imited range of frequencies from the outside world and hence receives a limited scop e of reality. We could say that the brain tunes into reality much like a radio, but we can only tune into one station. We think we move through a solid world of images tha t are perceived by the brain but the fundamental truth could be that we si mply decode just one reality out of many parallel worlds. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 27 The holographic paradigm solves many mysteries invo lving paranormal phenomenon since individual brains are just a part of the whole, the universal brain. All brains are infinitely connected and para normal information (telepathy) can easily flow from one brain to another. Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose contributed to th e quantum brain theory by presenting a model of the brain based on quantum co mputing. They believe that our brain processes information from the neurons no t only in classical states but may be using quantum states as well. Quantum states within the brain were long believed to be absolutely impossible since the brai n was too big, too wet and too hot to sustain quantum states that were hitherto on ly observed in the laboratory in isolated and controlled situations at the sub at omic scale. However Hameroff now believes he has found the building blocks, the qubits for quantum computing in the brain. He identified the tiny tubes called m icrotubules that comprise the cytoskeleton of the cell. The cytoskeleton is the s keleton that gives the cell its structure; it’s the scaffolding of the cell. Beside s giving structure to the cell, the microtubule is also a transportation pipe for all s orts of chemical compounds used by the cell. Hameroff points out that the cytoskele ton may also have a neural function and that they may even be more advanced th an neurons themselves. The neural function of the cytoskeleton may explain why a single cell organism can perform intelligent tasks. Although the single cell organism does not have a neural network, no neurons and no brain, it has som e primitive form of consciousness since it can perform intelligent task s such as swimming, eating and mating! Now for humans, we have a brain consisting of neuro ns that are interconnected by dendrites and synapses that make up the central nervous system. Inside the neuron cell we find a cytoskeleton build form micro tubules. The microtubule itself is constructed from tubulins, hexagonal structured proteins. It is the tubulin within the microtubule within the neuron that Hamer off has identified as the qubit of the brain. The classical interpretation of neurobiology has be en that concentrations of various ions carry impulses to and from the central nervous system and are responsible for all the information processed by th e nervous system as a whole. Hameroff however noticed that the microtubule conta ins highly coherent light (laser like light) and that this light might play a n important role in the information processing by the brain. Fritz Popp had already dis covered the emission of bio photons by the human body. Popp found that weak emi ssions of bio photons could be detected emerging from not only the human body but from all biological life forms and suspected that the source of these b io photon emissions is related to DNA. Hameroff found coherent bio photons inside the micr otubule in a quantum state. In other words the bio photons were coherent and qu antum entangled. The microtubule is filled with water molecules that are highly ordered, they are structured in a coherent way and Hameroff believes that the function of this ordered water plays a significant role in the condu ctance of the bio photons through the microtubule. When the bio photons pass through the microtubule they are sent to the synapses of the neuron and the n move over to the next neuron. In this way the microtubules acts as a wiri ng system for the coherent light in the brain and in fact all of the rest of t he body. It is referred to as the internet of the human body connecting not only the nerve cells but every cell in the body. It allows for quantum information interch ange between the brain and the rest of the body. The implication is that consc iousness is not restricted to the brain itself but that all cells of the body share i n the same conscious awareness."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 28 This may explain the holistic nature of consciousne ss whereby our thoughts and feelings act in unity in the body. Think what happe ns when you’re infatuated and the person you are in love with suddenly jumps in f ront of you. All of your body and brain will respond instantaneous and in unity! Your eyes get wider, your heart starts to pump faster, you breathe faster, yo ur adrenalin level goes up and you feel butterflies in your belly while your knees start to shake, all of this in unison. The unified response of the body in a singl e moment is sent over the body’s neural internet through the microtubule ‘wir ing’ as a coherent wave of light connecting all the cells in the body . Hameroff’s companion, mathematician Roger Penrose d eveloped a new alternative for the Copenhagen interpretation of qu antum physics, the collapse of the quantum wave by conscious observation. Penrose proposes an objective reduction (reduction is a synonym for the ‘collapse of the quantum wave’). Objective reduction (OR) calls for the collapse of the quantum wave without human conscious observation but just happens when a ‘certain threshold’ of what he calls quantum gravity is reached. The quantum computation that goes around in the bra in uses a feedback mechanism from the organism’s sensory input and tha t’s why the collapse of the quantum state maintained in the microtubule is call ed an Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR). The classical state of the se nsory input, orchestrates, manages the quantum computation. It is a feedback l oop. Now Hameroff’s quantum brain model makes a point of mentioning that consciousness, our thoughts and feelings are a resu lt of the objective reduction (OR) of a superposition of all possible thoughts an d feelings taking place in the qubits inside the microtubulus inside the neurons o f the brain. In other words our personal thoughts are just a collapse of the univer sal thoughts. The quantum brain model states that the universe it self has fundamental proto consciousness properties! It is this proto consciousness, or universal consci ousness (thoughts of all thoughts) that collapses into our individual consci ousness in the qubits of the brain. This happens at an average rate of 40 collap ses per second corresponding to the 40 Hz brainwave frequency. Our awareness of internal thoughts and feelings are constructed like the movie frames in a motion picture at the speed of 40 frames per second from a universal consciousness . Hameroff and Penrose point out that their Orchestra ted Objective Reduction (Orch OR) model for quantum processing in the mind is consistent with the spiritual teachings of Buddhism, Hinduism and Kabba lah that all teach the existence of a universal mind. Now what we have here is model of the brain that st ates that consciousness is not the epiphenomenon, the result of brain processe s but that the brain must be regarded as a big antenna or receiver of a universa l consciousness that is everywhere in the universe! Now the quantum brain theory has many opponents and is still in its infancy, but it has already drawn a lot of attention and may one day be widely accepted as exactly the way the brain works. ( \u0004 )"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 29 Human intention Dr. William Tiller is a professor emeritus of Stanfo rd University and cofounder of the Institute of Noetic sciences and the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine. For the majority of his career he had been a profes sor in the department of ‘Materials Science and Engineering’ at the Stanford University and his many subjects were metallurgy, crystal growths, semicond uctor materials etc. However in the sixties he started out a whole new career in a subject that had always interested him, the study of the paranormal and une xplained areas of human consciousness. His attempts were aimed at bridging the gap between science and spirituality. Therefore he adopted a strict scienti fic protocol in his studies such that he may seriously attract the attention of othe r scholars. He became interested in studying subtle energies, e nergies such as Reiki energy used in human healing by spiritual inclined people that can currently not be explained by our scientific understanding. He developed an ultra-sensitive kind of Geiger coun ter device to measure the subtle energies emitted by the hands of the Reiki m asters and demonstrated the existence of an energy field that is not in the ele ctromagnetic spectrum. This experiment was a positive stimulus for the Reiki co mmunity, they now got a scientific confirmation that the Reiki energy field s are real and that they can be measured. In his studies professor Tiller noticed t hat the healing intention sent to the hands by the Reiki practitioners had a crucial effect on the energy output measured. From these experiments he concluded that the human intention via our thoughts and feelings have a measurable effect on physical reality. He also tested Qi Gong Masters and found that their hands had a healing magnetism equivalent of a 20,000 gauss magnet and t heir palms emitted a beam of infrared radiation (1 to 4.5 microns in waveleng th) that had healing benefits. Tiller conducted a series of experiments to study t he possible effect of human intention under the strictest of scientific protoco ls. He built a dedicated device called an Intention Imprinted Electrical Device (II ED) that radiated a very weak electromagnetic energy of less than a millionth of a Watt. He asked four trained humans who went into a deep state of mediation to i mprint the intention of the upcoming experiment onto the IIED. Next the experiment itself was conducted with two i dentical IIED devices, one imprinted via the meditative process and the other left untouched. The IIED devices were placed in separate rooms in front of t he subjects. The following changes (statistical random change p < 0,001) were observed: - The acidity (PH) of water could be intentionally ra ised or lowered by one PH unit. - The activity of a human liver enzyme could be incre ased by 15 to 30 % - The larval growth pace of a fly could be increased by 25 %. The results measured were highly significant, the p ossibility of occurrence by chance were less than one in 1000. With these experi ments William Tiller had proved once and for all that our human intentions h ave a real measurable effect on physical reality."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 30 After continuous testing for 3 to 4 months, he noti ced that the intentioned effects of the experiment continued even when the IIED devic e was removed from the room. Somehow the room of the laboratory in which t he experiments were conducted had become conditioned. The IIED device wa s no longer needed to have the same effect in the experiment. William Tiller’s experiments may be an indirect indi cation that our prayers have a real effect and are answered. He thinks that places where people gather with their positive intentions to pray for better times, may get permanently conditioned after years and years being imprinted w ith the same intention and become sacred places. He explains the effect that he measured by stating that at a fundamental level the state of the physical vacuum in the room where the experiment was conducted had somehow changed. In its normal state the physical vacuum of the room is energetic, chaotic and random. However by i mposing our intentions the order in the physical vacuum can be significantly a nd permanently changed. (For more information on the physical vacuum and the ene rgy contained within it, see the next chapter) ( \u0005 ) Hado effect Japanese researcher Dr Masuru Emoto, chief of the H ado institute in Tokyo, demonstrates with scientific means probably the mos t convincing and startling effect that human consciousness has on our outer re ality. Dr Emoto has discovered an effect on water that was given the name the ‘Hado’ effect. He describes it as follows, quote: ‘Hado is the intrinsic vibrational pattern at the atomic level in all matter, the smallest uni t of energy. Its basis is the energy of human consciousness’. He wrote a book that was issued in 1999 called ‘The Message from Water’ that has sold millions of copies already around the glob e and has been translated in many languages. He’s lecturing and holding seminars around the world and also conducts live experiments where he demonstrates the ‘Hado’ effect on water. The word ‘Hado’ is now a buzzword in Japan. People use it to express the vibrations of a place or person, ‘this place has no Hado’ or ‘He is low on Hado today’! And all this upheaval is about crystallized frozen water? What is it that he has discovered?

He noticed that water from heavy polluted rivers did not crystallize at all and that clean mineral spring wa ter would give beautiful ice crystals when being frozen. So far so good, it is a result that may be expected . However to his amazement he discovered that the crystallization of the water mo lecules was somehow related to his mood. He started experiments in which he used c lean tap water and sent all kinds of human emotional thoughts and feelings to t he water samples before freezing them. To his astonishment the water reacte d to his intentions. When negative thoughts and feelings were used, the ice c rystals were imperfectly shaped, were chaotic in form or did not crystallize at all. However when he sent loving thoughts and feelings to the water before fr eezing it, the most beautiful and regular highly organized crystals formed.

Bach’s Air  Heavy metal "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 32 Dr. Emoto’s Hado theory postulates that, ‘since all phenomena is at heart resonating energy, by changing the vibration we can change the substance’. So when we want to change the internal vibration of le t’s say polluted water, we can use our positive intention to heal the water! And that’s exactly what Dr. Emoto and a long list of ‘followers’ are now doing. All over the world Hado cleansing rituals are held to c lean our rivers, seas and oceans. The first time he demonstrated the effect o f Hado in public, he gathered a crowd of 350 people around Japan’s most polluted lake, Lake Biwa on the 25 th of July 1999. The foul water smelled horrendous cau sed by the algae ‘Kokanada’ that yearly covered the lake! In the gathering orga nized by Dr. Emoto a critical mass of people projected their positive intentions like a laser beam onto the polluted waters. Water samples of the lake’s water were taken before and after the ceremony and a dramatic improvement of the structure of the wate r crystals was detected. A month after the ceremonial, a newspaper article app eared in the influential Kyoto Shinburn newspaper. The article stated that this ye ar ‘the spread of the water algae condition had improved and that the foul sten ch had disappeared’. ( \u0006 ) Meditation and prayer Maharishi Mahesh Yogi teaches transcendental medita tion (TM), a form of meditation that brings the spiritual seeker into hi gher states of consciousness. His present residence is situated in the woods of Vlodr op in the Netherlands. He has selected this place because according to the Mahari shi, this place has positive vibrations. The followers of Maharishi count an inc reasing number of well- scientifically educated people. They have come to a ccept the teachings of the Maharishi that meditation has a positive effect on world peace. Science has driven them to compare notes with eastern spiritual teachi ngs and given them a new conviction. Transcendental Meditation, (TM), has become very po pular all over the world especially since the Beatles visited the Maharishi in the sixties. Scores of business managers have been inspired to use TM as a stress-r elieve method. Extensive studies conducted on the effect of TM sho wed that when practiced by a critical mass of people they could substantially dr op the crime rate in a large city. When the group discontinued their TM, the crime rate went up again to the average level. This effect has become known as the Maharishi effect and multiple studies have proven that this effect is real. Many people pray for their loved-ones when they are seriously ill. They hope that a divine force will hear and respect their request and cure the patient. Others pray by using their inner powers and believe that t hey can heal at a distance using their sheer intention to help the patient. Th ree medical researches of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Ant onio published their results of a scientific investigation about the role belief plays in prayer in the summer of 2004. A group of 86 people were, without their prior know ledge of the experiment, assigned to a prayer treatment or to a control grou p.

Eight volunteers from a local prayer group pr ayed twice a day for a period of at least 3 minutes. After a month, the results were compiled for public ation. Here is a summary: • Pain scores were significantly lower in the prayed for group than in the control group. • Patients with the most intense belief in prayer had the best improvements in physical functioning in contrast to the control group. • Patients in the intervention group with a lower bel ief in the power of prayer had a significantly worse physical function outcome. Now their research showed two things: • Prayer has a real measurable effect on the patient being prayed for. • The patients faith that treatment by prayer can be established has a measurable effect on the effect of the prayer itsel f. ( \u0007 ) The healing power of the mind If anyone in the last decades has had a major impac t in the holistic healing community it must be Doctor Deepak Chopra. Born in I ndia he had his medical education and training in the Unites States. It was after a personal meeting with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi that he was persuaded to study the 4000 year old traditional Indian medical art called Ayurveda. Ayr veda is Sanskrit for the ‘the science of life’. After his meeting with the Mahari shi he went to take the train where he met a friend who handed him a book about A yurveda. One and one makes two and Deepak new there was a message here. After reading the book, he became convinced that there was more to Ayurveda than commonly believed in the West. Doctor Deepak Chopra had become frustrat ed in his medical career about the fact that he could do so little for his c ancer patients. A patient of Deepak diagnosed with lung cancer got medical advice to quit smoking and the man replied: ‘Thank you doctor, my mother in law ca n give me that advice, but she don’t charge me 50 bucks!’ In his book ‘Quantum Healing, exploring the frontie rs of mind/body medicine’, Doctor Chopra explains the relation between quantum physics and Ayurveda. Ayurveda teaches that all is spirit and that the bo dy is created by the mind. In this respect the mind must have all the power to he al the body. Notice that there is no ‘hard problem’ to be solved in Ayurveda, ther e simply is no bridge to cross between the immaterial and the material world since there is no duality in mind and body. According to Deepak Chopra our deepest thoughts and feelings play a significant role in the healing of the patient that has been se riously underestimated in western medical practices. The body is constantly r ecycling every atom in every cell. In a year’s time the body is completely renew ed and every atom in every cell has been replaced. Then what exactly is it that kee ps that tumor in its place if the whole body is rebuilt every year? Deepak explains t hat the blue print for the physical body is the more subtle quantum mechanical body. Diseases appear in the quantum body before they manifest in the physic al body. As long as the disease is not removed from the quantum body, the b lue print, the body will continuously reconstruct the body along with the tu mor. "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 34 According to Deepak the mind has the capability to p roduce every drug that Hofman La Roche sells only at no expense, in the pu rest form and in the perfect dose. The ability of the mind to heal the body may explai n the well know placebo effect, the effect whereas a patients is cured by his own s uggestion since he has been administered only a dummy. The ability of the mind to heal the body could also be at cause in the miraculous spontaneous remission s of cancer that have been reported so often in the medical files but for whic h there is no medical explanation. The nocebo effect is the opposite effe ct of the placebo effect; it is the negative effect that the doctor’s diagnoses hav e on the cure of the patient. Therefore the doctor-patient relation is of a cruci al importance in the healing process. It is a western ethical code that the pati ent has the right to know his medical condition in all cases, however the drawbac k is that when a doctor straightforwardly gives a patient the diagnoses ‘yo u have an incurable cancer sir’, he has actually given his patient the death sentenc e. The diagnosis ‘incurable’ kills the patient’s last hope for a cure and along with it his mental abilities to heal himself, besides that he will probably go into a me ntal shock as well. ( \b ) Collective consciousness Does something like a collective conscious, a consci ous shared by all humans exist? Carl Jung has speculated that we all share a common sub-consciousness. But could such be proven by science? At the prestigious Princeton Anomalies Research Ins titute (PEAR) they are convinced that a collective consciousness does exis t, in fact they are monitoring it all over the world right now while you read these w ords! At Princeton for some time now, Professor Robert Jahn and his colleagues have been conducting a series of laboratory experiments trying to prove or disprove the existence of psychokineses (PK for short), the ability of though t to affect inanimate objects. PK has become popular by stage performer and spoon bender Uri Geller. At Princeton they took PK very serious and wanted to t est whether or not the phenomenon was real. They used RNG machines to do this. A RNG is a rando m noise generator, a device that generates according to the uncertainty princip le of quantum mechanics a totally random noise. This noise is translated into a binary state, a 1 or 0. Now since the noise is random we expect a 50-50-chance occurrence of both ones and zeroes produced by the RNG device. Participants in the experiments conducted at the PEAR institute were asked to mentally influence the outcome of the RNG number generations. The participants were ordinary people and had no prior known psychic abilities whatsoever. However at the PEAR institute it was proven time and again, that mental abilities of ‘mind over matter’ exist since the 50-50 change RNG outcomes could be substantially altered. They conducted tests for more than a decade, tested hundreds of subjects in thousands of trials when they finally concluded tha t PK was real. They even concluded that PK abilities are common to everyone to some extent. Their subjects did not have any prior known paranormal ab ilities. At Princeton they have become so convinced that PK is real that they are now searching for a theoretical explanation. Dr. Jahn’s quote from the S unday Telegraph 16 th November 1997:"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 35 \"We don't see much point in continuing the collecti on of yet more data,\" he said. \"We're setting up experiments to get a better compr ehension of these phenomena.\" If you’re interested and want to test your psychic abilities on-line on the Internet yourself here’s the Internet address: www.parapsych.org/online_psi_experiments.html At some odd 30 universities all over the world RNG devices have been installed and are connected over the Internet. The next thing PEAR wanted to test with the RNG devices was whether a human collective consciou sness exists. The project was called the ‘Global Consciousness Project’ and t he RNG machines were used to send their results over the Internet to a central c omputer at Princeton. The investigations proved that the RNG devices coul d register shocking global events that moved the masses in unison. A few of th ese events are the funeral of Princess Diana, the verdict in the Simpson case and more recently the 911 attacks in New York. All of these events showed measurable and significa nt deviations from the expected 50-50-chance pattern. In case of the 911 a ttacks on the twin towers, the RNG devices even registered deviations before t he actual attack! RNG registration on the day the twin towers came do wn Psi experiments Russel Targ and Harold Puthoff in the seventies con ducted a number of experiments to find out if telepathic transmissions of thoughts and images between individuals are possible. They used a sende r and a receiver and put them in electro-magnetically sealed chambers. The s ender was submitted to a light that flashed at regular intervals. Both the s ender and the receiver were attached to devices that registered their brainwave s, their electroencephalogram (EEG). The flashing of the light was reflected in t he electroencephalogram of the sender, as was expected. Next the receiver was aske d to receive the images of the sender. After a while the receiver started to p ick up the light flashes that were admitted to the sender. The same patterns show ed up in the receiver’s EEG, although he was in a separate and electro-magnetica lly shielded room. Russel Targ and Harold Puthoff reproduced the earli er tests of Jacobo Grinberg- Zylberbaum of the National University of Mexico. He performed more than fifty experiments over five years. Jacobo Grinbert-Zylber baum placed his participants in shielded Faraday cages. Prior to any tests, the participants were asked to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 36 meditate for twenty minutes. After this period they were placed in the Faraday cages and also connected to EEG measuring equipment . The sender was subjected to a series of at least a hundred stimuli ranging from intense light flashes to hard sounds and electric shocks applied to the index and ring finger. Grinberg-Zylberbaum proved that in 25 percent of th e cases the stimuli admitted to the sender were transferred to the receiver and showed up in the latter’s EEG as a potential that was coherent with the potential in the sender’s EEG. Similar results could be replicated with the same participa nts in later experiments. When the same test was conducted with an infatuated coup le, the brainwaves in the EEG of both lovers showed a remarkable coherence ev en when no stimuli were admitted. The couple themselves said they had a str ong feeling of connectedness and oneness. These experiments proved that feelings of connected ness have a physical representation in the separate brains of separate i ndividuals. If we can really connect to another person such that our own brainwa ves show up in the other person’s brainwaves, we may start to ask questions about our own individuality, our own separate ego. Where does it start and where does it end? These experiments seem to underpin Hameroff’s quant um brain theory of proto consciousness that is received instead of being pro duced by the brain. The question hence is do we have a separate ego or is i t some kind of an illusion? ( \t ) Working for the Defense Intelligent Agency (DIA) of the U.S.A, Russel Targ and Harold Puthoff later conducted a great number of ps i experiments in intelligence area that was coined ‘remote viewing’. The objectiv e of ‘remote viewing’ is to spy on enemies by means of psychic protocols. Targ and Puthoff impressed the DIA with the results they obtained with the famous psyc hic Ingo Swann. It is a public secret that the intelligence departments of the U.S. A and Russia have been using remote viewing techniques for some decades now howe ver just recently seventy three thousand pages of secret documents about extr asensory spying has been declassified by the United States. The CIA now state s openly that they have been using remote viewing as a means of espionage. ( ) Morphic fields The Japanese monkey Macaca fuscata, living on the i sland Koshima of the Japanese coast had been a subject for study for at least 30 years. In 1952 researchers fed the monkeys sweet potatoes that they dropped in the sand. The potatoes were dirty and the monkeys altho ugh they liked the sweetness of the potatoes, obviously disliked the d irt. A young baby monkey found the solution and washed the potatoes in a nea rby stream and handed it to her mother. Once she had taught this trick to her m other gradually more and more monkeys mastered this trick. Between 1952 and 1958 a critical group of monkeys e stimated to be a hundredth had learned the trick of washing the potatoes, now monkeys are slow learners aren’t they? "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 37 However after the supposed hundredth monkey learned to wash his potatoes, all of a sudden the whole tribe on the island mastered this trick. Even more surprising colonies of monkeys on other islands and on the mainland all of a sudden began to wash their sweet potatoes. For some unexplained reason, the ability was transm itted to other monkeys on remote locations. Although the exact count, the cri tical mass that was needed for this phenomenon to happen is uncertain, it has beco me famous as the ‘Hundredth monkey phenomenon’. Studies were conducted to see if the effect is also applicable to humans and they revealed that also humans share knowledge unconscio usly as if we share a common storehouse, a common database. When certain p uzzles were taught to single members of a group, the puzzles could be sol ved significantly easier and faster solved when the ‘hundredth’ monkey of the gr oup had learned the trick. According to cutting-edge out of the established fr amework-reasoning biologist Rupert Sheldrake, our consciousness is connected to unseen collective fields that he calls morphic fields. Every member of a group co ntributes to the morphic field and the total awareness of the morphic field is acc essible to the whole group. There are countless morphic fields, at least one fo r every species. Sheldrake also believes that the morphic fields con tain the information, the building plan of a living organism. Although it is commonly believed that DNA contains all the information required to build an o rganism, this is certainly not true. The DNA contains only the information for the construction of the materials that are required to build the organism; it does no t contain the assembly plan itself! In the first stage of the embryo all cells are a 100 % identical and differentiation takes places after the fifth cell d ivision (32 cells). But where does this information come from, what cell is to differe ntiate into what, what part of the embryo is to become a head cell and what a tail cell? The information cannot possibly come from the DNA itself, since the cells can’t discriminate among themselves, so what is orchestrating the embryo gro wth? Rupert Sheldrake thinks that this information is stored in an external morp hic field. It may also be the explanation of the rather strang e phenomenon of gene recovery discovered on fruit flies. Biologist had r emoved the genes that were responsible for visual eyesight from a colony. The flies all went blind, however miraculously after a few generations the genes were restored in the DNA and the flies could see again! It is now believed that the information of the missing genes was recovered from the morphic field of the DNA of t he fruit fly. Consciousness the ground of all being Professor of Physics at the University of Oregon, Am it Goswami, author of ‘The Self Aware Universe’, ‘Quantum creativity’, ‘Physic s of the Soul’ and ‘The Visionary Window’, is the founder of a whole new br and of science called ‘science within consciousness’. He believes the paradoxes im posed by quantum science can only be solved if an opposite view is adopted a bout consciousness. In the current worldview consciousness is regarded the res ult, the epiphenomenon of brain activity. Consciousness is simply the result of the chemical dance of molecules and electrical fields of energy that go a round in the brain. This causal deterministic view of consciousness is called upwar d causation and claims that our free will is illusionary. All human behavior is simply determined by our chromosomal makeup and the sum of mechanical, elect rical and chemical processes that happen in the body. Following this c oncept, humans are just"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 38 complex machines without free will. Amit Goswami ho wever believes in a downward causation for consciousness and that consc iousness is the ground of all being. He has a very simple reasoning: ‘how can con sciousness be the result of the physical world, if the physical world by grace of the collapse of the quantum wave requires consciousness observation? Consciousn ess cannot be both its own cause and its own result at the same time! The chic ken and egg paradox is solved if consciousness is seen as primordial. Amit Goswami’s religious Hindu background taught hi m that the mind of Brahman is the only cause for the universe, however from hi s scientific skeptic background he refused to believe it. Finally he gave in and ac cepted that his religion may have been telling the truth all along. He is trying to teach that our material realism, th e belief that our material world is the only reality there is, is false and that the ground of all being is consciousness. ( \u0001\u000b ) Recapitulation In this chapter we have seen that consciousness has a far greater impact in our daily experience of the world than ever believed be fore. The impact of consciousness is not restricted to the quantum real m of quantum physics alone, it plays a significant role in the world at large that we live in. The centuries old idea of a strict separation betwe en body and mind suggested by René Descartes is false. Our thoughts and feelings are not limited to our bodily internal experiences of reality but have a measurab le and provable effect on the outer world. Science can no longer claim that consc iousness is solely the domain of spirituality and that there is a strict borderli ne that should not be crossed. It has brought quantum physicist Amit Goswami to be lieve that we have held the world upside down. It’s not that consciousness is a n effect of the materialistic world; no it’s the very cause of it. But if this is true, if consciousness creates the physical world, what does it create it from? At least consciousness should involve some form of energy, a spiritual energy for that matter that is required to create anything at all. If the quantum brain theory is right that consciousness is everywhere in the un iverse and not restricted to the brain, then this energy should be found anywhere in the universe as well. In the next chapter we will see what quantum scientist hav e discovered about the ‘empty space’ in the universe, the space between pl anets and stars, but also the space between the electrons and the nucleus in the atom. It doesn’t seem to be empty at all but it contains an abundant amount of energy! "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 39 Chapter 4 The zero point field The invisible field Quantum science in the 20 th century revealed the presence of an all-pervasive background sea of quantum energy in the universe. C ambridge University’s Dr. Harold Puthoff was one of the first to measure this energy of the universe. This energy was measured at zero degrees Kelvin, the abs olute lowest possible temperature in the universe equal to minus 273 degr ees Celsius. At this temperature according to Newtonian physics all mole cular and atom movement should have seized and no energy should be measured at all! Instead of finding no energy, as was expected, he found what he called a ‘seething cauldron’ of energy and henceforth it was given the name zero po int energy (ZPE). Harold Puthoff proved that the physical vacuum is not devo id of energy at all and that instead of being a vacuum, space it is actually a p lenum. ( \u0001 ) In quantum electrodynamics the background sea of qu antum energy is now used to explain the uncertainty principle that was disco vered by quantum physics, the unpredictable behavior of sub atom particles. The j iggling of sub atomic particles is believed to be caused by the zero point field. R andomly virtual photons jump back and forth between the zero point field and our physical world. They collide with and are absorbed by sub atomic particles that will be excited into a higher energy state. After nanoseconds the energy is relea sed again by means of another virtual photon that returns to the zero poi nt field. The photon is called a virtual photon since it comes and goes from the zer o point field and is not here to stay in the real world. It is only used in the ener gy exchange between the zero point field and the material world. Not only photons but also all sorts of elementary p articles come into our physical reality from nowhere at all. They seem to come from the zero point field, make their appearance in our physical reality for only t housandths or millionths of a second to disappear once again in the void. These f orms of mystical particles where called virtual particles since they were not stable enough to stay around in our reality. The zero point field is a quantum foam of virtual particles and photons. Our universe is never at rest not even in empty space! Even in a pitch-dark room where absolutely no light from the outside world can penetrate, scientist can still measure the presence of virtual photons. The existence of the zero point field has been know n in the quantum science community for a long time, but most scientists simp ly ignored its relevance. They simply nullified the effect of the zero point field energy in their scientific calculations since it only bothered them. As a resu lt they annihilated the effect of the zero point field because they believed the effe ct was insignificant! However a small but growing number of scientists no w take the zero point field very seriously, among them are many professors of n ote and they are now taking on a radical different view of our reality. Their s cientific discoveries and theories are controversial in the eyes of the established sc ience community who are holding on to the old paradigm that our world can a nd eventually will be fully explained by a mechanical model of the universe. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 40 The zero point field is becoming popular to a large r public thanks to scientific journalist Lynn McTaggert who wrote the book ‘The F ield’. She created greater awareness of the zero point field that may otherwis e not have been disclosed to the public at large. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in new zero point discoveries and the astonishing role hum an consciousness plays in this field. For paranormal and psychic phenomenon, there is now a scientific basis for study. ( \u0002 ) One of the first magazines covering the zero point field at length is Ode which appears in the US and the Netherlands The article a bout the zero point field appeared in the November 2003 issue, nr 61. ( \u0004 ) A sea of energy Princeton University’s John Wheeler and Richard Fey nman valued the zero point energy. They calculated that a cup of zero point en ergy is enough to bring all the oceans of the world to boiling point. The equivalen t in matter of the zero point energy using Einstein’s famous equation of E= m * c ² is 10 ⁹⁴ gram/cm³! This is more matter per cubic centimeter than the total mas s of the entire universe! Contrary to what we have always believed matter is not a condensed substance but a diffuse form of energy. ( \u0001 ) Now how is this possible, we seem to live in a huge sea of energy and we don’t even notice it? We’re like fish submerged in water but never ever aware of the fact that there is water all around them. Haisch and Rueda contributed to the zero point fiel d using Hal Puthoff’s work, by proving Newton’s famous law of inertia which states that inertia is the product of mass and acceleration, F= m * a. This old law that Newton took as an assumption, an axiom in his Principia, the holy Bib le of classical physics, could never be proven in 300 years! But by taking account of the zero point field, Rueda and Haisch proved that inertia is simply the resistance, the drag that objects experience when accelerated in the zero poi nt field. Sonoluminescense There exists a very weird phenomenon in nature that is called sonoluminescense, it is the transformation of sound waves into light energy! It is well known experiment in mainstream physics. In the experiment a small spherical glass, filled w ith water is resonated by harmonious sound waves of 20 KHertz originating fro m sound speakers. Next a very tiny air bubble is blown into the center of th e spherical glass flask. When the air bubble is exactly centered in the flask it star ts to rhythmically implode and emit light. The light is emitted in ultra short lig ht flashes representing trillion-fold concentrations of the original sound energy. Temper atures within the center of the bubble reach an astronomical height of 30.000 d egrees and the pressure is immense."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 41 Mainstream physics is still having problems with th is experiment and are speculating about cold fusion, others think that th ere is no other explanation than that the abundant light energy comes from the zero point field! The sonoluminescense effect has stimulated the imaginat ion of Hollywood filmmakers, and they featured a whole film about this physical phenomenon, the film is called ‘Chain Reaction’. Further investigations about this natural phenomeno n may lead into what is called sonofusion, a kind of cold fusion that physi cs has been seeking for so long. Sonoluminescense experiment Harvesting the energy Since the word of zero point energy was out in the world, a new breed of gold diggers was born. Many inventors are on the hunt fo r this zero point energy since it is free energy. The story goes that even Michael Faraday and Nicola Tesla discovered the application of free energy. Once you know how to delve it you can tap it from the vacuum in an abundance that is inex haustible. Image this, your TV set having no power cable since it is running just on energy it receives from the vacuum? Can you image that, do you know what this m eans? Bye bye to oil, maybe now you get the hunch. In a world that is hea vily dependant on oil, many people in power today will not be so pleased since they will lose all their power and wealth. It is for this reason and the possible military app lications that these inventions have been suppressed globally in the last few decad es. The United States of America prohibits pending patents to be exported ou tside the USA if they are believed to have dangerous military applications. H owever retired army lieutenant Tom Bearden has patented an over unity free energy device called the Motionless Electromagnetic Generator, the MEG. The device is a n over unity device and Bearden claims that it produces a 100 times more en ergy output than the energy that is put into it to keep it running. It is a per petual motion machine in the true sense of the word, however it is not in conflict wi th the laws of energy conservation, the second law of thermodynamics, sin ce it simply taps the energy from the vacuum. Bearden has redone 19 th century James Clerk Maxwell’s work, the founder of the classical electrodynamics theory . He says the interpretation of the original work of Maxwell is seriously flawed an d has been misinterpreted and simplified by Lorentz and Heavenside for better und erstanding. Bearden"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 42 discovered that the original quaternion equations o f Maxwell were overlooked and, as a result, so was the possibility of tapping free energy from the vacuum. Bearden is in good company about this statement sin ce it was Max Planck the founder of quantum physics who had always suggested that the validity of Maxwell’s equation should be re-established. In lay terms Bearden’s Meg devices is fundamentally a charged dipole, consisting of two charged plates. He explains that the physica l vacuum creates a virtual photon flux of electromagnetic energy that sustains the electrical dipole potential. The dipole potential is actually the equilibrium be tween the discharge and replenishment by virtual photons from the vacuum. H ence, the static electric field is not static at all, it only appears to be so, muc h like a waterfall, which from a distance looks like one static wall of water, but w hen studied at close range proves to be a constant flow of water. The secret o f the Meg device is not to discharge the charge of the dipole in the same circ uit of the dipole but in another separate electrical circuit. After this the vacuum will automatically replenish the discharged dipole to seek equilibrium. The charge t hat flows in the other circuit is said to deliver real electrical power. In this way zero point energy is extracted from the vacuum and discharged in an electrical circuit. Bearden says that all our curre nt sources of electrical energy such as batteries, dynamos and power plants all hav e one problem in common. When the electrical current is fed back to the sourc e that created the electrical current to begin with, it will kill the source of t he virtual photon flux with the vacuum. Unknowingly we’ve been taking buckets full of zero point energy from the river but were unintentionally throwing it stra ight back into the river. Tom Bearden also made a very important new discover y concerning a new type of ‘electromagnetic energy’. According to Bearden t he four Maxell equations used in today’s electrical engineering are simplified ve rsions of Maxwell’s original work. According to Bearden it was Oliver Heaviside who re moved the scalar part of the complex numbers in Maxwell’s equations leaving only the vectors in Maxwell’s equations for easy calculation. This is why science today only knows the classical electromagnetic wave that is a transverse wave. In the transverse wave the electri cal and magnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave oscillate perpendicular to the propagation of the wave. Bearden says that by removing the scalar part in Ma xwell’s equations we missed the fact that energy can also propagate as a longit udinal wave at super-luminal speed (faster than the speed of light). Longitudina l waves are akin to sound waves and oscillate in the same direction as their propagation. According to Bearden the internal longitudinal wave in the electromagnetic wave is the fundamental wave and comprises all known ele ctromagnetic fields of any form or shape. The scalar component of the electrom agnetic wave can be created from two opposing electromagnetic waves, a wave and its anti wave. Both waves"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 43 will cancel each other’s electrical and magnetic fi eld components when the waves are in phase spatially but 180 degrees out of phase temporally. Another way of saying the same thing is that the anti wave is movi ng backwards in time from the future and into the past cancelling the forward in time moving wave. The result is a scalar wave. Scalar waves are very different from electromagnetic waves; for one thing they can travel over immense distances wi th no loss of energy. Another important difference is that scalar waves travel at super-luminal speed (faster than light). In the early 20 th century Nicola Tesla was the first to discover the scalar wave. He used induction coils to create these scalar waves. He had conducted many experiments while sending scalar waves around the E arth proving that scalar waves propagate over long distances with no loss in field strength. Unlike our current familiar electromagnetic wave that dissipat es and looses its energy at a rate equal to the square of the distance from the s ource, Tesla’s longitudinal waves could travel any distance with practically no loss of energy. Tesla in his time believed in the existence of the ether and that it could be harnessed for free energy that could be the salvati on of humankind. He addressed the American Institute of Electrical Engi neers in 1891 with these words; ‘.. with the power derived from it, with eve ry form of energy obtained without effort, from stores forever inexhaustible, humanity will advance with great strides, it is a mere question of time when m an will succeed in attaching their machinery to the wheelwork of nature’. Tom Bearden’s scalar waves have also been discovere d by Russian scientists, however Russian science refers to scalar waves as t orsion waves. We will learn much more about torsion waves later. As a former mi litary man, Bearden is convinced that the Russians used this technology to create an arsenal of scalar wave weaponry during the Cold War. Bearden’s theory, which he has put in writing in a book called ‘Energy from the vacuum, concepts & principles’, is proven by the fi rst marketed power device called the ‘Patterson Power Cell’, an innovative ov er unity energy device. The Patterson Power Cell is developed and patented by James A. Patterson, scientist of the Clean Energy Technologies in Dallas . It is a glass enclosure filled with thousands of tiny palladium coated spheres tha t serve as the electrodes. It’s runs on heavy water. When started with a small inpu t power of 1.4 Watts, the cell puts out an enormous amount of heat, hundreds of ti mes the energy input. Claims are that the US Patent Office has tested it and four patents have been awarded. It’s being studied at different universiti es worldwide and is taken very seriously: now the dispute seems not to be if it wo rks but how it works!

John Hutchison l ives in Vancouver Canada in an apartment that he has completely stuffed with el ectronic equipment.

Using radio wave interference of low energy input but of high voltages of hundreds of kilo Volt s, he discovered amazing effects ranging from:"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 44 - levitation of heavy metals - fusion of dissimilar materials - anomalous heating of metals without burning adjacen t material - fracturing metals in a strange way. He has documented all of these effects on video and has demonstrated his discoveries to many qualified scientists and famous people who are now supporting him financially. He shows his Hutchinson effect movies on-line on the Internet ( www.hutchisoneffect.com/videos.htm ). In his movies we see objects floating in space, metals vibrating as if they are puddings. He even levitates a heavy canon ball. He is also able to demonstrate th e fusion of dissimilar objects such as wood and metal. The wood simply submerged i nto the metal and when the Hutchinson device was switched off, the wood re mained as if it had been perfectly glued into the metal! In the same way he has melted coins into aluminum bars. His experiments defy all common laws of nature! His anomalous waves having anti-gravity abilities seem to alter space-time its elf. He is able to melt metals without any burn marks or obvious heat radiation. Materials such as wood held in the same place where the metal is melted were not burned! This simply defies the laws of thermody namics whereas a heat radiation should at least be noted. Somehow his dev ice seems to dissociate the normal organization of the atoms in a material. It is as if the Van der Waals forces that bind the atoms in the material are shut off and the atoms are free to be molded into a new configuration. John Hutchinson has also developed a self-sustainin g battery that recharges itself from zero point energy, so he claims! The battery g enerates 18V at 250mA!

( \u0005 ) We could make an end to all poverty in the world by tapping into the free zero point energy from the vacuum.

"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 46 Recapitulation Empty space is not empty at all! The vacuum is actu ally a plenum. It contains an abundant amount of energy, the zero point energy. T here is a cosmic dance of energy back and forth between the physical realm an d the zero point field, a constant creation and destruction of matter from th e void. The continuous flow of energy in and out of the material world resembles w hat Eastern Hindu cosmology described about our universe as the cosmic dance of Shiva. Could it be that what scientists are observing as t he zero point energy is in fact our own collective consciousness and that we are cr eating the physical world from this energy? If consciousness is indeed the first c ause of physical reality and not the effect of it in our universe, at least we have identified a candidate for the required spiritual energy! In the next chapter we will see how an ancient scie nce that has been secretly preserved throughout history is now being reconstru cted by modern science. This ancient knowledge is called sacred geometry and for some reason it was very important to be preserved for future generations. I n antiquity it was taught in the mystery schools of the Egyptians and the Greeks. On penalty of death, initiates had to keep this knowledge secret throughout histor y. In the West this knowledge was preserved in Gnostic circles and secret societi es of Freemasonry. Sacred geometry claims that everything in our unive rse has an underlying invisible geometric structure following a fundament al principle. Contemporary scientists now use sacred geometry to explain how t he physical dimension is constructed from the omni present and all-pervasive background energy in the physical vacuum. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 47 Chapter 5 The revival of an ancient science At the other end of the scientific spectrum of cont emporary science an ancient science is being restored. For ages it has been pre served carefully. It is more or less an art form and it is called ‘sacred geometry’ . Why sacred, what is so sacred about geometry? In spiritual mystery-schools of the past it was taught that sacred geometry has been used by God to create the universe. We now know that sacred geometry contains many mysterious elements t hat elegantly describe many things such as the growth of plants, the propo rtions of the human body, the orbit of the planets, light, the structure of c rystals, music. The list goes on and on. We’ll give a few examples in this chapter. Now why do we introduce sacred geometry in a book t hat is about contemporary and ground-breaking science? The reason is that sac red geometry seems to be the key to a new post quantum physics that is emerg ing that better explains the existence of the zero point field. The new physics that is emerging is a revival of 19 th century ether physics and it is discussed in the n ext chapter. The archaic science of sacred geometry can be trace d back to the Egyptian civilization but may well be a heritage from an ear lier Atlantean culture and we’ll provide sufficient clues in this book to sustain th is fact. Sacred geometry contains elements that are crucial in understanding ether ph ysics introduced in the next chapter. Surprisingly enough sacred geometry also shows up i n the many crop circles that have been appearing in the last two decades all ove r the world. Someone somewhere must be teaching us a lesson that must at least have some relevance. I will not go into detail about the source of crop circles whether or not they are extraterrestrial; I personally think it they are, h owever the fact cannot (yet) be proven. What is far more interesting is that crop circles co ntain intelligent embedded geometry. The fact is that hundreds, thousands of c rop circles appear each year and that their design is of a much higher intellige nce than that of people who may have found it interesting enough to create hoaxes! There is abundant evidence that apart from the very few crop circles that were indeed identified as hoaxes, the majority of crop circles are genuine. It was pr oven that the stems of the crops are bent in a peculiar way by an excessive heat pro duced by a hitherto unknown energy source since no burning marks were found. St rong energy fields can be measured hours after the crop circles are formed in and around the crop circle. In my opinion the significance of crop circles is t hat contemporary scientists are getting hints by means of crop circles to seek for more understanding of geometry in physics and their discoveries of the ze ro point field. In the ancient teachings of sacred geometry it is b elieved that the sacredness of everything in the universe can be described in term s of geometrical patterns coming from the hand of God. As unbelievable as tha t may seem, it can be illustrated with ample examples that indeed many un expected things have a hidden geometry that is not obvious at first sight. It is now believed that the Egyptians applied sacre d geometry in the construction of the Great Pyramid and many other monuments. The Egyptians had two mystery-schools; one was called the left eye of Hor us. This school taught the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 48 female principles of creation, about love and compa ssion. The other school was called the right eye of Horus and taught the intell igent male principles of creation; sacred geometry was a main subject. Right eye of Horus Sacred geometry has also left its traces in other c ultures such as in the gothic architecture of European churches and cathedrals (C hartres), the Parthenon in Athens, paintings by Leonardo da Vinci and the Hind u classical dance. Sacred geometry has been preserved in circles of Freemason ry in utmost secrecy. ( \u0001 ) Freemasonry symbol The Freemasonry symbol is a carpenter’s square and a compass, the two only instruments needed in sacred geometry. It is a rule that if you have to use any other instrument than these two to prove something applies to sacred geometry, it may be geometry but it is definitely not sacred! Thanks to people like Robert Lawlor, Bruce Rawles a nd Drunvalo Melchizedek, the art of sacred geometry is now being restored and th anks to the enormous success of the book the ‘Da Vinci Code’ by Dan Brown that bec ame very popular in the year 2004, the awareness that seemingly important k nowledge has been secretly preserved throughout history is now within the publ ic domain. Now let’s take a quick course in this sacred art fo rm and I’ll show you some amazing things in the end. Flower of life Now this is a very important figure in sacred geome try:   Genesis pattern.

We must remember that what we see here is a two dimensional representation of what are actually three-dimensional spheres! Depicted in the picture you also see the hexagram fo rmed by the two equilateral triangles, it’s the Jewish symbol known as the star of David. The star of David in this picture is actually, in 3D, a star tetrahedron or interlaced tetrahedron. It is formed by two interlaced 3 sided pyramids, one poin ting upwards and one pointing downwards. If you’re looking for an exampl e of a star tetrahedron have a look at the cover of this book. Now the next creation story was taught in the right eye of Horus mystery schools and is also the basis of the Hermetic tradition (th e wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus alias the Egyptian Toth). This creatio n story was most likely also familiar in Freemasonry circles. In the beginning the universal mind of God created from a total void or nothingness from the focal point of God’s awareness a single central sphere. The first sphere was all around God on the first day of creation. The next day God created another sphere, the center of this sphere i s located on the surface anywhere of the first sphere.

Also they perfectly fit inside each other and can be perfectly nested. Al forms ha ve a double, an opposite form that can be created from the other. The cube and th e octahedron are doubles for instance. If we take the centers of the faces of th e cube and connect all the lines between these centers we get the octahedron.

Do you start to grasp the geometrica l beauty of symmetry that is involved in all these symbols and how all of the m evolve from a simple progression of the Genesis symbol? Tree of Life overlaid by the Genesis symbol The Tree of Life is the mystical symbol used in the Jewish esoteric Kabbalah. The Tree of Life is mentioned many times in the Bible a s the tree next to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the center of the Gar den of Eden. Ancient traditions thought that these geometrical patterns were very important and preserved them in mystical esoteric sciences. Torus The torus is also a very important geometrical 3D fo rm and we’ll bring it up here because it is the building block of matter in ether science. It is best compared with a doughnut or the smoke ring from a cigar. Here’s it is: Torus "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 55 It is a sphere, curving inwards on top and bottom, such that it has a hole in the middle! It also resembles an apple. The torus is th e result of rotating the Genesis pattern 360 degrees around the center. Golden Mean Another important subject of sacred geometry is the Golden Mean. The Golden Mean is a very special ratio and is expressed by th e Greek letter Ф called Phi. It equals Ф = ½ * √5 + ½ = 1.618 Phi like Pi is an irrational number, meaning you ca n never calculate its exact value, you can only approximate it. The Phi ratio is expressed in the Golden Section. T he Golden Section is a the length of let’s say a rope when it is divided such that the ratio of the longer part of the rope to the whole is exactly the same ratio as the shorter part of the rope is to the longer part. Ø Ø When the Phi ratio is applied to a rectangle whereas B = 1 and A has length Ø, the rectangle is called a Golden Rectangle. The Golden Rectangle can be used to create a spiral , the Golden Spiral. Starting with one Golden Rectangle, a second Golden Rectangl e can be attached to the first using the longest side of the rectangle, side A as the shortest side B of the next rectangle. To this end the second rectangle is constructed 90 degrees perpendicular to the first rectangle. If this proce ss is continued, called the spiralling of the Golden Rectangle, a curved line c an be drawn through the corners of the rectangles that will create a Golden Mean spiral. The spiralling of the Golden Mean spiral continues indefinitely in in ward and outward directions, it’s getting smaller and smaller spiralling inwards and getting bigger and bigger spiralling outwards."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 56 Golden Mean spiral A variant of the Golden Mean spiral is the Fibonacc i spiral. The difference with the Golden Mean spiral is that is does not spiral in in definitely but starts with a Golden Rectangle of which one side has length 1 and the other length Phi. Gradually when the Fibonacci spiral, spirals outwar d, there will be no distinction noticeable any more between a true Golden Mean spir al and the Fibonacci spiral. The Fibonacci spiral is based on the progression of the Fibonacci sequence. Crop circle, fractal spirals, Milk Hill, Wiltshire august 12 th 2001 Fibonnaci sequence Leonardo Fibonnaci (1175 AD), a great mathematician of the Middle Ages discovered the Fibonnaci sequence by studying natur e. He studied the growth of rabbit populations, plants and flowers and how they grow their leaves and petals and discovered a well-defined mathematical sequence in all of this. This is the Fibonnaci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 etc. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two p receding numbers starting with the root number 1. The Fibonnaci sequence prog resses towards the Golden Mean if we divide two successive numbers in the seq uence. 1/1 = 1 2/1 = 2.0 3/2 = 1.5 5/3 = 1.667 8/5 = 1.60 . 144/89 = 1.618"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 57 The Fibonnaci sequence propagates towards Phi (Ø) b ut never reaches it since it is an irrational or transcendent number. Fibonacci spirals and Golden Mean ratios appear eve rywhere in the universe. The spiral is the natural flow form of water when it is going down the drain. It is also the natural flow form of air in tornados and hurric anes. Here’s another beautiful example of a Fibonnaci spiral in nature, it’s the N autilus shell and every book about sacred geometry contains one:     Nautilus shell The Golden Mean ratio is all over the human body, i n the ratios between the bones, the length of your arms and legs. The Golden Mean is also the ratio in the distance from the navel to your toe and the distanc e from your navel to the top of your head. Leonardo da Vinci has beautifully hidden these Golden Mean ratios in his paintings:   Leonardo da Vinci and the Phi ratios in the human h and Music Greek philosopher Pythagoras discovered a wonderful mathematical relation between the harmonic notes in music. He noticed tha t by depressing a string in different positions on the fingerboard of a guitar like string-instrument that harmonic sounds were created. Some notes sounded be tter than others. At each depression of the string the string is divided in t wo different lengths and the ratio between these lengths were measured by Pythagoras. He marked down all the ratios that sounded harmonically well together. In this way he found the following ratios:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 58 1:1 (open snare) 1:2 (depressed at 1/3 of the length of the string) 3:2 , 5:3, 13:8, 21:13, 34:21 What Pythagoras had discovered is called the Diatoni c musical scale, named after the fact that the string is divided into two length s (Dia = two, tonic = tones) These ratios correspond with the frequencies of the notes produced by the white keys of the piano when attuned in the Diatonic scal e. After the 7 th note the octave of 8 notes is repeated only this time the first and the eighth note are doubled in frequency! The next 7 notes of the white keys on th e piano follow the exact same ratio! Now if you have been paying attention you may alrea dy have noticed that the musical ratios discovered by Pythagoras are the sam e ratios of the Fibonacci sequence! Simply take a number out of the Fibonacci sequence and its successor and you have the musical ratio found by Pythagoras. The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence that gives u s these harmonics in music. The diatonic scale is not the only musical scale, t here are many more, in fact no piano today is tuned in the Diatonic scale. But the principle relation between harmonics in music and mathematical progressions of numbers defined by the Fibonacci sequence is real. Now let’s pretend that we’ve tuned a piano in the D iatonic scale and that we have extended the piano’s keyboard with keys to provide for 49 octaves! That would be one hell of a piano and it would certainly no longe r fit into your living room! But suppose that we could actually play on this pia no. When we play the notes in the last two highest octaves, the keys on the far m ost right side of this piano, they will correspond with the frequencies of the co lors of light! There are seven keys in the highest two octaves tha t are the frequencies of the 7 primary colors of the spectrum of light, the 7 colo rs of the rainbow! So not only does the Fibonacci sequence define the ratios of harmonics in sound but also in the electromagnetic domain of light, it defines the 7 colors of the rainbow!

For instance Beethoven used the Golden Mean in his famous Beethoven’s Fift h. His famous opening motto"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 59 not only appears on the first and the last bar of t he symphony but also on the bar that represents the exact Golden Mean point of his symphony! Bela Bartók used both the Golden Mean and the Fibonacci sequence del iberately in his compositions using the measures 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and 89 to i ntroduce new instruments such as strings, cellos, percussion etc. The questi on is why did these composers add sacred geometry into their music? Maybe they we re not only famous musicians but also Freemasons? Squaring the circle A classical mathematical problem dating all the way back to Plato is called ‘squaring the circle’. In the last three thousand y ears mathematicians have tried to come up with a solution using only a compass and straightedge on how the construct a circle and square such that they have t he same perimeter. In 1882 Lindemann proved that there is no solution to this problem. Since Lindemann’s prove is rather complex, we will show in simple ter ms why the circle cannot be squared. The circumference of the circle with a rad ius of one is 2 * π and π (Pi) is an irrational number (a transcendent number, π can never be measured only be approximated!). But when Pi is irrational and canno t be measured so is the circumference of the circle! However the square’s c ircumference is a real number since it equals 4 times the side, and the side is a real number that can be measured. Hence the circumference of both circle an d square will never be equal in the mathematical sense, however they can become infinitely close. Vitruvian man The Vitruvian man by Leonardo da Vinci "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 60 Now here’s an interesting drawing from Leonardo da Vinci. What he is showing in this sketch is that the human body ‘squares the cir cle’ . When man stretches his arms and holds them horizontally, man’s body will p erfectly fit into the square. On the other hand, when he spreads his legs and rai ses his arms as in the sketch, man’s body can be perfectly circumscribed by a circ le. The circumference of the square ‘equals’ that of the circle. A lot has been written about this sketch alone, it contains a whole lot of hidden sacred geometry. We will not go into all the detail s here, but I want to show you some very amazing things. Ancient wisdom, the Herme tic tradition tells us that the human body can be regarded as a blue print for the universe by means of all the ratios that are found within the body. This may indeed be true. Lets have a look at the following picture: This is the same picture as above, in the picture t here are now two red circles added. The biggest red circle fits perfectly and is inscribed by the square. The smaller red circle’s center is on the outer circle and tangentially touches the inner red circle. Much to our surprise, the upper red circle represen ts the moon and the lower red circle represents the Earth! In mathematical terms : The ratio of the diameter of the smaller red circle to the bigger red circle r / R equals the ratio of the diameter of the moon to the diameter of the Earth! Now lets prove it: ( \u0004 ) Radius of the moon  : r Radius of the Earth  : R Side of the square is  : 2R The perimeter of the square is : 8 R Radius of the outer circle is  : r + R The circumference of the outer circle is : 2 π ( r + R ) Now ‘squaring the circle’ makes the perimeter of th e square equal to the circle: 8 R = 2 π ( r + R ) \u0001 8 R - 2 π R = 2 π r \u0001 R (8 – 2 π ) = 2 π r \u0001 "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 61 r / R = (8 – 2 π ) / 2 π = (4 – π ) / π Earth radius = 6,370,973 m Moon radius = 1,738,000 m Moon to Earth ratio = r / R = 0.27279977 r / R = (4 – π ) / π = 0.273239544 ( π = 3.14159265) There is another mysterious relation to be discover ed in the sketch of the Vitruvian man by Leonardo da Vinci. The Great Pyram id at the Giza plateau in Egypt called after the pharaoh that is supposedly b uried there named Khufu (Cheops in Greek), holds a perfect geometrical rela tion to the squaring of the circle and the Vitruvian man as depicted by Leonard o da Vinci! Look at the picture below: Great Piramid at Giza in relation to Vitruvius man The triangle in the picture is the exact geometrica l proportion of the Great Pyramid at the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt. The angles between the base and the apex (top) of the pyramid are exactly 51 degree s and 51 seconds. (51º 51’). ( \u0005 ) The Great Pyramid and in fact the complete layout o f the Giza plateau with all its pyramids, sacred temples and the sphinx contains a lot of hidden sacred geometry of which we will reveal more in this book. The point I want to make here is that the Egyptians were aware of the art of sacred geometry and how it relates to the universe, as the Giza plateau and in particular the Great Pyramid proves. Let there be light While explaining the Genesis pattern of sacred geome try we mentioned that on the second day of creation God created the vesica p isces and that the vesica pisces is the geometry of the light particle the ph oton. The Holy Bible mentions the second day of creation as the creation of the l ight. By the way did you notice that the vesica pisces has the shape of the eye?"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 62 It was discovered by Buckminster Fuller, who did a lot of the groundwork in reestablishing sacred geometry, that the geometry o f the photon must be two tetrahedrons joined at a common face. Now the geometrical shape of the double tetrahedron are perfectly circumscribed by the vesica pisces whereas the vertices of the te trahedrons neatly touch the face of the vesica pisces. This has been confirmed by Drunvalo Melchizedek another sacred geometry architect! ( \u0006 ) The tetrahedron is also the hidden geometry in the electromagnetic wave (wave form of light) itself. The electrical and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and a spiral can be drawn connecting the elec trical field with the magnetic field that exactly traces over a tetrahedron! Tom Bearden, the inventor of the REG machine has pr oof that James Clerk Maxwell must have known this but that Oliver Heavis ide removed the knowledge of the hidden tetrahedron in the simplified version of electrodynamics. ( \u0007 ) Notre-Dame de Chartres The knowledge of sacred geometry has been preserved in the architecture of churches and cathedrals all over Europe. The cathed ral of Chartres is famous for its sacred geometry that was used in its design. Sa cred geometry can be found for example in the layout of the ground plan and th e stained glass windows that contain the Phi ratio.  West rose window of the Chartres Cathedral and grou nd plan In the Gothic nave of the cathedral we find an enig matic labyrinth on the floor made out of white stone and set within dark marble. The labyrinth measures almost exactly one tenth of the interior length of the cathedral and it is used as the central point, the focus of the whole geometric construction of the cathedral. Obviously the designers thought it to be very impor tant The diameter of the labyrinth measures exactly the size of the west rose window shown in the picture above. At the same time the di stance from the center of the west rose window to the floor is the same distance as the distance from the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 63 center of the labyrinth to the west portal wall of the cathedral. In other words the west rose window and the labyrinth form a perfect e quilateral triangle.     Labyrinth on ground floor of the nave I personally visited the Chartres Cathedral a few t imes. During my last visit, in the summer of 2004, I noticed a young couple, a boy and a girl. The girl kneeled down at the center of the labyrinth and went into a meditation, hands held high into the air. The boy sat beside her. The couple we re totally undisturbed by the crowd that passed by although they drew a lot of at tention! I was intrigued. Obviously the couple knew something more about the sacredness of the labyrinth and they had chosen this spot for their meditation. But what could it possibly mean? If we meander through the labyrinth we have to make these alternating left and right turns. At the same time we turn inwards and o utwards until we enter the center. According to Daniel Winter, whose physics we will study in the next chapter, the labyrinth is the 2D symbolic projection of the Phi spirals that make up a torus. The torus is assumed in his ether physi cs to be the building block of matter. The labyrinth according to Winter is a symb olic projection of the twists and turns the Phi spirals of light take while cente ring into the nucleus of the atom. The Chartres cathedral secretly encoded knowledge o f sacred geometry; however it took many ages before it was discovered. Sacred geometry was used in many more cathedrals and churches throughout France such as the ones of Reims, Sens, Arras, Amiens, St Quentin, Bayeux and Toulous e to name a few. All of them contained labyrinths quiet similar to the one in Chartres. The labyrinth obviously was very important. France was the home of the Merovingian Kings a bloodline that were believed to be the descendants of Jesus Christ. Many authors no w claim that Jesus had children with Maria Magdalene and that the Catholic Church kept this fact secret for many ages. The idea has gained a lot of public awareness since the book the ‘Da Vinci Code’ by Dan Brown was released in the summ er of 2004. The descendants of Jesus are the bloodline of the Holy Grail. Traces of this bloodline lead to Rennes Les Chateaux in France and Roswell C hapel in Britain, the homeland of the Knight Templars and king Arthur. Th is secret of Jesus his marriage to Maria Magdalene and his offshoot was ca refully preserved in secret societies. It is now believed that these secret societies also preserved scientific and Gnostic knowledge that can be traced back to the mythologic al Atlantis. The Atlantean knowledge is supposedly passed on to the Egyptians and from the Egyptians to the Greek Hermetic tradition. In modern times of hi story it was preserved in secret circles of Freemasonry that have existed thr oughout the ages. Leonardo da"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 64 Vinci was a member of such a circle that gave him a ccess to the science of sacred geometry and his membership explains why he used it in his paintings. The importance of sacred geometry especially the meanin g of the Golden Mean has been used in many art forms in modern history, from the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci to the architecture of churches and cathed rals and in music like in the Fifth of Beethoven. ( \b ) Recapitulation This chapter was a lecture in sacred geometry. I wo uld not have introduced it in this book if it didn’t play such a significant role in a new physics that is unfolding. Science is discovering the geometrical and fractal patterns described by sacred geometry in our physical universe, the gravitationa l and electromagnetic energy fields of the Earth, the structure of the atom, the energy fields of the human body. In chapter 3 we showed that the separation once sug gested by René Descartes that there is a strict segregation between the phys ical and the mental dimensions is false. The human mind is very powerful and has p owers of mind over matter. Quantum physicist Amit Goswami suggested that consc iousness is primordial and that the physical realm is created from it. In chapter 4 we discussed the zero point field that was discovered by quantum science. The zero point field is an unlimited inexh austible energy field that is present everywhere in the universe. We suggested tha t the zero point energy might be the spiritual energy required to sustain A mit Goswami’s claim. In this chapter we studied sacred geometry an ancie nt science that is being rediscovered by contemporary scientists. In the next chapter we will use sacred geometry, th e zero point field and our understanding of consciousness and show how scienti sts today assimilate it into a new model of physics, a theory of everything that e xplains both the physical and the mental domain. We will also see that contempora ry science is rediscovering what Plato 2350 years ago suggested: that the world of the atom is constructed from the Platonic solids and discover the importanc e of the Golden Mean in waveforms."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 65 Chapter 6 Ether vibrations Quantum physics that has been around for some hundr ed odd years now is still mainstream’s most accepted physics. Although quantu m science has revealed the presence of the zero point field with all its virtu al sub atomic particles and photons that jump into existence from apparently no where to return to oblivion nanoseconds later, there is still is no reasonable explanation as to how and why particles and photons appear and disappear just lik e that. Also the quantum probability wave is still hard to grasp and visualize. Quantum physics may have proven to be a mathematically corr ect science; for lay people the wave-particle duality of quantum science it is still very hard to grasp. How do we visualize particles that can be both waves and s olid little marbles? Another difficult thing to understand and accept is the atom model presented by Niels Bohr where electrons fly in well-defined shel ls around the nucleus. Since they continuously radiate energy why don’t they eve ntually collapse into the shell? Where does this energy come from? Quantum sci ence has accepted the quantum states of the electrons (distinct shell wit hin the atom) for a fact however it cannot give a satisfying answer as to why the el ectrons only occur in discrete shells within the atom and why they don’t eventuall y crash into the nucleus. Even three hundred years after the discovery of gra vity by Newton, science still has no theoretical explanation for it. This is exactly why science is moving forward to fi nd new theories that can better explain the anomalies of quantum science. Today mai nstream science’s best shot is the string theory. However, a small group of sci entists is now taking a completely different view, and their new thinking i s taking them back to ancient beliefs. For thousands of years brilliant physicists and phi losophers have tried to represent our world in mathematical models of parti cle physics that state that our physical world is made of matter of which the small est part is called the ‘atom’. Atom is an ancient Greek word meaning undividable; it is supposedly the smallest part of matter that cannot be divided anymore! Quan tum mechanics however noticed that particles in some cases behaved like w aves and later introduced the wave-particle duality. Some quantum scientist already suggested in the pas t that the quantum possibility waves could be real waves after all, ex isting in the physical domain. They did not believe the particle wave duality was real. As long ago as 1937 Erwin Schrödinger wrote that ‘what we observe as ma terial bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space itself’. In the end even Einstein rejected the idea of discr ete particles and believed that particles were in fact part of a continuous field. A growing number of post quantum physicists are dis covering what Einstein and Schrödinger already assumed; physics may have been on the wrong track all along, misled by the idea that the material world e xists of separate hard particles! They are suggesting now that we may live in a wave- based universe. Matter is simply the focal point of a vibration in an energy sea called the ether."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 66 The ether In Greek antiquity, the Greek scientists and philos ophers believed that nature only counted four elements; earth, water, fire and air. The atoms were believed to be the building blocks of these four elements of the universe. Aristotle added the fifth element ether and postulated that planets and stars were made of ether stuff. Greek philosopher Plato, 350 years B.C., des cribed these five elements and added that matter is created from the five Platonic solids that he described in his book Timaeus. He equated the tetrahedron with the e lement fire, the cube with the earth, the icosahedron with water, the octahedr on with air and the dodecahedron with the ether, the stuff of the plane ts and stars. We now know of course that there are far more elements in nature t han the ones known in Greek antiquity. However, it is a well-known fact that th e Platonic solids play a role in chemistry as the internal organization structures o f molecules in many materials. For instance the Platonic solids show up in the org anization of molecules in natural crystals. In this chapter we will present a new theory about matter that agrees with Plato that the atoms are constructed from the Platonic so lids. Some scientists now believe that the ether is a subtle energy that flow s through all material things like some liquid, creating the material world from it. T he Platonic solids are believed to be the geometrical internal structures of the at om. Hence the new ether theory uses sacred geometry to explain our physical existe nce. In the 19 th century the luminiferous ether was well accepted b y science! It was the medium through which the electromagnetic wave w as supposed to propagate. In those days physicists believed that matter and t he ether were two separate things. The ether served as the carrier medium for radiant energies such as light and was believed to transmit force fields between m aterial objects in the universe such as gravity. James Clerk Maxwell, the founder o f electrodynamics and his contemporaries didn’t have any doubt that the ether existed. However in 1881 Albert Michaelson and Edward Morley conducted an ex periment to prove the existence of the ether. At the time light was thoug ht to be a compression wave that propagated as a longitudinal wave just like so und waves through the motionless and stationary ether. While the Earth it self is spinning, the Earth must have a relative motion with respect to the motionle ss ether. It was reasoned that when the speed of light is measured on the surface of the Earth it should give different results when measured clockwise or counte rclockwise with respect to the rotation of the Earth around its axis. However the Michelson Morley experiment proved that the speed of light had the same constan t value no matter in what direction the speed of light was measured. From thi s experiment it was concluded that the ether did not exist. Physics has abandoned the ether theory ever since. However today scientists believe that the results o f the Michaelson-Morly have been misinterpreted. So now after a hundred years the ether is back in p hysics. In the new emerging physics, the Newtonian particles and quantum mechan ical particle/wave duality is abandoned. In ether physics there are only waves! The ether is the medium of the electromagnetic wave s and it is assumed that the ether is a non-material fluid-like medium, a subtle energy substance that permeates the entire universe. It is a well known f act that waves require a medium to wave in: without a medium, sorry there ca n be no waves. Sound requires the air. For water waves it is the water t hat waves. But for some"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 67 unexplainable reason ever since the Michaelson-Morl y experiment supposedly disproved the existence of the ether, physics accep ted the fact that electromagnetic waves can travel through empty spac e without any medium at all. How absurd, if there is no medium, then what i s waving? How is light to propagate as a wave phenomenon if there is nothing to propagate in? Physics accepted that light could travel through absolute n othingness only because the Michaelson-Morly experiment failed. An astonishing premise of the revived ether physics is that there is no dualism, no distinction between a material and immaterial th ing; it’s all energy since energy is all there is! Matter is not a fundamental property of the universe; it is the form not the substance that shapes matter. Now we finally can take Einstein’s famous formula E=m * c², one step further and reall y start to understand what this formula implied! It is not that energy and matter can be interchange d; no, matter = energy, period! In this sense matter is an illusion of solidness an d separateness. Eastern spiritual traditions have always claimed that our world is Ma ya, illusionary. What they meant by this is that separateness does not exist; there is only the unity at the fundamental level of existence, the unity of Brahma n. Now we may see Eastern wisdom corroborated by modern day science! This is how ether physics is best described: Our universe is multi dimensional and it is made of one substance and one substance only! This substance is called ether and it is a vibrating fluid-like energy that permeates the physical vacuum. Matter a s we know it is created moment by moment as a standing wave, a vortex in th e physical vacuum. It is the condensed center of these vortexes that creates the illusion of a separate particle. All matter in the universe is interconnec ted since the particle fields extend to the far corners of the universe. Wave Structure of Matter A precursor of ether physic is the Wave Structure o f Matter theory by Milo Wolff. In 1986 Wolff formulated a theory that he called ‘th e Standing Wave Structure of Matter’ (abbreviated to WSM theory). Independently G eoff Haselhurst came to the same conclusion about a standing wave theory fo r matter and they are working together as of 1998. The WSM theory is relatively simple. It proposes th at matter is the focal point of a standing wave the result of two interfering waves. One is an inward wave moving towards the center and the other is an outward-boun d wave moving away from the center. The waves are spherical waves in the fa bric of space. The wave center of the two spherical waves is the ‘point particle’ center. As simple as the axiom of this theory is, the properties these standing waves can assume seem to be immense. Whereas almost all physical laws both in Newtonian a nd quantum physics were empirically derived by experiments, Milo Wolf says he now has theory that a priori, from theoretical principles, allows the law s of both relativity and quantum physics to be derived! "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 68 If he is right the origin of the physical laws and the properties of charge, mass and gravity, for the first time can be understood. Mainstream physics could never really explain these; for one thing we still don’t know what gravity really is: we have known the physical laws of gravity since Newto n, however we don’t know what is causing it! String theory is trying to accomplish exactly what the WSM theory has done, to integrate quantum physics and Einstein’s relativity . String theory is mainstream physics best shot and hope for a theory of everythi ng (T.O.E.) A wave structure of matter had already been propose d 130 years ago by William Clifford, he declared that ‘all matter is simply un dulations in the fabric of space’. Unfortunately, his colleagues never took his work se riously. In the WSM theory matter is just the interference p attern of in and out waves. The in-waves of a given particle are the out waves of another particle. In this way all matter in the universe is sustained and mutuall y dependent. In and out waves tie all the matter in the universe together. ( \u0001 ) Sub-quantum kinetics Paul la Violette has developed a general system eth er theory called subquantum kinetics. He believes that science is wrong about m any aspects in physics including the Big Bang theory that tells us how the universe came into existence after one big cosmic explosion. According to the Bi g Bang theory, the universe inflated from what is called a singularity, an infi nitely compressed point in space, into a volume of several hundred million light-year s in diameter in just 10 \u000e³² seconds! This event required that all known laws in physics, including the laws of Thermodynamics, Einstein’s relativity laws (nothing can exceed the speed of light) were disabled for the happy occasion, the bi rth of all matter and energy from complete nothingness. After this briefest of m oment of time, the holy laws of science were re-enacted and ever since the unive rse does not allow energy and matter to be created from the same nothingness any longer (first law of Thermodynamics). At its birth, the universe showed its highest degree of organisation and physics dictates that this order e ventually will decay into complete chaos again (second law of Thermodynamics) . Scientists call this the increase of entropy. Paul La Violette does not cont radict these laws, on the contrary, he simply doesn’t believe that these laws were disabled for just this split second during the Big Bang. In his book ‘Gene sis of the Cosmos’ he mentions many more problems with the Big Bang theor y such as the explanation for the observed red-shifts of stars that cosmologi sts use as proof that our universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang . The red-shift of the stars is believed to be caused by the Doppler effect as star s move away from our point of reference. Cosmologists never took the alternative tired light explanation for these red-shifts seriously- that is, the fact that light travelling over billions of light years may be absorbed by intergalactic material res ulting in a loss of energy and an increase of wavelength. La Violette believes that the cosmology of the anci ents is a better alternative that does not suffer from the Big Bang’s singularity pro blems. According to many ancient cosmologies, the universe evolved over bill ions of years as a result of a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 69 continuous process of matter and energy creation fr om a supposedly fourth dimensional realm, the ether. This creation process has never ceased and still continues today according to La Violette. To sustai n his claims, he explains that the universe at heart is not a closed but an open s ystem and is able to receive energy and matter from a fourth dimension without c ontradicting the laws of Thermodynamics. The ether is supposedly an unobservable metaphysica l realm, a non-equilibrium transmutable medium that continuously fluctuates. W hen fluctuations reach a critical threshold they are able to spawn stable wa veforms in our observable physical universe. It was only in 1973 that system theorist learned about chemical solutions that were able to create self-or ganising chemical wave patterns in solutions that spontaneously started to oscillate. These chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction periodically spawned so- called chemical or reaction-diffusion waves. The cr oss chemical reactions involved oscillate between low and high concentrations of th e chemical compounds that drive the reaction. Let’s assume that the first rea ction chain uses compound X to create compound Y, then the second reaction will be exactly the inverse of the first and use compound Y to create compound X again . There is a constant diffusion of the compounds from areas of high to low concentrations, hence the reaction-diffusion wave. These chemical waves will spawn beautiful Mandela like wave patterns when put on a Petri dish. To understand how the chemical reaction actually start s to oscillate let’s use the metaphor of the predator-prey system. Suppose we ha ve a population of rabbits that has an abundant supply of lettuce. Since rabbi ts breed like hell, their population will grow fast. However in our little cl osed habitat there are also foxes that feed on the rabbits, limiting the growth of th e rabbit population. Since the rabbit population grows fast, so does the fox popul ation. However, since there is a feedback loop in our system, balance will be rest ored in our habitat; when the foxes eat too many rabbits, they will run into a fo od shortage, reducing the growth of the fox population and allowing the rabbi ts to survive. The fox-rabbit population will oscillate between two extremes, a m inimum and maximum, a perfect example of a wave oscillation. From these observations, Paul la Violette reasoned that the ether may likewise spawn wave patterns from two ether states, two diff erent etherons, that continuously mutate from one state into the other a nd visa versa. In normal cases, the ether maintains its equilibrium state du e to the second law of Thermodynamics, however under critical conditions t hese ether transmutations like the predator-prey waves may become self-organi sing and form stable wave patterns. These wave patterns will become observabl e in our physical universe as electromagnetic energy, light. His theory has been tested in a simulator model cal led the Brusselator and uses two X and Y etheron states to prove that under crit ical conditions, self-organising oscillations may spontaneously come into existence. The actual ether reaction used just a few more intermediate ether states but for the sake of simplicity etherons X and Y are the only ones mentioned here. The transmutation ether model of Paul La Violette b rings to mind the transmutation of the Chinese Yin and Yang energies mentioned in the I Ching, the Book of Changes. The I Ching mentions physical crea tion as the result of cyclic mutual transmutations of Yin and Yang energies. The female Yin energy transforms into the male Yang energy and vice versa in an eternal process of physical manifestation. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 70 Paul La Violette’s sub-quantum kinetics perfectly d escribes how the ether realm spawns waves that we observe as light in our univer se. Since this light forms a standing wave that is eternally replenished by the etheron transmutations, this is what we finally observe as quantum particles of mat ter. Sub quantum kinetics yields a better alternative fo r the required in and out waves of Milo Wolff’s Wave Structure of Matter theory. As we progress in our understanding of how matter is actually shaped from the ether, we will see in the next sections that the vibrations created from the ether must be organised in vortex shapes in order to shape the atom. ( \u0002 ) Vortexes in the ether David Thomson and Jim Bourassa both founded the Quan tum EtherDynamics Institute and are independently developing an ether based model integrating, quantum mechanics, relativity theory and string the ory. The model describes matter as a sub atomic whirlpool or tornado, a vort ex in the ether. They call this vortex the Toroidal (A)ether Unit (TAU). When combi ned in spherical configurations they form the nucleus and electron s hells of the atom. Quantum EtherDynamics mentions that the ether has both mecha nical and electromagnetic properties. The mechanical property is what gives m atter its mass; it’s the angular momentum of the whirling ether energy. Mass is simply the inertia created by the ether vortexes much like the inertia that is created by a spinning top. The eternal spin of the ether vortexes that is to b e maintained for the stability of all matter in the universe is called the mysterious Gforce or God Force. EtherDynamics defines it as an enormous force with n o known cause. I quote from their website: ‘The Gforce is a tremendous force that is beyond co mparison to any other force in the universe. It may not be what physicists are hop ing to find (and I believe this is why this model hasn't been proposed before), but the Gforce appears to be a primary force that gave rise to the entire universe . If one were to liken it to the Force in Star Wars, they wouldn't be far off. If on e were to characterize this Gforce as God, or Supreme Being, or Great Architect of the Universe, they wouldn't be far off, either. Whatever this prime fo rce is, it appears to be a living thing and the source of all things animate and inan imate.’ ( \u0004 ) Cymatics Sacred geometry plays an important role in the ethe r physics that we are presenting in this book. The reason is rather strai ghtforward. When the universe is shaped from one substance and one substance only , then the only way to give the physical world a seeming separate appearance of individual material things is through form, since substance by itself cannot disc riminate. Hence the geometry of the ether and how it is structured is the crux i n creating the material world. "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 71 The relation between vibration and geometry is beau tifully described by the work of Swiss medical doctor and natural scientist Hans Jenny (1904-1972) in a science called ’Cymatics’.    Dr. Hans Jenny’s ‘Cym atics’ research, vibration of a fluid  with colloid showing a star-tetrahedron The late Buckminster Fuller (1895 - 1983) however w as the first to discover that a relation between musical frequencies (The Diatoni c scale) of vibration and geometrical forms exists. He used a balloon submerg ed in blue dye and vibrated it with audio frequencies from the musical scale (the 7 white keys from the piano): as a result of wave interference, marvelous two dimensional arrangements appeared on its surface. Dr. Hans Jenny carried on the work of Buckminster Fu ller and tested these standing wave vibrations in spherical volumes of fl uid. Much to his surprise all of the Platonic solids , named after the legendary philosopher Plato, show ed up as geometrical patterns. What you see in the picture a bove is a star-tetrahedron, it is also on the cover of this book! If you examine t he picture carefully you may have noticed the two equilateral triangles, one fac ing up and one facing down. Together they form a symbol that is known as the Je wish Star of David, but remember in 3D reality the two triangles are tetrahe drons, three sided pyramids. Star of David The white curved and straight lines in the photogra ph are the places where the vibration is cancelled, these are the nodal points, the still places to which the colloid particles dissolved in the fluid take refug e when the fluid is vibrated. The geometrical patterns are the result of wave interfe rence. When the outgoing waves from the center of the sphere meet the reflec ted waves from the surface of the sphere, standing waves are formed."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 72 Plato explained in his book Timaeus that the Platon ic solids are the basic forms that construct matter and that this knowledge came from the legendary Atlantis. We now have proof that humanity knew about the Plato nic solids even before Plato. In the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford they prese rve all of the 5 Platonic solids and some additional semi-regular solids that were described by Pythagoras. Carved out of stone the Platonic solids are dated a t least a thousand years before Plato! These stones were found in Britain and belon ged to the Neolithic peoples, a culture that according to our current understanding did not have the mathematical ability to understand these forms - no netheless they carved them out of stone! Now isn’t this surprising that a vibrated fluid can create forms such as these and that these forms have been described by Plato some 400 years BC? The secret of ‘Sacred geometry’ is not about geomet ry per se, it’s about vibrations that take on geometrical patterns! Sacred geometry was preserved throughout history in Freemasonry circles since it was believed to be important knowledge revealing the secrets of our universe! Contemporary scientists now tell us that in fact al l of creation is the offspring of ether vibrations just like the Eastern Hindu cosmol ogy has always talked about the Ohm sound of Brahman as the vibration that crea tes the physical world. The experiments of Cymatics are now interpreted by Daniel Winter and David Wilcock to show us how the Platonic Solid interferen ce patterns also occur within the ether and that it is these interference pattern s that really shape the atom. The Egyptians called matter frozen music and if ind eed matter is the result of musical vibrations of the ether just like the cymat ics experiments demonstrate, we can now appreciate why. Implosion Physics Daniel Winter presents a physics model called ‘Implo sion Physics’. He concludes that the entire universe, the material world is cre ated from one non-material substance, the ether. The ether is a kind of super conductive fluid that flows right through all physical objects. The ether vacuum is a n extremely dense nonetheless frictionless medium. The best comparison for the et her being non-material in nature is the super-conductive state of helium. When helium is cooled down to temperatures below 2 degrees Kelvin it becomes a su per-fluid, which means that objects can move through this fluid with no frictio n at all. Daniel Winter now believes that vortexes, little edd ies or tornados in the fluid-like ether are the basic building blocks of matter. Sinc e the ether is some kind of a fluid, it follows the well-known physical laws of h ydrodynamics. Interestingly, in 1895 two clairvoyants by the name Charles Leadbeater and Annie Besant published an article in a magazine tit led ‘Occult Chemistry’ wherein they explained the internal structure of Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen. Using clairvoyance as the only instruments in their scrut iny, they revealed the internal structure of the above-mentioned elements. The clai rvoyants had no scientific background whatsoever, however they pictured the fo llowing torus shapes as the basic building blocks of the atom:"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 73    The Anu They called these torus-like flow forms the ‘Anu’ a nd mentioned that the atom is shaped from the ether using the Anu as a flow form. ( \u0005 ) Daniel Winter supports the idea of these two clairvo yants and uses the torus shape from these observations along with the Platon ic Solids to construct the atom. According to Daniel Winter the ether creates vortexe s, little tornados of whirling and spiralling energy in the ocean of ether, our un iverse. The vortexes in the ether are like the little eddies in a river. The vo rtex is nature’s natural flow form for fluids. The same vortex flow form is created ev ery time we pull the plug in our bathtub! When two of these ether vortexes join their funnels they form a torus:     Single ether vortex    Double vortex = Torus "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 74 Now the torus is a unique flow form in hydrodynamic s, it allows fluids to spiral inwards and outwards on the same surface of the tor us. It is a very stable flow form. If the universe is essentially created from one uni versal substance, the ether, it must be form that is used to create different and s eparate things out of this universal energy. The torus is nature’s perfect flo w form to create a seemingly separate entity in the formless ether that is stabl e enough to last. The torus flow form is similar to the rings created by the smoke of a cigar. The cigar smoke whirls inwards on top of the smoke ring and comes out again on the bottom of the ring. It is constantly folding inward s to come around on the other side flowing outwards. The torus is often compared with the shape of a doughnut or an apple. It’s a spherical form folded inwards a t the poles to form a small hole in the middle. The individual ether torus doughnuts can be nested inside each other. Nesting torus doughnuts requires that the vortex cones of t he torus are aligned with the faces of the Platonic solids. The flat bottom of a vortex cone should touch the f ace of a Platonic solid. As an example we show the cube that contains 3 vort ex pairs or 3 torus doughnuts aligned perpendicular to each other in a cube and 5 nested torus doughnuts in a dodecahedron.   Cube (3 doughnuts) Dodecahedron (5 doughnuts) Now we may remember from the cube of Metatron that the Platonic solids themselves can be nested, they fit into each other. Let’s take the cube, when lines are drawn to interconnect all centres on the 6 faces of the cube, they form the octahedron. The octahedron is fully circumscrib ed by the initial cube. The same process can be repeated now with the octahedro n by interconnecting the centres of the faces of the octahedron. The result is a cube now circumscribed by the octahedron. This process can go on and on forev er, creating smaller and smaller Platonic solids perfectly nested into each other, it creates a fractal, a repetitive geometric pattern. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 75 Nested Platonic Solids The nesting of the Platonic solids is not restricte d to the cube and octahedron. All Platonic solids can be nested into each other. It i s the nesting of the Platonic solids that creates the electron shells of the atom . Similarly however at a much smaller scale the nucleus of the atom is formed. The electrons in the electron shells correspond wit h the vortexes that are nested in Platonic symmetries. According to Daniel Winter, physics has mistaken these vortex waveforms for electron particles. Within the atom, the electrons orbit the nucleus at a fixed distance from the nucleus. The s phere that describes the orbital plane of the electron is called the electron shell. There are different types of shells in the make up of the atom that were given t he names s,p,d and f shells and they contain respectively 2, 6, 10 and 14 elect rons maximum. Each vortex pair in the doughnut corresponds with 2 electrons and when the doughnuts are organized inside the Platonic Solids we get the equivalent of an electron shell. Here’s the correspondence: 1 vortex pair (1 torus) corresponds with the 2 elec trons of the s shell. 3 nested vortex pairs in a cube correspond with the 6 electrons of the p shell. 5 nested vortex pairs in a dodecahedron correspond with the 10 electrons of the d shell 7 nested vortex pairs in an icosahedron correspond with the 14 electrons of the f shell. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 76  Table of the elements So matter is the stable flow form pattern emerging from the ether. It takes on geometrical shapes from a formless energy, creating the illusion of separate electron particles in the electron shells and the p articles that make up the nucleus. Mainstream physics has never been able to explain w hy the atom has these ‘random’ numbers of 2, 6, 10 and 14 electrons in it s electron clouds, the orbital shells around the nucleus. Daniel Winter’s model of the atom now explains exactly why these number show up in the period tabl e of the elements! These numbers are related to the geometrical properties o f the Platonic Solids! Also for the very first time we have an explanation as to wh y the electron does not crash into the nucleus and how it’s radiated energy is re plenished. Electrons are not particles that encircle the nucleus in stead they a re standing wave patterns at discrete distances from the nucleus! The ether simp ly replenishes these standing waves eternally. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 77 Another way of looking at the torus shape is regard ing it as a form that can be perfectly described by a set of Phi spirals.  Phi spirals in nested doughnuts Phi spiral on the doughnut’s surface Each Phi spiral is actually a series of pure sine w aves. It is a well-known principle in physics that any complex wave shape can be creat ed from the sum of simpler pure sine waves with different frequencies and ampl itudes. This principle is called the Fourier principle. The Phi spiral is constructe d from a series of harmonics with wavelengths that comply with the Golden Mean versio n of the Fibonacci sequence: 1/ Ф 1 Ф Ф ² Ф ³ 0.61803 1.00000 1.61803 2.61803 4.2 3606 Ф= 1.618033988749894848204586834365638117720309180 When pure sine waves with wavelengths of 1/ Ф, 1, Ф, Ф ², Ф ³ etc. are added together, they will form a perfect Phi spiral. When these Phi spirals circle around the torus they meet and interfere. As a result of this interference two new additional wave s will be created. What is"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 78 important to notice is that both new waves will hav e wavelengths that are again in the Fibonacci series. This allows that the inter ference will be non-destructively since the interference will simply result into more harmonics in the Fibonacci series. Whilst destructive interference is the norm in wave interference, the only exception in nature is when the waves interfere wit h Golden Mean ratio wavelengths! In other words, the Phi spiral can re- enter itself around the torus shape without destroying itself. So the Phi spiral is the universe’s only possible way to nest and become self-organizing. This is how stable matter can be formed from electromagnetic energy as a form of pure wave interference. Electromagnetic energy in a straight line is what w e usually call light. When this same light chases its own tail around the surface o f the torus shape we call it matter. In other words the atom is pure electromagn etic energy in a coil, that we no longer perceive as light but as matter, or to pu t it in Daniel Winter’s own words; ‘ So now we have this dualism that waves in a line ar e energy and waves in a circle are mass, and because we don’t know how the wave got into a circle from the line and out, we conceive mass as separate from energy. E=MC^2 simply said that yes loop the speed of light back a round on itself, and you made mass of energy ’. The Golden Mean spirals of the torus shape eventual ly spiral into a perfect zero still point in the nucleus of the vortex that coinc ides with the nucleus of the atom. So these sine waves implode inwards into increasing smaller wavelengths. The implosion of the Golden sine waves into smaller and smaller wavelengths not only increases the frequency of the waves but also incre ases the speed of the waves to become super-luminal waves (travelling faster th an light). According to Daniel Winter, this is what gravity really is, the cascade of Golden Mean electromagnetic sine waves that gain an ever-increasing velocity br eaking the speed barrier of light. Einstein had always assumed that electromagn etism and gravity were related and Daniel Winter explains us how this conne ction is established.  "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 79 When doughnuts are nested to form the electron shell s of the atom, the only requirement to continue this form of non-destructiv e interference is that these doughnuts align according to the Platonic Solid geo metries. When these nested doughnuts inside the atom are arra nged according to the Platonic solids symmetries, all waves will rush int o the center of the atom, creating repetitive, recursive or fractal patterns that not only shape the electron shells but also the nucleus. Eventually the fractal patterns disappear into a zero point in the nucleus of the atom. The implosion of the electromagnetic waves into shorter and shorter wavelengths is what gravity rea lly is. In a way the torus is a miniature black hole that attracts the light into i tself creating gravity. The harmonious wave cycles that follow the Golden M ean ratio, the Phi cycles may be the origin of the word physical (Phi cycle) . Physics would be simply the study of Phi cycles! ( \u0006 ) Universal principle The repetitive patterns of the Platonic solids that fit into each other form fractals. A fractal is a repetitive pattern that can be scale d to any size. The scale may change but the ratio is held constant. Now the fractal patterns that shape the atom, accor ding to Daniel Winter also shape our planets and stars, in fact the universe. A fractal has self-similarity at all scales, it’s t he same geometric pattern repeated. The inner structure in a fractal is reflected in th e outer structure. Fractal means fraction of the all, indicating that each piece is part of the whole. It is the basic idea of a hologram and this is why according to Dani el Winter the universe at large is just a super-hologram. The fractals of ele ctromagnetic energy interconnect everything with everything and are the basic building blocks of this hologram. The fractal repetitive structures of elec tromagnetic energy weave a giant cobweb throughout the universe. The wavelengths of planets and stars are huge in co mparison with the wavelengths of the atom, however when their wavelen gths fit into the Fibonacci sequence of the Golden Mean, they interfere non-des tructively, they implode and form a fractal attractor that we call gravity! This is how the planets and stars are connected by means of imploding electromagnetic wav es that we experience as gravity. So if the universe is in essence a hologram and the re is only one principle that shapes everything from atoms to planets stars and t he universe at large, we should find proof of these Platonic Solid and dough nut structures in all parts of the universe. This holographic principle of the universe was firs t mentioned by the ancient Greek Hermes Trismegistus and written down in his e merald tablets as one of the seven Hermetic principles ‘As above, so below, as b elow, so above’. What Hermes meant was that there is a correspondence between th e different planes of existence, the macro-cosmos and the micro-cosmos. T his Hermetic principle tells us that what we see out there in the universe, in t he galaxies, stars and planets, we should also find on a smaller scale inside the a toms. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 80 So is there any proof that may corroborate the vali dity of this Hermetic principle in our universe? Surprisingly enough, NASA in the summer of 2004 rel eased new information about discoveries that were made with the European Space Agency observatories the INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton. They discovered that s o-called black holes in our universe are actually doughnut shaped torus for mations! Black holes are objects that exist in our universe with an unfathom able mass. They have the density of millions to billions times the mass of o ur Sun and the gravitational force of black holes is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. Everything in the environment of a black hole is at tracted to the core of the black hole. NASA’s doughnut shape of the black hole The similarity between the macroscopic doughnut tor us shape of the black hole and the microscopic doughnut torus shape of the ato m is apparent. The black hole’s basic characteristic is that its gravitation is so immense that even light cannot escape it. According to Daniel Winter the vort ex structure of the doughnut torus structure is actually an implosion of Golden Mean waves that is no less than the equivalent of gravity. It is light that is attr acted into the core, just like what happens inside the Black Hole. ( \u0007 ) Astrophysics is still trying to find out the right cosmological model for our universe. The current accepted idea has been around since the seventies and is the idea that the universe has been created in one giant blast called the Big Bang. Ever since the universe has been expanding, t he cosmological model of an expanding universe is called the inflationary model . One of the founders of the inflationary model Dr. Robert P. Kirshner of Harvard University now believes that a cyclic model can better explain the latest discov eries made about our universe. In the cyclic model the universe is re-birthed in a n eternal cycle of both expansion and contraction. Recent discoveries have shown that the universe not only expands, but also that this expansion is accel erating. The only source that could explain this acceleration is an invisible ene rgy that permeates the entire universe! Astrophysics has termed this mysterious e nergy dark energy! Remarkably a cyclic model is the cosmological model that corresponds with the ancient Eastern cosmology. According to the spiritu al Eastern scripture of the Upanishads the universe is recreated eternally from the breath of Brahman by breathing in and out the Prana of the universe. ( \b ) "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 81 There are now a number of astrophysics theorists wh o have launched the idea that the universe at large has the shape of a giant doughnut torus. One of these theorists is Professor Joseph Silk of the Departmen t of Physics, Oxford University. The most common used method by scientists to model the shape of the universe is to measure and determine the geometry of the cos mic microwave background radiation of the universe, the primordial residual energy of the Big Bang that created the universe and it is from these measureme nts that these new ideas of the universe stem. ( \t ) If we assume that the universe is indeed in a perpe tual cycle of birth and death then the doughnut torus shape can perfectly explain and model this behavior. Just suppose that all planets, stars and galaxies m ove through space in this huge doughnut shaped universe. The center of the doughnu t represents the moment of the Big Bang. The center like the center of the bla ck hole is a singularity where all space and time are infinitely compressed. Think of this zero point as the eternal now. Now when we leave the zero point of the doughn ut and move outwards through the funnel over the surface of the doughnut , space emerges and starts to expand, time starts ticking. We’ve left the ‘white h ole’ of the universe where planets, stars and galaxies are birthed. While trav ersing over the surface of the torus, space keeps expanding until we cross the equ ator, the middle plane of the symmetrical torus. Next space starts to shrink agai n and all space is attracted to the ‘black hole’ opposite pole of the doughnut wher e everything will collapse again to the zero still point within the doughnut. We’ve completed one complete cycle of birth and death! The eternal cycle of the universe would be such that everything is being birthed from a singularity, (Th e Big Bang), the white hole of the universe. After the universe’s birth we move fo r billions of years through space to end up where we started to be attracted ag ain into a huge black hole. From there on the next cycle is started.

Platonic Solids also show up in the Earth’s energy fields as will be demonstrated in the next chapter. The ‘aura’ of the Earth is a d odeca-icosohedron grid (nested dodecahedron and icosahedron) that is referred to a s the Earth grid for short. Richard Hoagland together with David Wilcock have po inted out that there are planets in our Solar System that show geological st ress points at exactly 19.47 degrees latitude. Examples are the Great Red Spot o n Jupiter, the Great Dark spot of Neptune, the Sun’s area of the largest suns pots. The 19.47 degrees latitude stress points can be explained if we consi der the interlaced tetrahedron energy structures to be present in the sphere of th ese cosmic bodies.  Interlaced or star tetrahedron in the planets ( \u0001\u000b ) The correspondence principle of the Hermetic princi ple ‘as above, so below’ is valid also for the Platonic solids in the aura, the energy field of the human body. Science in the nineties has actually corroborated t he existence of the bio energy fields of the human body that were already known to the Chinese for thousands of years, know as the Chinese meridian system and t he seven chakras in the body. The eastern Chakra systems of the body have b een identified as nodes in the human body where vortexes of subtle energy from higher dimensions interfere with the physical body. Many ancient traditions mention that the etheric en ergy counterpart body of the physical body as the vehicle of the human soul. Sup posedly the energy structure of the human aura contains the wave interference pa tterns of the Platonic Solids especially the star-tetrahedron (Star of David).

(Mer=rotating light, Ka=spirit, Ba=human body). It was believed that the spinning light of the Merkaba could take a person from one dimension into another. It was the light through which the soul descended into the human bod y and that can also be used to ascend to higher planes. The Merkaba energy field of the human body is an in terlaced tetrahedra (double interpenetrating tetrahedra, one pointing upwards a nd one downwards, see the cover of this book). The Merkaba is mentioned in ma ny religions such as in the Jewish Kabbalah, which describes it as a counter ro tating energy field that affects both spirit and body. In the Bible Ezekiel called the Merkaba the vehicle of light. This vehicle of light allowed the soul to travel between parallel dimensi ons. Kings 2:2 tells the story of prophet Elijah and Elisha who crossed the Jordan ri ver at Beth-El when all of a sudden a Merkaba of fire appears and Elijah disappe ars in the whirlwind. Elijah had vanished from the face of this Earth and ascend ed from the physical plane. The Merkaba is also preserved in Islam in the ancie nt Islamic mysticism of Sufism.

The human heart has an electromagnetic field in the form of a doughnut toroidial field (perfect torus) triggering the 7-layered muscles in the heart to beat. This toroidial energy field i s the animator of the heart according to Daniel Winter. Another example is the geometry of DNA. DNA has the geometry of ten interpenetrating dodecahedra spiralling along the h elix. It requires ten Phi spirals to create the top view of DNA. The basic geometry o f DNA is that of a dodecahedron. Since Daniel Winter assumes that the u niverse is one huge super hologram and that everything in the universe is con nected with everything else by means of Golden waves, he believes that DNA is e lectro-magnetically coupled with the Earth grid and the Zodiac by means of the fractal dodecahedron shapes of energy. DNA, Earthgrid and Zodiac coupling "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 85 Ether and the zero point field But how does the ether relate to the zero point fie ld that quantum scientists have discovered? Are they one and the same thing? The on ly difference I believe is how these fields are being described. Both fields describe energy that is everywhere in t he universe. Quantum physics however describes the zero point field as the colle ctive energy that is released (virtual photons) by all of the sub atomic particle s in the universe when they fall back from their excited state to their ground state s of energy (called the Lamb shift after Willis Lamb). The sum of all this energy is what creates the zero point field. On the other hand the sub atomic particles b orrow energy (virtual photons) from the zero point field pushing them into a highe r energy state. The give and take of virtual photons of energy is what shapes th e zero point field. In this way empty space, the vacuum is actually a plenum of ele ctromagnetic energy (virtual photons) spanning all frequencies in the electromag netic frequency domain. In contrast with quantum physics the ether theories state that there are no particles only waves. The zero point in the ether t heory of Daniel Winter is the perfect stillness, the alpha and the omega of creat ion. The zero point is perfect stillness and infinite movement at the same time. I t’s the same thing. How can this be? The cascade of Golden waves creates an inf inite series of higher harmonics and when all the waves are added up using the Fourier principle it creates a flat wave of zero Hertz, perfect stillnes s! Now think of a glass of water, if you start to vibr ate it slowly, you will quite clearly see wave fronts in the glass. When we incre ase the frequency, it will be harder to notice the water surface is vibrating. If we add in all possible vibrations with frequencies ranging from extremely low to inde finitely high, the sum result of all these vibrations will turn the water into a smooth surface again. The water has become calm again. This calmness however is ill usionary since the water is both at rest and shaking like hell all at the same time! That is what the zero point field in essence is; it ’s complete stillness (zero Hertz) and filled with an infinite cascade of Golden harmo nics all at the same time. The waves that create matter and that by means of f ractals move into the nucleus in an increasing cascade of Golden waves, s peed up and exceed the light speed. But where do they go? They center into the z ero point, back from where they came. In this sense, the zero point is the alp ha and omega of creation! The zero point is perfect stillness and unimaginabl e abundant activity at the same time! They are two sides of the same coin, it’s lik e a snake biting it’s own tail.  Conscious energy Scientist like David Wilcock, Daniel Winter take the notion even further, they say the ether energy has properties of consciousness, t hey conclude that there is no dualism in the physical and the mental realm. The ether energy is pure consciousness energy and s ince it shapes our entire universe, the universe itself must be a living inte lligent being."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 86 So if this fact can be proven ether physics seems t o be a scientific corroboration of the tenets held by many Eastern spiritual tradit ions that the source of our universe is a life force energy, a spiritual energy called many names like Prana, Ki, Chi, Akasha to name a few. In this chapter we’ll present some ‘proof’ of this startling conclusion, although scientist take different notions to come to this co nclusion. For instance David Wilcock refers to Russian studies that have revealed the very existence of torsion waves that travel as spiralling impulses through th e ether medium at a billion times the speed of light. They are caused by many t ypes of events such as the movement of physical objects but also surprisingly enough by human conscious thought! Russian discoveries revealed that our thou ghts and feelings extend far beyond the body and travel through the universe! Quantum physicist David Bohm also believes that the universe is holographic in nature and that there is an undivided wholeness of all things, it is useless to think in terms of separate particles since they are like little whirlpools in the river, you can’t tell where the whirlpool starts and the river ends. Bohm goes on to say that life and consciousness are not only present in anim ate life forms but also in inanimate matter such as rocks since, energy, space , time and consciousness are not separate things according to Bohm. Amit Goswami says that consciousness must be the gr ound of all being to solve the ambiguity of the Copenhagen interpretation of q uantum science. So it must be consciousness that is primordial and shapes the physical. Amit Goswami is the author of the book ‘The self-aware universe’. Daniel Winter explains consciousness as follows; whe rever the ether waves fold back upon themselves to become fractal or recursive , they turn around to meet themselves creating not only gravity but also self- reference or self-awareness in the process. Self-reference is the principle of bei ng self-aware and is the definition of consciousness according to the ancien t Vedas. The Golden waves in the fractal geometrical pattern s are attracted to the zero point, the focal point of the atom. The zero point acts as a fractal attractor drawing into it all the electromagnetic waves that can be shared to ride the roller coaster of the cascading Golden waves. In a sense i t’s a miniature black hole attracting the light into itself meanwhile creating not only gravity but also self- awareness. But if recursive electro-magnetic waves forming fra ctals is the true nature of consciousness, it means that consciousness is not r estricted to life forms only but also inanimate objects must have a kind of consciou sness. All material things in the universe must be self-aware! Indigenous tribes like the native Indians of Americ a and the Australian aboriginals for instance have always claimed that everything fr om the raindrops to rivers, from rocks to mountains are alive. Conscious life i s not restricted to animate life forms that dwell upon the land; the Indians believe d that every material thing had a soul, including the land. To these people all of creation was alive and part of the whole; they worshipped the mountains and the rivers, the moon and the Sun just as much as the animals and plants. Our wes tern culture regards the ancient religions as primitive since they worshiped the stars and planets as the Gods of the Heavens. Maybe they didn’t have such a primitive and poor concept of reality after all? Maybe it is us who have some catching up to do? "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 87 It is now dawning in science that the universe may be self-aware. This implies that all atoms, planets, stars, etc, are self-aware and have some form of individuality. We can no longer speak of consciousn ess that is restricted to organic life forms alone; consciousness can reside in many forms including stars and planets. The universe itself may be one conscio us being that we humans are a whole part of. This makes every single focal point of waves an ind ividual consciousness that is part of the universal consciousness. Human individu al consciousness focusing in the human body is simply a piece of the whole pie o f consciousness. The brain is merely the antenna tuned to receive the individual consciousness from the universal consciousness just like the quantum brain theory suggests. Each individual mind however must also have access to th e universal mind. It would explain how the universal consciousness wa s accessed by so many geniuses like the greatest philosophers, scientist, artists and musicians that have inspired us throughout the Ages. If we grasp and ac cept this, then within this holographic concept of consciousness our separate e gos must be illusions. A growing number of physicists today believe that t he universe indeed is self- aware. Why is it that almost all of the world religi ons associate God’s consciousness with light? The Bible tells us that G od is the Light of the world! Daniel Winter’s Implosion Physics now tells us that it is conscious light that creates the material world! Could this universal co nsciousness that many like to refer to as God be the zero point in the ether, the still point, the fractal attractor in chaos theory that draws all the light of the wor ld into itself where all is One? The zero point could be regarded as the source and destination, the alpha and the omega of creation. Daniel Winter tells us that it is this universal consciousness that focuses the waves into the zero point and keep s it spinning, it can be compared with the Gforce mentioned in EtherDynamics ! But wasn’t God also associated with unconditional l ove? If God is really to be associated with conscious light then where is the l ove in all of these Golden waves? Phi and Love Manfred Clynes, a former concert pianist studied th e relation between music and emotion. During his many performances he learned th at certain parts of his playing moved people more than others. He wanted to find out what it was in music, what pitches and notes touched people more t han others. He started a scientific career to find out. He studied the wave shapes that were related to hum an emotions. The tender hugs and caressing between people seemed to follow predictable envelopes of pressure that were universal. His studies showed th at they were not related to cultural, religious or racial backgrounds. All over the world people seem to follow the same recipe for creating emotions in waves. Expressions of anger and hate where people push and jerk the other also follow predictable wave paths of pressure. Amazingly the e motion associated with love is Golden Mean related! If we’re hugging our loved one and we express the feeling of love, the maximum pressure in the hug is at exactly the Golden Mean ratio with respect to the total duration of the hug ! "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 88 Relation between emotions and wave envelops . Daniel Winter concluded from Manfred Clynes material that love must be Golden Mean related! So it seems there is only one way the universal con sciousness of the universe can create. It requires the loving non-destructive inte rference bending of light into fractal structures of geometries that allows the wa ves to stand and interfere eternally. The higher harmonics in the Golden Fibon naci sequence are all based on the longest Phi wave, the carrier wave. The casc ade of electromagnetic waves all braid on this Golden wave with the longest wave length, the long Phi wave or lo-Phi wave, the love-wave! Is lo-Phi the origin of the word love? So it seems only love creates and we can now apprec iate that the loving waves that interfere with each other is what creates the material world. If the interfering waves did not maintain the Golden Mean ratio in wav elength, destructive interference would be the result and the material w orld could simply not exist. Isn’t it true that love can move mountains and that hate and anger destroys everything? We can see the same principle expressed in waves that lovingly construct the material world! When the waves hate ea ch other, they compete and kill each other! Light in a straight line is energy, loving light be nded around a focal point creates matter and it’s the universal consciousness that ke eps the waves centered! If the universal mind of the universe, God is the light an d love of the world, like the Bible has always told us; we can now appreciate it from a scientific perspective! The loving heart Daniel Winter is a member of the Heart Coherence Tea m that has developed a Heart Tuner ®. The Heart Tuner is a heart/brain bio feedback system that is able to measure the coherence between the heartbeats (El ectrocardiogram ECG) and the brainwaves (Electroencephalogram EEG) of an ind ividual. It is used by"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 89 therapists and researchers but is also suited for i ndividuals to establish balance between the heart and mind. For the first time in history we’re able to really measure human emotions such as compassion, empathy, love, anger and frustration. T he Heart Tuner uses the electromagnetic waves of the heart and the brain an d is able to determine if there is harmony between them, in other words if there is coherence between heart and mind. What the Heart Tuner does is that it check s whether our feelings and thoughts are balanced. For ages we’ve believed that the heart is the home of our feelings and emotions, it is expressed in almost any popular love song, ho wever human emotions can now really be measured and they stem from the heart indeed. Emotions are reflected in the waves of the ECG. Also our thoughts leave a fingerprint in the electr omagnetic field of the brain, our brainwaves recorded in the EEG. The Heart Tuner pic ks up the signals of the heart and the brain and is able to detect phase loc ks between the waves of the ECG and the EEG. When a phase lock is detected, not only do the frequ encies in the heart signal match up with the frequencies of the brainwaves, al so their phase matches, the waves are harmoniously connected! In technical term s the signals are said to be coherent! What really is happening is that the perso n involved is balancing his feelings and his thoughts and he’s experiencing pea ceful, joyful feelings, bliss. The Heart Tuner has proven its therapeutic benefits : • It stimulates the immune system • Balances emotional and physical health • Is a feedback tool for stress release • Improves a person’s learning abilities • Can be used to eradicate addictions. • Is a good aid in conflict solving by measuring cohe rence between two persons (it’s a lie detector that never lies!) Now how does the Heart Tuner work and what is reall y happening in the frequency spectra of the heart and brain? First of all, the sonic sounds of the heart, the he art beats are translated into electromagnetic pulses by the thymus of the heart a nd the glands in our body that act as piezo-electrical devices translating so nic pressures into electromagnetism. This is how the heart creates an electromagnetic field that can be measured as an ECG. Daniel Winter discovered that people who are experie ncing true feelings of love leave a signature in the frequency spectrum of the heart, the ECG. What happens is that the frequency components in the spectrum become Golden Mean related (Phi)! Surprisingly also the brainwave s can become entrained, phase locked with the heartbeat waves! Brain and he art waves beat in the same pace and in the same phase connected by the Golden Mean (Phi). The result is our by now familiar cascade of Golden electromagnetic waves just like we’ve discussed before that is happening insid e the atom. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 90 According to Daniel Winter, the cascade of Golden el ectromagnetic waves ends up as blue light in the DNA of our body! The DNA is a k ind of a lens attracting the electromagnetic energy into itself. So how does the heart and brain waves that have lon g wavelengths connect and lock with the much shorter wavelengths of the DNA? I t’s the Golden Mean ratio that bridges the scale of the long wavelength of th e heart and brain waves to the short wavelength of DNA. When our thoughts and emoti ons are attuned to love, a cascade of Fibonacci series of harmonics is created that links the energy of the hearth and mind to our own DNA. So emotion is really energy, it is energy in motion , e-motion. Emotion is like a roller coaster conveying the emotional energy from the heart to every cell in our body into our very own DNA. The energy of our emotio ns moves between these scales of long waves to short waves and is finally delivered to our DNA. Fritz Pop had previously discovered the bio photons, the blue light in the body and assumed that it was somehow related to DNA, Daniel Winter explains us the wave coupling mechanism of how the energy of the mind an d heart is delivered to our very own DNA. When the heart expresses the emotion of love it crea tes a cascade of Golden Mean electromagnetic waves, in fact it creates grav ity just like the atom does when it attracts by Golden Mean braiding electromag netic waves into the zero still point. Why have we always associated love with grav ity? Why do we use words like I’m attracted to you, like the moon is to the Earth, when we’re in love with someone? Why has our emotion always been associated with weight? Why are we heavy in love? When Isaac Newton saw the apple fall from the tree, he just discovered gravity. He ran off to tell others and e xplained the principle of gravity to others by saying that the apple is attracted to the Earth. The people stared and laughed at him, the whole idea seemed preposterous, how could an apple be attracted to the Earth? Are they in love? Only peop le in love are attracted to each other. It took Newton a long time before people sta rted to get used to the idea of gravity as a force of attraction. In those days, Ne wton would have done better to take another word to explain the principle of gravi ty. However taking Daniel Winter’s theory of gravity literally, the word attra ction seems just fine, it now seems appropriate to say that the Earth and the moo n are in love and that it is gravitation that is drawing a man to a woman! Daniel Winter also used his Heart Tuner on a trained yogi who went into a deep state of meditation. Formerly he had instructed the yogi to focus on a tree and to send loving thoughts to the tree. He placed an ante nna near the tree and linked both the yogi and the antenna near the tree to his Heart Tuner. The antenna under the tree picked up the Earth’s el ectromagnetic Schumann waves. The Schumann waves named after German Profes sor W.O Schumann were discovered in 1952. The Schumann waves are a r esult of the Schumann resonance, a frequency resonation of about 8 Hertz that occurs between upper layers in the atmosphere and the Earth’s crust. It is called Gaia’s heartbeat. The Schumann resonance is somehow related to human consciousness since brainwaves operate in a frequency domain that inclu des the 8-Hertz Schumann frequency. Spacecraft of NASA are all equipped with a device that simulates the natural Schumann resonance frequency. From early sp ace travel NASA learned that astronauts get disoriented and distressed when they are shut off from the Schumann resonance. As a human being we depend on i t. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 91 Daniel Winter demonstrated that the trees in the woo ds act like huge antenna that pick up the Schumann frequencies and amplify i t. When hooked up to the Heart Tuner he noticed first of all that that the y ogi’s ECG and EGG were coherent as expected from earlier experiments. However he al so found that the yogi’s brainwaves and heartbeats had become coherent with the Schumann resonance of the Earth! What he demonstrated with his experiment is that whe n we feel love we tune into and become one with nature itself. Daniel Winter now believes that all biologic life depends on the Schumann resonance as the carrier wa ve, the long Phi wave to braid electromagnetic Golden waves. Humans can link up to biology and to mother Earth itself for that matter. The heartbeat of this planet is the Schumann resonance. It may be the explanation why a walk in the woods is so refreshing and why people like to spend time in nature. Being completely shut off from the Schumann resonance on high altitudes in a plane whe re the fuselage acts like a big Faraday cage, is now believed to contribute to the effects of jet leg. Daniel Winter warns us of the hazards of electromagn etic smog in our biosphere, it destructively interferes with biology itself and finally causes cancer. We’ve shielded ourselves from the natural Schumann resona nce and the Earth grid energies by hiding in concrete buildings and by des troying the green forests of the globe, the antennas that amplify the Schumann r esonance. The power grid in the United States that drains current into the Eart h causes the worst case of electromagnetic pollution and this activity should be stopped immediately according to Dan Winter! ( \u0001\u0002 ) Torsion waves Nikola Tesla around 1900 was the first to experimen t with two spiral coils (caduceus shaped). He fed the two coils with opposi ng alternating currents such that they would create electromagnetic fields that would be self-cancelling. Although the electromagnetic fields were cancelled out, he demonstrated that his Tesla coils were nevertheless able to transmit ener gy over long distances. He had actually discovered a new form of energy. Remarkabl y Tesla’s waves did not loose its energy at the inverse square of the dista nce as normal electromagnetic energy does, even over long distances there was no loss of energy to be noticed. Tesla’s work on this revolutionary new form of ener gy was almost forgotten in history. It retrospect it seems his work was too re volutionary to be accepted by society in the last century, especially its applica tion of free-energy. This is why his work nearly disappeared without trace. Fortunat ely the same form of new energy was independently rediscovered in the ninete en fifties during the cold war behind the Iron Curtain by Russian astrophysicist Dr . Nikolai A. Kozyrev (1908- 1983). Kozyrev’s discoveries were kept secret by th e Soviet Union during the cold war. It was only after the fall of the Iron Curtain that Kozyrev’s discoveries were slowly revealed to the West. In the Soviet Union tho usands of academics have delved into this subject after Kozyrev’s initial di scovery of this new form of energy. Kozyrev proved the existence of the ether o nce and for all. This new energy is neither electromagnetic in natur e nor does it relate to gravity as it stands on its own. The new form of energy dis covered by Kozyrev is a spiralling non-Hertzian electromagnetic wave that t ravels through the vacuum at super-luminal speeds, a billion times (10 ⁹ C) faster than light. Due to the spiralling nature of the wave, the wave is called a torsion wave since it traces a"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 92 spiralling path! According to independent researche r David Wilcock the torsion wave also traces a perfect Phi spiral! Torsion wave s are called non-Hertzian waves since they do not obey the classical theory o f Hertz and Maxwell. Einstein and Dr. Eli Cartan predicted the existence of static torsion fields in 1913 in a theory that became known as the Einstein-Carta n Theory, or ECT for short. Torsion fields never got very much interest in phys ics until Kozyrev discovered their actual existence. We have already discussed torsion waves in chapter 4 about the zero point field, where we mentioned that Tom Bearden discovered that the fundamental wave in the electromagnetic wave is a scalar wave. The scal ar wave is the wave that remains when two opposite electromagnetic waves int erfere cancelling out the electric and magnetic field components, just like T esla did. The result is a hitherto unrecognized component in the electromagnetic wave, a longitudinal wave vibrating in the same direction it is travelling. ( Classical electromagnetic fields are transverse waves, vibrating perpendicular to its pr opagation). Scalar waves and torsion waves are just synonyms for the same wave. Torsion waves now seem to play a significant role i n explaining our physical reality. Although torsion fields are very weak they can be measured using torsion beam balances that were first developed by Kozyrev. Torsion waves create minute forces in matter and that’s how they can be detected. Torsion fields can be either static or dynamic. Sta tic torsion fields can take on the form of vortexes like the one mentioned in the Impl osion Physics of Daniel Winter. These static vortex torsion fields in the fa bric of the vacuum space can stay in one place for a very long period of time. K ozyrev discovered that torsion fields can also propagate through space as torsion waves at tremendous speeds at least one billion times the speed of light (10 ⁹ C) . He noticed that all physical objects both absorb an d radiate torsion waves. By shaking, vibrating, deforming, heating and cooling physical objects they generate measurable torsion waves. Even the displacement of an object generates torsion waves that can be measured. All movement therefore from the vibrations of atoms to the orbits of our planets and stars leaves their traces in the form of torsion waves in the ether. A very remarkable phenomenon that Kozyrev discovere d by rotating gyroscopes is that they lose very small but measurable amounts of weight. Also firmly shaking objects could make objects lose weight. Now from our current understandings of physics this is quite impossible! It violates all physical laws, how can solid matter lose weight when it is spun at high speeds or shaken? If we still believe that matter is made of little hard ma rbles called particles, yes this would be a great mystery! However Kozyrev showed th at the gyroscopes shed more torsion waves when shaken or spun, so that eth eric energy that sustains the object was shed back into the background sea of the ether. The momentary loss of ether energy accounted for the weight drop. Dr. Harold Aspden of Cambridge University discovered a related phenomenon. He attached a powerful magnet to a gyroscope and spun it at high speeds. He measured the amount of energy required to accelerat e the gyroscope to full speed to be a 1000 Joules. Now to his surprise when he stopped the gyroscope from spinning and restarted the gyroscope to spin a gain within 60 seconds after it stopped, it required 10 times less energy to spin t he gyroscope to the same speed. The spin of the gyroscope had added extra sp in to the ether that sustains the gyroscope that lasted for a while before it wor e off, rather like the momentum"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 93 stored in the tea of a teacup after stirring it wit h a teaspoon. We now know that spinning magnets are strong torsion wave generators . Another violation of the laws of Newton with respec t to torsion fields comes from Bruce DePalma. He conducted experiments where he ca tapulted two identical steel balls at the same speed under the same angle into the air. The only difference between the balls was that one of the ba lls was rotating at 27000 revolutions/minute and the other was not. The spinn ing ball reached far higher into the air than the non-spinning ball. By the spi nning of the ball torsion fields were created that caused a slight change in the tot al mass of the ball. Kozyrev discovered that stars also radiate torsion wave energy and postulated that these torsion waves were generated due to the spinning of the stars. From his astronomical observations of stars using dedica ted telescopes to measure the torsion wave radiation, he noticed that the star ra diated this torsion wave energy from a location in the sky that must be the true po sition of the star whereas the visible light of the star reveals the position of t he star many years ago since it took many light-years before this light reached the Earth. From this observation he concluded that the torsion wave must travel at s uper-luminal speeds. He even noticed that torsion wave radiation was received in a location in the sky that revealed the future position of the star! Since tor sion waves travel at super- luminal speeds, they can cross the time barrier and ‘move’ into the future. Since the Earth also radiates torsion waves and thi s torsion radiation is much stronger near the poles, Kozyrev’s experiments are geographical location dependant. He also noticed that his effects could o nly be measured during the cold periods of the year. In the summer the intense solar torsion waves interfered with the torsion waves of his experiments. Our Sun is the greatest torsion wave generator in our Solar System. ( \u0001\u0004 ) Torsion waves flow in and out of all physical matte r and atoms are basically all torsion wave generators. The counter rotating Phi spiralling electromagnetic waves in the Implosion Physics of Daniel Winter that spiral into the nucleus of the atom, likewise cancel the electromagnetic components of the electromagnetic w aves and results in a torsion wave. Phi caduceus scalar wave "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 94 Russian science has actually many names for Daniel Winter’s electromagnetic energy vortexes such as spin fields, torsion fields and axion fields, they are all vacuum spin fields. The doughnut and vortex structu res of spiralling Golden Mean waves described by Daniel Winter are forms of static torsion fields. The spiralling into the zero still point of the electromagnetic vo rtex creates the following effects: • It accumulates ‘infinite’ energy due to the implosi on of the waves into smaller and smaller wavelengths. The shorter the wa velength the more energy is contained in the spiralling wave. Like th e tornado accumulates energy and focuses it into the eye of the tornado, the electromagnetic vortex accumulates energy into its still-point. Not ice that it is the extreme spinning of air molecules in the eye of a tornado t hat gives it its immense destructive power. • A spin field of electromagnetic energy stores inert ia (the resistance to movement). The more spin, the more inertia is store d. The same inertia effect is demonstrated by spinning tops and gyrosco pes that resist any change to their momentum. If we appreciate these two effects created by torsi on fields, we may start to understand why matter and energy are interchangeabl e (Einstein’s famous formula E=m* c^2) and what it is that gives matter its solidness. If we organise vortex spin fields of electromagneti c energy in the organisation patterns of the Platonic solids we call an atom, we may now understand that: • Matter is a dense form of accumulated energy • Matter internally has properties of inertia that gi ves it mass. So in reality, there is really nothing solid about matter. Mass is the illusion of a solid thing, its the maya of the material world men tioned by the Tao. This illusion is sustained by the stored inertia in the waves and has tricked science to maintain a false concept of inertia. We’ve always believed t hat inertia is an inherent property of mass, but the truth is just the opposit e, the stored inertia of spinning electromagnetism in a local region of space creates the effect we observe as mass! There is little known in Western science about torsi on fields created by matter spun at high speeds. NASA has just recently launche d a satellite in April 2004 to investigate the spin fields of the planets in our S olar System. Since most scientists believe that the spin field is a propert y of matter, they fail to recognise that it is the torsion field that creates matter in the first place. Bruce de Palma’s spinning gyro experiments proved that gyroscopes ac tually lose weight. This phenomenon is totally unexplainable within the curr ent scientific paradigm, however if we understand that by spinning an object we change the overall electromagnetic spin stored in the object, we may s ee why it has a feeble but measurable affect on its mass. We can now also start to see why Haisch & Rueda, dis cussed in chapter 4 ‘The Zero Point Field’, were able to prove Newton’s famo us law of inertia F=m * a. They proved that inertia is the effect caused by ac celerating mass through the zero point field. Well since the electromagnetic vor tex within the atom stores both zero point energy and inertia, we’re not surprised to find a correlation here. Static torsion fields in the form of vortexes in th e ether and the spiralling torsion wave travelling at super-luminal speeds are getting more and more attention in Western science. According to some, torsion waves ar e the missing link in the search for a final ‘theory of everything’, Einstein ’s unified field theory. It seems"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 95 that electromagnetism, gravity and torsion waves ar e all members of the same family; they are just different forms of ether vibr ations. The most astonishing fact that may prove that a ‘th eory for everything’ is within reach, is the fact that Kozyrev discovered that hum an thoughts and feelings are generating torsion waves as well. He has been able to measure torsion waves that were caused by sudden human emotional changes. So what Kozyrev proved was that: Consciousness is related to ether vibrations. Our very thoughts and emotions create torsion waves that travel at super-luminal speeds to the far ends of the universe. Torsion waves may be the physics for telepathy, the ability of mind reading between two individuals. Since torsion wave can phy sically affect matter, it may also be the explanation for psycho kinesis or PK, t he ability to mentally change physical objects. Stage performer and spoon bender Uri Geller has always demonstrated these abilities in front of large audi ences. Although many still think he was a conman, he has been subjected to scientifi c scrutiny but they could never disprove his ability. During the cold war Rus sian scientist have experimented a lot with psychics because they belie ved that their abilities were genuine. Now we may remember from chapter 3 ‘Science and Con sciousness’ the research programs of Dr. William Tiller into the effects of h uman intention. He used test persons to imprint their intentions into his IIED de vice and asked them to manipulate the outcome of an experiment, for instan ce the lowering of the acidity of water. The IIED device was placed in a room for extended periods of time and the effect of lowering the acidity of water could c learly be measured. After a while the IIED device could be removed from the room and the effect continued. The room had somehow become conditioned. Now the conditioning of this room may be explained by the presence of stati c torsion fields that were imprinted in the physical vacuum of the room by hum an intention! These torsion fields created by means of human intention are able to create subtle changes in matter. In 1984, Dankachov showed that static torsion fields could also be memorized in water. Water proves to be a good medium for storing static torsion fields. The late French biologist Jacques Beneviste has proven that water is able to memorize the constitution of chemical compounds that were di ssolved in it. Somehow a torsion field can be created in water that is a fin gerprint of the chemicals dissolved in the water. After diluting the water a great number of times such that no possible molecules of the original chemical comp ounds could be found, the heavily diluted water still maintained its properti es as if the original compounds were still in there. What had happened is that alth ough no molecular traces could be found in the water, there was still the imprint in the water of the original torsion field of the chemical compounds. Beneviste also demonstrated that by simply placing a second bottle next to the first on e he could xerox the properties of the water from one bottle to the other. The tors ion field of the first bottle of water was induced into the second! Prof. Dr. David Schweitzer is able to photograph this memory effect of water. He has a fairly simple method to measure the water mem ory effect of water and the imprint they leave behind in the water. He takes a water drop and allows it to dry"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 96 up at a tilted angle. Next he investigates the drie d up water drop under a microscope and shows how interesting light structur es become visible. The memory effect of water may be a physical explan ation for homeopathy. Many people are very sceptical about homeopathy because how can clear water that has been diluted so many times such that all chemic al compounds are gone still have a medical effect? Pure water can’t have a heal ing effect can it? However the invisible torsion fields that are present in the wa ter may be the reasonable explanation for this phenomenon. ( \u0001\u0005 ) The imprint of human intention into the ice crystal s of Dr Masuru Emoto is yet another example that can be explained by torsion wa ves radiated by human thoughts and emotions. The torsion fields created b y human intention are simply memorized in water. At an invisible level the inter nal structure of water has changed. After freezing the water these changes bec ome manifest to the naked eye in the different shapes of the ice crystals. At Sound Energy Research they create torsion field imprints in water using scalar (torsion) wave technologies. They treated distilled water with a scalar waves and a coil developed by Dr. Glen Rein. The result is str uctured water called scalar wave structured water™. They sent samples of this w ater to Dr Masuro Emoto who froze the water samples and studies the crystal s. They formed perfect geometrical hexagonal structured ice crystals. This is yet another example that indirectly proves that consciousness and torsion wa ves are related since both human conscious intention and scalar waves seem to produce the same results in Dr Masuro Emoto’s experiments with ice crystals. Scalar wave Structured Water™, ice crystals created by Dr Masuro Emoto Sound Energy Research sells their programmed ‘smart ’ water in bottles in three different flavours. By using different intentions t hey added different programming to the water. The water is said to have relaxing an d healing properties. ( \u0001\u0006 ) Akashic field Torsion waves are very remarkable waves as they nev er wear off, they propagate to the far corners of the universe without losing t heir momentum and in this respect they have eternal life. Torsion waves as th ey travel through the physical vacuum do not encounter any friction; therefore the y maintain their energy. As torsion waves traverse the universe they interfere with other torsion waves. Over"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 97 time they weave a tapestry of the history of all th at has ever happened within the universe from the movement of the smallest sub atom ic particle, to the revolution of the planets, and the expansion of galaxies. Reme mber that torsion waves are generated by many phenomena such as the vibration o r displacement of matter, electromagnetic energy and our conscious thoughts t o name a few. Torsion fields are therefore information fields as they encode everything that has left its traces in the form of torsion waves in thi s universe. This boils down to the recording of every little thought that was ever tho ught and every little move that was ever made. The interference patterns of the tor sion waves form a huge hologram that permeates the whole of the universe. Just like the waves of the seas form an interferenc e pattern that in theory allows us to decode the movement of the ships that stirred its surface, likewise torsion waves theoretically allow us to decode the history of our universe. The only difference between the waves at sea and the torsion waves is that the sea waves eventually loose their energy as they crest at the shores. The superposition of torsion waves and their memory capacity however is limitless and eternal. Torsion waves allow for information transfer across the universe, connecting every atom in the universe with every other atom an d since torsion waves travel at super luminous speeds they could be the explanat ion of the non-local effects that were predicted in theory and discovered by exp eriment in quantum physics. The information field created by torsion waves in t he universe allows for a coherent whole of the universe, connecting every li ttle atom in the universe with all other matter in the universe informing it of it s whereabouts and activity. In fact scientists are discovering a very high state o f coherence in our physical universe that can not easily be explained if the un iverse is a bunch of single individual parts of atoms, molecules, planets and s tars that only maintain contact by separate forces such as gravity acting upon them . Quantum entangled particles keep their coherent relation eternally an d are not bothered by any distance separating them whether it be a few millim etres or the distance of a galaxy. These relations can only be explained if an invisible field permeates the universe that interconnects them. The information field described above is termed the A-field by Professor Emeritus Ervin Laszlo. Laszlo in the last four decades devel oped an integral theory for everything; instead of specialising in one particul ar field, Laszlo has studied many fields of science and finally developed an integral system theory. According to Laszlo the A-field is more fundamental than energy and matter in the universe. It’s this primordial information field that is the ground of our universe interconnecting everything with everything renderin g our view of separate entities in this universe useless. In his system th eory there are no separate entities at all; ‘separate’ entities that we observ e in our universe are all embedded in one seamless interwoven net of connecti ons. The A-field of torsion waves may be new to science, its existence has been known for thousands of years in the East. The only new th ing about it is that it is being rediscovered by western science. Eastern spiritual tradition has named this field the Akashic field. Akasha is a Sanskrit word meanin g radiating or shining, it’s the equivalent for ether. Akasha is the womb of creatio n bringing forth every physical aspect that can be perceived with the senses accord ing to eastern traditions. In ancient eastern spirituality the history written wi thin the Akashic field are called the Askashic chronicles, the book of life that reco rds everything that has ever happened or will happen in the universe. The Akashi c chronicles or Akashic records contain the story of every soul that ever l ived on this planet."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 98 The Akashic records, are holographic torsion fields of individuals that embed in larger holograms of groups of peoples such as natio ns. The holograms of nations weave the hologram of humanity on Earth and resembl es what Carl Jung called the collective mind of man. The A-field or Akashic field can explain the psychic abilities reported by many people to see into the p ast and know about events that took place in this world that were not perceived by any personal cognitive conscious experience. The Akashic records are the s torehouse of information that has been consulted by all great seers throughout th e ages including Edgar Cayce. The author of this book, personally testifies that psychic gifted people are able to read the Akashic records. In the past I have been c onsulting a paranormal practitioner for a long time. Being born as a very sceptical person, my disbelief in the paranormal however eventually melted as I was c onfronted with many unusual cures that I could not explain. I also shar ed many experiences with other clients of this practitioner during the long waitin g hours in the waiting room. During one of my consultations I handed him a photog raph of someone close to me without disclosing any prior details about the p erson in the picture, not a single word. I simply asked if he could help this p erson. He held his hand above the picture to sense it while he started to reveal to me what had happened to this person in clear details and quiet explicitly explai ned the situation this person was in. The information hit me right in the face for I knew he was right. I was totally flabbergasted by the experience since there was no way he could know the details he was revealing to me! From this moment on I knew with absolute certainty that there was something fundamentally mi ssing in my understanding of what I believed to be my materialistic reality. To me this personal experience changed my scepticis m about the paranormal once and for good. I can therefore from my own expe rience testify that psychic abilities to read the Akashic records are real and that indeed everything that has every happened in this world must be written in the vacuum fabric of space and time. Human consciousness is able to read this book of life. I think everyone of us at least has had one or more experiences in his life where he or she suddenly had access to information not pe rceived by the senses. What we call intuition, a sudden insight or feeling that informs us about a situation, may be explained by moments of unconsciously tappin g into the Akashic field and having access to information we can’t logically exp lain. Sometimes we just know things! Twins who are emotionally very close often keep a t elepathic contact and unconsciously know about each other especially when the other twin half is in distress. Twins often have an ability called twin-p ains, they are able to sense the pain of the other half in cases of, for instance, a severe toothache. Owners of a dog know that their dogs are often mysteriously abl e to sense their bosses return home after a long day at the office. Animals in nature are able to sense a pending Earth quake. Hours preceding the actual quake animals start to respond very nervousl y as if they sense something terrible is about the happen. Earthquakes are accom panied by a tremendous release of torsion waves as a result of the frictio ns that occur in the Earth crust prior to the quake itself. These intensified torsio n waves are most likely sensed by the animals’ consciousness and may explain their ne rvous behaviour in anticipation of the quakes. Humanity has somehow lo st its paranormal abilities that are still common in animals. During the tragic events of the tsunami that took place on the 26 th December 2004, rescue workers in the aftermath of the Earthquake were amazed to found an almost complete absence of dead wildlife"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 99 although there were so many human casualties. The r eason may be that animals used their 6 th sense and felt the impending disaster that caused them to flee to safer places in the higher mountains. It seems our current understanding of psychic abili ties and the paranormal is finally catching up. Explanations for psychic abili ties have now come into the domain of science that for the first time in histor y is able to give a rational explanation for these abilities that have been igno red, ridiculed and dismissed out of hand for so long in the West. ( \u0001\u0007 ) Recapitulation For the first time in recorded human history we may have a unified theory of everything (T.O.E.) within reach that not only expl ains our physical universe but also connects it with consciousness, closing the ga p between science and spirituality once and for all, 300 years after Desc artes. The empty space of the universe is not empty at all . It contains a spiritual energy that modern day science has rediscovered as the eth er but this energy has been known for thousands of years in many ancient spirit ual traditions by names such as the Chi, Ki, Prana or Akashic energy of the univ erse. This energy not only shapes the physical world mome nt by moment, it is also related to consciousness. Contemporary science is r evealing that the firm belief in a distinction between the material and the spiritua l word is false. There is no duality, the universe is constructed from one and o ne substance only and both the physical and mental world springs forth from th e ether. Amit Goswami, Daniel Winter and David Wilcock are a few of the scientists who have crossed the bridge between science and spirituality and who now believ e that the primordial conscious energy of the universe is the first cause of creation. The ether energy can arranges itself into basic geo metrical wave patterns that were named after Plato, the Platonic solids to form matter. Almost 2,500 years ago, Plato wrote that the physical world was constr ucted from the Platonic solids. The Platonic solids arrange themselves in what chao s theory calls fractal patterns weaving a matrix in space interconnecting atoms wit h the stars. The scales of the Platonic solid shapes are different but the ratios between them are still the same (following the Hermetic principle as above so below ). The suggestion coming from quantum science that the probability waves are real waves is now believed to be true. This finally solv es the enigma of the wave particle duality of quantum science. There are no p articles in the universe, only waves. What we see as a particle is in fact the foca l point of vibrations. The idea that God is the light and love of this wor ld as mentioned by many world religions can be taken literally after studies of t he work of Daniel Winter. Matter is created from pure light (electromagnetic and torsio n wave energy) and as we have demonstrated there is a distinct relation betw een love and the Golden Mean ratio (Phi) that is required to sustain matter. Sin ce the focal point of these waves creates conscious awareness, every atom in the univ erse is conscious and the universe itself is One conscious being. The univers al consciousness, God is all that is, he’s omnipresent and omnipotent. He’s aware of all things going on in the universe because he’s the universal consciousness a nd all that is. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 100 Matter in the universe is attracted by means of Gol den Mean braiding of waves towards to the zero point, the alpha and omega of c reation. It is the love in those waves that creates the gravity. The late and legend ary R. Buckminster Fuller the subject of the Beatles song ‘Fool on the Hill’, dis coverer of the importance of sacred geometry, used to put it this way: ‘Love is metaphysical gravity’. If there wasn’t any love in the waves that shape ma tter they would start to destructively interfere and the universe would coll apse into a great void. God is the Gforce in Ether Dynamics and the fractal attract or in chaos theory, attracting all waves towards the center where all becomes One. Russian scientists rediscovered Tesla’s new type of non-electromagnetic energy that travels in spiralling ways and called it torsi on waves. Scientists now believe that torsion waves can be regarded as information c arrying waves rather than energy waves. It was proven that torsion waves are linked to human consciousness and are created by human thought and emotions. Torsion waves are the interface between the mental and the physic al world although we must keep in mind that in reality there is no duality be tween them. Torsion field physics is the promising physics of p sycho kinesis and telepathy and shows us how the universe creates a hologram that r esembles the ancient information field of the ether better known as the Akashic field. The Akashic field is the book of life that keeps a record of all that has ever happened in this universe and all that will ever happen in the futur e. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 101 Chapter 7 Atlantis and the Earth grid The vibrating ether energy that shapes the atom mom ent by moment also shapes the planets, the stars and all the rest of the univ erse in the very same way. The Platonic energy fields at the quantum level should therefore also be found at the macroscopic scale of our own planet Earth. The scal e of the wavelengths may be different but the ratio of the interfering ether wa velengths are the same, the ratio is inherently fixed by the geometry of the Platonic solids. Another way of saying the same thing is that atoms, planets and stars are interconnected by the fractal patterns of the Platonic solids. We will demonstrat e in this chapter that the Platonic solids also create an energy matrix around the Earth that scientist now call the ‘Earth grid’. The Earth grid A number of scientists have been working on the Ear th grid model, but the first one was Ivan P. Sanderson. Sanderson found that the twelve ‘Devil’s Graveyards’ around the world were geometrically spaced from one another. The ‘Devil’s Graveyards’ are the triangular areas in the world w here physical anomalies have been reported such as the mysterious disappearances of ships and airplanes for no apparent reason. The most famous of them is the Bermuda triangle; second best known is Devil’s Sea east of Japan. There have been many reports of time and space dilations that were accompanied by loss o f compass, altimeters, artificial horizon, loss of radio contact and other strange phenomena that many airplane pilots experienced while flying over the B ermuda triangle. There have been reports of planes that after arrival seemed to have travelled through a different time zone since all watches on board were late by exactly the same time! Sanderson noticed that there are five ‘Devil’ s Graveyards’ in the Northern Hemisphere, five in the Southern Hemisphere and two at the poles, twelve in total forming the exact vortices of the icosahedron ! Devil’s Graveyards and the icosahedron Three Russian scientists, Nikolai Goncharov, Vyache slav Morozov, and Valery Makarov made the next step in the construction of t he Earth grid. They started with Sanderson’s work and added the dodecahedron to the grid pattern. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 102   Icosa Dodecahedron grid Bruce Cathie discovered independently the octahedro n and cube in the subtle energy fields of the Earth and this was later given the name the Cathie grid. Husband and wife scientists William Becker and Bethe Hagens finally put the complete Earth grid symmetry together. Becker is a Professor of Industrial Design at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Bethe H agens is a Professor of Anthropology at Governors State University. Startin g from the icosa- dodecahedron grid they added a special polyhedron d eveloped by sacred geometry explorer R. Buckminster Fuller. The offici al term of their final Earth grid is the Unified Vector Geometry 120 Polyhedron, or t he UVG 120 also called the ‘Earth Star’. The Earth grid has been studied at length and it sh ows many amazing facts since it perfectly outlines the shapes of the continents, mountain ridges, tectonic cracks in the Earth’s crust, ridges at the bottom of the o ceans, places of volcanoes, ocean current patterns. All of these geological eff ects and many more can be mapped onto the Earth grid. The grid pattern of the Earth is attributed to the torsion waves that rush into the Earth. Although to rsion waves are very subtle, collectively they become very strong and are able t o create real geological effects that are discernable in our Earth’s crust. The ‘Devil’s Graveyards’ are all situated on the ver tices of the icosahedron of the Earth grid. In these places abnormal ether vortexes can occur during rare interplanetary alignments taking place within our S olar System. According to David Wilcock the different densities of the ether in the universe create many different physical dimensions. Basicall y there are eight dimensions related to the octave; however every dimension itse lf can have again eight sub- dimensions. This subdivision can go on and on rende ring infinite dimensions within our universe. The airplanes and boats that mysteriously disappear ed in the Bermuda triangle without any wreckage ever found can be explained by these time and space warping vortexes on the vertices of the icosahedron . The planes and boats may have literally disappeared into another dimension. One such a vortex location on Earth where physical anomalies can be experienced is the Oregon vortex in the United States. The Oreg on vortex is open to the public and is famous for its space and time warps. Strange effects such as the shrinking and expansion of human beings depending on the loca tion within the Oregon vortex can be personally experienced. "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 103    Oregon vortex, two people trading places also chang e sizes What happens in the Oregon vortex also happens in th e Bermuda Triangle only the effects are far stronger and can make planes di sappear from this plane of existence. ( \u0001 ) The Earthgate project Dutch researcher Saskia Bosman has conducted a numbe r of experiments with regard to the Earth grid. She’s developed a device named the Earthgate that is able to pick up the torsion wave energy of the Eart h grid. The design is very basic, it consists of a four-sided pyramid in the t op with an elongated inverted pyramid beneath it, along with 4 other tetrahedron shapes at the bottom all made of copper ‘wires’. She has used brass spheres soldered together with h ollow brass pipes. The whole construction is a wire frame of 1.8 m high with a b ase of 1.10 x 1.10 m. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 104 Earthgate device of Saskia Bosman showing orbs The whole idea about the Earthgate is that the Plat onic geometries that are incorporated in the wire frame are geometrical form s that resonate with the spiralling torsion waves of the Earth grid’s energy . The whole construction is a kind of antenna that is tuned to torsion waves. Sas kia Bosman herself calls it the ‘acupuncture needle’ punctured in the earth’s energ y grid. In multiple trials, the device was fired up by a gr oup of people projecting their loving intentions towards the Earthgate in a state of meditation. Additional sounds were used as well! When the device was activ ated, anomalous light spheres, called orbs started to emerge that could b e viewed with the naked eye and have been photographed with both normal and inf rared photography. The light spheres were translucent and seemed to float in the air. Magnetometers picked up a strong signal at 3m dista nces from the Earthgate in the ELF frequency range (extra low frequencies 0-10 0 Hz). A strong base signal was focused around 7.8 Hz, the frequency of the Sch umann resonance along with higher harmonics. Clairvoyant people that were invited to witness the Earthgate experiment explained that the Earthgate links up with the ener gy grid of the Earth when the Earthgate was activated and aligned to the North-So uth axis. Activation of the Earthgate caused cosmic energy to come down from th e universe while the same energy moved up from the Earth to flow through the device, according to these psychic observers. Saskia Bosman was able to measure a toroidal energy vortex around the Earthgate; the vortex was measured in a horizontal plane around the Earthgate. She explains that the scalar waves or torsion wave fields that are omnipresent in the physical vacuum cause the anomalous effects cre ated by the Earthgate. She also believes that the Earthgate works really like an acupuncture needle and that it enhances and balances the Earth grid. ( \u0002 )"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 105 Ley Lines and megalithic structures The amazing truth of the matter is that mankind has known about the existence of an Earth encompassing energy grid for at least t housands of years. The Earth grid has simply been rediscovered in the 20 th century. We now have irrefutable proof that the ‘primitive cultures’ of the past, th e ancient cultures that had such a ‘limited understanding of physics’ knew about the s ubtle energies of the Earth and its grid pattern! The fact is that the Earth grid itself is laid down in stone all around the world. The Earth grid lines are the Ley Lines that we find all around the Earth. Ley Lines are manmade line markings carved out of stone in the co untryside and include dolmens, menhirs and stone circles. Megalithic stru ctures are found all over the world depicting the precise location of the Earth’s energy lines. These Ley Lines include many sacred places such as Avebury and Ston ehenge in the United Kingdom. Ley Lines are found all over the world and many cul tures in the past have referred to the Earth’s energy lines in various way s, the Chinese called them the dragon currents in the old art of Feng-shui, the ar t of balancing and harmonizing the land. By building pagodas, temples and stones s tructures they believed that it helped to heal the Earth. Feng-shui is to the land what acupuncture is to the body, it regulates the flow of Chi, the invisible e theric life force. The Australian aborigines referred to energy grid l ines as the dream lines that could be experienced in their dreamtime (a state of heightened awareness). When the Earth grid was finally in place it was disc overed that all pyramids and ziggurats (flat topped pyramids), sacred temple com plexes and stone circles around the world were placed on the vortices of the Earth grid. We mention the temples of the Mayas in Yucatan, the pyramids at th e Giza plateau and the white pyramid in Tibet. The Great Pyramid at the Giza pla teau, the pyramid of Khufu (Cheops in Greek) is the most important of them all because it is situated exactly on the north pole of the Earth grid matrix. The rea son why the ancients have chosen the Giza plateau for the Great Pyramid is th e location of the world’s strongest ether vortex. Most people know pyramids only from the ones in Egy pt and Mexico, but pyramids are scattered all over the world in China, Japan, Ecuador, El Salvador. Mexico (Chichen Itza), Guatemala, Peru (Machu Picch u). Some archaeologists believe that pyramids can be found in Europe as wel l. They have identified anomalous structures in hills covered by earth that have the shape of a pyramid in England at Silbury Hill, in Italy in Montevecchi a (3 possible pyramid shapes) and Germany. ( \u0004 ) Carl Munck was inspired by the work of Edgar Cayce, who when asked whether mankind would ever understand the pyramids replied that in order to understand the pyramids man must first understand the ‘mathema tical precision of the Earth’ Munck single-handedly managed to derive a mathemati cal model that precisely matches up with the Earth grid nodes. He was able t o prove that the Prime Meridian of the Earth was once not located in Green wich but was situated at exactly the spot where the Great Pyramid at the Giz a plateau in Egypt is built. So in ancient times the Great Pyramid of the Egyptians marked the zero longitude"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 106 line. The zero latitude line was the same in ancien t time as today and is the Earth’s equator. The place where the Great Pyramid is built is uniqu e, it is the only place on Earth where the longest stretches of landmass are found i n relation to water. When the Earth is circumscribed by a circle drawn through th e Great Pyramid, then the total cover of land on the circle exceeds the cover of wa ter far more in this place than in any other place on Earth. This was probably reco gnised in ancient times and it was for this reason that the zero degrees meridian, the Prime meridian was marked by one of the most amazing structures, the G reat Pyramid. Carl Munck cleverly discovered that all ancient str uctures of pyramids, stone circles, ziggurats and other Earthworks encode in t heir structure their longitude or latitude with respect to the Earth grid. The exact position of all ancient structures on Earth is based on a 360 degrees meridian grid sy stem with the Great Pyramid as the Prime meridian (0 degrees longitude). The re lative position in latitude or longitude was ‘engraved’ into the structure in a la nguage that would survive all future languages on Earth, the eternal universal la nguage of mathematics. Munck proved that if the visual aspects of an ancient mon ument such as its number of steps, terraces and faces that were used in the con struction were multiplied they give a number that is exactly the same as the produ ct of the degrees, minutes and seconds of the exact longitude or latitude of t he structure with respect to the Earth grid. As an example we mention the longitude of the Mayan Kukulkan pyramid at Chichen Itza, Mexico. Kukulkan pyramid Chichen Itza The pyramid is constructed in 9 terraces (layers), has 4 sides with 4 staircases with a total of 356 steps. (91 steps in each stairc ase with a common top step) If we take these visual markings and multiply them we get the number: 9 terraces x 365 steps x 4 sides x 4 staircase = 52 .560 The modern day longitude of Kukulkan is 88 degrees, 34 minutes and 9.71620648 seconds. If we adjust this longitude to the ancient Earth grid longitude we need to add to Kukulkan’s longitude th e longitude of the Great Pyramid at the Giza plateau, since Kukulkan is West of Giza. The longitude of the Great Pyramid is exactly 31 degrees, 42 minutes and 10.51620648 seconds. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 107 This gives the ancient longitude for Kukulkan as 11 9 degrees, 42 minutes and 10.51620648 seconds. If we multiply 119 x 42 x 10.51620648, guess what i t equals to 52.560! Stonehenge Stonehenge is just another example. It contains 60 stones in a 360 degrees round circle. Now multiply these two facts and we g et the number 21.600. The latitude of Stonehenge is exactly 51 degrees, 10 mi nutes and 42.3529411 seconds. If we multiply the numbers in the latitude of Stonehenge we get the value: 51 x 10 x 42.3529411 = 21.600 Munck has proven his theory to be correct for a vas t number of ancient structures and we now have proof that the ancients could deter mine the longitude and latitude of these structures with a precision that is equivalent to our own global positioning system (GPS) using satellites. Carl Munck elegantly proved that all ancient struct ures were designed to encode their position based on a uniform principle that wa s once commonly known worldwide. The ancients simply left their messages in stone for future generations to be discovered! ( \u0005 ) The lost continents Edgar Cayce was very sure about the fact that Atlan tis was not a myth and he predicted that proof of the mythological continent of Atlantis would eventually be discovered. Atlantis according to Edgar Cayce was d estroyed in three major periods of inundations spreading over thousands of years. The third and final destruction was a cataclysm, a pole shift of the Ea rth that caused the last of the remaining empire of Atlantis to sink in about 10.50 0 BC. Besides Atlantis, Edgar Cayce also mentioned the existence of the civilizat ions of Lemuria and Mu in nowadays Asia. Mu like Atlantis was a very highly c ivilized culture that collapsed around 50.000 BC. Survivors of the catastrophe fled to countries like China and Japan. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 108 The current consensus by historians is that the fir st civilizations that emerged are of Sumerian and Babylonian origins. These civilizat ions quite suddenly and in a relatively short time span emerged some 5000 years ago from the Stone Age. If remains of Atlantis were to be found, these discove ries would certainly revolutionize our world and we would be forced to r ewrite history books. Edgar Cayce was by no means vague about Atlantis, i n 1933 he quite precisely predicted that the first discovery of remains of At lantis would be found in 1968 or 1969 near the coast of the United States. He pinpoi nted to Bimini, an island in the Bahamas where eventually remains of temples would b e found under the muddy sand of the ocean. According the Cayce, Bimini was once part of the lost empire of Atlantis named Poseidia, the name of the sea God mentioned by Plato. Cayce’s predictions came to pass when in 1968 a civ ilian pilot flying over the waters of Bimini discovered an underwater structure that became later known as the Bimini Road. The Bimini Road is man made road w ith a length of several hundreds of meters and has been studied by the Univ ersity of Miami Professor Manson Valentine who revealed this news to the medi a. Ever since Professor Valentine’s discoveries were made public, flocks of researchers have swarmed to the Bahamas and Cuba to get their fair share in wha t may be the Atlantean discoveries. Researchers today are looking for the remains of th e lost mythological civilizations of Atlantis, Mu and Lumeria all over the world and some of them have already reported some very astonishing findings. Th e Association for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) that preserves Edgar Cay ce’s legacy, have formed a team of experts who are diving for the remains of A tlantis in the waters around Cuba and the Bahamas. They found a large underwater platform near Andros Island in the winter of 2003. The discoverers hypot hesised that they had found the remains of a huge ancient port structure. In the waters near Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula in th e summer of 2000 a research group headed by Russian researcher Paulina Zelitsky found mysterious megalithic structures at depths of 600 to 750m which they call ed MEGA. In October 2004 the same group headed back to the same location to research what they believe to be the Mayan Atlantis. In 2001 colleagues of Zel itsky working for the same company discovered another huge land plateau in the same region between Yucatan and Cuba in a deep trench with sonar techno logy that showed clear shapes of roads, buildings and pyramids. Using under sea robots they also made video images of white sands with in the middle clea rly distinguishable large sized man made structures. ( \u0006 ) While conventional research is being performed by di vers looking for the lost continent under water, a total new field of archaeo logy has emerged, the application of satellite imagery from space. Satell ites have discovered undulations on the ocean floor near the Bahamas the size of mou ntains that are spaced in geometrical patterns that may well be pyramids. The se discoveries were made by a company named ‘Satellite Discoveries’. This compa ny helps archaeologists and other researchers in their archaeological quest. Th e company publishes an e-zine magazine ‘Mysteries Unsealed Online Magazine’ on th e internet that keeps updates on the progress of their work. Satellite pictures made off the coast of Florida, s how straight lines on the floor of the ocean that are hundreds of kilometres long and are like trenches in perfect straight lines. These lines must be artificial beca use of their impossible length and"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 109 straightness. It is highly unlikely they were cause d by tectonic Earth plate movement, because they found Earth cracks that even run perpendicular to these lines. Similar lines have been found near the coast of Africa, South America, The Azores and Europe. It seems there is a huge megalit hic underwater network that is interconnected with super megalithic structures (pyramids). The constructions may have been above water in ancient times and coul d well be the remains of the lost civilisation of Atlantis. Digitally enhanced s atellite pictures possibly reveal the structures of underwater super sized pyramids, plac es that appear to be cities and other large megalithic structures. Further inve stigations are required but if in fact it can be proven that these structures are art ificial it seems that Atlantis is rising. Satellite Discoveries are raising funds and inviting scientists to investigate these underwater constructions further. ( \u0007 ) In 1995, off the coast of Japan near Okinawa large underwater structures were found that could be the remains of a castle. The ar chitecture resembles the architecture of nearby castles still on land. The s ites are under research by Professor Masaki Kimura, marine biologist of the Un iversity of Ryukyus in Okinawa. Professor Kimura believes that the structu res must be manmade by a lost civilisation. They even found roads underwater that prove they must have been manmade. Professor of Geology Teruaki Ishii at the Tokyo Univ ersity suggest that the structures must be dated back to 8,000 B.C. Others believe that they are much older and may well be 12.000 years old.  Structures in the waters near Okinawa, Japan In March 1995 in another location in the waters of Okinawa divers found the remains of an ancient city spread over an area of h undreds of square kilometres. They found streets, boulevards, arched structures, staircases carved out of stone and welded together. A few months later off the sho re of the island Yonaguni, 300 airmiles south of Okinawa in shallow water they even found a huge underwater pyramid! "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 110 The news about the underwater city and the pyramid made headline news for more than a year in Japan but this striking news fa ct has been totally neglected outside of Japan. Speculations are that the remains that are found are remnants of the legendary civilization of Mu. ( \b ) On the 15 th November 2004 the discovery of Plato’s Atlantis Ci ty made European headline news when an American expedition team lead by Robert Sarmast held a press conference claiming to have found its remains . Robert Sarmast says he has found the city with its circular canals just like P lato has described it. The city supposedly lies 1.5 km below sea level covered unde r meters of sea sediment, 80 km southeast off the coast of Cyprus. After a 6 day s expedition and sonar scanning of the area, he returned with proof of man made structures, including a 3 km long wall, deep trenches and meandering riverb eds. Sarmast says he compared 50 clues derived from the books of Plato w ith the actual site and definitely identified this site as the city of Atla ntis with its Acropolis Hill. His expedition counted members who also joined in the e xpedition that recovered the wreckage of the Titanic. Being very sure of his cas e from the preparations made in 2003 leading to the expedition in 2004, he wrote the book ‘The Discovery of Atlantis – the startling case for the Island of Cyp rus’ (Origin Press 2003) that has become a bestseller among tourists on Cyprus alread y. ( \t ) Researcher John Mitchell author of the book ‘New vi ew over Atlantis’ believes that all of these structures both on the land and under water belonged to a geomantic tradition that was once universally known all over the Earth. Mitchell states in his book ‘We live within the ruins of an ancient struct ure whose vast size has hitherto rendered it invisible’. The major regions where pyramids are found are in t he Earth grid’s 0 degrees longitude zone (Egypt, Giza plateau), the 120 degre es longitude zone (Kukulkan, Meso America, Maya and Aztec pyramids) and the 240 degrees longitude zone (Japan, underwater pyramids). These three zones are not coincidental; they mark the strongest energy lines of the Earth grid that a re defined by the Platonic tetrahedron shape, the three-faced pyramid! The most likely explanation for all the pyramids th at are found under water and on the land is that they are the legacies of the lo st civilizations of Atlantis Mu and Lemuria. These civilizations must have had knowledg e of the ether and the Earth grid. Pyramid Power What is so special about pyramids? Why are they found all over the world and why over the Earth grid? Egyptologists would tell us that the Egyptians buil t the pyramids in Egypt serving as burial sites for the pharaohs. However at the Gi za plateau no mummy was ever found in the Great Pyramid that was named afte r Khufu, the Pharaoh that supposedly has been buried there. In later Egyptian times pyramids were built of a far lesser quality than the enigmatic Great Pyram id at the Giza plateau and these pyramids have certainly been used as burial s ites. However a number of archaeologists now believe that earlier pyramids su ch as the one at the Giza plateau served a totally different purpose. "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 111 To find out what pyramids are for, 20 large pyramid s were built in 8 different locations in Russia from 1990 onwards. They were bu ilt near Moscow and in the Ukraine. All pyramids were constructed from fibregla ss; the largest in size has a height of 44 meters and weighs 55 tons. Research ha s been conducted for more than a decade now on these pyramids under supervisi on of Alexander Golod, director of a Defense Enterprise in Moscow. Many Ru ssian scientists from famous Russian academies in the fields of medical science, biophysics and physics were involved in the pyramid studies.   Russian pyramid They have collected a lot of data indicating that t he pyramids exhibit a hitherto unknown ‘pyramid power’. Studies revealed that pyra mids can increases the immune system of organisms leading to a better heal th. Agricultural seeds that were placed inside the pyramid for 1 to 5 days yiel ded a better crop increase of 30 to a 100%. The Russian military measured a colum n of energy right above the pyramid extending for several kilometres into the a ir. Amazing enough the ozone layer improved over the area of the pyramids and se ismic activity in the region diminished. A nearby oil well yielded a better prod uction since the oil had become less viscous (lighter). The reports were confirmed by the Russian academy of Oil and Gas. Another amazing effect of pyramid power is the effe ct it seems to have on human consciousness.

Another amazing report on pyramid energy comes from Mr Kirti Betai. In Agra India, Mr Kirti Betai has created 36.000 small pyra mids and put them into a special configuration forming a pyramid energy heal ing system. He has founded the Daya Dhaar Self Care Center, a non-profit organiz ation. Pyramid treatment is free of charge and without reservation available to anyone. Mr Betai has already helped ten thousands of people who have visited his center. He has claims of ‘miraculous’ healings from ailment s that are incurable and he is inviting scientist to come and study his work. He built the pyramid construction to heal himself f rom a liver and kidney failure that was the result of a wrong drug administration. Among his patients he also cured his wife who suffered from chronic Asthma. He claims to have healed a woman diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy with treatme nt lasting two years. When she entered the program she couldn’t stand on h ere own feet, but after two years she was able to stand up for as long as 45 mi nutes. Blood samples indicated that she was cured from the disease. ( ) Recapitulation The Greek word for pyramid is pyramidos and is cont ains the word ‘pyr’ meaning ‘fire’ and ‘amid’ meaning ‘in the middle’. So pyram id really means ‘fire in the middle’. Russian research has shown that the pyrami d’s power is indeed a ‘fire’ in the pyramid’s interior. The pyramid’s shape seems to acts as an antenna for the spiralling torsion waves. It is assumed that a pyramid focuses torsion waves from the Earth grid into its center. The megalithic stones and structures placed on the meridians of the Earth grid are the acupuncture needles in the energy body of Gaia, just like Saskia Bosman has demonstrated with her Earthgate device. Supposedly the megalithic infrastructure was built by highly advanced ancient civilizations to protect us from cosmic influences and used to stabilize the aura, t he ether energy fields of the Earth. There is now circumstantial evidence to suggest tha t the megalithic infrastructure was used by the Atlantean civilization to stabilize the tectonic plate movements that caused Earthquakes and volcanic activity aroun d the world. However they could not prevent a pole shift that eventually led to the destruction of Atlantis. Carl Munck proved that the ancients ‘engraved’ the exact grid location into the megalithic earthwork structures with an accuracy th at is stunning. We can only speculate that their motivation to do this was that it would eventually be discovered by future sophisticated and technically developed civilizations like ours. It would allow this future generation to reco nstruct the megalithic infrastructure that once was used to stabilize the aura of the planet. All of the discoveries mentioned in this chapter sh ow us that we drastically need to re-evaluate and rethink every book that has been written about human history."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 113 If you’re still not convinced that highly civilized cultures pre-dated our current civilization just have a look at these hieroglyphs that were found on the Egyptian temple wall at Abydos.

Now what do we really know about the Egyptians? Let’s have a look in the next chapter at the most intriguing and mysterious construction every made b y man, the Great Pyramid at the Giza plateau and see how scientist have started to unravel this enigma. Indications are that the Great Pyramid must not be attributed to the Egyptians but to the Atlanteans."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 114 Chapter 8 The Giza Plateau One of the seven world wonders is the Great Pyramid at the Giza plateau by the side of the Nile near Cairo. It has been the subjec t of studies and explorations since the dawn of modern history. Piles of books ha ve been written about the enigmatic Great Pyramid alone. Many of these books stem from Egyptian archaeologists. Egyptologists haven’t changed their view about the Great Pyramid very much in the last hundred years. Pyramidologist s date the construction of the Great Pyramid back to 2589 B.C. and it is supposedl y created as a burial site, the tomb of pharaoh Kufhu (Cheops in Greek). Leading ex pert in the field is Dr. Zahi Hawass, chairman of the Supreme Council of Antiquit ies (SCA) in Egypt, who fiercely adheres the tomb theory of the Great Pyram id. Although there is a sarcophagus inside the King’s chamber of the Great Pyramid, no mummy has ever been found inside the pyramid. The sarcophagus must have been made inside the pyramid since due to its size it cannot be removed from the King’s chamber any more. In the last decade scientist have started to doubt the age and purpose of the Great Pyramid. Gradually as more and more secrets o f the Great Pyramid are being exposed, the tomb theory becomes less and les s acceptable. Indications are that the Great Pyramid must have been built by a highly intelligent culture that must have had a scientific understanding and a ccess to techniques such as our own. The Great Pyramid consists of two million limestone blocks, has the height of a forty-story building and the width of two and a hal f football fields. The foundation of the pyramid is bedrock chiselled with a precisio n of only 2 centimetres off perfect level. Even today with all our technical kn ow-how and laser precision craftsmanship according to specialists we are not a ble to build a structure like the Great Pyramid which such precision! We simply do no t have the mechanical technology available to carve the stones that const ruct the pyramid with the precision that has been used! The stones are so per fectly carved and the mortar joints are so terribly thin that you can’t even get a sheet of paper in between them! The mortar joints are terribly strong, far st ronger that the mortar that we use nowadays. The stones seem more or less glued or fused together. The smallest blocks weigh a ton. The average block howe ver weighs 2,5 tons up to even 70 tons. How could they lift these very heavy blocks with such precision to the height of a forty-story building? Although ther e are some theories, we simply don’t know for sure. The massive construction of th e pyramid is aligned with a precision of only one degree off perfect alignment to the 4 cardinal points. The Giza Plateau contains three pyramids along with a number of satellite pyramids around the bigger pyramids. We also find th e famous Sphinx statue on the Giza Plateau. The three big pyramids are named after the Pharaohs that according to the Egyptologists ordered for their co nstruction as a mausoleum: • The Great Pyramid of Khufu • The pyramid of Khafre • The pyramid of Menkaure"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 115   From left to right, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure with its satellite pyramids It has become more and more obvious that the Great Pyramid in particular and the Giza Plateau in general has been designed to en code sophisticated scientific knowledge at multiple levels, there seems to be no coincidences. Every discovered detail has a meaning than we’ve just sta rted to unravel. Archaeologists got stuck in the single and only exp lanation for its purpose and made us believe that it serves as the burial site o f the Pharaohs such that we missed the whole point! For centuries the Giza plat eau has been studied through the eyes of archaeologists and historians but in th e last two decades that has now changed. Originally the pyramids were covered with a 144.000 white granite casing stones, giving them a smooth polished surface. In ancient t imes the reflections from the Sun must have been noticeable from miles away. The Egyptians called their pyramid ‘Ta Khut’ which translates into ‘The Light’ . Muslims in later times robbed the Great Pyramid of its casing stones to build the mosques in Cairo. The only remains of the casing stones are found at the base of the Great Pyramid and the top of the pyramid of Kahfre. It is from these ston es that the exact dimensions of the Pyramids have been determined. The capstone th at should seal the top of the Great Pyramid is missing. In this chapter we will just show a few facts that underpin the claims that the pyramids must have been built by a highly advanced civilization that had access to a technology better than our own! According to E dgar Cayce eventually the Great Pyramid will reveal all of its secrets when t he Hall of Records is opened and proof will be found of its Atlantean origin. The Hall of Records is supposedly a large storage r oom hidden somewhere under the Giza plateau that is believed to contain advanc ed Atlantean equipment. Some assume that the missing capstone is a miniature ver sion of the Great Pyramid with all the interior details. The capstone is supp osedly buried in the Hall of Records too. Edgar Cayce gave directions to the loc ation of the Hall of Records and hinted at the left paw of the Sphinx where the entry to the Hall of Records should be found. Investigative archaeologist Howard Middleton-Jones now claims to have found the exact location of the Hall of Rec ord. He also claims that the Ark of the Covenant, the tabernacle that contains the 1 0 commandments that were given to Moses on Mount Sinai is buried inside the Great Pyramid. The entrance to the Ark of the Covenant should be in the Great G allery at the junction that leads to the Queen’s chamber on the one hand and to the King’s chamber on the other. He came to this conclusion after carefully s tudying the book Exodus in which God explains in detail to Moses the construct ion of the Ark. Howard Middleton-Jones is quite sure that what is actually described in the book of Exodus is the staircase interior of the Great Pyram id known as the Grand Gallery leading up to the King’s chamber. Now if Howard Mid dleton-Jones is right we’re heading for some interesting discoveries. "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 116 ( \u0001 ) But just let’s not be drawn into speculations about the Great Pyramid instead let’s have a look at some very provable mathematical fact s. The mathematical constants The pyramid encodes the mathematical constants for Pi and Phi and the natural logarithm e! These three constants play a very sign ificant role in mathematics and physics. The origin of these constants has for centuries puzzled mathematicians and scientist and it still remains a mystery, but the fact is that these mystical constants show up everywhere in natu re. All of the three constants Pi, Phi and e have been incorporated into one and t he same structure, the Great Pyramid! This in itself is a very remarkable fact a nd proves the ingeniousness of the builders of the Great Pyramid. By no means is it possible that these constants sho w up accidentally by piling up some rocks. The values for Pi and Phi were easily f ound, however in 2003 Rick D. Howard eventually discovered the value for the natu ral logarithm. He developed a theory called the Triple-Triangular-Theory (TTT) th at mathematically underpins the presence of all three constants in the Great Py ramid. In the picture below are the dimensions of the Grea t Pyramid in royal cubits. The royal cubit is an ancient length measure used by th e Egyptians. Dimensions of the Great Pyramid in royal cubits. The mathematic value of Pi defines the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle and is found in the pyramid. • Pi can be found taking twice the base length of the pyramid divided by its height: Pi = 2 * 440/280 = 880/280 = 22/7 approxi mating Pi = 3.14159. The Golden Ratio or Phi is found in the pyramid in the following way: • Phi is found when the length of the slant length of the pyramid is divided by half the base length of the pyramid, Phi = 356/2 20 = 1.618 (220 is the half of the base of the pyramid). I’ve left out the proof for the value of e since th e Triple-Triangular Theory is rather complex. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 117 The fact that the pyramid encodes Pi and Phi and e, the most profound constants in nature shows that the builders of the pyramid mu st have had a mathematical understanding of the importance of these constants. ( \u0002 ) Location of the Great Pyramid The location where the Great Pyramid has been built is very remarkable to say the least, it seems to be cleverly chosen to relate to the speed of light! The speed of light is exactly 29.9792458 x 10.000.000 meters per second. (Roughly 300 thousand kilometres per second) Ten thousand kilometres is by definition the distan ce from the North Pole to the equator, it is simply how the meter has been define d in the SI system. Now if we divide the speed of light by the distance from the equator to the North Pole, we get the number: 29.9792458. This is the latitude of a line at half the distance between Khufu and Khafre of exactly 29.9792458 degr ees North. Now the chance of the location of the Giza Plateau being chosen by chance without the intent to represent the speed of light seems unlikely. Another indication that the builders of the Great P yramid knew the speed of light is found in the number of casing stoned that were u sed in the construction. From the discoveries made by Bruce Cathy, the one w ho discovered the octahedron and the cube in the Earth grid, we know that there is fascinating coincidence between the speed of light, the Gematri an value for light and the number of casing stones of the Great Pyramid. What B ruce Cathy did is that he expressed the regular value of the speed of light i n another measurement. He called it the grid speed of light; the speed light takes to travel along the Earth grid lines. In order to prove his fact, Cathy propo sed a different time unit. He introduced the grid second as a replacement for the current second as a unit of time. Instead of there being 3 * 8 hours in a day, he proposed a 3 * 9 = 27 grid hours in a day. He also used a different measure fo r distance; he used a radial displacement, the radial arc bow on a circle of 360 degrees. Next he recalculated the speed of light as the number of arc minutes (1/ 60th of a degree) light travels along the 360 degree circle (the Earth) per grid se cond (supposing there are 27 grid hours in day). Much to his surprise he found t he grid speed of light to be the very harmonious value of 144.000 grid arcs per grid second. So the harmonic value 144.000 for the speed of ligh t matches with the number of casing stones that were used to cover the Great Pyr amid. If we add in the fact that the Gnostic Kabbalah equates the Gematrian val ue for light to the number 144, we can safely assume these numbers that are sh owing up are no coincidences and that the builders of the Giza Plat eau most likely new the speed of light! Another ‘coincidence’ is the fact that the longitud e of the Great Pyramid may be related to the Mayan long count calendar. The Mayan long count calendar predicts the end of time at the 21st of December 2012. The l ongitude of the Great Pyramid is exactly: 31º 07’48” East which equals 31 .13 degrees East in the decimal system. Now scholars have determined that t he last Maya Great cycle of the long count calendar started on August 13th, 311 3 B.C. We will discuss the Mayan calendars and the end date prophesies in Chap ter 10 ‘Spiralling Evolution’. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 118 So the location of the Great Pyramid may also be a hint to the Mayan long count calendar. Remember also the facts that the location of the Gr eat Pyramid is the exact location of the North Pole of the Earth grid and th at it is the unique location on Earth where the maximum of landmass in relation to water is found! The Giza Plateau therefore is a unique location on Earth and it is therefore hard to believe that this fact has gone unrecognised by its designers! ( \u0004 ) The Giza plateau and the inner planets The dimensions of the Great Pyramid are the first s trong indications that the builders hinted at representing the dimensions of t he Earth. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, the radius from the poles to the ce ntre is smaller than the radius of the equator to the centre. Therefore the Earth i s flattened like a football that is squashed when someone sits on it. This is attribute d to centrifugal forces, a result of the Earths spinning on its polar axis. These imp erfect spherical dimensions of the Earth are perfectly reflected in the Great Pyra mid. The perimeter of the pyramid represents the equatorial radius of the Ear th. The perimeter of the pyramid equals to half a minute of Earth’s equatori al longitude. In other words if we take the perimeter of the Great Pyramid and mult iply it by 2 * 60 * 360 = 43.200 we get the circumference of the Earth along the equator in kilometres. This proves to be correct from satellite measuremen ts with a 99,5 % accuracy. The height of the Great Pyramid represents the pola r radius of the Earth. If we take the height of the pyramid and multiply it by t he same value of 43.200 to maintain ratio we get the polar radius of the Earth with an accuracy of 99.3 %. So it seems more than reasonable to assume that the Great Pyramid was indeed deliberately designed to represent the Earth. These facts cannot be dismissed as being purely coincidental. ( \u0005 ) The height of the Great Pyramid also seems to be a reference to the distance between the Sun and the Earth! The height of the py ramid is 280 royal cubits. The distance between the Earth and the Sun measured in kilometres is 147 x 10 ⁶ Km and equals 280 x 10 ⁹ royal cubits! So the distance between the Earth an d the Sun is exactly a billion times the height of the py ramid. In the chapter about sacred geometry we also demonstrated that the Great Pyramid expresses the ratio in size between the Earth and the moon by ‘sq uaring the circle’. From these examples, we may get the impression that the Great Pyramid is indirect proof of the existence of harmonic geometr ical relations between the Earth, the Moon and the Sun. Jean Martineau in ‘A l ittle book of coincidence’ indeed has proven that such harmonic relations exis t between all the celestial bodies of our Solar System. With the aid of sacred geometry he explained all the orbits of the planets of our Solar System and showe d that they are based on intrinsic harmonic principles. Johannes Kepler the great astronomer had always believed that the orbits of the planets could be ex plained by geometry, in fact he believed that the Platonic solids were the key to t he mysteries of the orbits. Was Kepler a Freemason? It would explain why he was so obsessed with the Platonic solids? "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 119 In 1994 Robert Beauval in ‘The Orion Mystery’ propo sed a now popular theory that assumes that the three pyramids on the Giza pl ateau are aligned to the three stars of the Orion constellation. The Nile accordin g to Beauval corresponds to the Milky Way. The pyramids on the ground represent the positions of the three stars of the Orion constellation at 10,400 BC (As above s o below). The date of 10,400 BC perfectly corresponds with the date for the cons truction of the Great Pyramid given by Edgar Cayce. While the popular and well known Orion alignment of the Giza plateau is still debated, there is also a less popular cosmic relati on that we will demonstrate in this book that can be proven relatively easily and beyond any doubt. This theory again assumes that the Great Pyramid was built to r epresent the Earth. It seems that the three Pyramids on the Giza platea u cleverly correspond with the four inner planets of the Solar System, Mercury, Ve nus, Earth and Mars with the emphasis on Venus. But how can three pyramids corre spond with four planets? The correlation between the pyramids and the planet s is as follows: • P1 : The Great Pyramid of Khufu relates to the Eart h • P2 : The pyramid of Khafre relates to Venus • P3 : The pyramid of Menkaure relates to both Mars a nd Mercury Aerial photo of the Giza plateau, on the right depic ting the planets The correspondence of the middle pyramid with Venus to my opinion may be a hint to the origins of the builders of the Giza Pla teau. We will reveal that later. Now the three pyramids relate in ratio with the fou r inner planets of the Solar System in three different ways: • The base of each pyramid corresponds with the diame ter of their corresponding planet • The angle between P1-P2 and P2-P3 relates to the so lar orbital time differences between Earth and Mars. • The distances between the pyramids relates to the r elative distances between the planets. "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 120 The smallest pyramid P3 corresponds to the average diameter of both Mercury and Mars. The builders of the pyramid probably used two kinds of colours in the casing stones to discern the dimensions of both Mar s and Mercury in one pyramid. The central pyramid P2 corresponds to Venu s and, the Khufu pyramid (P1) corresponds to the planet Earth. We must keep in mind that the dimensions of the pyra mids are related to the diameters of the planets and that the ratios that w ere calculated are within an accuracy that requires the exact measures of the pl anets that science has only been able to achieve by using satellites! And here we have a structure in the middle of a sand pit that demonstrates the ratios b etween the dimension of the planets and base lengths of the pyramids with the s ame accuracy! The three pyramids are not aligned in a straight li ne; they actually make an angle of 191.6 degrees. (180 degrees would be a straight line). Remember that this is the ‘angle’ between the Earth and Mars/Mercury. Planet Earth orbits the 360 degrees around the Sun in 365.25 days. Planet Mars however requires 686.98 days. Now let’s calculate h ow much of the 360 degrees of a full circle Mars has covered when the Earth ha s completed its revolution around the Sun: The angle would be: 365.25 / 686.98 * 360 = 191.4 d egrees! This is the exact angle between the three pyramids! The relative distance between the planets was also taken into account when the pyramids were situated on the Giza Plateau. The distance in a straight line between P1 and P3 i s 36857 inches. The distance in a straight line between P1 and P2 i s 19169 inches. The exact ratio between the two distances is P1-P3 / P1-P2 = 36857 / 19169 = 1.92 Now measuring the corresponding distances between t he planets is not such a simple fact. The distance between the planets is no t constant, due to the elliptical orbits of the planets around the Sun. Johannes Kepl er discovered the elliptical orbit of the planets four hundred years ago but the ancients that constructed the Great Pyramid must have known about it too. They cleverly used the distance between the Earth a nd Mercury when Mercury is farthest away from the Sun. In this case the distan ce between Earth and Mercury is 79.76 x 10 ⁹ m. The distance between Earth and Venus is 41.39 x 10 ⁹ m. The ratio now in distance between Mercury and the E arth and Earth and Venus is 79.76/41.39 = 1.92 This is the exact same ratio in distance between th e planets that has been used in the distances between the pyramids on the Giza plat eau! The accuracy is just stunning! There are other clues that indicate that the Great Pyramid corresponds with the Earth. The length of the Earth’s solar year is perf ectly reflected in the construction of the Great Pyramid in two ways! The first reference to the solar year is reflected in the length of the base of the Great Pyramid that is exactly"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 121 36,524.22 Primitive Inches in length or 365.2422 sa cred Egyptian cubits in length! The second reference to the length of the Earth’s s olar year is found inside the pyramid where we find a small room in between the K ing’s chamber and the Great Gallery called the Ante-chamber. When a circl e is drawn inside this room touching all the walls, the circumference of this c ircle is exactly: 356.25 inches, a perfect reference to the number of days in a year! The total length of a year is 356 days and 6 hours hence 356.25 days! The dimensi ons of the Ante-chamber must have been deliberately chosen to depict the nu mber of days in an Earthly year. ( \u0006 ) Initiation The Great Pyramid’s purpose may well be that of a b ig crystal harnessing the torsion waves of the Earth. It is situated at the e xact North Pole of the Earth grid where the most powerful torsion waves arise from th e Earth. According to Drunvalo Melchizedek, the Great Pyramid has been pla ced such that the apexes of the pyramids are exactly in the course of a Phi spiral. In fact all three pyramids are aligned to this Phi spiral: Pyramids and the Sphinx perfectly aligned to a Phi spiral We now have reasons to believe that a primary functi on of the pyramids could have been to stabilize the Earth grid and protect t he Earth from earthquakes, volcanic activity and maybe poles shifts. If the Great Pyramid was used to harness the torsio n waves of the Earth, we should not forget that the torsion wave energy is a lso conscious energy. From sources such as Edgar Cayce, David Wilcock and Drunva lo Melchizedek the story goes that the Egyptians used the Great Pyramid as a n instrument for spiritual initiation, healing and awakening. Prior to the final initiation in the Great Pyramid, initiates went through the secret teachings of the right eye of Horus and learned abo ut sacred geometry and as I have come to believe also about the ether physics o f creation. The Egyptians believed that creation all arose from the primeval waters, the Nun (ether). Paragraph 1146 of the Pyramid Texts relates the sto ry of a primeval cosmic serpent Iru-To who emerged from the primeval waters to create the physical world. These are Iru-To’s words from the Pyramid Te xts: "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 122 I am the outflow of the Primeval Flood, he who emer ged from the waters. I am the ‘Provider of Attributes’ serpent with its many coils. I am the Scribe of the Divine Book which says what has been and affects wh at is yet to be. What I believe is being described here is a combinat ion of the ether physics of both Paul La Violette and Daniel Winter. The torsion wave (Phi spiral serpent Iru- To) spontaneously emerges from the ether (primeval waters) to create form (‘the attributes’) out of the formless ether. The torsion wave is the Scribe of the ancient Akashic records, the equivalent of Ervin La slo’s A-field, the torsion wave information field that permeates all of space. (See chapter 6 ‘Ether Vibrations’) Another interesting fact is that the serpent Iru-To is depicted with two heads. This could symbolise the fact that the torsion wave can be created from two opposite electromagnetic waves as has been suggested by Tom Bearden. Metaphorically the two-headed snake could also symbolise the duali ty that came into existence from the Oneness when Iru-To emerged from the prime val waters. When the first forms where created from the Oneness of the ether, the wholeness of creation was separated. In spell 321 of the Coffin Texts, the cosmic serpen t Iru-To continues: I extended everywhere, in accordance with what was to come into existence, I bent right around myself. I was encircled in my coi ls; one who made a place for himself in the midst of his coils. If this isn’t a perfect description of a static tor sion field, the doughnut torus explained by Daniel Winter then what else is? The f act that the serpent made a place for himself in the centre could indicate that this form is also the focal point of awareness, the place where consciousness dwells. The serpent also plays an important role in the anc ient Egyptian caduceus symbol; the winged staff with two serpents twined i n seven turns around it. It was the symbol carried by Toth or Hermes Trismegist us. According to Edgar Cayce and other sources, Toth was the builder of th e Great Pyramid. The caduceus is a beautiful example of the spiralling-i n of the torsion wave in a vortex shape. The caduceus So finally the Egyptians that had passed through th e schools of the right eye and left eye of Horus got their initiation into higher truths inside the Great Pyramid. They were placed inside the sarcophagus, the big co ffer inside the King’s chamber. The coffer was placed in the focal point o f the pyramid (pyr amid = fire"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 123 in the middle!) such that the strong torsion wave e nergy changed the conscious state of the graduate undergoing the initiation pro cess. The former mentioned sources reveal that the Egyptians could create self -induced out of body experiences in this way. An out of body experience is an experience whereby the individual’s consciousness is no longer bound by th e physical body but is free to travel any place it likes even inter-dimensionally. Many people have experienced a near death experience (NDE) a temporary form of ou ter body experience (OBE) while on the operating table. Although many patient s have reported such experiences the whole subject is still a taboo in o ur civilized Western society! If the initiation was successful the graduate was a wakened and returned with Christ-like abilities to heal and perform wonders. According to the Edgar Cayce’s readings Jesus is the reincarnation in a later era of the builder of the Great Pyramid, Hermes Trismegistus, the Thrice Greatest, also known as Toth the Atlantean. Toth got the help from an Egyptian pries t by the name Ra-Ta who later reincarnated as Edgar Cayce himself! Hermes, the Th rice Greatest alias Toth and Jesus, meticulously designed a device for his futur e awakening as the historical Jesus of Nazareth who by his initiation in the Grea t Pyramid awakened to the Christ consciousness according to Cayce readings. T here are many biblical historians who now claim that Jesus indeed spent a long time in Egypt. Most people think that Jesus and the Christ are jus t synonyms. However the Christ is the perfect awakened man, he who has atta ined universal consciousness. Jesus of Nazareth is just one of man y prophets like the Buddha, Mohammed, Zoroaster, Chrisna and many others in his tory who had attained this state of consciousness. I believe that the essence of Jesus’s teaching is that Christ consciousness lies dormant in each and every one of us. A Bible in stone "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 124 Interior of the Great Pyramid In June 30, 1932 Edgar Cayce gave a reading about t he Great Pyramid. Here’s a quote from his reading on that day: All changes that came in the religious thought in t he word are shown there, in variations in which the passage through same is rea ched, from the base to the top or to the open tomb and the top. These are sign ified by both the layer and the color and in what direction the turn is made. What Edgar Cayce’s is saying here is that the Great Pyramid precisely encodes the history and future of religious turns that are taken in the world. In other words it is a giant Bible in stone. From the base t o the top of the pyramid the internal passages in the pyramid encode the rise an d fall of spiritual awareness by means of the turns in the passage (ascending or descending angle), the kind of rock that is being used and the rock’s color. Peter Lemusier discovered just exactly what Edgar C ayce had been describing in his reading on June 30, 1932. According to Lemusier, the Great Pyramid has been m eticulously designed to mark all historical events from the last 4000 years into our present time. Lemusier found that an inch in the passageway corre sponds to the length of a year. The Enoch circle in the Ante-Chamber was the perfect key for the translation of length (an inch) into time (a year). The start date was fixed by Lemusier and proven by means of two ‘Scored Lines’ that were marked in the descending passageway close to the entrance of the pyramid. Lemusier proved that these lines aligned o n the spring equinox with the Pleaides star cluster in 2141 BC. From this rare c onjunction the start date of the time line that the pyramid encodes could be determi ned to be the summer solstice of 2623 BC. The height of the space between the floor and the c eiling of the passageway is also an indication of the progress in spiritual awa reness. If the height increases it means progress, if it decreases it means decline. From the entrance of the Great Pyramid (BC 2623, re ign of Pharaoh Khufu) there is a descending passage all the way to a subterrane an chamber underneath the pyramid. Halfway the descending passageway we find an intersection with an ascending passage that leads to both the Queen’s an d King’s chamber. The intersection of the descending passage and the asce nding passage is the time in history that corresponds with the Exodus (1453 BC) of Moses and the Israelites out of Egypt. It was marked as a time of great spir itual progress. According to the Bible, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai and instructed him to worship only one God. In history this event marked the transition from polytheism to monotheism. At that time Moses’ peopl e lived in Egypt where they worshiped all the neters (Gods) of the Egyptians an d followed a polytheistic religion. Inside the Grand Gallery coming from the ascending passageway, all of a sudden the space between floor and ceiling rises immensely . The entrance to the Grand Gallery demarcates the Ascension of Jesus of Nazare th. (33 BC 1 st April). By the way the pyramid encodes Jesus birth date as exactly 27 th Sept 2 BC."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 125 At the end of the Grand Gallery there is an elevati on known as the Great Step. The Great Step puzzled Peter Lemusier and he didn’t know what to make of it. When Edgar Cayce was asked at the time what the Grea t Step signified he explained that it marks the period of 1958 to 1998 the 40 year period indicated by Edgar Cayce as the time of the many Earth change s that would take place (see the epilogue of this book). Edgar Cayce predicted his own return in 1998 as wel l! He didn’t say he would reincarnate in this year but he simply mentioned to be back by this year. We will later reveal that indeed he returned in this year. According to Edgar Cayce the King’s chamber symbolizes our present era. It is th e end of the timeline indicating the time of immense progress, a spiritual revolutio n, the time of a global Ascension. The King’s chamber may well be related t o the 2012 predictions, the end of the Mayan calendar and the time of great cha nge. What this book is trying to prove is that we live in an extraordinary time i n which science and spirituality are merging. What kind of an immense progress in sp iritual terms would that be? If the Great Pyramid is indeed a Bible in stone we may start to understand that our current spiritual advancement is reflected in t he Great Pyramid by the King’s chamber. The builders of the Great Pyramid may have left it as a gift to our current civilization to be decoded. Only by means o f our current scientific advancement do we now have the capacity to really f ully understand this mysterious pile of rocks that has puzzled mankind f or ages. Maybe the greatest mystery of all, if the pyramid h as a timeline that perfectly predicts the future, how were the builders of the p yramid able to see into the future? Did they use induced outer body travelling as a means of time travelling? ( \b ) King’s chamber and DNA Sonic experiments performed in the King’s chamber s howed that the King’s chamber has a series of acoustic resonance frequenc ies that correspond with perfect musical notes! The coffer inside the King’s chamber for instance has a perfect resonance frequency of 440 Hz, the ground n ote A, the frequency of a tuning fork. Four other resonance frequencies were found in the King’s chamber. These correspond with the musical notes F#, A, C# and D#. These notes are the notes of the F sharp major scale (F#). Indian Shamans tun ed their ceremonial flutes to F sharp because they believed that it is a frequenc y that is attuned to mother Earth. Now we may remember from the Cymatics studies that the Platonic solids emerge from the perfect sound frequencies of the diatonic musical scale. So it would be no surprise if pure tonal frequencies were found in the Earth grid frequencies. The amazing thing is that the resonance frequencies of the King’s chamber correspond with the resonance frequencies that were found in the 4 bases of the DNA molecule. DNA is a spiralling helix of three bil lion base pairs. This amazing structure only has 4 basic building blocks, the DNA bases adenine (A), cytonsine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Each base pair is a combination of 2 out of these 4 bases sequenced to a string of three billio n base pairs. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 126 Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry David W. Deam er of the University of California, Santa Cruz measured with infrared light the resonance frequencies of all the 4 bases of DNA. Each base resonated to an av erage of 15 frequencies, 60 frequencies in total. Next they used a technique th at is commonly used in music and transposed the higher octave frequencies of lig ht down to the octave of sound. (Remember from our chapter about sacred geom etry that the colors of the rainbow are the 7 keys in the diatonic scale transp osed to the 48 th octave) They fed the 60 transposed DNA frequencies into a Ya maha DX7 programmable synthesizer. The pitches were not perfect musical n otes, however after a few weeks of ‘tuning’ they found that the frequencies w ere centered around 4 pure musical notes. The notes that they found, you guess ed it, are the same resonance frequencies of the King’s chamber in the Great Pyramid! They even recorded DNA music played on the DX7 synth esizer on a CD titled ‘Sequencia’. People that listened to the CD reporte d feelings of connectedness and familiarity. Now this discovery lends much credit to the claims made by Edgar Cayce and others that the Great Pyramid was used for healing. It seems an unimaginable coincidence that the same resonance frequencies tha t were used in the King’s chamber correspond with the resonance frequencies o f the DNA bases. ( \t ) Recapitulation The more we know about the Great Pyramid, the more wondrous the seventh world wonder becomes. Egyptologist are still holdin g on to the idea that the Great Pyramid was built for no other reason than to serve as a burial chamber for Pharaoh Kuhfu, however this idea has become just lu dicrous. The pyramid is much older than claimed and must have been built by a culture far more superior than the Egyptians. Even today we simply don’t have the technology to build an edifice like the Great Pyramid. The reason why Egyp tologists cling on to their own archaic theories is that they have no other choice but to defend them. The vast majority of Egyptologist are Muslim and the Koran s imply states that the Earth is no older than 4000 years. So they simply don’t buy any theory that may date the Great Pyramid to a time frame before the establishe d date of construction 2589 B.C. The Great Pyramid and the Giza complex can be regar ded as a gift of an ancient culture to a future generation provided that they h ad developed to a scientific level of understanding such that it could unravel a ll its hidden secrets. As more evidence is accumulated it becomes more credible th at Edgar Cayce was right about the pyramid’s purpose for spiritual initiatio n and healing. Another purpose could be that is served as a balancing instrument f or the Earth’s energy grid. In the next chapter we will further delve into the mysteries of the human DNA. The builders of the Great Pyramid must have had a t horough understanding of the human DNA if they were able to attune the King’ s chamber to the DNA frequencies. Is it possible that something as simpl e as sound frequencies can be used for DNA healing? Let’s hear what Russian scienc e has to say about the subject today. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 127 Chapter 9 The mysterious DNA The DNA double helix as the template of all life fo rms has been around in science for some odd fifty years now since their discovery by Crick and Watson. Our knowledge about DNA since then has dramatically inc reased. DNA stores the chemical molecular instructions for cellular reprod uction. It is a blueprint for the reproduction of all the proteins that are found in the cells of an organism. The human body contains an estimated 70.000 to 90.000 d ifferent proteins. The DNA helix is a twisted double string. Each stri ng is made of around 3.1 billion nucleotides. The nucleotides are all linked togethe r to form this immense chain. There are only four different base nucleotides used in the chain. These bases are denoted by their initial character adenine (A), cyt onsine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). Three of these bases in a chain form a triplet or c odon. There are only 4³ = 64 different types of codons in the DNA chain. Each tr iplet or codon is the genetic equivalent for one amino acid, the building block o f a protein. One protein consists of some hundred amino acids, so it takes t he same number of codons to code one protein. The sequence of codons that encod es a single protein is called a gene. Nucleotides form base pair bridges between the two DNA strings. One of the nucleotides of a base pair is in one of the DNA str ings, the other in the opposite DNA string. In this way the base pairs form a bridge , a chemical bond between the two DNA strings tying them together in a twistin g staircase like double helix. Of the complete chain of triplets in a complete DNA string only 5% is used for the coding and reproduction of proteins. The other 95% is called junk or dormant DNA; it seems to be a senseless repetition of triple ts that western science simply doesn’t know what to do with it. For a very long ti me scientists believed that the 95% non-coding part of the DNA is completely redund ant. There is now strong evidence that the non-encoding DNA is not useless a fter all but in fact may be more important than the encoding codons. Revolution ary new discoveries revealed that the idea that the inherited genetic m ake up of an organism cannot be changed is wrong. It has been proven that the se quence of the DNA molecule’s codons can be reprogrammed! Human Genome project The most profound study ever performed on the 5% en coding triplets of the human DNA string was conducted in an international j oint effort called the International Human Genome Project. The task of the Human Genome Project was to identify the complete structure of the human DNA and map its triplets and genes. Since the human body contains at least 70.00 0 different proteins, it was expected to find at least some 100.0000 genes in th e human DNA, 70.000 to explain the physical reproduction of the human body (protein encoding genes) and some 30.000 different genes to explain the diff erences in personality and character. When the first draft version of the huma n genome was finished in 2001 and the final version in 2004, the high hopes and e xpectations of biologist in the world were shattered to pieces when only 30.000 gen es were found in the human DNA. Thirty thousand genes in the human genome is on ly three hundred more"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 128 that it takes to build a mouse. The Human Genome Pr oject also revealed that we share 98 percent of our genes with chimpanzees! All our assumptions about DNA as being the sacred bo ok of life containing all the text to write each chapter in biology now have to b e re-evaluated. The DNA differences between a human being and a primate tha t we evolved from are simply too small to account for the differences in appearance let alone the immense difference in conscious awareness and intel ligent abilities. On the DNA level we have more in common with dolphins than wit h apes. Junk DNA While western science invested in the International Human Genome Project focusing on the 5% of the encoding triplets of DNA, in the Soviet Union in 1990 a group of Russian scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences was formed to study the complete human genome. This research was led by Dr. Pjotr Garjajev, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well a s the Academy of Sciences in New York. The Russian research was taking a wide angle and held an open view in their studies. The research team included b io physicists, molecular biologist, embryologist and even linguistic experts . Their research revealed that the supposed junk DNA that has been completely negl ected and forgotten by western mainstream science, was no redundant leftov er of evolution at all. Linguistic studies revealed that the sequencing of the codons of the non-coding DNA follow the rules of some basic syntax. There is a definite structure and logic in the sequence of these triplets, like some biolog ical language. Studies further revealed that the codons actually form words and se ntences just like our ordinary human language follows grammar rules. Scientists have conducted many studies on the origi ns of human languages and the origins of the grammatical rules that are so es sential to all human languages; however they have always failed to find the source. But now for the first time in history the origins of language may be surprisingly attributed to DNA. The language of the genes is much, much older than any human language that was ever uttered on this globe. It even seems more like ly that the DNA grammar was taken as the blueprint for human speech. Whereas the western Human Genome Project deciphered the ‘machine language’ code of the DNA molecule, the structure of the DNA ‘b its’ formed by the sequence of nucleotides, Russian scholars discovered the hig h level language present in DNA. Another amazing fact that Garjajev’s group disc overed was that the DNA is by no means a closed book of life. He discovered th at the text of the DNA book could be altered. The codons of the DNA string can b e rearranged in different sequences. In other words the software of the human genome our DNA molecule can be reprogrammed! Studies revealed that the junk DNA seemed to be jumping DNA. Triplets of the DNA string were able to exchange places. Since the DNA was found to have a syntax and semanti cs akin to our human languages, it was proven that our currently restric ted perception that DNA only served for the coding of the reproduction of the pr oteins for the chemical make up of an organism, is only half of the story. When DNA in vitro test tubes were exposed to coherent laser light, the laser light spiralled along the DNA helix as if it was guided by the structure of the DNA molecule. The most amazing effect was noticed when the DNA itself was removed and the laser light kept spiralling! The vacuum of the space that was just previously occupied by the DNA had changed and somet hing caused the laser"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 129 light to keep spiralling. These effects have been m easured and remained for quite some time. The effect is now becoming well known as the DNA phantom effect. Vladimir Poponin and his team of Russian Academy of Sciences repeated the work of Garjajev at the Hearthmath Institute in the U.S. A. Poponin concluded again that a field structure was formed in the physical v acuum even when the original DNA was removed. We’ve seen similar examples of vacuu m changes before that could be attributed to torsion fields. ( \u0001 ) DNA programming The most astonishing experiments that were performe d by Garjajev’s group are the reprogramming of the DNA codon sequences using m odulated laser light. From their discovered grammatical syntax of the DNA language they were able to modulate coherent laser light and even radio waves and add semantics (meaning) to the carrier wave. In this way they were able to reprogram DNA in vivo (in living organisms) by using the correct resonant fre quencies of DNA. The most profound discovery made so far is that human lingui stic words can be modulated to the carrier wave with the same reprogramming eff ect. Now this is a baffling and stunning scientific discovery! Our own DNA can simply be reprogrammed by human speech, supposing that the words are modulate d on the correct carrier frequencies! Whereas western science uses complicated bio chemica l processes to cut and paste DNA triplets in the DNA molecule, Russian scie ntist use modulated laser light to do exactly the same thing. The Russians ha ve proven to be very successful in repairing damaged DNA material in viv o! Laser light therapies based on Gajajev’s findings a re already applied in some European academic hospitals with success on various sorts of skin cancer. The cancer is cured without any remaining scars. ( \u0002 ) Emotions Daniel Winter and his heart coherence team have foun d proof that human emotions can reprogram DNA as well. The sonic beati ngs of the heart in rhythm with our feelings, our emotions, are transformed in to electromagnetic energy in the body’s glands that act like piezoelectric coupl ers creating smaller electromagnetic counterpart wavelengths of the emot ional sounds of the heart. The emotion becomes energy in motion, e-motion, sen ding it right down to the DNA of every cell of our body as blue coherent laser light that is able to modulate the DNA codons just like the lasers of the Russians did. On close examination from the top view of the DNA it has a dodecahedron shape. There are ten Phi spirals required to create the do decahedral helical shape of the DNA spiral. The DNA molecule as a wave shape is attu ned to the heart and able to receive its sonic emotions. Daniel Winter explain s the implosion of long waves into short waves as the mechanism that conveys the emotions of the heart to our DNA. The scale (wavelength) is different but the rat io of the wavelengths is the same maintaining the Golden Mean ratio. Not only em otions feed our DNA with blue ultraviolet light, also cellular metabolism th e consumption of food is all about creating short wave blue light that feeds our DNA. Plants receive this light directly"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 130 from the Sun using chlorophyll in their leaves and use a process called photosynthesis to bind the photons of the Sun. Anim als consuming these plants get these bio photons indirectly from plants, the a ccumulation however has become less effective. This coherent light of the S un is stored as bio photons in the organism. The purpose of the metabolisms in bot h plants and animals is to create highly coherent ultraviolet laser light insi de our DNA that drives cell replication. Many studies have revealed that there is a clear re lation between our mental and emotional state and our health. People who suffer f rom depressions and negative emotions for long periods will eventually suffer da mage to their physical health as well. Have you noticed that the one who talks the m ost about a disease is the one who eventually gets it? Fear is a very negative emo tion that does not benefit health. Scientific studies have proven that no matt er how well babies are fed, when they lack the caressing and loving touch of th eir mothers they eventually die! The loving hugs of the mother are sent right d own to the DNA of the baby! Daniel Winter makes it abundantly clear that our emo tions program our DNA and shape the immune system of our cells, creating stro ng health. Negative emotions destroy the coherence of the immune system while po sitive emotions enhance it. According to Winter the healthiest thing to do is t o have as much bliss and ecstasy as possible in our lives since it is the he althiest emotion, which in the long run gives us longevity. Bio wave com puter The wave processing and modulating properties of DNA have revealed a total new purpose for the DNA molecule. For a long time we hav e believed that the only purpose for DNA was that it serves as the carrier o f genetic information for the reproduction of life. This now seems to be only hal f of the equation. Gajajev and others in a paper titled the ‘DNA wave Biocomputer’ postulates that DNA is no less than an intelligent biological comput er, it‘s an intelligent apparatus that is able to store and retrieve biological infor mation from all the cells of the body, connecting the chromosomes of all cells into a holistic continuum, a kind of biological internet inside the body. The DNA chromo somes acquire unlimited information from the metabolisms that occur in each and every cell and in turn produce regulative electromagnetic signals as a fee dback. All of the billions of cells that make up our body are in instantaneous co mmunication with each other. In quantum mechanical terms, they are non-locally c onnected. This allows for coordination of the countless complex biochemical e vents that take place inside our body to be regulated in a coherent way. Informa tion exchange in the body by means of the nervous system and the intercellular b iochemical molecular diffusions are processes that are way too slow to e xplain the instantaneous response our body is able to give to external stimu li, nor can it account for the stunning coherence with which all of our bodily fun ctions act in unison. Other proof that our body is a single super coheren t operating bio system comes from Cleve Backster. He has been able to prove that cells isolated from the human body still remain in communication with our b ody even if they are transported far away from the body. He used two lie detectors, one was connected to a volunteer, the other to cell samples that were taken from his mouth and stationed twelve kilometres away from thi s person. He was able to prove that changes in the emotional state of the pe rson being tested were reflected in both lie detectors simultaneously, the one attached to the person’s experiment is that all of our bodily cells are conn ected non-locally no matter how"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 131 far they are apart and that this connection remains even when cells are isolated from the body. ( \u0004 ) According to Gajajev, the genomic information of th e organism is also stored non- locally, this means that it is not restricted to th e DNA molecules itself. The DNA molecule merely acts as a storage device that is ab le to read and write the genomic information from a non-local distributed fi eld. DNA acts like a fractal environment that stores the coherent blue laser lig ht in a holographic way. This genomic hologram can be read using either electroma gnetic or acoustic fields. Now here’s a quote from the paper: DNA acts as a kind of aerial open to the reception of not only the internal influences and changes within the organism but to t hose outside it as well. Indeed we regard this as one of our primary finding s, which in view of quantum nonlocality of organisms extends not only to the or ganism's local environment, but also beyond it to the extent of the entire univ erse. Remember from chapter 3 ‘Science and consciousness’ , paragraph ‘morphic fields’ that biologist Rupert Sheldrake had already propose d the morphic field. Morphic genetic fields encode genetic information that is s hared by all members of a species. The DNA bio wave computer model proposed b y Gajajev and his group shed a whole new light not only on where and how th e genetic information is actually stored but also where it initially came fr om. If genetic information is actually stored in morphic fields in the fabric of space and time, we may also start to re-evaluate Darwin’s evolution theory. ( \u0005 ) Intelligent Design Darwinism has received a lot of criticism in the las t decade since although Darwinism has been around since 1859, it is still un able to answer many questions related to the evolution of the species. For one thing Darwinism is unable to explain is the explosion of sudden new li fe forms that appeared some 530 million years ago on this planet. The abundant new higher life forms that came into existence with a higher level of biologic al complexity than previous life forms, required all sorts of new proteins and corre sponding genes in a relatively very short time span. The explosion can hardly be e xplained by a spontaneous increase in the number of natural mutations of gene s. It is also hard to imagine how a complete new species develops from its predec essor, since it requires an abundant amount of coherent spontaneous mutations t aking place all at the same time to create all the new features of a new specie . It is also hard to conceive that nature was able to create such biological comp lex systems such as the eye by merely tinkering about a bit with the codons of the DNA molecule. All biological systems such as the organs, the immune s ystem and the senses are far too complex to have come into existence by mere cha nce alone. The problem with these complex biological systems is that they did not gradually develop over many ‘prototypes’; these prototypes are missing in the fossil records all together. Many new biological functions such as eyesight were spontaneous creative inventions in the evolutionary process. When more an d more fossils were found in the quest to find the missing links in the fossil r ecords, paradoxically more and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 132 more evidence was being collected that evolution to ok place in quantum leaps of species such as from invertebrates to vertebrates. The development of new species requires the involve ment of many new biological functions coherently at same time. For new species such as birds to emerge it is not enough to just develop fethers, it also require s lightweight bone and muscle structures. If a mutant only developed fethers, the se mutants would not render a biological advantage and natural selection would ev entually eliminate the new life form. We humans supposedly stem from the apes, but e volutionists were never able to really prove these assumptions. Mathematician Fred Hoyle came up with a beautiful a nd credible analogy to proof that evolution can hardly be considered a lucky rou lette game. He used the analogy of the three dimensional puzzle called the Rubik cube. Each face of the Rubik cube is constructed from a matrix of 9 smalle r cubes per face. Each of the three layers in the face of the Rubik cube can be p ivoted around both a vertical and a horizontal axis. When the puzzle is solved, a ll the Rubik cube’s faces will have the same colour. Suppose we give a Rubik cube to a blind man and ask him to solve the puzzle. Hoyle calculated that the blind man requires an exp ected 5 x 10¹ ⁸ turns to solve the puzzle. Suppose he makes one turn per second th en it will take him 5 x 10¹ ⁸ seconds = 126 billion years to complete the puzzle by chance. This is longer than the age of our universe! Now suppose we help the bl ind man by advising him on a yes or no for each turn he is attempting, then the puzzle can be solved in only 120 turns requiring 2 minutes to solve the puzzle. To solve the Rubik cube we only need to align 9 * 6 = 54 smaller cubes, however to solve the puzzle of life, it requires 3.1 billio n nucleotides to be perfectly aligned in the DNA strings! Now do we still believe that evolution was the work of a blind man? Cambridge University Professor of evolutionary biol ogy Simon Conway Morris believes that there must be a divine cause for our evolution. His unorthodox view of a divine cause is not very popular among his col leagues. Although he does not believe that man is the splendid accident of evolut ion, he makes it crystal clear that he doesn’t adhere to the vision of creationist s whose only truth it is that God created the world in seven days. He brings up some new and very interesting arguments. According to Morris evolution has come u p with the same solution to problems many times. For instance the camera like s olution of the eye has been ‘invented’ at least 6 times by completely different species that did not pass this solution on by means of exchanging genes. Simon Con way Morris shows that there are abundant examples in nature of identical convergences of biological functions, identical solutions that emerged complet ely independently within different species. He says that environmental facto rs such as oxygen, water sunlight and gravity probably narrow the possible s olutions down to only a few restricted solutions. So if there is convergence in the development of biological functions, it means these convergences were no coin cidence. ( \u0006 ) Another difficult question for Darwinists to explai n is the sudden leap in intelligence and consciousness that occurred to the Neanderthals some 35.000 years ago. From hunting, cave living Neanderthals t hey made this enormous cultural and intelligent progress. By tool making, farming and animal keeping,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 133 mankind for the first time in evolution made life a lot more comfortable, now that chasing animals in the wild was no longer the only option. One of the most important pillars of Darwinism is th at gene mutations take place irrespective of external changes in the environment . The reason why the adapted species survives the changes in the environment is because they are ‘coincidentally’ better equipped to survive. Natura l selection takes care that these better-equipped mutants will survive; this selectio n process is called the survival of the fittest. Dr. Bruce Lipton however disagrees with this axiom o f Darwinism completely and says that cells themselves have the ability to perf ectly rewrite their own DNA when the external environment demands it. Harvard g eneticist John Kearns delivered proof for Dr Lipton’s hypothesis in 1988. He placed bacteria that could not digest milk sugar (lactose) in an environment t hat only contained lactose, so it was their only possible source for food. Instead of dying off these bacteria were able to reprogram their DNA such that they were abl e to survive and feed on the lactose. So here’s another source claiming that DNA reprogramming is possible! ( \u0007 ) The last thing in Darwin’s theory that may become ex tinct is most likely Darwinism itself, the scientific criticism is growin g and alternative evolution theories are emerging. The most radical opponents t o Darwinism are the creationists who simply believe in the literal text of Genesis in the Bible and fiercely debate that it was God who created Adam an d Eve and all other life on Earth some eight thousands years ago. Of course thi s simplistic rather fundamentalist blind belief in the Bible cannot be taken serious as the fossil records contradict it altogether. In 1995 however a new more serious evolution theory emerged the ‘Íntelligent Design’ theory. The founder of the Intelligent Desig n theory is Michael Behe who launched his evolution theory in a publication titl ed ‘Darwin’s Black Box’. The Intelligent Design theory states that life on Earth is the result of an intelligent design instead of by an unguided process of trial a nd error. The Intelligent Design theory adherents, unlike the creationists, acknowle dge that life on Earth developed in both stages of gradual progress of sma ll adaptive changes followed by spurts of evolutional leaps that can only be exp lained as the result of and intelligent design. Quantum physicist Amit Goswami is his book ‘The vis ionary window’ believes that the quantum leaps in the development of species may be explained by quantum science. A number of quantum scientists have create d the foundation for what they call quantum evolution. The basic idea of quantum evolution is that gene mu tations take place in the quantum state and not in the classical state of New tonian physics. Quantum super positions of gene mutations do not manifest i mmediately in the phenotype of the organisms but accumulate in the gene pool of the species over millions of years. Goswami mentions that morphic genetic fields could be the storage space for these quantum mutations that take place within the species. Quantum mutations allow for an endless number of po ssible gene combinations taking place at the same time. Only changes in the genome of a new life form that makes biologically more sense eventually colla pse from the quantum state to the classical state. He mentions that consciousness must be involved to trigger the collapse of the quantum state before the new sp ecie emerges."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 134 Quantum evolution could explain why transitional li fe forms were never found in the fossil records, since the transitional life for ms only virtually existed in the quantum realm and came into existence in quantum le aps. After new species have come into existence, nature uses the natural s election process to select those genes that are available in the gene pool of the new specie that best fits the environment. However these adaptive changes of the specie to new environmental situations have always been available in the collective gene pool. So quantum evolution embraces Darwinism in the sense that it believes that the natural selection mechanism is a pressure that allo ws for species to adapt in the metastasis period in between quantum leaps of new s pecies. Unlike Darwinism believing that there is no purpose i n evolution, Goswami’s theory states that there is a discernable direction in evolution from simple to more complex life forms. He believes that the consc iousness choice for the collapse of the quantum potential of genes to creat e new species is in accord with a greater plan. A fundamental question indeed is why did life on Ea rth develop from primitive single unconscious cellular life to complex human b eings that eventually became self-aware? What could be the purpose of self-awaren ess if evolution is only about Darwin’s survival strategies of selfish genes? ( \b ) The new discoveries outlined in this book of an int elligent all pervasive cosmic energy that is omnipresent in the universe and that also serves as a recording medium for information such that it can act as the storage device for morphic genetic fields of DNA preserving the genetic informa tion of species, seems to contradict Darwinism and lends credit for the Intell igent Design and quantum evolution theories. Also the physics of chaos theory seems to support t he Intelligent Design theory of Michael Behe. The fractal attractors of chaos theor y raise the philosophical question if there is purpose in the universe. Are w e pulled towards a final goal? Is evolution a pulling process towards a finite end po int somewhere in the future or are random mutations by chance in Darwinism still pu shing us? Chaos theory seems to favor the first option. Recapitulation DNA’s purpose is not to serve solely as a chemical m emory device for the reproduction of proteins. Russian research has reve aled that we underestimated the intelligence of DNA as it acts like a bio compu ter and is able to store and process biological information of the metabolisms t hat take place in our body as well as genetic information. Most astonishing, the codon sequences of DNA can be reprogrammed by coherent frequency sources such as modulated laser light, radio waves and human emotions. We have just starte d to discover the gateway functions of DNA to information fields, the bridge to what Rupert Sheldrake called the morphic genetic fields of life. Morphic genetic fields may be the true driving force behind biological evolution as opposed to the random mutations of the genes by chance and the natural selection process t hat was proposed by Darwin. These new discoveries show how little we still actu ally know about DNA. Notwithstanding the fact that we apparently still h ave a very limited knowledge of DNA in the West that is accepted by mainstream scienc e, we nevertheless took"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 135 the liberty to start playing around and modify the genome of crops and organisms as we please. These enterprises could be very hazar dous to the biosphere and the very survival of life on Earth since restructuring of the DNA molecule destroys the wave characteristics of the DNA that took nature mil lions of years to perfect. Until we can speak the language of DNA, we should not seek to rewrite the book of life; I think we have been led astray and are on a dangerous road."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 136 Chapter 10 Spiralling evolution Darwinism has become a dogma, a kind of religion all by itself and is still today fiercely defended. The reason why is quite understa ndable from a scientific point of view. The axioms of science itself are at stake. Adherents of Darwinism defend it so fiercely because they are afraid that science will eventually lose its very foundations if it can be proven that indeed evolution is not random at all and that purpose and direction must be accepted as a reality. The door to a possible Divine force in nature would be opened again that was shut closed hundreds of years ago. It was French ma thematician Simon Laplace who finally closed it after Descartes. He replied t o Napoleon, who had questioned whim why he had left out God in his books as the ca usal force for the movement of the Heavenly bodies, saying that he no longer ne eded the hypotheses of God. Science is firmly rooted on the premise that all re ality can be explained by reductionism and determinism, casting aside all div ine causes to the domain of religion. So the real issue that is being debated i s not a scientific issue it’s a spiritual issue: should science admit God, when he’ s knocking on the door! Universal balance In his last book the ‘Cosmic vision’, Ervin Laszlo brings an interesting point into the discussion. While Neo Darwinists like Richard Daw kins and Intelligent Design advocates fight over the legitimacy of Darwinism, La szlo points out that the discussion is narrowed down to biological evolution only; he says we should look further and include the evolution of the universe a s a whole in the debate. According to Laszlo, the real question is how did t he universe evolve to a state such that biological evolution could take place at all? Our universe evolved from plasma into elementary pa rticles, atoms, molecules, planets stars and galaxies that eventually created the conditions on Earth that were just perfectly fit to quicken lifeless matter into life. The real miracle of evolution is that the universe’s physical constants and laws are coherently fine tuned such as to allow for the universe to evolve a nd bear life forms as we know it today. If the perfect coherence of all these phy sical laws and constants were only slightly different, there would be no universe as we know it today nor could there be life on Earth. If the expansion rate of th e universe had been only a billionth less the universe would have collapsed so on after the Big Bang. However had it been a billionth more, the universe would ha ve evaporated into cold gasses. If electromagnetism and gravity were not c oherently tuned there would be no hot stars and no planets for life to evolve o n. If electrons and protons did not have exact opposite charges there would be no a toms and no DNA. All physical constants seem to be miraculously balanced . If any of these constant were just slightly off, you wouldn’t be reading the se words. And yet here we are! There must be a plan behind ev olution of the universe and life, the chances of the universe coming into its o wn being as it is today is utterly inconceivable without an intelligent guidance. Erwin Laszlo has developed over the last 40 years a n integral system theory. The theory started off from the work of naturalistic ph ilosopher Alfred North Whitehead who developed a metaphysical work called o rganic metaphysics. He"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 137 deduced that our reality is composed of undividable interwoven organic entities. Living organisms are just one of the many ways natu re has found for itself to express these organic entities. Life in the cosmos evolves as a whole, a network of seemingly separate entities but which mutually a ffect each other. Whitehead concluded that reality is a process, an integral ev olutional process. Laszlo took Whitehead’s metaphysical framework as a basis for hi s integral system theory that explains how the evolution of our universe tak es place as an integral process of individual but not separated systems. The physic s of torsion waves weaving the A-field is the physical foundation underpinning his evolutionary system theory. ( \u0001 ) There is another way to explain that creation canno t be the result of a lucky coincidence. One of the most intriguing laws in nat ure is the second law of Thermodynamics that states that the universe and al l known processes within it whether it be physical chemical, or biological proc esses all strive to a lowest possible state of energy and order. In physical ter ms, we say that systems in nature strive to a higher degree of entropy (disord er). Astrophysics tells us that eventually over billions of years the universe as a whole will decay into the primordial state of chaos once again. The second la w of Thermodynamics states in plain language that eventually every ordered sys tem will return to a chaotic system. We see this principle manifested in our wor ld everyday. If we don’t put enough energy into conserving the things that we cr eated, eventually everything will break down. So evidently we experience that ‘d ying’ is a natural thing that is all around us on a daily basis, whether it is your car breaking down, your house that requires new paint or the cat that just died. Nothing is eternal and everything is subjected to entropy unless we put ou r effort and energy into it to keep it alive! However if we look with different eyes into the sam e world we see life manifested everywhere as well, a very high degree of order. Ev erything that we see around us has been created out of a primordial state of pu re chaos, the early universe seconds after the Big Bang. Science states that whe n order is achieved in a system, disorder must be created elsewhere since th e second law of Thermodynamics does not allow order to increase. However creation itself seems to be abundant proof that the total order in the universe from its early conception did increase and hence that negentropy must exist as well (negative entropy). The life force wi thin every living plant animal and human being on this planet is a force that cons tantly counteracts the effects of entropy. So besides the second law of Thermodynamics that te ars everything down, there must be a creative force in nature as well that cre ated order out of chaos just like that. Cycles in time Scientists in the last century discovered many cycl es in many natural phenomena such as biology, nature, stock market prices, popul ation growth, economy, etc. that are somehow linked to planetary movements and the activity of the Sun. The amazing thing about these completely independent an d separate phenomena is that they act in coherence. They are harmonically c onnected as if some unseen force connects them by means of resonance. Currentl y science is not able to"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 138 explain these coherences, since how are we to expla in resonance between completely different separate and independent pheno mena if there is no known energetic effect or force that connects them. Only an omnipresent energy field such as the ether may eventually explain how indepe ndent phenomena such as the Sunspot cycle and economical cycles are interco nnected by means of resonance. Scientist Ray Tomas has developed a theory called t he ‘Harmonics of the Universe’. For many years Ray Tomas had been working for customers developing economic models to forecast developments in stock m arket prices of all sorts of commodity. Eventually he discovered cyclic behaviou r in these stock market prices that were harmonics of the planetary periods . He also found musical ratios in the harmonics involving fractions of 3/2, 4/3 an d 2 and proportions of 4:5:6:8 that formed major cords in the musical scale. His t heory now suggests that many cyclic events occurring in nature such as biologica l, physical, and economical cycles have harmonics that are interrelated much li ke the notes in music. Ray Tomas has found that many economic cycles are pure harmonics of the Sun’s rotation, its solar rotation period at the equator of 25.8 days and of the Sunspot cycle of 11.07 years. The Sunspot cycle is the cycl e in the Sun’s activity that decreases and increases in cycles to culminate to a solar maximum every 11.07 years. Ray Tomas believes that the cycles that we f ind in our Solar System are harmonics of even larger cycles that occur in the M ilky Way, our galaxy. All galactic cycles eventually are believed to be harmo nics of a single universal cosmic cycle. Vedic tradition has always explained that the universe is the result of one primordial resonating vibration, the Ohm sou nd of creation. In a sense we could say that our universe is one big song, it’s a uni-verse (one song). ( \u0002 ) Ray Tomas found a very harmonic ratio 34560 that mi raculously seems to be the ratio that by scale connects everything in the univ erse from the quantum realm to the universe at large. For instance if we were t o take the average distance between moons and multiply it by 34560 we get the a verage distance between planets. If again we multiply this value by 34560 w e get the average distance between stars etc. The ratio 34560 seems to scale a ll of the following spherical objects from small to large: nucleons, atoms, cells , moons, planets, stars, galaxies, universe. Daniel Winter who learned about the miraculous ratio of Ray Tomas discovered that if we compress the speed of light by a factor of 34560 we get the speed of sound. If we compress the speed of sound by a facto r of 34560 we get the speed of heat. The number 34560 according to Ray Tomas is the seed number for many cycles in the universe. Another astonishing fact is that a Sumerian clay ta blet named after its finding place Nineveh has been found that contains a cosmol ogical constant with a value of 70 * 60^7 (seventy times sixty raised to the pow er of seven). The Nineveh constant, after being decoded by NASA a strophysicist Maurice Chatelain, perfectly described all the orbital time s of our planets down to a second if whole fractions of this number are taken. For example Pluto has a perfect 25000 cycles in the Nineveh constant and Ha lley’s Comet has 81.000 cycles. Since the Nineveh constant’s measure is the second, it equates to a cycle time of roughly 6.2 million years. Starting from th e Nineveh constant, researcher David Wilcock discovered a galactic constant that he named the Wilcock constant"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 139 that equals 0.7 * 60^9. This constant is exactly 36 times the Nineveh constant and according to Wilcock will harmonically connect all orbits of all objects in our galaxy. ( \u0004 ) Since we learned in chapter 6 ‘Ether Vibrations’ th at scientists discovered that our universe is constructed from an all-pervasive vibra ting energy, we are not surprised to find resonance in the universe between many seemingly independent cycles of independent phenomena. Eastern Vedic trad ition has always suggested that our evolution takes place in four Yugas or Worl d Ages. According to Eastern traditions, the cosmos develops in cycles of dawn ( sandhya) followed by cycles of dusk (sandhyansha). Each of these periods of dawn a nd dusk is one tenth of the Yuga and there are four Yugas in total, Krita, Tetr a, Dvapara and the Kali Yuga, our current Yuga that is presently ending. The four Yugas add up to the Great Cycle of cosmic evolution. Throughout human history there have been periods of dawn and periods of dusk within the current Kali Yuga. Eastern traditions te ll us that in periods of dawn there is a rise in consciousness awareness, whereas in times of the dusk, human consciousness falls asleep and loses its spiritual awareness and connection to its Divine source. At the end of the second millennium E astern traditions prophesised that humanity would finally be heading to a new per iod of dawn, the new Age coinciding with the Age of Aquarius. Auric Time Scale Could Eastern spirituality be right about the exist ence of cosmic cycles of evolution? There is now evidence to suggest that th e evolution of the universe indeed moves in cycles with a forward motion tracin g a spiral along its path. What this means is that events from the past are linked to events of the future like some form of resonance between these events is taki ng place. Russian scientist Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev who discov ered the torsion wave, the spiralling wave that moves through the ether, was t he first to suggest the relation between torsion waves and the phenomenon of time. H e called the torsion wave the wave of time. Independently Tom Bearden also su ggested that a relation between scalar waves (torsion waves) and the tick o f time exists. Could it be that evolution is not random at all but is occurring in recurring events that add more complexity to the development of the universe and life on Earth at each turn of the spiral? The prevailing idea of Dar winism rules out any possibility that some energetic force could guide evolution. Ev olution is simply a completely random and unbiased process according to Darwinism. However there is now evidence that this may not be the case. The coherence that scientist started to discover be tween many unrelated phenomena in biology, nature, economy and history n ow seems to indicate that these events are linked and somehow resonate. This is exactly what Dr. S.V. Smelyakov and Y. Karp enko are suggesting and say they can prove. Professor Sergey Smelyakov is ISAR’ s international vice president and member of the Golden Fund of Cyclic Science in Russia. Yuri Karpenko is member of the Astrological Research Society ‘Hambur g School’ and Astrovita."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 140 Together they published a remarkable scientific pap er in 1999 called ‘The Auric Time Scale and the Mayan factor’. In the paper they suggest that planetary revolution s, the 11 year solar cycle, trends in demography, the epochs of the coming of G reat Teachers for humanity, geological, economical and other cycles in nature a nd society are all interconnected and synchronized by the Golden mean number, Phi (Ф) and the Fibonacci series! Even more remarkable Smelyakov and Karpenko claim t hat all of these cycles are related and synchronized with the Mayan Long Count Calendar the mystical calendar that ends on the 21st of December 2012. Th ere is general consensus that the start date of the Mayan Calendar is the 11 th August 3114 BC and that the end date is on the 21st of December 2012, covering a time span of 5125 years. We now know that the ancient Mayas new the duration of the average solar year with a precision of several digits behind the decim al. Their calendar for Venus was accurate to within only 2 hours per 500 years! As a mazing as these accuracies may be, the most mystifying of their knowledge is n o doubt their Mayan Long Count calendar. The Mayas associated the expiring o f the Mayan Long Count calendar with the end of time. I stress to say that the Mayans did not mention that it would be the end of the world! To prove their hypotheses, Smelyakov and Karpenko f irst of all established scientific proof that the Solar System, planetary e volutions, solar rotation and the average solar activity period of 11.07 years are ha rmonically related. Resonance takes place in two domains, the harmonic linear dom ain and the exponential non- linear domain. Linear resonance is the resonance th at takes place if resonating cycles are whole fractions of the source cycle. Ray Tomas and others had already discovered these harmonic linear cycles of the plan etary revolutions. Also the Nineveh constant accounts for a linear harmonic res onance since it is the seed cycle number for planetary linear harmonics. If who le fractions of this number are taken, the revolutions of the planets of our Solar System can be calculated with a precision of a second. However Smelyakow and Karpenko also discovered the non-linear resonance that occurs not only between the planetary revolutions b ut also with the solar activity cycle, the solar rotation cycle and the Asteroid be lt revolution cycle. Now these exponential increasing or decreasing resonance freq uencies are most remarkably the Golden Mean fractions of the source frequency. The resonance frequencies can therefore be described by the following series that was given the name the Auric Time Scale series denoted by the following di screte set of time periods: F = {...Ф -2 , Ф -1 , Ф 0 =1, Ф 1 , Ф 2 , ...} Now we may recognize this series as the Golden Mean version of the Fibonacci sequence. It is the same sequence that by means of wave implosion in the Implosion Physics of Daniel Winter is responsible fo r the creation of gravity, conscious awareness and the recursive nesting by Go lden Mean ratio of the Platonic wave shapes that create matter. By means of the same principle Smelyakow and Karpen ko now state that evolutionary time (not physical time) itself is imp loding by a Golden Mean ratio. Evolution is supposedly occurring in decreasing cyc les of time, each successive cycle being a Golden Mean fraction shorter than the previous one. If this is indeed the case then evolutionary time itself should be im ploding and exponentially culminate to a crescendo, an end time. What we shou ld expect at this end time is open to speculation; it could be a transformation, a quantum leap in our evolution"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 141 process, who knows? The end time of the Auric Time scale supposedly coincides with the predicted end time of the Mayan calendar. The speed of our evolution is no doubt increasing r apidly. For millions of years we have walked the face of this Earth dressed in anima l hides with spears in our hands. Then 35.000 years ago we suddenly started to make more use of our brains and transformed from hunters into farmers an d toolmakers. In the last millennium and in the last century in particular ou r evolution has speeded up tremendously. It has been only a hundred years ago that we discovered electricity and the electromagnetic field and see h ow it has revolutionized our world in such a short time compared to the total ti me span of humanity’s evolution. In the first half of the last century we industrialized our globe; the second half could be characterized by an informatio n revolution. Today computers are running our daily business in all areas of our society. The birth of a worldwide web, the Internet as a globally shared encyclopaedi a of all conceivable intellectual and scientific knowledge ever collected by humanity , took less than 10 years. In the new millennium we’re anticipating nanotechnolog y and quantum computing to revolutionize our world. The speed of our technolog ical and scientific development has become unimaginably fast. Society cannot catch up with this speed and the purpose of this book is to demonstrate that the phi losophical interpretations of humanity’s major scientific achievements are dramat ically lagging behind since, for the masses, our prevailing outdated Newtonian-C artesian worldview hasn’t changed a bit in the last century. So it is more th an evident that our evolution, in terms of scientific and technological achievements, is developing faster in ever- shorter cycles. Therefore it seems like: (the amount of new knowledge) × (time of obtaining this knowledge) = constant. But is there proof for the hypotheses that our evol ution takes place in decreasing cycles by means of the Golden Mean? According to Sm elyakow and Karpenko humanity’s evolution is spiralling into a bifurcati on point that coincides with the end of the Mayan Calendar. To prove their hypotheses, first of all the harmoni c relations between the orbits of the planets, the solar activity cycle, the solar ro tation cycle and the revolution of the Asteroid Belt were mathematically structured in a model called the Solar- planetary synchronism (SPS). In this model the long er revolution cycles of Jupiter, Uranus and a hypothetical planet Proserpin e were taken. The planet Proserpine is a hypothetical planet. The planetary period of planet Proserpine is the minimal period for which all other periods are harmonics. Within an accuracy of 0.1% all planetary revolutions of the Solar Syst em, revolution of the Asteroid Belt, the solar activity cycle and the solar rotati on cycle could be proven to resonate with Jupiter, Uranus and the hypothetical planet Proserpine. The calculated revolution cycle time for the hypothetic al planet Proserpine is 510.9 years, this hypothetical planet seems to be balanci ng point in the resonance. Next in the SPS model the Auric Time Scale harmonic s were tested and for 9 of the considered periods the periods fell well within the specified accuracy. The Auric Time Scale can be centred on any cycle period . For instance if we take the Earth year as the centre cycle of Ф 0 =1 year than the solar activity cycle is Ф ⁵ = 11.089 which is within the defined accuracy close t o the established value of 11.07 years. In other words, the solar activity cyc le is the fifth Phi harmonic of the Earth year. The Auric Time Scale hypothesis’ most interesting a spect is when this time scale is superimposed upon the Mayan Long Count Calendar. This calendar started on"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 142 the 11 th August 3114 BC and ends on the 21 st of December 2012. The Long Count calendar comprises 13 Baktuns of 144.000 Kins (days ) to a total length of 13 × 144 000 = 1 872 000 (days) = 5125.3661 ( years ). Smelyakov and Karpenko artificially divided the Lon g Count calendar in 12 intervals that decrease in length by means of the G olden Mean ratio, the Auric Time Scale series. The separation epochs of these 1 2 time intervals are: 3114 BC, 1146 BC, 71 AD, 823, 1287, 1547, 1752, 1861, 1929, 1 971, 1997, 2012. The epochs that were found quite perfectly seemed t o correlate with: – Clustering of global natural cataclysms such as s evere Earthquakes, volcanic activity, space phenomena such as supernov as. – The coming of great Teachers to this Earth as wel l as outstanding philosophers and scientists; we mention Buddha, Zor oaster, Pythgagoras, Plato, Lao-tzu, Confucius, Quetzalkoat l (Kukulcan) – Originating of calendar systems such as those of China, India, Iran, Babylon, Egypt, Maya. – Demographic trends in the population of China, as an indicator of world trends – Forming and interaction of worldwide religious/ph ilosophical systems and states The Auric Time Scale epochs were also extended befo re the start of the Mayan Calendar giving the years 11.449 BC and 6298 BC. Th ese are both interesting years since together with the start of the Mayan ca lendar 3114 BC they all represent the times of the last known geomagnetic i nversions of the Earth magnetic field, a pole shift where the north and so uth poles switch polarity. As we know 11.449 BC perfectly matches with the date give n by Edgar Cayce for the destruction of Atlantis by a worldwide catastrophe, floods and inundations as a result of the pole shift. It’s also the date of the sudden ending of the last ice age. The date 6296 BC corresponds with the epoch given b y Plato for the final destruction of Atlantis. The start of the Mayan Calendar, 3114BC coincides w ith the emergence of the ‘first’ civilizations on Earth, the Sumerian and Ba bylonian civilizations according to historians. Variations in strength of the geomagnetic field of the Earth seem to correspond with the Mayan Calendar. Since the time of Jesus Ch rist the Earth’s protective magnetic field has decreased in strength and is now at a bare minimum at the second millennium. The magnetic field is so weak th at the natural wobbles of the north-south magnetic axis of the Earth has become r ather instable in the last decades. Many scientists believe that these effects are pre-cursors of a coming new pole shift. The start and end date of the Mayan calendar correspond with the minimums in the geomagnetic field strengths, wherea s the maximum geomagnetic field strength centers around the time of Christ, hence corresponds with the Auric epoch 71 AD. The Mayas that left us their Long Count Calendar st ill mystify many all over the world. The Mayas mysteriously vanished from the fac e of the Earth leaving no traces in about 830 AD. What happened to the Mayas an d why their civilization abruptly ended as if they collectively ascended fro m this planet as was speculated in the famous book ‘The Celestine Prophecy’ by Jame s Redfield, remains a"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 143 mystery. The miraculous disappearance of the Mayas in 830 BC is more astonishing taking into account that it quite nicel y corresponds with the Auric date 823 BC. ( \u0005 ) Time wave zero Smelyakow and Karpenko are not alone in their reaso ning that evolution is spiralling in towards the end time of the Mayan Cal endar. Years before the end date of the Maya Calendar was finally established i n the nineties by Jose Arguelles, Terrence McKenna and his brother Denis d eveloped a Time Wave zero theory. The Time Wave zero theory explains that time is recursively imploding like a fractal to an end time that mysteriously is the exact same date as given for the Mayan Long Count Calendar, the 21 st of December 2012. It is important to notice that the brothers McKenna derived their Time Wave Zero end date long before Jose Arguelles established the end date of t he Mayan calendar. Terrence McKenna in a hallucination got a vision th at he should study the mathematical principles of the legendary and myster ious Chinese book of the I Ching. The I Ching, or the book of changes, is a bo ok used for many centuries as an oracle to predict the flow of changes. It consis ts of 64 hexagrams in a matrix of 8 by 8 that can be used to predict the change of yin and yang energy manifesting in the world. The book is said to predi ct the flow of changes in the universe. When there is too much yin energy it will be eventually compensated by yang energy and visa versa, like a rhythmic change constantly balancing between two extremes. In 1973, Researcher Martin Schonberge r claimed that the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching are somehow related to the 64 codons of human DNA. The brothers McKenna however believed that the I Ch ing worked because the yin and yang energies are real and create a time wave i n the universe that is responsible for all changes in evolution. Terrence McKenna deduced a mathematical fractal function from the I Ching’s lo gic. The fractal supposedly represents the changes in our world that take place in terms of novelties and habits. They matched their time wave function with the peaks and troughs of history and found by applying a best-fit approach t hat the time wave ends at the 21 st of December 2012. The peaks on the vertical axis of the time wave fun ction indicate a strong increase in novelties (time of great evolutionary a dvancement) as evolution proceeds along the horizontal axis. The frequency o f novelty increases as evolution proceeds. The time wave zero function seems to support the id ea that has been postulated by Smelyakov and Y. Karpenko that the amount of kno wledge obtained in our evolution rapidly increases to a maximum as we near the Mayan end date since the novelty rate of the time wave function converge s to a singularity. According to the time wave theory in the last 384 d ays there will be more transformations than in all of history before. Even tually in December 2012 the novelty wave implodes and novelty itself becomes in finite. What it could mean is only open to speculation. Maybe it is a time of a g reat transformation, a time of enlightenment? The brothers McKenna published their theory in the ‘Invisible Landscape’ that was published in 1975. It was only years later in 1987 that Jose Arguelles published"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 144 ‘The Mayan Factor’ after decoding the Mayan Long Co unt calendar and arrived at the very same end date. ( \u0006 ) Solstice galactic alignment What is so special about the date 21 st of December 2012? Does it have a cosmic meaning? The Mayan Long Count calendar duration of 5125 year s is a fifth of the time it takes for our Solar System to revolve around the ga lactic centre of the Milky Way, 25.625 years. There are other estimations going around for this revolution time such as 25.920 years that happens to be Plato’ s perfect harmonic number. Our galaxy the Milky Way is a flat spiral containin g billions of star systems such as our own Solar System. Just like our Earth revolv es around the Sun, our Solar System as a whole revolves around the centre of the Milky Way. The movement of the Earth around the Sun therefore is not a perf ect circle but a spiral since we also revolve around the galactic centre. The Earth’s rotation axis makes an angle with the e cliptic, the plane the Earth travels through around the Sun in one year’s time. While we also travel around the galactic centre, the Earth’s axis, the inclinat ion with the ecliptic slightly changes in a circular motion as we travel the 25.92 0 years it takes to complete the galactic Great Cycle. The variation in the incl ination of the Earth’s axis of rotation with the ecliptic over these long stretche s of time is called precession (of the equinoxes). Precession is the reason why stars in the heavens, for instance the pole star and the big dipper change position ov er the centuries. The Egyptians saw the pole star in a completely different area of the heavens than where we see it today. What causes precession is still unknown al though there are some theories. The effect may be related to the Galactic centre. If we divide the Earth’s precession cycle of 25.920 years into 4 we get the time of the 4 Yugas of the Vedic tradition. What happens on the 21 st December 2012 is that a very rare alignment will o ccur in the precession cycle of the Earth. Although the perfect date is hard to establish by scientists, somewhere around the ending of the M ayan calendar, the Earth, the Sun and what is called the dark rift in the galacti c center will perfectly align. This alignment is very unique in the precessional cycle. Since it presumably occurs at the dawning of the solstice Sun on the 21 st December 2012 it is also often called the winter solstice galactic alignment. The exact date for the alignment is very hard to de termine precisely since it is hard to determine what the exact location of the ga lactic center is. Scientist calculated that this alignment could already have o ccurred on the 10 th of May 1998. In Chapter One we mentioned that Edgar Cayce predicted that the time of the changes on Earth would take place between 1958 and 1998. So maybe the alignment has already taken place? According to John Major Jenkins author of the books ‘Maya Cosmogenesis 2012’ and ‘Galactic Alignment, The transformation of Cons ciousness according to Mayan, Egyptian and Vedic Traditions’, the Mayas ne w about the precession of the equinoxes and chose the end date to coincide wi th the winter solstice galactic alignment. As the title of his latest book suggests , the Mayas believed that it would be a time a great transformation in conscious ness. John Major Jenkins says"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 145 he has found proof that the phenomenon of precessio n must have been known in the past by the Mayan sky watchers. According to Je nkins, the alignments of the Mayan temple complex in Chitzen Itza, the pyramid o f Kukulcan and the Izapan complex were all built to aim at the precessional a lignment with the Galactic center around the year 2012! Jenkins also found pro of that many other ancient cultures such as the Egyptian and the Vedic traditi ons understood the phenomenon of precession. ( \u0007 ) Cosmic influence If it is true that some unseen force drives evoluti on within predefined cycles, why does it seem to relate to planetary movements and c osmic alignments? If the 2012 predictions are true and humanity supposedly w ill go through a transformation process of consciousness, what are t he mechanisms that trigger these events? David Wilcock explains us that the conscious ether e nergy of the vacuum is responsible for all the Earth changes that were pre dicted by Edgar Cayce. Planets and stars throw off abundant torsion waves as they revolve and constantly rewrite the fabric of the ether. As we travel on th is spaceship called Earth around the galactic center in a round trip of roughly 2600 0 years we enter different zones of ether densities. Wilcock’s claim are backed up b y Cambridge University Dr. Harold Aspen who mathematically proved that the eth er has varying levels of density that he calls ‘space domains’. In 2000, Russian biophysicist Dr. Simon E. Shnoll p ublished his 30 years life work in a famous Russian physics journal that proves tha t planetary motions create disturbances in the vacuum that affects both living and inanimate processes on Earth. He found that fluctuations in biological, ch emical and even radioactive decay of many materials occurs in cycles that corre spond with the celestial movements of our planets. Scnoll studied the noise data in the histograms of many phenomena and discovered that this noise was n ot random at all and that these fluctuations kept pace with the celestial orb its of our planets. The coherent noise in totally unrelated phenomena seemed to indi cate that there is a collective cause for all these fluctuations. It’s important to notice that mainstream western sc ience cannot explain how totally independent processes such as biological, c hemical and physical processes can be simultaneously reacting coherent to outside influences that correspond with the motion of our planets. If we accept that p hysical matter is not made out of hard marbles called atoms, but in reality are vo rtexes in the ether, the same medium that our torsion wave travels through, we ca n start to see and understand how torsion waves are able to affect man y things in our material reality. Torsion waves originating from our planets , the Sun and the cosmos affect biology and life on Earth. The Sun is by far the strongest torsion wave generator in our Solar System and all by itself has an immense influence. David Wilcock even believes that torsion waves may b e responsible for the spontaneous extinctions of existing life forms and speciation of new ones on Earth that took place many times in evolution, causing th ese quantum leaps in evolution and the missing links in the fossil recor ds. The torsion field maybe the true carrier of DNA information, the morphogenetic field proposed by Rupert Sheldrake. David Wilcock suggests that the DNA’s mor phogenetic field was already present in the vacuum even before the life forms that emerged from"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 146 them existed on Earth. He believes that the morphog enetic fields are the precursors of biological evolution. This raises the question whether the mass extinction of so many species that occurred in the last century can be attributed to humanity’s destructive exploitation of nature al one or if these extinctions may have been caused by changes in the ether density in our region of the galaxy as well. Since torsion wave energy is pure cosmic consciousn ess energy it also has an effect on our collective and individual consciousne ss and our spiritual development. The different ether density zones in o ur galaxy correspond with the different World Ages of the Vedic traditions. There are zones in our galaxy that call for spiritual darkness and zones that call for spiritual awakening. We are just leaving the Kali Yuga, the Age that engulfs us in t he darkness of materialism and loss of spiritual awareness. Our Solar System is no w entering a zone in our galaxy that signals the end of the Kali Yuga and th e start of the Age of Aquarius. Esoteric traditions have kept this cosmic knowledge alive for centuries but in the West we have just started to decipher its significan ce. ( \b ) But if our Solar System has entered a different zon e in the galaxy that is more energetically charged, are there any measurable eff ects that can substantiate this claim? Changes in the Solar System A little known fact to the public but well known to organizations such as the NASA is that the Earth is not the only planet in our Sol ar System that is experiencing global warming! The public at large presumes that g lobal warming is caused by industrial pollution and carbon dioxide exhaust. Bu t this cannot explain the global warming of Pluto our far distant planet that is dri fting even further away from the Sun. NASA however does not officially relate the gl obal warming of Earth to the global warming of other planets in the Solar System . Professor of Geology Dr. Alexey Dmitriev of the Sib erian Department of Russian Academy of Sciences has studied these phenomena and concluded that changes that are taking place in our Solar System are cause d by highly charged material now entering our Solar System in this region of the galaxy. Here’s a brief overview of the recent changes that have taking pla ce in our Solar System that Dr. Dmitriev is referring to: • Uranus and Neptune have endured polar shifts • A change in the intensity and brightness of Neptune by 40% • Doubling of the magnetic field of Jupiter • Brightness increase in Saturn • A growth of the dark spots on Pluto • Auroras on Saturn • Venus is showing reversals of areas of dark and lig ht and is becoming brighter overall • The moon is growing a sodium potassium atmosphere • 200% growth of the atmosphere of Mars that is getti ng thicker. • Dramatic climate changes on Mars such as the melting of the icecaps • An increase in the Sun’s solar activities (solar fl ares) • A growth of the heliosphere (magnetic field of the Sun) by a 1000%! All of the anomalies mentioned above occurred in th e last two decades alone!"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 147 The Sun’s heliopsphere is a magnetic field in the s hape of an egg that extends to the outer space of our Solar System. It is like a t eardrop, with the tail of this drop pointing in the opposite direction that our Solar S ystem is travelling. It is like the blazing trail of a comet. The leading edge of the h eliosphere is showing glowing plasma energy. This plasma energy in 1990 used to b e 4 to 40 astronomical units deep (an astronomical unit is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, 93 million miles). The heliosphere now has a layer of plasma e nergy that is a 100 astronomical units deep. That is an enormous increa se that cannot be easily explained by western science. NASA reports have also shown that there is a 400% i ncrease in speed of solar particles that are emitted by the Sun as they trave l through interplanetary space. The conductance of the interplanetary space has som ehow increased. (\t ) Researcher Michael Mandeville in 1998 proved that t he number of earthquakes has increased since 1973 with a staggering 400%; in 2000 he proved that volcanic activity between 1875 and 1993 has increas ed by almost 500%. Another independent researcher Will Hart who also i nvestigated the matter comes up with figures that show that there were 2119 eart hquakes reported in the 19 th century. However in the year 1970 alone, 4139 have been reported. Now that’s a tremendous increase. According to Hart’s investigat ions the largest earthquakes have occurred since 1960. After 1960 many dormant v olcanoes began coming to life, like Mount Popocatepetyl in Mexico that start ed erupting in 1990 after being dormant for centuries. He also registered the incre ase in tornados in the last few decades: • 1950s 4796 tornados • 1960s 6813 tornados • 1970s 8580 tornados • 1980s 8196 tornados • 1990s to date 10.000+ tornados Dr. Dmitriev in 1997 already showed that between 196 3 and 1993, the overall amount of natural disasters like hurricanes, typhoo ns and mud slides, tidal waves etc has increased by 410 percent. According to Dmitr iev the energetic transformations that are taking place in our Solar System changes the atmosphere’s outer layer the ionosphere and the mag netic field of the Earth. These energetic changes in our solar system are als o causing changes in the wether patterns on Earth. The United Nations International Strategy for Disas ter Reductions agency (UN- ISDR) released a report in September 17 th 2004 indicating that globally there has been an overall increase in natural and manmade cat astrophes. The number of victims of natural disasters tripled since 1990. A Swiss insurance company and the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disas ters at the University of Louvain in Belgium drew similar conclusions. And then we have the El Nino phenomenon that cannot be explained by global warming due to the Sun. Only massive heating of the ocean itself can only cause this affect. David Wilcock believes that the Earth’s core is warming due to a higher influx of ether energy and that the core’s h eating is causing the warming of the oceans. Dr. Dmitriev has proven that the temp erature changes in the oceans are directly related to the changes in the e arth’s magnetic field. So there"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 148 is a common cause for these changes that can be exp lained by the fluctuations in the ether. ( ) Dramatic changes are also happening to our Sun. The Sun’s activity seems to be increasing. Solar activity manifests in two phenome na, solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME). Sunspots are magnetic fields that extent from the surface of the sun, they are responsible for creating solar flares. Solar flares radiate enormous amounts of energy in the form of X-ray rad iation that reach Earth within eight minutes. The Sun has a sunspot cycle w ith an average of 11 years. At the end of this cycle the magnetic polarity of t he Sun reverses, it is a pole shift where the North Pole becomes the South Pole and vis a versa. Strangely enough the corona, a sphere of pure plasma extending some 2500 kilometres from the Sun’s surface is much hotter that the surface of th e Sun itself. Whereas the Sun’s surface has a temperate of 5700 degrees Celsius, th e corona can have temperatures up to two million degrees Celsius! How this is possible is a mystery to orthodox science, since we would expect that tem peratures drop when we move away from the Sun’s surface; instead temperatu res increase to astronomical heights! CME’s are explosions of plasma taking place in the corona. It takes one to three days before the CME’s charged particles reach Earth . Both solar flares and CME’s can cause damaging effects to our satellites and di sturb radio communications. In 1989 a powerful CME hit the Earth that disabled many satellites and the power grid of Hydro-Quebec in Canada cutting off electric ity supply to seven million people. However the all time solar activity record was set in the year 2003. On the 21 st October 2003 warnings went out about raised solar activity and on the 28 th the biggest sunspot ever was observed. Soon after the third strongest solar flare ever was fired. On the 4 th of November, the all time record was set, the greatest solar flare ever measured was followed by a CME that fortunately just missed Earth. The most alarming fact however is that the stronges t CME ever measured occurred two years after the last solar maximum of February 2001. So our Sun in definitely out of pace and behaving extraordinarily . The next solar maximum year happens to be in 2012! ( \u0001\u000b ) Solar flares of 4 th November 2003 (NASA) "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 149 Another impact on the Earth’s etheric stability was caused by the Venus transit of June 8 th 2004. This rare alignment of the Sun, the Earth an d Venus last happed on the 6 th December 1882. The day after the Venus transit the Ijen Volcano in Java became active to be followed by an eruption of the Byzymianny Volcano i n Russia on the 29 th of June. July was a very heavy month with in total eight eru ptions of volcanoes around the world. In September of the year 2004, fifteen erupt ions occurred including Mount Etna in Italy. The impact of the Venus transit on t he Earth’s volcanic instability can only be explained by an ether theory. Orthodox science cannot explain how a passing planet can have all these affects on planet Earth. However if we believe the ether is real we can star t to see how planetary movements change the influx of ether energy into th e Earth. David Wilcock explains that the internal core of the Earth contai ns plasma instead of the current notion held by science that the core contains molte n iron. The ether influx he explains has a direct impact on the volume of the p lasma core that increases with the extra ether influx. This plasma tries to find i ts way to the surface where it cools down to lava causing volcanic activity and ea rthquakes. Venus transits happen in tandems with an eight-year interval. The next transit is due June 6 th in 2012! Researcher Will Hart is convinced that the Mayan pr iests new about the Venus transit and the solar sunspot cycle and how they ca use the catastrophes we are now experiencing. Because the Mayas knew that both the sunspot cycle maximum and the Venus transit converge in the year 2012 they choose 2012 as the End date of their Mayan calendar system accordi ng to Hart. The Mayas understanding of the Venus transits and i ts impact were demonstrated by the Mayan priests who predicted the return of th e god Quetzalcoatl in the year 1518. The god Quetzalcoatl was associated with both the planet Venus and a bearded man that would eventually bring civilizatio n to Mexico. The man to bring ‘civilization’ to Mexico was Juan de Grijavlva who discovered Mexico in the year 1518. So it seems the Mayas anticipated his coming. The amazing fact is that the years 1518-1526 happened to be Venus transit years! Eventually Hernando Cortez set foot on Mexican soil in 1519 and conquer ed the Aztec empire. Unfortunately for the Mayas it only brought destruct ion to the Mayan culture. Years later it was Cortez who became the impersonat ion of the Quetzalcoatl. ( \u0001\u0001 ) Recapitulation Now there is abundant proof that our own Solar Syst em is undergoing dramatic changes in the last decades. Strangely enough why i s NASA ignoring it and deliberately keeping the public unaware of these ch anges? Russian scientists are doing a much better job and dare to draw definite c onclusions. Then why doesn’t the USA take global warming seriously? If they did they would have showed up at the Kyoto conference about climate control measures and carbon dioxide reductions, wouldn’t they? Economic interests are m ost likely the motivating factors behind both denials; it seems they don’t wa nt to create panic that could harm their economic interests! "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 150 There appears to be convincing scientific evidence to suggest that life on Earth is undergoing a transformation that is caused by energ etic changes occurring within our Solar System. Scientists have discovered that b iological, chemical, physical and even economic trends are related to the movemen ts of our planets and the activity of the Sun. This suggests that evolution i s taking place within the confines of well-defined cosmic cycles. The most important c osmic cycle seems to be our revolution around the Galactic Centre. This cycle o f 25.920 years corresponds with the precession of the equinoxes. Esoteric Vedic cosmology pictured humanity’s evolut ion going through stages called the World Ages or Yugas that neatly fit in t he Great cycle of 25.920 years. According to Vedic cosmology we now enter a new era in the evolution of humanity called the Golden Age. Entering the Golden Age also seems to be related to the Mayan calendar ‘end time’ prophecy for the year 2012. John Major Jenkin s has found abundant clues showing that ancient cultures and spiritual traditi ons around the world had knowledge about the Earth’s precession. He believes that the ancients left us artefacts and myths all over the world that tell us about the importance of precession and the solstice galactic alignment taki ng place around the year 2012. The year 2012 seems to be a convergence of the gala ctic alignment, the solar maximum and the Venus transit. Throughout the book we have indicated the relations that exist between ancient Eastern wisdom and today’s scientific discoveries a bout our cosmos. The ancient Eastern traditions were not the only traditions tha t kept a cosmology alive that our scientists are now starting to corroborate. In the next chapter we’re going to have a look at the Bible and discover that ancient knowledge was preserved in it as well. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 151 Chapter 11 Science and the Scriptures While scores of theological scholars both in the pas t and present have been studying the literal meaning of biblical phras es and the historical facts mentioned therein, leading to an endless stre am of interpretations that are just as eternal as the flow of a river, ot hers have studied the scriptures and discovered by scientific provable fa cts hidden meaning within these scriptures. Along with our rapid scientific evolution, our unde rstanding of the significance of ancient scriptures such as the Veda s and the Upanishads is growing. Now we’re not only discovering the scienti fic significance of Eastern spirituality but also that of the Bible! Fascinating facts have been discovered about the Bi ble that are often dismissed or ignored by official religious institut ions, our churches, because these findings do not fit in with the estab lished dogmas and so the best strategy is to completely ignore them. However unlike theological discussions, scientific facts can neither be ignored nor can they be debated, they can either be proven righ t or wrong, there is no in between. The Book Genesis Maybe one of the most complex and least understood books of the ancient past is the book Genesis, the first book of the Hol y Bible. In the last two decades scholars have discovered that this book alo ne encodes hidden knowledge that must have been put into it deliberat ely. Only now at the turn of the millennium have we reached a level of s cientific understanding that allows us to grasp the multiple levels of know ledge hidden in these books. The biggest secret of creation is hidden in the fir st sentence of Genesis. In the original Hebrew version of the Bible, Genesi s starts with the word Be-resjiet meaning ‘at first’ or ‘in principle’. It has been t ranslated in modern versions of the Bible into ‘in the beginning ’. Everyone knows the starting phrase of Genesis howev er only few know that the whole essence of creation was put into tha t first word. We now know thanks to Stan Tenen’s work into the origin an d nature of the Hebrew alphabet and Daniel Winter’s additional rese arch into the significance of the Golden Mean spiral, that the sa cred Hebrew alphabet was designed with a very clear intention to convey the very essence of creation and to teach later generations what the Be -resjiet, the principle of creation really is. Independently Stan Tenen and Daniel Winter noticed t hat the Hebrew alphabet, the characters of the alphabet, are proje ctions of a seed form on the faces of a tetrahedron seen from different angl es! However it was Daniel Winter who pointed out that this seed form is actually the Golden Mean or Phi spiral."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 152 The Phi spiral describes the surface of the torus, the basic element of matter. Now if we put the Phi spiral inside a tetra hedron and then slowly revolve the spiral around a pivot axis, and shine a light from behind the Phi spiral, Hebrew characters will show up as the s hadows on the face of the tetrahedron. All of the Hebrew characters will show up in a natural progression by turning the Phi spiral inside the te trahedron. Stan Tenen called the seed form in the tetrahedron ‘The flame letter in the tent’.  Flame letter in the tent and the first verse of Gen esis . Now isn’t this amazing, the authors of Genesis quit deliberately wanted to convey this knowledge to future generations. But we needed to evolve to a level of scientific understanding that would sooner or later reveal the significance of the scripture. But what does it mean? ( \u0001 ) According to Daniel Winter, the angles needed to pro ject the Phi spiral onto the faces of the tetrahedron and create the Hebrew alph abet are the same angles we need to rotate the doughnut torus such that they ca n be nested into each other according to the symmetries of the Platonic solids. This is exactly the recipe for constructing matter from torus shapes as described in the chapter 6 ‘Ether Vibrations’, paragraph ‘Implosion Physics’! Even more remarkable is the fact that the actual so und of a Hebrew character when vocally expressed has a frequency shape (frequ ency spectrum) that is similar to the character on paper itself. Both Stan Tenen and Dr. Hans Jenny (Cymatics) independently proved this fact. Hans Jen ny used the recorded expression of the letter on a plate with sand. The vibrations in the voice pronouncing the Hebrew letter caused the sand grain s to take on the actual shape of the Hebrew character! This hi-tech knowledge has been deliberately preser ved in the Bible for future generations to discover. The Hebrew alphabet is a c ookbook for creating matter; it is a sacred language that has been intentionally designed. The third book of the Kabbalah the ‘Sephir Yitzirah’ mentions the story o f God taking letters from the alphabet to create the world. For centuries we have ridiculed this idea and believed it to be a myth, but only now that we have reached scientific maturity we marvel at these words, as indeed the Hebrew alph abet seems to be the blue print for creating matter. We can now also make sense out of the first sentence in the gospel of John that states:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 153 John 1-1 “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was w ith God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God; 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made”. Given the fact that basic keys for the construction of matter are given in the first sentence of Genesis, we may now have another look a t the mythical story of Adam and Eve contained within Genesis. Lets look at the basic building blocks of matter once more: Left, the double vortex creating the torus on the r ight! It takes some imagination but have a look at the do uble vortex on the left, doesn’t it look like a tree? The bottom vortex are the roots, the top is the foliage. Is it the Tree of Good and Evil in paradise? If we have a look to the right picture it is rather easy to see the apple, the torus is an ap ple shape. The snake that seduced Eve to eat the apple from the tree is the P hi spiral that perfectly describes the torus. The story of Adam and Eve, could well be references to the way the material world is constructed from the ether. The fall from paradise started when from the Oneness of the Creator his eternal consciousness, t he ether, the first torus shape was created. The first step in creation was at the same time the separation from Oneness. The fall from paradise could be explained as the separation from Oneness into the illusionary physical world of seem ingly separate parts. ( \u0002 ) Now it is obvious that the authors of the book of G enesis possessed a thorough scientific understand that we are just starting the rediscover. But who were the authors of Genesis? Archeologist Howard Middleton-Jones is convinced th at the authors of the book of Genesis and the builders of the Great Pyramid are o ne and the same. He discovered that the authors of Genesis must have ha d a thorough understanding of the interior of the Great Pyramid. Howard Middle ton-Jones discovered the significance of the persons mentioned in Genesis al ong with their ages. From these two facts he was able to draw a vector plot! The lineages of Adam, Seth, Enoch, Kenan, Mahalalel and Jared can be translated into a vector plot when their ages mentioned in Genesis are translated into angle s! Adam is the reference point of this vector plot. He is placed at zero degrees of a 360 degrees circle. Genesis verses 1-32 are about A dam who was 130 years old when he had a son named Seth. Adam lived another 80 0 years for a total of 930 years. The numbers 130, 800 and 930 are transposed into degrees. Each turn in degrees forms a new vector, the concatenated vector s create a vector plot. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 154 They used a CAD (Computer Aided Design) program to d raw these vector plots from the text of Genesis. For every lineage mention ed in Genesis Adam, Seth, Enoch, Kenan, Mahlalel and Jared a vector plot was created in this way. When finished they projected the completed vector wire f rame over the Great Pyramid and surprise, surprise, the vector wire frame perfe ctly matched with the airshafts inside the Great Pyramid. The airshafts are very sm all pipes inside the Great Pyramid that originate from both the King’s and Que en’s chamber and run outwards to the outer surface of the pyramid. Offic ial Egyptologist would explain that the airshafts are the ascending paths for the Pharaoh’s soul when the soul leaves the tomb on his voyage to the hereafter. Howard Middleton-Jones has now proven that the exac t angles of these shafts are all mentioned in Genesis. Now the question again is who wrote Genesis? Is the author the architect of the Great Pyramid? ( \u0004 ) The Book Exodus A very interesting fact is that archaeologist Howar d Middleton-Jones claims he has found the entrance to the Arc of the Covenant, the shrine that contains the Ten Commandments given to Moses by God. According t o Middleton-Jones, the entrance is to be found in the Great Pyramid at the Giza plateau. The entrance to the Ark of Covenant supposedly face s the south end wall of the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid. In his book ‘Gi za-Genesis, the best kept secrets’ he gives exact details on how the door to the secret hidden passage may be opened. He discovered this entrance by studying the biblica l book Exodus in which God gives detailed instructions to Moses for the constr uctions of the Ark of the Covenant as the storage place for the Ten Commandme nts. He discovered that in minute detail the construction and materials used f or the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid were actually being described in the book of Exodus! Howard Middleton-Jones however does not believe that the A rk of Covenant contains the Ten Commandments, he has come to the startling conc lusion that it could be a crystal of Atlantean origin placed deep beneath the Giza plateau for the stabilization of the Earth grid. ( \u0004 ) The Book of Numbers Many believe that the author of the books Genesis, Exodus and the Book of Numbers is actually Moses. The Book of Numbers deal s about the forty-year time span after the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. There are an awful lot of numbers mentioned in the Book of Numbers, hence its name. The numbers seem to have relevance. Physician and America’s leading herbalist Dr. Josep h S. Puleo was inspired to study the Book of Numbers for healing frequencies. He says he was spiritually inspired to do so after some mystical experiences, and the book revealed to him the musical tones destined to be sung by the gather ing of a critical mass of a 144.000 people that would hail in a 1000 year lasti ng peace as mentioned in the Holy Bible. Eventually he did find 6 sound frequenc ies in the Book of Numbers chapter 7, verses 12-89."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 155 The frequencies found are 396 Hz, 417 Hz, 528 Hz, 6 39 Hz, 741 Hz, and 852 Hz. These frequencies are the frequencies of a very old musical scale called the Solfeggio scale. It was used in Gregorian and Sansk rit chants. The syllables used to denote the tones are: Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La, they are taken from the medieval song Ut Quent Laxis, a Gregorian chant in Latin written for John the Bapti st. Ut queant laxis Re sonare fibris Mi ra gestorum Fa muli tuorum Sol ve polluti La bii reatum Sancte Iohannes Translation: In order that the slaves might resonate (resound) the miracles (wonders) of your creations with loosened (expanded ) vocal chords. Wash the guilt from (our) Polluted lip. Saint John . The text in Ut Quent Laxis is suggesting that these notes open up a channel of communication with the Divine that renders speech us eless. In a vision Dr. Joseph S. Puleo was shown to use a n umber reduction methodology used by Pythagoras. It is a very simple reduction method chucking big numbers into a single digit. The values of all digits in the number are added up. When after the first addition the number still c ontains more than one digit, the process is repeated. Here’s an example: 456 reduces to 4+5+6 = 15, that next reduces to 1 + 5 = 6. So the number 456 reduces eventually to the single digit 6. Jopeph Puleo found repetitions of a single issue or subject in the Book of Numbers that was brought up. The first thing he fou nd was that of the mentioning of the number of the day, the first day, the second day, the third day etc. The first day was referenced in verse 12, the second day was mentioned in verse 18 and the third day in verse 24. The last re ference to a day was in verse 78. All day references are found in verses with a v erse increment of 6 starting at verse 12. The Pythagorean reduction of these verse numbers is : 12 = 1 + 2 = 3 18 = 1 + 8 = 9 24 = 2 + 4 = 6 30 = 3 + 0 = 3 36 = 3 + 6 = 9 42 = 4 + 2 = 6 Do you see the repetition now of 396, 396 etc this k eeps going on until verse 78 is reached! This is how the first frequency corresp onding to the Ut tone was found. The other frequencies were found using other repeti tive issues found in the text and all matched up with the Solfeggio scale. The Solfeggio scale after a while was forbidden by the church and changed into our current popular Tempered scale. The Ut was chan ged into a Do and its"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 156 frequency changed, also the seventh Ti note was add ed. The total harmony of the scale was gone. ( \u0005 ) It is now believed that the frequencies found by Pu leo have healing properties. The frequency of 528 Hz supposedly has healing effe cts on DNA. The frequency seems to have an effect on the water molecules that surround the DNA helix. Glen Rein of the Quantum Biology Research Lab in Ne w York has performed experiments with in vitro DNA that was exposed to d ifferent recordings of music styles. He used a technique to modulate the music i nto an audio scalar wave. He used two phase opposite sound fields from the same music to self-cancel the waves and create scalar audio waves. In the experim ent a CD player, an amplifier and a spiral like self-cancelling coil were used. F our styles of music were played to test tubes containing in vitro DNA. The absorptio n of UV light of the DNA test tube samples was measured after an hour. Gregorian chants had caused a 5 to 9.1 % increase i n the absorption of UV light due to the unwinding of the DNA helix. Sanskrit chan ting caused a similar 5.8% to 8.2% effect. Rock (0-1%) and classical music (0- 1.1%) had little or no effect. Glenn Rein finally concluded from the experiments t hat the audible sound waves of the Solfeggio scale can cause resonance in DNA a nd can have healing effects. ( \u0006 ) The question is who put the frequencies into the Bo ok of Numbers, was it the medieval monks that created the Solfeggio scale and did they deliberately create it because they new of its healing properties? But how were they to know, was it kept in Gnostic circles perhaps as an Atlantean her itage? Or could it be that the monks simply discovered what Puleo had discovered. But then how were they able to tune the scale to the exact frequencies men tioned in the Bible since they had no means to actually measure the exact frequenc ies? It remains a mystery, but the fact is that musical frequencies are mentio ned in the Book of Numbers that have scientifically measurable effects on DNA. It has been suggested that these frequencies have DNA healing properties. Gematria Gematria is an ancient old science that studies the Bible in a different way. It tries to find meaning in the Hebrew text by studyin g the numerical values of the Hebrew letters and words. In Hebrew every character has a unique value, much like the binary ASCII code in modern computers that is used to represent characters. The values of the characters in a word can be added up to the numerical value of the word, words can be added up to the value of sentences etc. There are a few direct references to the Great Pyra mid in the Bible. One of them is in the book Isaiah: Isaiah 19:19-20 “At that time there will be an altar for the LORD in the middle of Egypt and a monument to the LORD at the b order of Egypt. This will be a sign and a witness to the LORD All-Powerful in the land of Egypt. When the people cry to the LORD for help, he will send s omeone to save and defend them. He will rescue them from those who hurt them” . The altar in the middle of Egypt and the monument a t the border of Egypt is most"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 157 likely a reference to the Great Pyramid residing ne ar the Nile delta. The Great Pyramid is the only monument that is located in the centre of old Egypt and is on the border (of the Nile) at the same time. If the official Hebrew text of the same verse of Is aiah 19:19-20 is taken, we discover a very interesting fact. When the Gematria n value is taken from this verse of Isaiah it adds up to the value 5449. In in ches this is the height of the Great Pyramid! Remember that the Great Pyramid was covered by 144. 000 polished casing stones. Bruce Cathy who recalculated the speed of l ight relative to the Earth grid, found the harmonic value for the speed of light to be a 144.000 arcs per grid second. The Gematrian value for light also happens to be a 144. Again we find proof that the authors of the Bible m ust have had profound knowledge of the Great Pyramid and most likely also about the speed of light. This is knowledge that the ancients should not have possessed at the time the Bible was written at least not if we still believe in a linear evolution of humanity where it is believed that our current civilization is the pinnacle of evolution on this planet! ( \u0007) So what we see here is that the harmonic grid speed of light corresponds with the Gematrian value 144 for light! This seems to be no coincidence. It may be that the ancient authors of the Bible new about the harm onic grid speed of light and designed the Hebrew word for light such that it rep resents the value 144! If they were able to design the whole Hebrew alphabet from the projections of the Phi spiral in a tetrahedron, why not add a Gematrian si gnificance to the words as well? ( \b ) The most baffling example of Gematrian knowledge an d wisdom comes from Greg Braden and is explained in his latest book ‘The God Code’. The four bases (A,C,T,G) that form the DNA of our c ells are all made of the four most common elements on Earth hydrogen, oxygen, nit rogen and carbon. Braden discovered that the atomic mass numbers of these fo ur elements as given by the periodic table of the elements match with the Gemat rian values for the Hebrew letters Yod, Hey, Vav and Hey, that spell YHVH or J ehova, the Hebrew name for God. Why do the atomic mass numbers of the four life brin ging elements hydrogen, oxygen nitrogen and carbon that are the corner ston e elements of organic chemistry and thus of life on this planet correspon d with the Gematrian values that spell out the name of God? Again this can only be explained if the Hebrew language was intentionally designed to do so. Accor ding to Braden all root languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Co ptic, Sanskrit and Egyptian Hieroglyphics share the same relation to the period ic table of the elements. Furthermore he believes that the DNA contains a lan guage in readable format that science has not yet discovered. Braden may not be aware of the Russian research of Garjajev’s group who has already discov ered that the DNA sequencing follows the rules of grammar and that al l our human languages are based on this universal grammar!

Gematria raises questions about who actually wrote the Bible? How d id the authors of the Bible know the measurements of the Great Pyramid and is i t possible that they indeed knew the speed of light? And then we have the name of God, Jehova written in the code of life our own DNA. Could it be that the H ebrew language has been intentionally designed by a civilization far more s uperior than our own? Did the authors of the Old Testament add a deeper level of significance to the literal Hebrew words in the Bible, tempting us most of all to read between the lines? Perhaps the Old Testament was meant to convey and c onceal an ancient science that we’re just starting to rediscover? The Bible Code A lot of upheaval has been caused by the revelation of the alleged Bible codes that were discovered within the Old Testament. In 1 958 a Rabbi discovered some unusual patterns encoded within the book Genesis. H e believed there were secret messages hidden within the Bible. In 1988 mathemati cian Eliyahu Ripps of the Hebrew University took the claims of the old Rabbi seriously and incorporated the complete text of the Old Testament into a computer. He and his team developed an analysis method to scan the whole text of the Bi ble looking for hidden Torah codes. The simple algorithm is called Equidistant L etter Sequencing (ELS). It boils down to first establishing a keyword that we want t o find within the text. Next the computer starts looking for the first occurrence of the first letter in the text. When found the second letter is searched for. Now th e distance between first and second letter in characters is determined, let’s sa y the two letters occur within a distance of 50 characters. Now the rest of the Bibl e text is scanned but this time only the characters with a 50-character interval ar e scanned to search for the next characters in the initial word. When the whole word is found, the scanning continues to find other possible related words. The Bible Code was introduced to the public at larg e when investigative reporter Michael Drosnin entered the scene and wrote the by now famous book ‘The Bible Code.’ The Bible Code revealed a lot of historical names, places and facts within the Old Testament, the assassinations of Lincoln, K ennedy, Ghandi, references to the Oklahoma bombing, World War II, the fall of the Iron Curtain. The Bible Code took on prophetic qualities when Drosnin warned Isr aeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin one year before he was assassinated, that the Bible Code predicted his murder. Not only was the exact date of the incident encoded but also the name of his murderer! A year later Rabin was murdered on th e exact date mentioned in the Bible code and by the man mentioned therein. Now this is an astonishing fact that cannot easily be explained! It attracted the interest of the military defence o f the United States who seriously studied the subject of the supposed Bible Codes. However other people claim that hidden codes can be found in any book! To prove this fact Brendan McKay of the Australia Nati onal University took a page from the book ‘Moby Dick’ and proved that the follo wing words could be extracted using the ELS algorithm: Princess Diana, Royal, Dodi , Henri Paul, Mortal in these jaws of death. For many it is absolute proof that the Bible Codes are just random and bear no inherent meaning. However Drosnin defends these cla ims by saying that the words extracted by ELS were all found very close to each other in the text and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 159 that the chances of such occurring were against odd s. This has been confirmed by a statistical study that has been performed and pub lished in ‘Statistical Science’. He also said that ‘Moby Dick’ did not predict future events! Theomatics While the debate continues whether or not the Bible Code is authentic, a totally different kind of Bible code has been discovered th at according to the discoverers is far more interesting and can be mathematically p roven without a shadow of a doubt. Theomatics is based on the ancient science o f Gematria but takes it a bit further! The discoverers of Theomatics claim that it proves that God’s own watermark, His own autograph was put into the Bible! This is what they write about their own discovery, quote: ‘It is absolutely, completely and totally impossibl e to mathematically disprove Theomatics. The overall validity of this discovery - the fact that God did it - is unimpeachable. Theomatics will never be disproved. In fact no one will come close to it’. Wow, these people are either very arrogant or they a re so very sure about themselves that they have truly stumbled onto somet hing very real! Let’s have a closer look. Theomatics is a combination of the words Theo, the Greek word for God, and mathematics. The basis for Theomatics is the ancien t Gematria. Theomatics was discovered like the ‘Bible Code’ fee ding the text of the most original Greek version of the New Testament into a computer. Now in the Greek New Testament the chapters are indicated with lette rs like the letters in the Roman numerals. This way they could derive the nume rical value of the corresponding Greek letter, the ASCII code (number representing a character used in computers) so to speak of the Greek letter. They discovered that not only the letters represent a value but also that all wor ds within the text have a unique number. It is calculated by adding up the values of the character that constitutes the word. Gematria values of the Greek alphabet"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 160 For instance the word Jesus in Greek has the value of 888. Iesous ( Ιησους) = I (10) + e (8) + s (200) + o (70) + u (400) + s (200 ) = 888 Likewise the value of phrases and sentences can be calculated. So far so good, we’re still on the familiar terrain of Gematria. However they also discovered that numbers mentioned in the text are keys, indicators to the words they refer to. Examples are : Adam lived 930 years (930 is a key), Abraham had 318 servants, Jesus had healed a man of 38 years, etc, etc. Now all of these numbers are key numbers in Theomat ics, they bear a relation with the very words that they refer to! Now the impossible was proven: All words within the Bible, each having a unique va lue, when referenced in a sentence or phrase, the value of the phrase or sent ence is a multiple of the value of the word itself. They found NO exceptions to this rule! Here is an example: The value for Jesus is 888. However the birth of Je sus has a value of 111 (Jesus and his conception are also related by a multiple o f 8). Now within the Bible every reference without except ion to the birth of Jesus will be a multiple of 111: (Now remember that the phrases hereafter are origin ally in Greek!) Jesus  : 111 x 8 Christ  : 111 x 12 Her begotten : 111 x 8 (Mathew 1:20) Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son : 1 11 x 27 (Mathew 1:23) And she will bear a son  : 111 x 11 (Mathew 1:21) She will bear : 111 x 4 She bore a son and called his name : 111 x 24 (Mathew 1:25) The babe in the womb  : 111 x 13 She bore the son the firstborn  : 111 x 25 (Luke 2:7) This child   : 111 x 26 (Luke 2:17) He was conceived  : 111 x 19 She bears   : 111 x 3 And between her seed he will crush : 111 x 7 (Revelation 12:13) Now by no means can these occurrences in the Bible be labelled coincidental. Theomatics shows that the Bible must have been writ ten using a predetermined mathematical design. The discoverers stress that it only works for the Bible and for no other book and only with the exact values as signed to the Greek letters. Tests were conducted to see if another random assig nment of numbers to the Greek alphabet could also give the same results, ho wever all tests were negative. Now the astonishing fact of the matter is that if T heomatics can be validated that not only is it proven that the Bible is indeed cons tructed following a mathematical"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 161 design but also that the Greek language that existe d before the New Testament was written, must have been designed using the very same principles! In addition, since the New Testament consists of a multiple of books written by different authors who wrote their books over time i n different eras, all of the words and phrases chosen by these authors should ha ve been orchestrated on purpose following a unified and unique principle! This is why the adherers of Theomatics believe that only a Divine force could have arranged for these circumstances to happen! Unfortunately Theomatics is not getting the attentio n the ‘Bible Code’ has had, a thorough investigation by scientific standards coul d prove or disprove these bold and stout claims made by Theomatics. ( ) Sacred geometry Theomatics seem to prove the numerical mathematical principle of Gematria that was applied consistently in the text of the New Tes tament. This is not where the story of Gematria and the puzzling application of i t in the Bible ends. Researcher Daniel Gleason claims that we have missed the whole point about Gematria in the New Testament. According to Daniel Gleason, Gematria is really about sacred geometry that was secretly hidden in t he Gospels! The Gematrian values that we find in the Gospels ar e actually the lengths, diameters and circumferences of geometrical forms t hat can be derived from the symbolic texts in the Gospels of the New Testament. Much of his work focuses in on the Gospel of Mark and he comes up with a diagra m for every verse in the Gospel of Mark based on principles of sacred geomet ry. All of his diagrams symbolize and focus on the impo rtance of the resurrection of Jesus. After Jesus’ crucifixion and burial, Jesus r esurrected from his grave and the sacred geometry of Daniel Gleason uses his resurrec tion, the raised Jesus, as a central theme in all of his diagrams. In the previous section we showed that the Gematria n value for Jesus is 888. The value for the risen Jesus however is 8880. This is exactly 10 times the value of the living Jesus, 888. We could say that Jesus was raised to a power of 10! All of Gleason’s diagrams show a circle with a circumferen ce of 8880 units, the value and symbol of the ‘risen Jesus’. Enclosed within th is circle, for every verse he shows how sacred geometrical patterns can be drawn inside the circle that correspond with the Gematrian values mentioned in t he verse. Since Daniel Gleason’s work is way too elaborate to be summarised in just a few words just in this book, without doing him justice we simply present one example to illustrate his work. This example is fascinating since again it reveals the importance of the ‘Star of David’ or the interlaced tetrahedron as the symbol of the resurrection of Jesus: This example is from John 20:31 where it says: "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 162 But these things have-been-written that you might-h ave-Faith that Jesus is the Christ ... the Son of God ... and that having-Faith ... you may have Life ... in the Name of him. (John 20:31) And John 14:6 Jesus says to-him ... I am The Way and The Truth an d The Life ... no-one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6) Now consider the following Gematrian values in Gree k: Life is 815. ( ζωη = 7+800+8).  ( Side of the tetrahedron ) Christ or Christos ( Χριστος ) in Greek is 1480 (Circumference of a circle) Jesus Christ with a Gematrian value of 2368 (Cir cumference of a circle) The Son of God (` ο ` υιος του θεου ) 2004. (Circumference of a circle) The Risen Jesus has avalue of 8880. (Circumference of the outer circle) Now look how neatly all of these values are represe nted in Gleason’s sacred geometry diagram symbolizing the Star of David. Sacred geometry symbolism of the Risen Jesus in the Star of David. Although the sceptical reader may call it a fabrica tion of numbers, I believe it to be far from coincidence. The fact is that the Star of David, the interlaced tetrahedron plays a significant role as a symbol th roughout history and it shows up in many forms. In all cases it is related to the Merkaba, the vehicle for ascension. Also Jesus demonstrated his ascension wi th his resurrection from the dead. So we find the same symbol of ascension, the Merkaba also in the New Testament hidden in the sacred geometry of Gematria . ( \u0001\u000b )"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 163 Recapitulation Many people have always claimed that the Bible cont ained all the knowledge there is to know. Well for a fact there are many mo re levels of knowledge hidden behind the plain words and sentences that have been debated for centuries. While Biblical scholars still fight about the meanin g of the words leading to ever more interpretations, science is revealing a signif icance that allows for only one interpretation. It is utterly impossible that primitive ancient peo ple could have written the Bible. The knowledge hidden within the Bible that we have just started to uncover is stunning. It reveals that somehow the know-how of a highly developed civilisation was preserved along with the Bible text. The Hebrew language, the original language of the Old Testament was obviously designe d by a culture with a profound understanding of vibrations in physics. Ge matria adds another level of knowledge to the words of the Bible. Although the d iscoverers of Theomatics are absolutely convinced that God wrote the Bible himse lf, what can be taken as a fact is that a mathematical principle was used that can not easily be explained. Daniel Gleason’s work may prove that all of the Gema trian mysticism was really all about sacred geometry. Now how do we explain al l this? Let’s for a moment assume that the Hebrew and Greek languages have been designed on purpose by a superior civilisation that walked the face of the Earth before we did to conceal sacred information about e ther vibrations and how they create reality. The designers of these alphabets an d languages could be survivors of Atlantis that founded new cultures after the des truction of Atlantis. Hermes Trismegistus (Toth the Atlantean) the builder of th e Great Pyramid according to Edgar Cayce and other sources, supposedly is one of the founding fathers of these cultures. It could explain why Theomatics wor ks on the level of individual words. However when it comes to phrases and whole s entences it becomes very unlikely that all authors of the books that make up both the Old and the New Testament new about and applied the Theomatics prin ciple. The only reasonable explanation would be that all a uthors of the Bible were initiates to a higher wisdom and knowledge, destine d to transcend space and time and these authors universally applied mathematical principles of Gematria and or sacred geometry to encrypt this wisdom in the Bible such that it could be conveyed to future generations. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 164 Chapter 12 Awakening Rewriting history History has proven Edgar Cayce to be right about ma ny predictions he has made. For one he predicted that Atlantis would be discove red and that along with it Atlantean knowledge would be restored on Earth. The greatest and most promising archaeological discovery in the waters of Cyprus was announced in the very same week this final chapter is written. So th e timing is just perfect to start drawing some final conclusions in the last chapter of this book. All around the world researchers are looking for th e remains of Atlantis, Mu and Lemuria and their research has already been success ful. Underwater structures and even pyramids- the possible remains of Mu - hav e been found in the waters the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Yonaguni. These structures must be at least 12.500 years old since they are found on the sea fl oor that submerged under water at the ending of the last Ice Age, around 10. 500 BC. A very remarkable announcement was made on the 15 th of November 2004 when Robert Sarmast held a press conference revealing the discovery of the city of Atlantis in the waters of Cyprus, exactly where Plato situated it. We will most likely hear a lot more about the latest archaeological discovery of Atlantis. Although no real artefacts or physical ev idence has yet been recovered, it is not presumptuous to conclude that Atlantis is not a myth after all, and that Edgar Cayce was right all along about his predictio n of the recovery of Atlantis. This is how I feel our history books may be rewritt en concerning the destruction of Atlantis in the future, combining the work of Ed gar Cayce, David Wilcock, Robert Sarmast, Drunvalo Melchizedek and other sourc es: A global catastrophe in the form of a pole shift le d to the destruction of a highly civilized culture, the continent of Atlantis 10.500 B.C. The imminent pole shift was known a long time before it actually happened. This allowed many of the inhabitants of Atlantis to flee to other parts of t he globe before the catastrophe hit. Many Atlanteans fled to North and South Americ a and the Middle East, particularly Egypt. It is a significant fact that a lmost every religion has flood myth stories very similar to the Biblical story of Noah and the Ark. The most credible explanation why these flood myth stories show up in all religions all over the world is that they are based on the actual historic al fact of the inundation of Atlantis. Survivors of the flood helped to shape ne w civilizations all over the world. The first was the Sumerian culture, the olde st know civilization on Earth, that quite suddenly arose from the Stone Age. Histo rians today have no explanation as to why the Sumerian civilization ros e to such heights in such a short time. The first signs of Atlantis show up wit h Plato (427 –347 BC). Plato explains in his book ‘Critias’ that he first learne d about Atlantis from stories by the Greek Solon (638- 559 BC), one of the ‘seven wi se men of Greece. Solon in his turn learned about Atlantis from stories relate d by Egyptian priests. Plato was the first to note these mythological stories down i n his book ‘Critias’. This book that Plato never finished is the only reference we have today to the mythological lost continent, but for centuries the possibility o f its existence has intrigued scores of people. Edgar Cayce’s readings mentioned that the migration s of Atlanteans took place in different time frames in ancient history. The Cayce readings mention that"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 165 Atlantean people entered America from both the east and west in 28.000 B.C. The last and largest migration occurred during the years approaching 10.000 B.C due to the anticipated pole shift. The majority of these refugees fled to North America becoming the native Indian tribe, the Iroqu ois. Modern day genetic research performed by Gregory L. Little in August 2001 on the origins of mitochondrial DNA now seems to corrob orate Edgar Cayce’s stories. Mitochondrial DNA is believed to be the remnant of a bacterium that has entered the human cell somewhere along our long timeline of evolution and henceforth symbiotically lived within the cell. Mitochondria h ave their own DNA, the mtDNA that is only passed on in the female lineage. There are only 39 different clusters of mtDNA, the so-called 39 haplogroups that appear in the human cell. The mtDNA has a very slow evolution speed and has practi cally changed very little over thousands of years. This mtDNA is therefore ver y suitable for genetic research to trace the origins and migrations of cul tures all over the world. Researchers now believe that Atlanteans were carrie rs of the X type haplogroup of mitochondrial DNA that can be traced back to the very same regions and dates in history of mass migrations that were given by Ed gar Cayce. The spreading of the B type haplogroup also seems to correspond with the stories given by Edgar Cayce about the civilization of Mu. ( \u0001 ) Cayce mentioned that besides Atlantis there were ot her earlier highly advanced civilization like Mu that resided in today’s Asia, whose culture collapsed and was destroyed around 50.000 BC. Survivors fled to count ries like China and Japan. Last century, many researchers studied the Asian Ve dic scriptures because there were striking parallels between the knowledge conta ined within these scriptures and the facts of quantum science. Fritjof Capra in 1975 wrote the book ‘The Tao of physics’ and studied the parallels in detail tha t seemed more than mere coincidence. The most logical explanation I believe as to why scriptures that are thousands of years old contain scientific knowledge that puzzles our scientists today is that the source of this knowledge can most likely be traced back to the survivors of earlier civilizations who attained a s cientific understanding equalling our own. Today we believe that our current civiliza tion is the pinnacle of evolution; however the discoveries of an ancient sc ience that we are just starting to understand, together with the archaeological dis coveries of underwater structures belonging to cultures that must be at le ast thousands of years older than the Sumerian culture, force us to awaken from our dream. Following the same reasoning, the Egyptian culture may also have its origins leading back to Atlantis. The scientific facts disc overed about the Great Pyramid on the Giza plateau make it very unlikely that the pyramid was built by the late Egyptian dynasty as a grave tomb for Pharaoh Kufhu. Only a highly civilized culture like Atlantis could have had access to a te chnology and a science that allowed them to build the Great Pyramid with such m athematical and astronomical precision. So it may well be that surv ivors of Atlantis are the founding fathers of the Egyptian culture just like Edgar Cayce has suggested. The South American cultures of the Aztecs, the Inca s and the Mayas and the indigenous cultures of North America, the native In dians, still puzzle scholars today. Although the link between the Mayas and Atla ntis is harder to prove since the Maya culture is of this millennium, the fact is that they were excellent sky watchers and that they knew about the precession of the equinoxes, cycles of solar activity and had precise notions of the revol utions of the planets, giving rise to the Mayan Long Count calendar. In order to under stand precession, the Mayas"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 166 had to notice that the stars in the heavens slowly change their positions by 1 degree every 72 years. This is a very, very small c hange in the heavens to be noticed by the naked eye over such long time spans! And then there is their calendar for Venus that is accurate to within only 2 hours per 500 years! These are facts that cannot easily be explained. Twenty first century scientific knowledge that pops up in ancient cultures also shows up in the Jewish Kabbalah and the Christian B ible. The Old Testament contains knowledge that cannot easily be explained. For one thing Daniel Winter proved that the Hebrew alphabet, the language of th e oldest version of the Old Testament is designed from the shades of the Phi sp iral in a tetrahedron. The Hebrew character set therefore is the cookbook for creating matter. The angles required for the rotation of the Phi spiral inside the tetrahedron such that it creates the shadows of Hebrew characters, are the s ame angles required to nest the torus doughnuts into the Platonic solids symmet ries. And then we have the atomic weights numbers of the elements Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon, Hydrogen, the building blocks of organic ch emistry within the DNA molecule of life. According to Greg Braden, the ato mic weight numbers of these elements correspond with the Kabalist Gematrian val ues of the letters Yod, Hey, Vav and Hey that spell YHVH or Jehova, God. The authors of the Old Testament quite clearly had access to knowledge that doesn’t correspond with the scientific development of the cultures of their time, although no one exactly knows the age of the Old Te stament or its origins. The possibility that Atlantean knowledge was preserved in the old scriptures is an explanation we now must consider. Revival of Atlantean knowledge Edgar Cayce mentioned that the Atlantean science an d knowledge would eventually return to Earth. I believe that the redi scovery of the ancient science of sacred geometry, the rediscovery of the significanc e of the Platonic solids in both Implosion Physics (Daniel Winter) and the ether theo ry of everything (David Wilcock) is in fact the revival of an ancient scienc e that acknowledged the existence of the ether. This ancient science can be traced back to Atlantis. Actually there are more scientists who have also di scovered the significance of the Platonic Solids in the model of the atom but wh o are not mentioned earlier in this book. I’d like to mention Dr. Robert J. Moon w ho in 1986 rendered the complete table of the elements from the Platonic So lids. However it was Plato who first described the Platonic Solids as the buil ding blocks of the atom. Plato’s claim became more credible when Dr. Hans Jenny’s ex periments proved that in a vibrating spherical fluid all of the Platonic solid s emerge as vibration patterns. This has led to the development of Implosion Physic s that only needed the hypothesis of the ether ‘fluid’ to explain how vort exes in the ether arrange themselves around these Platonic solids. If the emerging ether theories that form an explana tion for both the physical and the consciousness realms are accepted by mainstream science, we have a final theory of everything. It would be a revolution in s cience that could lead to a spiritual renaissance and a scientific paradigm shi f. In this theory of everything, science and spiritual ity merge into a universal wisdom. Smelyakow and Karpenko suggested that evolu tion is not a linear process but happens in spirals. The knowledge that is now about to break through in science is therefore only a revival of past know ledge that once belonged to the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 167 ancients and the lost civilization of Atlantis. Mos t likely all ancient spiritual esoteric wisdom can be traced back to earlier civil izations like Atlantis, Mu and Lemuria. In this sense esoteric wisdom is essential ly scientific knowledge about the Divine nature of our Universe. The dualism betwe en science and spirituality is an artificial bifurcation that was only introduced by Descartes because he believed that our reality could perfectly explained without a call for a Divine cause. Descartes made a just decision at the time. We could never have made the scientific progress we have made today if science w as still constrained by religious dogmas. Therefore we owe Descartes a lot. Thanks to men like Descartes and Newton, we’ve had the chance to unders tand and research our reality with strict objectivity. However the more s cience progressed, the less objective reality itself seemed to be. We’ve demons trated this abundantly throughout this book. However the painful legacy of the Cartesian bifurcation now is that science has a very hard time to accept that perhaps after all there is a Divine cause in the Universe. Atlantean knowledge was a universal wisdom an integ ration of both science and spirituality. The Atlanteans simply didn’t make the distinction like we have for the last three hundred years. How else can we explain t hat scriptures thousands of years old exist which contain so much knowledge tha t is both spiritual and scientific in nature? It is only because our own cu rrent civilization has reached a level of scientific maturity such that we can now s tart to see these scriptures in a whole new context. One can argue that Eastern spiritual traditions ach ieved their universal knowledge not by arcane scientific means but by means of esot eric principles like introspective meditation. In a state of higher cons ciousness, adepts had access to primordial knowledge stored within the Akashic reco rds. Although this may very well be true, I still think there is reason enough to assume that the ancient Vedic culture got their initial wisdom from earlier civil izations. We have amply demonstrated in this book that frontie r-breaking scientists are now discovering the existence of an all-pervading e nergy ether field that they believe is the source of both the physical realm an d non-physical realm of consciousness. Ancient cultures have told us for th ousands of years the very same thing. This energy field was known in differen t cultures by different names like Prana, Ki, Chi and Akasha. Science simply refu sed to believe that it could ever be real and in the West we believed it to be a superstitious and primitive thought. For thousand of years esoteric wisdom has also told us that the distinction between the material and the immaterial realm is su perficial and that universal consciousness is the source of all manifestations. Frontier scientists start telling us now exactly the same thing; there is only one su bstance the ether, the source of both the physical and the mental word. Physical things only appear to be separate things, however they are all manifestations of one universal source, the ether t hat uses form and not substance to create the illusion of separateness. S ince ether is also conscious energy, the essence of the universe is universal co nsciousness. Using the same reasoning about the illusionary nature of separate physical things, then our individual consciousness must be an illusion. Indiv idual consciousness is a fraction of the whole, a holographic part of universal consc iousness. Spiritual traditions called the illusionary nature of separateness Maya and claimed that the true nature of the universe is Oneness."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 168 Hinduism tells us that everything is the manifestat ion of the One infinite Creator, Brahman. What we see as individual physical realiti es are therefore illusions that hide the Oneness of the universe from our view. Bud dhism teaches the importance of rejecting the ego. Siddhartha Gautama , the original Buddha, while sitting under the Bo tree awakened to the universal consciousness realizing that it is our clinging on to our individual ego that is th e source of all pain and suffering. Hinduism and Taoism also teach that the belief in a separate ego is false. The spiritual seeker finds his way to Brahman by travel ling the path where he has to undo himself from his false belief in the reality o f his ego. Belief in a separate ego is a misconception; it’s the barrier that separates the seeker from his Creator. Many mainstream scientists discovered that coherenc e in the universe seems to be the rule and not the exception. Whereas on the s urface our physical reality seems to exist of separate things, science is actua lly discovering the holistic nature of our universe. The universe cannot be full y understood if we isolate it into separate things. Ervin Laszlo’s A-field shows that everything on an informational level in the universe is eventually c onnected with everything else. Quantum science reveals that quantum entangled part icles act in unison as if they are One. No matter how far they are separated in the universe nor how much time has passed; they keep their entangled rel ationship forever. Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum’s experiments showed that indiv idual minds can be connected and that stimuli administered to one pers on can show up in the EEG of another. Scientists like Daniel Winter, David Wilcock, Amit Go swami and others believe that consciousness is not restricted to biological life forms per se. They believe that consciousness is an intrinsic property of the universe itself and it may manifest itself in many forms. All physical objects from sub atomic particles to stars and planets are believed to be sentient life forms. Although this idea may seem absurd at first, indigenous tribes like the na tive American Indians and the aboriginals have always told us about the sacrednes s of the land. They believed that everything has a soul and that the land includ ing its rocks is alive! Ancient mythology is full of stars and planets that were at tributed Divine like personalities, the Gods of the Heavens. We believed that the ancients just had a very primitive understanding of reality and, being in awe of the cosmos, they attributed Divine properties to the stars. To their primeval minds it was the only way to understand reality. Maybe it is just us who have things upside down? Today 21 st century scientists are saying that our universe as a whole is one sentient being that is evolving. James Lovelock was one of the first to postulate his Gaia hypotheses claiming that the Earth itself is a sentient being. Scientist are now saying that God is simply ‘All that is’. If God is ‘All that is’, His consciousness must also be in the rocks and the stars and planets of this universe. Oneness So finally scientists are loosing themselves from t heir shackles, their self-imposed dogma that all reality must be objective and determ inistic and that God is no part of the game. Science is starting to reveal that uni versal consciousness exists everywhere and in everything. If we accept this as a fact, we can finally blend s cience with Eastern esoteric wisdom and present a grand new vision on a silver p latter; a new global awareness that is being birthed on this planet in t his remarkable epoch of human history: "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 169 Our individual consciousness is not separate from t he universal consciousness, from God. We are and never were separated from God. The ego is simply a false belief in an individual self. Just as there is no d uality in the material and the immaterial world, nor is there duality between the individual consciousness of man and the universal consciousness of God. Therefo re we are divine creatures. I believe that this is exactly what the historical Je sus of Nazareth, awakened to Christ consciousness, was teaching mankind. However mankind failed to understand Him. There were only a few who really un derstood and believed His words. Most of us grew up with the belief that only God is divine and that man is born with original sin, the hereditary stain of being de scendant from Adam. The idea that God and man are One is taken as blasphemy by o ur religions; man is born as a sinner and needs to repent to God for the rest of his life. Dogmas like these throughout the ages have been used by religions to establish their power and subject their believers to a theological ideology. It is based on fear, fear that if our sins are not forgiven, God’s wrath will come do wn upon us. If we live a sinful live we will be punished and sent to Hell. The Cath olic Church officially supports the dogma that children need to be baptized to wash off the sins of the parents that were committed in the act of conception! Chris tianity also teaches that Christ died on the cross for our sins. Christ repaid the d ues for our sins, such that we can enter Heaven. But let’s think rational for God’ s sake, if God created us with a free will, why would he judge us if we’re acting in free will? How can we ever do anything against God’s will if it was God’s will in the first place that man should have a free will? If God were to judge us for actin g out of free will, he would be an imperfect God wouldn’t he? It would mean that He just made a little mistake in the design and then had to provide a manual, the Ten Commandments, as a prescription of all the does and don’ts, the laws t o abide by, to make up for His own imperfectness. Wake up, there is no sin, all we do is God’s will! There is no duality between your free will and God’s will! Exot eric religions used the metaphor of God as an old judgmental man with a bea rd looking down upon the sinning folks on Earth from Heaven, in order to est ablish their own power! All over the world Muslim religious leaders in the last decade tend to radicalise the same idea! They are appealing now to their beli evers to start a holy war, a Jihad to subject the non-believers to ‘the only tru e religion of Islam’ as the will of God. Fundamentalists feel the end, Judgment Day is near and use the Koran as a license to kill all the non-believers in God’s name . The believers of these dogmas are driven by intense fear, the fear that God will punish them too if they do not obey the strictest of laws imposed by Islam. Only b y living the Koran to the letter they can they escape from God’s punishment that wil l be upon us all now very soon. The reason why we are raised with these fear driven beliefs is because Christianity lost all its authentic roots during th e first ecumenical council at Nicea in 325 A.D. in modern day Turkey. During this first ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church, the church proclaimed the fi rst Catholic dogma, the creed that Jesus of Nazareth was a Divine Christ, t he Son of God. To establish this dogma, Christianity’s esoteric roots and pagan istic belief had to be eradicated. The Roman Catholic Church selectively p icked the gospels that were canonically admitted. By doing this, the Church was able to firmly constitute its power. All ancient wisdom and legacies of our colle ctive Atlantean history were deliberately destroyed and the West was robbed from all its arcane wisdom. It drastically changed the cause of our Western spirit ual evolution! Dan Brown the author of the ‘Da Vinci Code ‘ brought the whole subject to the public’s attention and claims that many things that we were taught about Jesus"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 170 were wrong. Understandably Christians all over the world now fiercely debate and reject the claims made by Dan Brown in his book. How ever, it is alleged that the Catholic Church today still keeps many secrets in t he vaults of the Vatican. For one thing there are indications that before 325 AD Christianity accepted reincarnation as a part of its theology, however th is ‘pagan’ belief was eradicated because it could undermine the Church’s power. If w e live so many lives, then why strive to live a good and sinless life in this life? There is still plenty of time and plenty of lives to live before we reach Heaven aren’t there? So why should we obey the Church’s rules? After the Nicea council, the suppressed esoteric wi sdom could only survive in secret underground Gnostic circles. Members of thes e circles had to make a vow to keep the teachings within the circle. There was a death penalty for breaking the secrecy code. It was by grace of these Gnostic circles and Freemasonry that a science like sacred geometry was preserved for futu re generations. Leonardo da Vinci was a member of such a secret circle, the Pri ory of Sion, and as we have shown in chapter 5 ‘Revival of an ancient science’ he used sacred geometry in his art. Although it is written in the Bible that God create d man equal to his own image, today we find it very hard to believe that this may actually be true and that maybe every one of us is truly a spark of the Divin e. But what if we allowed ourselves to believe that Go d did indeed create us in his own image? What if we are His co-creators? What if o ur surrounding ‘objective reality’ proved to be only a projection of our own consciousness? Could it be that it was we who created reality all along? Then God d id not forsake us after all, did he? Many people today have lost their faith since t hey cannot believe that if there is a God, why does he allow all these terrible thin gs in the world? But what if we were doing it to ourselves all along? Maybe we are spiritual beings with a material experience instead of material beings with a spirit ual experience? Eastern spirituality would call this realization an awakening, an enlightenment, the realization that we are One with God. Many peop le throughout history have achieved this enlightenment; they awakened to the C hrist consciousness, the universal consciousness, like Jesus of Nazareth did . The problem that Jesus had in his time is that nobody understood him. When he s aid ‘I and the Father are One’, he was crucified for these words because they were taken by the Pharisees as pure blasphemy. Today many people will still crucify the enlightene d idea that God and man are One, especially those who tend to support the idea that God is judgmental and man must be punished for his sins! However I believ e that the current developments in science are leading us into the dir ection of a realization that our cosmos is Divine and that we are a part of the whole ! This has been the true message of all the prophets including Jesus of Naza reth who were trying to bring Enlightenment to humanity. However in our fear of G od we failed to recognize the truth! Fortunately today it is much easier than 200 0 years ago to comprehend the very words of Jesus in a whole new context. Jesus said ‘love your brother like you love yoursel f’. If we fail to love our brother like ourselves, we fail to recognize the Oneness an d our own Divinity. Of all the six billion people that are walking the face of the Earth, in reality there is only One of us here! We are only different perspectives of the same universal consciousness!

Later he became a pi lot on a Boeing 727. In 1965 he left his position to start investigating UF O and paranormal phenomenon. He had founded L/L Research to start investigating reincarnation using hypnotic regression sessions in which subjects were led back to the early days of their youth, their birth and even to pre-conception stage s of previous lives. Later he started to investigate the UFO claims that were reported all over the United States. He had interviewed many abducted peop le who claimed they had been taken hostage by extraterrestrials for scienti fic research purposes. Later he formed a UFO contact group, consisting of people who were able to telepathically make contact with extraterrestrials using a techniq ue called channelling. This is when he met Carla L.Rueckert who was a gift ed medium who could make contact with entities who claimed to be extraterres trial. On January 15 th 1981, Carla L.Rueckert in the presence of Don Elkins unexp ectedly went into a deep trance state. In the trance state she made contact with an entity that called itself ‘Ra’. This was the start of channelling spanning a four-year period that was compiled into a series of five books called the ‘La w of One’. The entity ‘Ra’ identified itself as a social memor y complex, a blended consciousness of a group soul that lived on the pla net Venus millions of years ago. For 4 years in a row, the channelling continue d in a question and answer style, Don Elkins posed questions to ‘Ra’ on wide a range of scientific and other subjects. The compelling evidence of a sophisticate d scientific understanding not known to Earth came from the mouth of Carla Ruecker t who did not have any scientific background whatsoever. Ra explained that the civilization of a planet coul d evolve to a group consciousness where all individual consciousness bl ends, much like the collective unconsciousness proposed by Carl Jung. The collecti ve consciousness has access to all the experiences of all the individuals that ever lived in that civilization, the Akashic records. According to Ra, planet Earth is approaching the en d of a 75.000 year astronomical cycle, three successive precession cyc les. This event is to culminate in the year 2012. The entity Ra explained that they had intervened wi th the evolution of planet Earth dating back to the time of the Egyptians, whe re they decreed the ‘Law of One’. Members from the Ra group supposedly reincarn ated on planet Earth to help humanity. Ra-Ta and Toth, both originating fro m the Ra group, constructed the Great Pyramid at the Giza plateau * for healing and initiation into higher spiritual realms. * (T he same claims stem from Edgar Cayce! Note also tha t in chapter 8 ‘The Giza Plateau’ I mentioned that the central pyramid corresponds with the planet Venus and that putting this planet c entral may have been done on purpose to reveal its origin; Venus is the home planet of Ra!) "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 172 Ra called we humans populating the Earth, the ‘ Souls of Distortion ’. The ego concept, the belief in a separate individuality is a distorted view of reality according to Ra. The fundamental reality is that th ere is only One Infinite Creator and that all perceptions of individuality are simpl y illusions. Hence Ra’s teaching is called the ‘Law of One’. Ra incarnated into huma n life form in order to bring this teaching to the Egyptians. Unfortunately the Egyptians did not awake from their distortions and misunderstood the ‘Law of One’ and started to worsh ip Ra instead as their God of the Sun. Since the teachings were not really graspe d, the distortions of the ‘Law of One’ continued for the Earthlings. Ra the Egyptian Sun God In numerous sessions, Ra explains to Don Elkins the history of planet Earth, its spiritual evolution, about life on other planets, e arlier civilizations such as Atlantis, Lemuria and Mu. Ra explained that the evo lution of the soul leads through multiple lives in the cycle of reincarnatio n. We all have lived many, many lives on many planets since the soul itself is eter nal. Gradually the soul evolves into higher awareness and will reincarnate in highe r dimensions, to finally reach the highest, the eighth density where the soul is r e-united with the consciousness of the One Infinite Creator. Ra also gave in-depth scientific lectures and expla ined the octave-based nature of our universe consisting of multiple dimensions that he preferred to call densities. Both the material and immaterial world is construct ed from a universal etheric spiritual energy that Ra called Love/Light energy. Ra explained that the Love/Light energy travels through the universe as a spiralling wave (torsion wave!) * . The seven different dimensions in the universe ar e different densities and vibration speeds of the same universal Love/Lig ht energy that correspond with the seven white keys in the musical scale. Dens ities like the keys in the musical scale are recurring. After the seventh whit e key, the first key is repeated only one octave higher. "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 173 * (Note that Daniel Winter explained that the spiral ling Golden waves that rush into the atom are light braided on th e lo-Phi wave of love.) Matter is a vibration of this Love/Light energy and there is a unique relation between music, sound and geometry (the Platonic sol ids) that play a role in the construction of matter. Our universal dimensions ar e constructed around the octave of the musical scale. Within the seven main dimensions there are another seven sub dimensions and so forth. The planet Earth is a now a 3rd density planet but currently undergoing its transition into a 4 th density planet at the end of the 75.000 year cycle, according to Ra. Now these amazing details about science were given a long time before frontier physicists discovered the very essentials of what R a was saying. How do we explain such explicit knowledge that came though or from a woman with no scientific understanding whatsoever? ( \u0002 ) The period referred to by Ra when they intervened o n Earth may well have started in the 18 th dynasty (1352- 1336 B.C) of Amenhotep IV better kn own as Akhenaten, the name he later adopted. Offering by Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti to the Aten. Akhenaten only reigned for nearly 18 years but he truly was r esponsible for a revolution in old Egypt. The Egyptians at the time worshipped a whole pantheon of deities, but Akhenaten threw all of them out and taught the Egyptians to only worship one God, the god of the solar disc, the Ate n. Akhenaten lived in the great religious capital of Egypt, Thebes. He ordered the destruction of all the temples and statues of the pantheon of neters (deities) inc luding the most popular neter at the time, Amun. A strong opposition rose against Akhenaten and he had to flee from Thebes along with his wife and a host of follo wers. He founded a new city outside Thebes named Akhetaten, the horizon of Aten , the present day name of this city is El-Amarna. Akehenaten single-handedly reformed the Egyptian re ligious culture from polytheism to monotheism. This is the first time in recorded history that the concept of one God, monotheism, was introduced. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 174 Many historians now believe that Moses who led the Israelites out of Egypt and Akhenaten are one and the same person. The stories are identical. One of the first to suggest this relation is Sigmund Freud. Fr eud is normally only associated with his work on psychoanalysis, but he also had a great interest in the Egyptian culture and in his final book ‘ Moses and Monotheism’ he wrote about the connection between Moses and Akhenaten. Could it be that Akhenaten\\Moses was just bringing the ‘Law of One’ to Earth? There are a few very coincidental things here that may hint in this direction. Suppose Moses himself is indeed the author of the b ook Exodus that describes the exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt. Now Howa rd Middleton-Jones claims to have deciphered the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant, the Ark that contains the Ten Commandments that were given to Mo ses by God on Mount Sinai. Middleton-Jones says he found convincing clu es in the book Exodus that describes the construction of the Ark, but in fact are descriptions of the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid. Suppose Middleton-Jones is right and Moses indeed b uried the Ark in the Great Pyramid. It means that he must have been involved i n the construction of the Great Pyramid too. Another clue that links Moses to the Great Pyramid is the fact that Peter Lemesurier’s pyramid timeline reference point that demarcates the Exodus of Moses out of Egypt coincides with a promi nent place in the Great Pyramid, the base of the ascending path that leads to the King’s and Queen’s chamber. Sources like Edgar Cayce and the ‘Law in One’ chann elling claim that the ones who constructed the Great Pyramid are reincarnated descendants of the Ra group. This would link Akhenaten\\Moses to Ra’s ‘Law of One’ and would explain why Akhenaten\\Moses decreed monotheism. The channelling of the ‘Law of One’ by Carla Ruecke rt although very remarkable is not unique; in 1969 Jane Roberts compiled a book ‘Seth speaks’ from a fifth density entity that identified itself as Seth. Surp risingly the teachings given by Ra and Seth meticulously and consistently sketch a sci ence and cosmology that is now being corroborated by science. According to the channelling of both Seth and the ‘ Law of One’, humanity has always received help from extraterrestrials dwellin g in higher dimensions of consciousness in the universe. Those entities have advanced further in the cycle of reincarnation towards the unity of the One. They want to help us in our evolution. In their understanding, the concept of s eparateness has ceased to exist and by helping us they are helping their own evolut ion! In order to understand this we must understand that basically we are multi dimensional entities that exist in multiple densities at the same time; however hum anity has lost its consciousness of it, according to Ra. Basically the re is no difference between Ra and us, we’re One! This is how Ra sees us and that’ s why they are helping! By helping us they are helping lesser-developed par ts of themselves to evolve as well so to speak. Ra speaks to us in terms of duali ty, us versus them for that is the only concept that humanity can understand, alth ough to Ra this concept does not make any sense. Ra in the ‘Law of One’ quite clearly states that th ey are now here to help us in our transition to the fourth density. They call the tra nsition the harvest of the fourth density souls that after a long period of reincarna tions are now ready to make the transition. Earth is in the final stage of a 75.000 year cycle (three successive precession cycles of 25.920 years!) and will evolve into a fourth density planet. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 175 The mysterious crop circles that started to appear two decades ago all over the world may just be the kind of extraterrestrial help that Ra is referring to. This crop circle appeared in 2004 in the hills of S ilbury Hill and crop circle experts believe it to be related to the 2012 prophecies: Silbury Hill, Wiltshire crop circle August 2 and 3 on 2004 This Silbury Hill crop circle features an Ancient E gypt mosaic in the centre, the Egyptian wings of Ra and symbols from the Mayan Cal endar around the rim. Without going into the details, the two outer rims a re Mayan time scales and the inner Ra wing symbol can be seen as the hands of a clock that indicates the remaining time in years before the year 2012. If yo u look very carefully, the wings show a ‘time’ slightly off a perfect quarter past nine! From the ‘hands of the clock’, the remaining time to 2012 has been cal culated. Although the theory seems very plausible in itself, the calculations ar e slightly off perfect, so it leaves room for doubt! Around the same time the crop circles started to ap pear two decades ago, claims emerged about abductions by aliens. These claims fr om all over the world are often neglected; in most cases they are officially ridiculed. According to Steven Greer of the Disclosure Project , the U.S. government is intentionally ridiculing the UFO subject to mislead the public at large. Today doubts still exist about the investigations c arried out concerning the alleged recovery of UFO remains that crashed near R oswell, New Mexico in July 1947. Officially the U.S. Air Force Roswell case is closed but the whole incident has all the hallmarks of a cover up. There seems to be an enormous increase in UFO sighti ngs over Mexico City since 1991. Many amateur photographers have taken footage of UFO sightings and there are many eyewitness reports. Very unexpectedly and for the first time in history an official UFO news story was issued by the Mexican Ministry of Defense about a UFO encounter that occurred in May 2004 in the skies over Mexico. On the 5th of Ma y 2004, the Mexican Air Force recorded eleven unidentified flying objects o n infrared film. In a television news flash the pilots were explaining their encount er with these UFO’s and the footage of the encounter was broadcast on many stat ions across the world."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 176 In front of the camera, Major Magdaleno Castanon explained that they were following the UFO’s for at least 15 minutes. A t one time they were very scared because the UFO’s suddenly made a full turn and came after their plane; all of a sudden they were all around them encircling the pla ne. Now this official statement made by the Mexican gov ernment about a UFO sighting is unique. There have been lots of UFO sigh tings over Mexico and never before was there any official comment from the gove rnment. The question may be raised, why this sudden change in the policy abo ut the UFO phenomenon? Maybe they can no longer keep the lid on it and it’ s wiser to start telling the public at large about it? Let’s see if we will hear more official reports about UFO sightings in the future. Don’t worry that UFO’s will land on the White House la wn and take over control of this planet; these are all sci-fi horror fantasies. However I do believe that inter- dimensional extraterrestrial life has helped humani ty’s evolution throughout history with a positive intention to raise its cons ciousness. Now the time has come when humanity is speeding up its evolution to a critical threshold of scientific understanding where we are discovering t he divine nature of the universe, claims are that extraterrestrials are wit nessing and guiding this very unique event.

The return of the prophet Edgar Cayce before he died promised that he would b e back. He even mentioned the year of his return, 1998. Then if he was right about it where is he now? In his book ‘The reincarnation of Edgar Cayce’, Wynn Free states that the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce is David Wilcock. Wynn F ree has researched the claim made by David Wilcock himself that he is the r eincarnation of Edgar Cayce. David Wilcock is not just another ordinary scientist ; he calls himself an intuitive researcher and in fact is a psychic gifted person. He claims that he is in contact with the same source ‘Ra’ that was channelled by Ca rla Rueckert in the ‘Law of One’. Wynn Free who investigated this claim now thinks tha t all three Edgar Cayce, Carla Rueckert and David Wilcock were in fact in cont act with the same source ‘Ra’. It explains why Edgar Cayce so often made ref erences to the ‘Law of One’! He mentioned the ‘Law of One’ a number of times in his readings in relation with the Atlantean people who were split into two camps, the followers of Belial and the ‘Law of One’. These camps were at war according to Cayce. According to David Wilcock, it was Ra who informed hi m that he is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce. Further more Ra urged him to reveal his relation with Edgar Cayce to the public. He was shocked to h ear this in 1998 (the year mentioned by Cayce for return), because he knew tha t he would be ridiculed but Wilcock reluctantly went through with it. Wilcock sa ys he prefers to be respected for his scientific work than for his connection wit h Edgar Cayce. David Wilcock has written three books called the Convergence series, ‘The Shift of the Ages’, ‘The Science of Oneness’ and the ‘Divine Cosmos’. All three of his extensive research books are getti ng respect from scientist all over the world. Currently he’s working together wit h ex-NASA scientist Richard C Hoagland who claims that NASA is withholding the tr uth about many things, for one example the energetic changes that are occurrin g in our Solar System. Wilcock and Hoagland are developing a hyperdimension al ether physics model to"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 178 explain these phenomena and are presenting it withi n both the scientific and the public arena. Wilcock who has studied the ‘Law of One’ by Carla Ru eckert was guided by his spiritual guide Ra to collect proof from scientists all over the world that could corroborate the science dictated by Ra in the ‘Law of One’. The result is collected in the Convergence series. Now why should we believe a young man like David Wi lcock when he claims that he is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce? Of course o nly circumstantial evidence can be brought to the stand; however some pieces of the evidence are very convincing. For one thing as a young man he was alr eady gifted with psychic powers. Today he gives readings just like Cayce did for his clients. He predicted the attacks on the Twin Tower on the 11 th September 2001 in readings that were published on the Internet many years prior to the a ttacks. Wilcock’s readings are often very cryptic and are best understood in retro spect: Reading from 12 th June 1996: It's the greatest science fiction story ever told. Someone comes in - Rescue 911. CBS and ABC give it adequate coverage. A cast-iron fence is wrought around the victim's body... Reading July 9 th 1998: World Trade Center bombing really shook things up. The next time one tries something like this, it will become a much larger s tory, if the details are worked out properly . ( \u0004 ) Another amazing fact is that he is the spitting ima ge of the younger Edgar Cayce. The coincidence of facial alikeness doesn’t end wit h David Wilcock but continues with his friends and Edgar Cayce’s friends. Accordi ng to Wynn Free it appears as if a group of persons acquainted to Edgar Cayce, re incarnated in this life as the friends of Wilcock again. The most convincing evide nce however comes from the comparison of the astrological charts of the birth date of both Edgar Cayce and David Wilcock by astrologer Brian McNaughton. He dis covered that the astronomical charts of the birth date of Edgar Cayc e and David Wilcock are of such remarkable similarity as to rule out chance. The Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars that accordi ng to astrology determines a person’ s personality are in the same signs for b oth the birth date of Edgar Cayce and David Wilcock. McNaughton, starting from t he astrological chart of the birth date of Edgar Cayce, determined all the dates between the birth of Edgar Cayce in 1877 and the year 2000 that have the same alignment of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars and found to his asto nishment only one date; the exact birth date of David Wilcock! ( \u0005 ) Although the proof seems rather convincing, the Ass ociation for Research and Enlightenment (A.R.E.) that preserves the legacy of Edgar Cayce officially hasn’t recognized David Wilcock as the reincarnation of Edg ar Cayce.

Social difference s in the world have increased as a result of our greed, the rich simply got riche r and the poor got poorer. Humanity seems more apart than ever before. Christians around the world believe that Christ wil l return one day to Earth, as he has promised, to restore the power and glory of God . There are many today who believe the Second Coming is now at hand. Christian s believe in the rapture where God will take those who go in the name of Jes us Christ with Him to Heaven, the rest of us sinners will be punished and sent to Hell to do justice on Judgment Day. Muslim fundamentalists believe exactly the same thing and also feel the Armageddon will be here soon. The belief in the wrath of God has driven both reli gions into a blind belief in their own righteousness. George Bush, the President of Am erica, has turned into a Christian fundamentalist after his faith saved him from the booze and is now on a heroic crusade to eradicate all evil in this world. His mission is to establish a new world order. He has simply divided the world in two sections, the good and the bad, his axis of evil! He’s fighting his own holy w ar, his own Jihad with the blessing of God to kill the bad guys. God bless Ame rica! The bad guy is Bin Laden and his Islamic followers who are fighting the very same holy war with the very same intention, blessing and consent of their God. Both camps claim that God’s wrath is on their side. How ironic! The polarizations between clashing religions in the political arena has led to the same ‘us and them’ polarization throughout all laye rs in our societies. People have become scared and it is this fear that has ren dered George Bush a second term. At the same time away from the masses a new awarene ss is awakening to humanity that reveals that there is only Oneness in the universe. We are all children of the One universal consciousness! This a wareness seems to come in the right time and in the right place. We are spiri tually deprived of a universal wisdom! All the polarizations in this world stem fr om our failure to see the unity that connects us all. The source of our polarizatio ns stem from our judgmental nature to distinguish between what is good and what is wrong. Judgment is the instrument used by the ego to sustain its belief in an individual self! When I pass my judgment upon you, I’m actually expressing that I’m different from you and that I would never do that. Judgment is separation in action! Humanity is in a dire need of a spiritual wisdom that unites instead of separates since separation is the basis for all conflicts. Without it I feel ther e is no hope for humanity as we are perfectly able to destroy ourselves! Many have reso rted to politics and feel that all problems require a political answer. Do not be fooled, for politics is judgment with a capital J. It will never unite. Science has become a substitute for Western religio n.

It makes us co-creators with God! We have the power to shape our own destiny both individually and collectively! What we believe will ultimately be our reality! These revelations from science puts Jesus’s words a nd the Bible in a whole new perspective. The gospels were deliberately restrict ed and changed into dogmas at the council of Nicea in 325 AD to establish the pow er of the Catholic Church. As the recovered 13 ancient Nag Hamadi codices found i n upper Egypt in 1945 reveal, the Gospels of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip and the Gospel of Truth for instance were deliberately left out of our version of the Bible. Why, because they simply revealed too much esoteric knowledge! At the same time we were deprived of the ancient scientific knowledge that c an be traced back to the Egyptians and had its roots in the Atlantean cultur e. But let us now reread the same words in the Bible a nd find the words where Jesus speaks of His and humanity’s Oneness with the Fathe r: John 17: 22 -23 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you se nt me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Esoteric teachings have always told us that what we see outside of us is a mirror of our own beliefs and convictions. If we believe t he world is hard, bad and ugly and that we need to fight and compete in order to s urvive than that conviction will be reflected in our daily experience of life. However if we believe that the world is peaceful and that we will meet only friend ly people on our path, we will radiate this belief and attract loving and friendly people on our way! Christians have another way of saying it ‘what you reap is wha t you sow’. Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. We’ve come to a point in our evolution where we can start to understand the significance of these words in the Bible in a whole new perspective. I have come to believe that humanity has a great po tential that is now being unleashed in an awakening that is taking place glob ally. Humanity’s collective consciousness is rising to its true Divine potential . The distortions that Ra suggested have to do with our own misconceptions, o ur strong beliefs and convictions that we are just poor frail sinning ind ividuals who are passively subjected to a dangerous outside world that we have no control over. These distortions have led us into fear and despair. In his book the ‘The Isaiah effect’, Greg Braden ex plains a new mode of prayer that he derived from the Dead See scrolls found in the Qumram valley, especially the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. He learned that t he Essenes, who are the people of the lineage of both Isaiah and Jesus, tried to t each something about prayer that is new. Isaiah in the scrolls explains that a prayer should not be about asking, we should believe and act as if the prayer had already been fulfilled. Greg Braden continues to explain that we should have a s trong believe and intensely visualize, feel and see with as much of our senses as possible the outcome of what we are asking for in our prayer. The trick is to believe that our prayers have"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 182 already been fulfilled and never doubt it afterward s. That is when we start to live our true Divine powers. In his book Greg Braden compares the wisdom of the Essenes with modern day quantum science and concludes that the Essenes’ wis dom is not based on some ancient pagan belief but can be substantiated by qu antum science. ( \u0001 ) The same message of Isaiah comes from Jesus as he t ells us that we have failed to ask in the right way: John 16:23-24 In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whateve r you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete . Most people who pray send out a request to God and hope that it will be answered instead of knowing their own powers and kn owing who they really are! The trick is not to ask and wait until it is given, but to know that it is given even before you have asked! You ar e in control as you are the Creator! Jesus told us that his powers to perform miracles a re not His alone but will awaken in all of us: John 14:12 He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. Could it be that the Second Coming of Christ is not about the physical return of the historical person Jesus of Nazareth but about t he awakening of Christ consciousness in all of us, a global awakening? There are new spiritual teachings on Earth that wer e passed on to us in the last two decades that I believe try to explain exactly t he same matters that Jesus tried to teach humanity but have been misconstrued by our religions. After 2000 years Jesus’ his message is brought to us in a new perspective that today is much easier to accept than it was 2000 years ago. We now have a scientific framework that allows us to understand these words without cr ucifying the messenger of the news! The book, ‘A Course in Miracles’ was channelled to Dr. Helen Schucman in 1975 through a process of inner dictation. According to Schucman, the inner voice revealed itself as the historical Jesus of Nazareth . There have been millions of copies sold of this teaching in many languages arou nd the world already. This teaching is non-dualistic and tells us that God and man are One. It stresses the importance of forgiveness and teaches that sin and judgment are tricks used by the ego to sustain the belief in separation. ‘A Cou rse in Miracles’ teaches that Jesus did not die on the cross to pay for our sins but that his crucifixion was really to show us that we crucify ourselves and tha t resurrection is available to all of us. In summary, ‘A Course in Miracles’ is not a new religion, it is an individualised course aimed at changing the thought system such that all the false beliefs in a separate ego, the tendency to judgment and the strong belief in sin are undone. ( \u0002 ) "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 183 Around the same time another teaching was channelle d called the ‘Law of Attraction’ by Esther Hicks who channelled a source called ‘Abraham’. The ‘Law of Attraction’ is becoming popular in the United State s and is a used by a number of personal trainers. Most of them are presumably form er NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) trainers and teachers who claim that t hey have modelled the strategies and success factors of those who were su ccessful in life. They now use the ‘Law of Attraction’ to tell us that everything in our universe is fundamentally a vibration from the physical to the mental domain. O ur own thoughts and emotions are vibrations too and will attract like v ibrations. In other words, we create our own reality and receive exactly what we believe to be true. It is a vicious circle since what we believe is true keeps getting back at us. This acts as a confirmation that only reinforces our beliefs. Gi ven a negative attitude, this is the reason why people tend to cling on the same rep etitive patterns that only seem to hurt them. If we want to break free from th e entrapment of the circle of repetitive behaviour that is hurting us, we should not put our focus on what we don’t want, but instead put our focus on what we do want! These new gurus of the power of the human mind teach businessman today to do business in a completely new way. They tell them to release thems elves from the archaic old burden of Darwinism, the belief that business is all about competition and the survival of the fittest. Instead businessmen are ta ught to put their positive intention, focus and awareness on their goals and w atch how magic will happen, for the universe will deliver abundant oppo rtunities for those who have asked in the right way! ( \u0004 ) We live in a very special time, a time of great chan ges. It is as if we live in a time capsule that is rapidly unfolding in this special e poch in human history. There is an avalanche of knowledge available to mankind sinc e the dawning of the Internet that is speeding up our evolution tremendo usly. When viewed in retrospect it seems no coincidence that we had to d evelop to a technological and scientific awareness before a new spiritual awarene ss could be birthed. Many sources claim that humanity has received help from the spiritual dimensions and from extraterrestrials throughout the ages to come to a point that we would be mature enough to make a quantum leap in consciousne ss. In this respect we have received the channelled works of the ‘Law of O ne’, of Seth, ‘the Law of Attraction’, ‘A Course in Miracles’. Another aid ha s been the crop circles. By studying our past, many pieces of the puzzle seem t o fit now and it seems that the ancients left us clues about the importance of the galactic alignment of 2012. The ancient 2012 prophecies of the Mayans, the prop hecies of the Incas, the Hopi Indians, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce, Jesus and many o thers predicted that a global shift in consciousness would occur around th is time on Earth after a time of tribulation. Smelyakov, Karpenko and Terrance McKen na have given us clues that our evolution occurred in fractal repetitions follo wing the Golden Mean ratio. Time itself may be spiralling into an end point that cor responds with the 2012 Mayan predictions. Could it be that our evolution is inde ed pulled from the future instead of being pushed from the past like chaos theory sug gests and that the fractal attractor of our evolution coincides with the winte r solstice galactic alignment of 2012 and the end time of the Mayan Long Count Calen dar? If there is ever to be a shift in global consciousn ess to occur on this planet as has been prophesised, I believe the time is here and no w! This book is my attempt to share many of the marvel lous things scientists have discovered in this very special time of history. Yo u may either marvel or have fallen into a complete disbelief about the subject. To me personally I’ve become very hopeful about a new future for humanity. I’ve always felt and believed that"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Souls of Distortion Awakening 184 the world we live in could not be God’s will. I fin ally came to understand that His and our will are not disjointed. We have the possibi lity and the power within us to shape a bright new future for our children, a time of peace and understanding, a true Heaven on Earth. Since the majority is unaware of the pending change s, the prophecies of the past when they come to pass, may hit us by surprise just like it has been prophesised! Matthew 24: 37-39 Jesus: For the coming of the Son of Man will be jus t like the days of Noah. For as in those days which w ere before the flood they were eating and drinking, they were marrying and gi ving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered t he ark, and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so shall the com ing of the Son of Man be. Maybe this book took you by surprise? If it did, I want you to consider this: All truth passes through three stages: First, it is ridiculed Second, it is violently opposed Third, it is accepted as self-evident!
