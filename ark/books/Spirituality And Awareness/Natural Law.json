If the information presented here resonates true to you, I very highly recommend checking ou t his work, and researching the topics written about in this thesi s for yourself. There are numerous others who have covered natural law and its workings; but I find Mark’s material, and what comprises this thesis , to be the most important aspects of it . I have tried to make every concept that is written about as clear a s possible, but if there are certain things of which you don’t know what they are , or don’t understand, I recommend just lookin g t hem up on the internet . The last that i s being asked of you, is to just believe anythin g you read here . When I started researc hing this topic some years ago, at first, I didn’t f ully grasp the importance of it, it was just another set of “ rules ” to me. But for some reason, I felt compelled to do some more research, and by doing so, I was able to connect the dots, see the big pict ure, and the current human condition for what it really is. I wrote this because I feel that once somebody comes to a deep understanding of this knowledge, they will almost be obliged to live according to it; or know for a fact that their behaviour is immo ral and wrong. I find that a quote by Mark Passio h imself describes t his quite well: “ In a time of such overwhelming ignorance of this critical information, the fact that I do understand it places me in a position o f moral obligation to speak this informa tion to others, in an attempt to help them to understand it, and live it, as well.” This man is not a “ g uru” of any kind, nor does he claim to be . I t is simply about the information being presented ; n ot the presenter, or the way it is being presented that matter.  "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Before we Begin This first section is called before we begin, and ‘ begin ’ is the key word here; this is an initiation into very deep ly esoteric material, that has been hidd en from humanity for decades . If you feel that the current hum an condition and life on Earth are tolerable just the way they are , and you are content with our global situation as it is now , then there is nothing for you to find here. T he information you will e ncounter in this thesis is not new information . W hile it w ill most likely be new to most who read it, all of this information can be found in numerous differe nt books, seminars, and lectures written by numerous different people. As the old saying goes: “T here is nothing new under the sun. ” This simply means that truth is singular and eternal. It has always been here and will always be here ; i t is our perception s that must be aligned with it. Some of you are very likely to be angered by the things you are about to read, so be it. The fact of the matter is that tr uth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent ; because it wages war against all forms of falsehood and deception. If you wish to take away any real value from reading this thesis, you should make a deliberate effort to be consciously aware of any impulse s you may have to reject certain information presented, solely based on your initial emotional reaction to it. It is a logical fallacy to gauge the veracity ( truthfulness ) of any information based on how you feel when first he aring it; because you cannot “think” with the emotions. I f you read something you don’t like, or something that angers you, that’s okay, feel the emotion . B ut don’ t immediately tell yourself it can’t be true. Of course you s houldn’t just believe anything you read here ei ther; it’s ab out checking the information for yourself, and to actually start researching this material for yourself . A nd this is a great place to start that journey . However, this entire thesis is a tapestry. L ike pieces of a huge jigsaw puz zle; i t is meant to be seen and taken in as a whole, in its entirety . It is highly recommended that you read the entire thesis from beginning to end, otherwise, you will most likely not recognise the patterns inherent to the tapestry. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 Teachability A person ’s teachability, or t heir ability to learn by being taught by another, is extremely dependent upon the open - mindedness or closed - mindedness of the person being taught. Low teachability derives from arrogance and rigid scepticism, but also from naiveté and gullibility. High te achability derives from a balance between healthy scepticism and an o pen - minded willingness to learn , and more importantly, willingness to change . People should consider with great care their sources for information . Because by refusing to present certai n information, and by influencing people to dismiss certain information as unimportant or unnecessary to consider, many modern institutions (like the mainstream media, or so - called “ educational ” institutions ) seek to control human perceptions and by doing so, limit what human beings may come to understand . And by limiting what a person is able to understand, a person is automatically limited in what they are able to do , what they are able to change , and what they are able to create . So again, you should not just believe anything you read here . Y ou need to look into the information written about in this thesis for yourself, and most importantly, personal introspection is necessary ; to really feel within whether or not this i nformation resonates with truth. E v ery person has that intuitive capacity to a certain degree . "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Requirements & the Role of Knowledge People everywhere say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as a whole, such as happines s, health, peace, freedom, etc. W hich of course are all great things to aspire to, and most people will say that they want these things. However, it feels as though they aren’t being truly honest with themselves, because when they are told that those aren’t autom atic condi tions that manifest themselves , and that there are specific requirements for us to obtain these conditions , t hey usually don’t want to hear about it . Also, people wouldn’t say they want these conditions if they were already omnipresent . P eople say they wan t something because they don’t already have it, whet her it be partially , or in full. This is what the real law of attraction is about; it explains that conditions of which you say you want them, don’t automatically manifest by thinking of them, or just hav ing a feeling about them. There are certain requirements for obtaining those conditions. Of course, this statement only counts i f you want something to be different than the way it already is; if you’re completely o kay with the way things are now, requirem ent doesn’t exist. We need to know certain things . Knowledge that will ultimately lead us to positive action i s what ’ s required. Specifically, t he knowledge of the requirements to obtaining the conditions we say we want . H owever, if this knowledge is absen t it obviously can’t be obtained and used to create change. But if it is present , then it must be wilfully being ignored , and a s long as this knowledge continues to remain unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired conditions will be impossible . And t hat is exactly wha t this thesis is about; what those requirements are , and what this knowledge consists of. Occult Knowledge This knowledge is ‘Occulted , ’ meaning it is ‘Hidden .’ Derived from the Latin adjective ‘ Occultus ’ which means ‘ Concealed / H idden from s ight , ’ which is in turn derived from the Latin verb ‘ Occultare ’ which means ‘to K eep s ecret / to C onceal . ’ Just like in English, the word ‘Ocular’ means ‘Related to the e ye / Related to s ight , ’ which is derived from the Latin noun ‘ Oculus ’ mean ing ‘Eye . ’ O ccult knowledge is certain information that has been ‘h idden from the e ye ’ for a specific reason. Occult knowledge constitutes both the knowledge of human consciousness and how it operates, and the knowledge of natural law , the unseen universa l spiritual laws which govern the consequences of human behaviour. In the a ncient mystery tra ditions and occult schools, these concepts are known as the two ‘Arcana’ which translates to ‘Secret’ in both Latin and Greek ( ‘ Arcanum ( μυστικό ) ’ in Greek ) ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 The Lesser (Minor) Arcana : Secret knowledge of the microcosm . – Deals with individu al units of consciousness; the h uman psyche . → How it operates, where our motivations come from etc. (‘lesser’ does not mean it is less important, but s imply that it’s ‘ smaller ’ ) T he Greater (Major) Arcana : Secret knowledge of th e macrocosm. – Understanding of the large (universal) laws of Nature that govern the macrocosm. → Natural Law. Natural Law The word ‘Natural’ is d erived from the Egyptian word ‘ N eter (Ntr) ’ which translates to ‘ Spirit / God ’ a nd the suffix ‘ - a l , ’ which , just as in English, means: ‘ R elated to / Of / Having c ome f rom . ’ I t can be readily seen th at the word ‘Natural’ (Neter + - al) means ‘ Related to - or, h aving come from Spirit / God . ’ Natural Law : Universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of behaviour for intelligent species ; meaning beings that are capable of coming to an understanding of Self / Consciousness , and also capable of understanding the objective difference be tween harmful and non - harmful behaviour towards themselves and other beings . This does not include the animal kingdom . F or the very same reason you wouldn’t attempt to teach mathematics to your cat or dog, this same goes for animals understanding natural l aw. This is because we don’t share the same level of consciousness. There are differences in levels of consciousness, and a being’s abilit ies to comprehend information. N ot every being has the ability to come to an understanding of how som ething like natur al law works. Therefore, we are held to different standards when it comes to us understandin g natural law. Sadly, within the human population such knowledge also isn’t commonly known because it has been deliberately hidden in order to create and maintain a power differential between those who know that information , and those who are ignorant of it. The knowledge of natural law and its operations constitute some of the most deeply occulted information on Earth , which the powers that be seek to keep hid den f rom the people , because the understanding of this information would l evel the playing field and put an end to the currently operating systems of control. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Nescience vs. Ignorance : The Contexts of not Knowing We should make a very clear distinctio n between nescience and ignorance , so that the difference between these two concepts is fully understood. The term nescience is one that has been practically “ de leted ” from colloquial English. These are the two contexts to not knowing somethi ng; the first term ‘ Nescience ’ is derived f rom the Latin verb ‘ Nescire , ’ which means ‘t o N ot k now s omething because necessary information was absent or unattainable . ’ The prefix ‘ N e - ’ in Latin means ‘ Not / N ot Present / Absent . ’ The second part of the word nescience is derived from the Latin verb ‘ Scio / Sciero ’ which means ‘ I know . ’ Therefore, in case of n e science it is impossible for a person to aggregate necessary information. Contrary to i gnorance , nescience isn’t a person’s fault; the information simply isn’t availa ble for them to perceive . The term ‘ Ignorance’ is derived from the Latin verb ‘ Ignorare ’ which means ‘ to N ot know something even though necessary information is present ; because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded . ’ This is u sually be cause of disin terest or contradicting beliefs. Ignorance , contrary to nescience , carries blame . Because the person has wilfully chosen to ignore the information. For t he va st majority of people this information is readily available to them , but most people choose to ignore it because they feel they don’t need to know it, or because it contradicts something they already believe in. Therefore, we live in an ignorant society. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 What this t hesis constitutes is a master - k ey that has the power to unlock all the l ocks, and all the doors, to all the “ mental cages , ” but only if it is accepted (not believed). This process starts by perceiving truth’s presence, acknowledging truth’s presence , accepting it for what it truly is, and then finally and most importantly, to do something with it . Understand ing this information is not where this work ends ; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, a ction is required. People often say, ‘ change happens in the heart ’ or ‘ ch ange happens in the mind , ’ which is true , but lastly it happens in the guts . If you have the “guts” to do something , you have developed the courage to do something . We must develop all three, h eart, m ind, and g uts ; we must care enough to know , and then fin ally convert that knowledge into action . Because taking action is t he most important step towards creating change in the physical realm . 1. Knowledge → 2. Understanding → 3. Action Problem Solving There are a few m ain steps to solving a problem, any prob lem at all . It doesn’t matter what the nature of the problem is. 1. Recognis e that there is a pr oblem to begin with . Fear - based denial must first be dealt with and conquered. Denial will only make the problem grow. 2. Recognis e that symptoms are merely effects of underlying causes. I nstead of treating symptoms, you must make an accurate diagnosis of the cause(s) of the problem . ( Diagnosis : from the Greek preposition ‘ D ia - (δια) ’ mean ing ‘ Through / B y wa y of , ’ and the Greek noun ‘ G nosis (γνωσις) ’ which means ‘ K nowledge . ’ The term ‘Diagnosis’ etymologically means ‘B y way of k nowledge ’ ) And in doing so, you will come to an understanding of what cause has put certain symptoms into effect. 3. Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required action(s) necessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem.  "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 Truth vs. Perception For some reason, when people hear t he term ‘ t ruth’ most tend to immediately jump to incredibly mystified conc epts of what truth is (to them); starting to immediately relate the concept to God , or something else that is completely irrelevant. A ll this is , is mystification and obfusca tion of what truth actually is. Perception is not equal to reality or truth . For example, when a person who is visually impaired removes their glasses . The reality (t ruth) will remain the same , while the perception of that indiv idual may drastically change. Truth is objective , meaning it is not based on the perceptions of human beings. This can be seen as an assaul t on the human ego; as everybody likes to think their perceptio ns are important and accurate. Human perceptions can differ slightly from the truth, or th ey can differ wildly from the truth. The truth does not waver, it d oes not move, bend, or change; i t is that which is. It doesn’t matter whet her anybody believes it, knows it, sees it, n or if anybody wants to see it. I t’s there, it has always been there, a nd it will always be there. Nobody can cha nge what has already happened, t he past can impossibly be altered. Unlike the future; a nd the alteration of the future begins in the present moment. All that truth is, is all that has happened in the p ast, and t hat which is happening at the present moment . That which is, and that which has been. Whenever the term ‘Truth’ is used in this thesis, that is all that is being referred to. In the picture shown here, imagine the white lines which do not waver to be truth , and every coloured line to be the perception of a n individual. Their ability to perceive what has occurred, and what is occurring, can be referred to as consciousness (a being’s ability to recognise patterns and meaning inside, and around themselves); whi ch can be either accurate, or inaccurate. In case of a low frequency vibration (red line), t he wa velength will be longer, and the wave won’t frequently hit the white line. In case of a high frequency vibration (blue line) , the wavelength will be a lot shor ter, and the wave hits the wh ite line a lot more frequently. The higher the frequency of a person’s consciousness is, the more their wave of perception hits the line of truth . "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Solipsi sm Solipsism is a completely ego centri c and destructive i deology, that has absolutely no resem blance to truth in any way. Pe ople who are solipsists , whether they know they are or not, usually have a des tructive influence on society. The word ‘Solipsism’ is derived from the Latin adjective ‘Solus’ which means ‘Alone / Only’ a nd the Latin pronoun ‘Ipse’ which means ‘Self / Myself’ – ‘Only m yself / t he Se lf al one . ’ The ideology of a solipsist is: ‘ Nothing exists outside of me, I am the only being that exists in creation , and everything I perceive is created by me .’ O r in other w ords, ‘ I am God . ’ They believe that their perception is the only real perception, and that nobody else outside themselves truly even exist s . What this thesis teaches, is that your perception isn’t always truth; you have to work to align your perceptions w ith the truth . Hearing this can already be damaging enough to the ego for some people . But what a solipsist believes is that you don’t even exist, and your existence is fully based on his or her perception . T herefore, in their mind, so are your own percept ions. Solipsism also happens to be the third sin of Satanism , meaning that Satanists don’t want any solipsism within their own community of followers , but they think it’s alright for others to live according to this ideology . The first sin of S atanism hap pens to be stupidity, which is also something that is looked down upon within their community, but considered fine for others. In short, solipsism is the ideology that only one’s own mind is sure to exist . Solipsists contend that knowledge of anything o ut side one’s own mind is unsure. T here fore, to them, there is no such thing as objective truth, and nothing about the external world and it s wor kings can actually be known. This state of mind only ensures a person to feel comfortable in their ignorance and l aziness. Definition of Natural Law Before we look at the definition of n atural law, let’s look at the definition of the word ‘ Definition ’ – ‘ An exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of a word , concept, or object . / The degree of clarity of an object, image, or sound; for example, a high definition television. ’ To make something (de) finite, as opposed to infinite. The more accurate our definitions for words or concepts are, the better our clarity of meaning , and therefore, our und erstanding of those words or concepts will be. Therefore , ‘ D efinition ’ means ‘ Clarity of m eaning ’ when applying it to words and concepts. Since most of this thesis is going to be about natural law from here on out , we must know the definition of the concep t : • Natural : Inherent / Having a b asi s in Nature, r eality, and t ruth / Not m ade or ca used by h u mankind. • Law : An existing condition which is both binding and immutable (cannot be changed). "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Natural law is a testable hypothesis , meaning it is testable by s c ientific m ethodology : Question → Gather i nformation → Hypothesis e → Observe → Analyse and t est d ata → Draw c onclusion → Communicate your results . This works because natural law is not a religion or a belief system , but a science . Working definition of natural law : Universal, non - man - mad e, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behaviour f or all intelligent beings . Na tural law is a set of u niversal spiritual laws which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness. D iscovery vs. Belief Natural law is capable of being discovered , understood, and harmonized with ; unlike religion , which asks to believe, accept as is , and do without question . You could best try to understand the way natural law works like you understand the law of gravity , and therefore wouldn’t wa lk over the edge of a cliff. The law of gravity does not require your belief to be in effect; and neither does natural law . B elief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation of all laws of Nature, such as g ravity, i nertia, m oment um, t hermodynamics, and e lectromagnetism. Similar to such other phenomena of Nature, the workings of n atural law don’t require belief in order to be oper ational, discovered, and known. “There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what is not to tru e; the other is to refuse to accept what is true.” – Søren Kierkegaard, Danish Philosopher"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Consciousness and the Brain Consciousness : The ability of a being to recognise patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place; both within oneself, and in the realm in which the self exists and operates.

These expressions are: - Thoughts : Creative (neutral) f orce  ♀ + ♂ - Emotions: Internal expression  ♀ - Actions: Result of thought and emotion being expressed into the physical realm. ♂ Like in almost all majo r religious traditions, this represents the ‘H oly t rinity ’ : The f ather creator (thoughts), and the s acred feminine figure (emotions), which the father figure impregnates or inseminates in some form.

The three main complexes that compr i se the human brain are: - The R - Complex (Reptilian Brain): B asic survival functions - The Limbic system (Mammalian Brain) : Human emotion - The Neocortex (Human Brain): H igher thought funct i ons and consciousness • The R - Complex becomes active when we are in ‘ fight - or - flight ’ mode ; when survival is at stake. This part of the brain also controls basic motor skills and respiration. It is comprised of the brainstem and the cerebellum. It is the lo west conscious part of the brain , meaning it is not a “ thinking ” part of the brain, merely a part of the brain that reacts to stimulus. • The Limbic system , also referred to as the ‘mid - brain , ’ makes it possible for us to feel in our physical realm. It does this by releasing neuropeptides into the bloodstream via different glands that comprise the l imbic system, for example: the pineal gland , the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland etc. It is the part of our brain which ma kes all human emotions possible. I f this particular part of the brain would not function properly you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions. This is part ially what psychopathy is ; w ith psychopaths this part of the brain does not function properly . W hich could be due to some form of birth disorder, or from chronic conditions in someb ody’s life which have ‘ numbed ’ this particular part of the brain. • The Neocortex is structurally the highest part of the brain , and evolutionary the newest part of the brain. The word ‘ Neo’ derives from the Greek adjective ‘Néos (νέος)’ which means ‘New . ’ It ’ s where all the electrochemical activity that comprise our human ‘ modes of thought ’ take place ; t hat which we consider the things in thought that make us human , and separ ate us from the animal k ingdom. By higher thought functions is mean t for example: logic, intuition, creat ivity etc. It is basically the outer layer of the brain’s grey matter. So a s far as evolutionary development of the human brain goes , it is the newest part of our brain struct ure. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 The two hemispheres of the brain are bilaterally symmetrical , meaning they are able to be divided into approximate mirror ed images of each other along the midline . The two separate halves generally control differen t functions of the brain. Th e left , intellect ual part of the brain (masculine): l ogic, analytical thought , math etc. And t he right , intui tive part of the brain ( feminine): creativity, intuition , compassion etc. When there is a healthy balance between the two hemispheres of the brain, that ’ s when real consciousness, and pattern recognitio n is developed. As well as true morality, and ethical consideration. Intellect is not the same as intelligence. Intellect is left brain understanding; while intelligence is holistic understanding , with the right brain included in the process. The word ‘Intelligence’ is made up of ‘Intelli + Gence . ’ The ‘Intelli’ part derives from ‘Intellect , ’ and ‘G ence’ comes from the Latin verb ‘ G ignere’ which means ‘to Generate / to C reate / to B ring f ort h . ’ So , inte llect + creativity / logic + compassion etc . , that is real intelligence , holistic intelligence . Sadly, m ost people in our society are not holistically i ntelligent ; they’re usually in some form of either l eft - or right brain imbalance. If the left brain bec omes chronically dominant, the R - Complex will take over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by selfishness and base desires . T hey usually develop a personality based on domination and control . If the right brain becomes chroni cally dominant, the Limbic System takes over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by their own emotions . T hey usually develop a personality based on submissiveness and naiveté .

Natural law is expressed through seven basic underlying principles , plus an eighth ‘ lost ’ principle which binds the other seven together. These principles constitut e a ‘ master key ’ through which u niversal wisdo m is unveiled. These are the seven principles of n atural law : 1. Mentalism : All is mind, and everything is energy. 2. Correspondence : As above, so below. Reflecting qualities . 3. Vibration : Nothing is stationary, everything gives off light or sound. 4. Polarity : Everything comes in pairs, and has its polar opposite. 5. Rhythm : All is ebb and flow ; action - reaction, advance - recoil etc. 6. Cause and Effect : Everything happens according t o natural law. 7. Gender : Animate or inanimate, everything has its male and female properties . These are also know n as the ‘Hermetic principles , ’ derived from the name of the Greek God: Hermes ( Ερμής ) , who was called the ‘M essenger of the Gods . ’ 1. Mentalism → All is mind ; the u niverse is mental. Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation . Thoughts create our state of existence and the qua lity of our experience here on E arth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create , by being responsible for everything you think . 2. Correspondence → T hat which is above i s like to that which is below, t hat which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of each other. The universe is self - similar across all scales. 3. Vibration → Nothing rests, everything moves. At the most fundamental level, the u niverse and everything that comprises it is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The u niverse has no ‘solidity’ as such ; t he u n iverse is ‘holographic . ’ Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration . 4. Polarity → Everything is d ual , everything h as poles. Everything has its opposit e. Opposites are identical in n ature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all thing s that seems con tradictory may be reconciled. 5. Rhythm → Everything flows ; out and in , in and out. E verything has its tides . A ll things rise and fall . The pendulum swing manifests in everything. The measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing t o the left. Rhythm compensates. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 6. Cause and Effe ct → Every cause has its effect , and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law . Chance is but a name for law not recognised. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law . There is no free will to ignore law without cons equence ; t hat is the limit of free will . This is why n atural law is also sometimes referred to as consequentialism . 7. Gender → Gender is in everything, everything has it s masculine and feminine pr operties ; g ender manifests on all planes. While every person has a biological sex, psychologically both qualities exist simultane ously in everyone, and everything.  The seven principles are represented here by these seven circles that form the Seed of Life , which are encapsulated by an 8 th circle, which ho lds all the others together . 8. Care ( the 8 th ‘lost’ principle) → This principle encapsula tes all seven other principles; if you look at the seven circles that form the seed of life, the eighth added circle forms the outer shell. Without this shell present and intact, the creative (generative) e ssenc e of the seed will be lost. Care (not compassion) is whatever you give attention to , and help to grow. This does not mean you should n ’ t care for, or ignore any negative things in the world because you think that will feed into it and give power to it ; if that happens only ignorance is being fed into it. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it will occur . The lost p rinciple is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do , to spend your time on , to pay attention to , and to manifest into reality . What we care about on a day - to - day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions. What we as conscious beings need to develop are heart , mind , and guts , in that order . W e must care enough to know , and then act a ccordingly to that understood knowledge. All three must be in place to gain unity consciousness ; unifying thoughts, emotions, and actions. Therefore, care can be seen as the ultimate generator of the quality of our experience of life. Hence the eighth prin ciple is also known as the generative principle. True care is created in our hearts, the ‘ pump ’ that causes our blood to flow through our body , in many ancien t traditions they spoke of the ‘ life force ’ being in the blood. As important as the brain is, the heart is ultimately generating the experience. Because what we care about becomes what we think abou t, and therefore , how we behave. That which we care enough about to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created in our w orld. The reason the world i s in the state it’s in , is because most people do not care enough (even if they say they want things to be different) to change it through their behaviour .

This analogy can be seen very readily in the sayings ‘ spending time ’ and ‘p aying attention . ’ Whatever information or endeavours we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting something in return for that investment. This return could come in the form of knowl edge, unde rstanding, skills, or expertise . However, this only happens i f we invest our spiritual currencies wisely. W e should seek to improve the quality of our attention by directing it towards information that is capable of improving both our own lives , as well as the human condition as a whole. Such an effort would constitute a va luable investment of our time. We should more frequently ask ourselves the questions : “ W hat am I spending my time on? W hat am I paying attention to? ” A nd most importantly , “ W ha t kind of quality am I getting in return for these investments of my spiritual currencies? ” "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 N atural Law also know n as... Natural Law has had many different names in many different traditions throughout the world in different times in history. Some e xamples are: Law of Cause and Effect : – “Effect invariably follows cause.” – “For every action, there exists an equal and opposing reaction . ” Law of Attraction : – “The energy you emit is the energy you attract.” – “Energy flows where attention goes.” – “As you think, feel, and act – so you shall be.” Karmic Law or Moral Law : – “You reap what you sow.” Golden Rule : – “Do not do to others as you would prefer not to have done onto you.” "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 Natural Law Expressions Chart (how it works) These expressions are the recognisable workings of natural law in human life that manifest through five basic expressions, which each have a positive and a negative aspect. Giving us a total of ten o verall natural law expressions, which are all explained in detail on the fo llowing pages. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 1. + The positive aspect of the Generative Polarity is ‘ L ove . ’ In regard to natural law, love should be seen as the expansive force for consciousness . Lov e is the force which helps us become open to truth, and expand our awareness. - The negative aspect of the generative polarity is ‘ F ear . ’ In regard to natural law, fear should be seen as the contractive force for consciousness . Fear is the force which influences us to become closed to truth, and the force which ultimately shuts down our awareness. 2. + The positive aspect of the Initiating Expression is ‘ K nowledge , ’ or the acceptance of truth. Knowledge positively influences our decision - making processe s in every area of our lives. - The negative aspect of the initiating expression is ‘ I gnorance , ’ or the refusal of truth. Ignorance negatively influences the quality of our lives because it negatively influences our decision - making processes in every area of our lives. It is important to remember that ignorance should be distinguished from nescience. Nescience means not knowing something because necessary information is not present, or unattainable . Ignorance, on the other hand, means not knowing something even though necessary information is present, because that information has been wilfu lly refused or disregarded. “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.” – Thomas Jefferson , 3 rd president of the U. S .A. “The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance .” – Socrates, Greek philosopher 3. + The positive aspect of the Internal Expression is ‘ Sovereignty , ’ or what is also referred to as ‘ Internal Monarchy ’ ( o ne r uler within) . The word monarchy is made up of the prefix ‘Mon - ’ derived from the Greek adverb ‘M on s (μόνα) ’ which means ‘One / Single / A lone’ and the Greek noun ‘Archon (αρχων) ’ which means ‘Master / Lord / Ruler . ’ T herefore, monarchy means ‘One Ruler . ’ As a state of consciousness, sovereignty means that one has unified the three aspects of their consci ousness, in the way that there is no contradiction between one’s thoughts, emotions, and actions. The word ‘ S overeign ’ is derived from the Latin adverb ‘Super ’ which means ‘Above / Beyond’ (In classical Latin the ‘V’ character represented a ‘ U , ’ hence the letter ‘W’ is called a ‘double U . ’ The “ V - sound ” didn’t phonetically exis t in classical Latin, instead the ‘V’ was represented by the letters ‘P’ o r ‘B’). The second half stems from the word ‘Regnum’ which means ‘ Reign / Rulership / (externally imposed) C o ntrol / Kingship . ’ Thus, the word ‘S overeign’ means: ‘One who is a bove the r ulership or c ontrol of another .’ Therefore, the word s overeign mean s ‘ n ot a slave . ’ Being sovereign means being a m ona rch (Mon - : ‘One’ / Archon: ‘R uler’), a single ruler who rules only the ‘ k ingdom of s elf . ’ Sovereignty is a state of being in which one controls one’s own thoughts, emotions, and actions, and by bringing them into Unity / Non - Contradiction / Non - Duality, attains mastery of one’s own consciousness. Self - Control = Sel f - Mastery = Self - Ownership "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 - The negative aspect of the internal expression is ‘ Confusion , ’ or what is also referred to as ‘ Internal Anarchy ’ (no r uler within). Confusion is the state of mind in which the being is ruled by fear and ignorance. Confusion c a n be seen as i nternal o pposition , in such a way that one’s thoughts, emotions, and actions are in perpetual contradiction with one an other ; t he three are not in alignment . A s we think is not how we truly feel , and is not how we act. There is complete contr adiction and separation when there is no unity amongst th e se three aspects of our consciousness . 4. + The positive aspect of the External Expression is ‘ Freedom , ’ or what is also referred to as ‘ External Anarchy ’ (no external r uler). True freedom for all bein gs should be seen as the ultimate goal of spiritual development. And s uch a state can only manifest as a result of human society’s adherence to natural law. - The negative aspect of the external expres sion is ‘ Control , ’ or what is referred to as External M o narchy ( o ne e xternal r uler ). For example, t he concentration of illusory power by a king, or by institutions like government. Externally imposed control is the pathway to all forms of evil and destruction . It results when a society lives in direct oppositi on to natural law. 5. + The positive M anifestation is ‘ Order , ’ or manifested goodness. Or der represents everything we truly want to manifest . Order results only when there is b alance and j ustice ; w hich can only be present when truth has been accepted , and our behaviour has been brought into harmony with natural law. - The negative manifestation is ‘ Chaos , ’ or manifested evil. Chaos is the e xact opposite of what we truly want to manifest . Chaos occurs when there is i mbalance and i njustice , which result s wheneve r there is ignorance of truth , and behaviour which is in opposition to natural law. All five expressions of natural law are unilateral , meaning they do not cross over into one another . Therefore, ther e is no way you could accept truth and develop knowledge , and then end up in a state of confusion. J ust as you cannot go from ignorance to sovereignty. The natural law expressions simply do n’ t work that way. If you keep waiting on an external saviour, you are going to be waiting in your chains forever . Even t he modern Christ - figure himself proclaimed that the knowledge of truth would be the only pathway to true freedom. Until you take in the light, you will never dispel the darkness . T he light being knowledge of truth ; w hich is what ‘l ight’ has always symbolized and represented in the bible, and in numerous other ancient mystery traditions . “ The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it. ” – John 1:5 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 Right vs. Wrong The concepts ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’ are diamet ric opposites of one an other. Right and wrong do not merely exist as concept s in the human mind , anybody who believes that is engaged in Satanism , whether they are aware of it or not. Explained in a wa y that’s completely unambiguous; i f you believe that there is no real differ ence betw een right and wrong, and that this concept isn’t inher ent in N ature, you are accepting a Satanic belief. Th is is b e cause the second tenet of Satanism is the concept of moral r elativism (left brain imbalance) . There are four main tenets - , also ref erred to as the ‘ pillars ’ of Satanism: 1. Self - preservation is the highest aspiration : If they must step on others to save them sel ves , so be it. 2. Moral relativism : To Satanists there is no such thing as the objective difference between right and wrong behaviou r . They consider ‘right’ to be what is ‘ good for me ’ and ‘wrong’ what is ‘ bad for me . ’ And that they themselves can make up the difference between the two , based on their own personal likes and preferences. 3. Social Darwinism : A ruling class delegates itself the right control and direct the masses, because they believ e they know better than the rest of humanity . 4. Eugenics : A social ideology advocating the promotion of higher rates of sexual reproduction for people with traits and characteristics desired by it s proponents, in this case Satanists, and reduced rates of sexual reproduction , or e ven sterilisation for those with undesired traits and characteristics. The word is d erived from the Greek adjective ‘Eugenes (εύγενής) ’ which means ‘Well - b orn / of Good s to ck / of Noble r ace . ’ Which is in turn derived from the Greek adjective ‘Eu - (ε ὖ - )’ which means ‘Good / W ell , ’ and the Greek noun ‘Genos (γένος) ’ which means ‘Birth / Race / S tock.’  Morality i s not about right versus left, it’s about right versus wrong. A deep understanding of morality , and the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behaviour , lies at the very heart of natural law ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Jus t as in ancient Rome the word ‘Liber’ meant ‘Book’ (Library), and ‘Free’ (Liberty) simultan eously. The word ‘Right’ means ‘Correct’ and ‘Moral’ simultaneously, as does ‘Wrong’ mean ‘Incorrect’ and ‘Immoral’ simultaneously. So , i n the sense of what you ‘ have a right to do , ’ w hat is a right? – A ny action in which you are correct and moral in doing so. Every single person ha s the same rights as the next; n ot one person has any more right s than another, nor any less rights, at any plac e, at any time. Knowing Rights Rights are most easily understood when they are considered through ‘ Apophatic Inquiry . ’ This process helps us to understand what a right actually is , by und erstanding which actions are not rights because they cause harm to other beings . The word ‘Apophasis’ is derived from the Greek noun ‘A pophanai (απόφασις) ’ which means ‘to S peak o ff . ’ W hich is a method of logical, deductive reasoning , that is employed when given a limited set of possibilities , in which we gain knowledge about something by excluding the known negatives , or b y setting the logical i nconsi stencies to the side . In other words, d escribing what something is , by explaining what it is not . Natural Law Transgressions Harmful Actions : • Murder / Assault – Ending a life without the right to do so. I f a being is killed in the act of somebody de fending themselves , it is not murder. Under no possible circumstance does the “right to m urder ” or the “right to assault” exist . However , the right to defend oneself th rough physical force exists at all times . • Rape – C oercing the free will of another pers on, and making them sexually associate with whom they wish not to. • Theft – Taking what somebody else has created or acquired through lawful means , which is their property for as long as they are using it and being responsible for it. You have no right to just take something t hat does not belong to you. • Trespass – Every person has the right to set aside a (reasonably sized) sp ace for themselves. And invading this area without permission or consent would be invading their privacy and their personal space , wh ile taking away their security in the process. • Coercion – Forcing somebody through threat of violence to have their will comply with yours , whether they wish that to be the case or not. Making somebody do something against their will is not a right. Althou gh this is already a short and seemingly simple list , all these transgressions can ultimately be nar rowed down to just one w rong - doing: Theft . "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Every harmful action that a person is capable of taking is a form of theft ; s ome form of property is always be ing stolen when a wrong - doing is committed. - Life is a form of property. - Rights are a form of property. - Freedom is a form of property. - A person’s own body is a form of property. A living being or their property must have been harmed or damaged in or der for a violation of natural la w, or a wrong - doing to have taken place. Any action which does not cause such harm to other sentient beings is a right. – No victim, no crime . This is the fundamental crux of natural law; what is right behaviour, and w hat i s wrong behaviour . There is no such thing as the delegation of a wrong - doing . I n other words , if a specific action is not a right for any individual , then that action cannot be “ delegated , ” “ granted , ” or “ lice nsed” to any other individual, or group of indi viduals , and suddenly be called a right . That actio n forever remains wrong under natural law. Rights can’t be granted to human beings by other human beings, because rights don’t come from human beings ; e verybody is born with the exact same rights. Natural law (the difference between right and wrong behaviour ) always holds true regardless of a population’s belief systems (culture) . This means th at it doesn’t mat ter how many people agree that a wrong action can be turned into a right action , or that a rig ht a ction can be turned into a wrong action . Such things can never be done in reality . People can only believe they can claim such reversals and that this will in some way make it so. Unfortunately, at this moment in time most people do erroneously believe tha t it is morally possible for some groups of people to create and delegate “ rights ” which do not exist , or to take away rights which do exist. When in doubt as to whether an action is , or is not in harmony with natural law, visualise the scenario of a world with only two people . If the behaviour is a right or a wrong in that instance, it shall forever remain a right or a wrong in any size population; regardless of how many people may believe otherwise. So, if the action is a right for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a right. And if the action is a wrong for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a wrong, regardless of the number of people involved. For example, let’s examine T axation for what is really is , without euph emising . Taxation is the claim that a group of people who call themselves ‘government’ ha ve been given or delegated the “ right ” to (forcibly) confiscate an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual’s labour (a form of property), w hether or not that person agrees to share that product voluntarily (coercion is involved). Taxation is enforced by the threat of theft (seizing property that is rightfully a person’s possession), the threat of imprisonment ( taking away the physical freedom of movement), or even the threat of violence (behaviour resulting in bodily harm) if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist the confisc ation. This practise is always “ justified ” by those who claim that such practise s are necessary a nd requi red to uphold the common good . T he word ‘J ustified ’ etymologically derives from the Latin words ‘Jus / Juris ’ which mean ‘Right / Law , ’ and the Latin verb ‘Facere’ wh ich means ‘to Create / to Make . ’ Therefore, ‘to J ustify’ etymologically means ‘to Create r ight / to Create l a w . ’ "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 If we define the concept of slavery as : the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of labour of another human being, we can clearly see that there is no percentage to which we could lower this number (other than 0%) that would no longer constitute slavery. M any people try to justify this by saying this money is used for different serv ices . H owever, we aren’t able to refuse most of these “ services . ” Imagine, you have a computer at home; one day a computer technician knocks on your door and tells you: “I am now your computer technician, and you are not allowed to refuse my services.” Immediately the right to c hoose (free will) has been taken away. Then he tells you “Whether you want or don’t want my technician services , I’m going to need $3 00, - every year, I’ll come over every two months to collect my money. I do not care if you are happy with my service or not, and if you refuse to pay me, I will take your computer.” Does it seem like the computer is truly yours , i f y ou are living under that k ind of coercion? Or does it seem more like a violent criminal telling you: “I am going to steal your possessions if you don’t give me what I say you should .” That sounds more like a form of extortion or duress, and that is what al l forms of taxation fall under; duress . If we are being completely honest with ourselves , taxation is merely a euphemism for theft, violence , and slavery ; these are the three practises on which it is actually based. Since no individual anywhere on Earth ha s the right to claim ownership of the product of another’s labour, such behaviour can never be delegated to a group of people , and called a “ right . ” Therefore, all forms of taxation are always wrong according to natural law. Another important example of so mething to examine for what it actually truly is, is P rohibition . W hether regarding drugs or junk - food, ingesting anything harmful into the body is strongly opposed , hopefully for obvious reasons ; purification of the body is an important part of purificati on of the mind . I t is crucial to recognise that anyone should be allowed to put anything inside their body, because they own their body . If an individual , for whatever reason , wants to ingest any given substance they always have the right to do so; because their body is their property. People easily tend to overthink the concept when confronted with the question whether their body is theirs or not. They often pause and ask themselves questions like : “ Am I going to own my body forever? I’m going to die somed ay, does th at mean I don’t own it now? ” This is a complete over - mystification of the concept. All sensible humans recognise that they will die someday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies . D oes that mean they don’t own their bod y righ t now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives - / exists inside) your body , which is one o f the specific reasons you own your body, t he other is that you are using your body right now. – Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using it as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness; your body is yours . Continuing on the topic of prohibition , i t is the claim that a group of people who call themselves ‘ g overnment’ have been given the “ right ” to prevent others from putting any given substance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they will be fined or imprisoned. I t should be self - evident that since an individual’s body is their own property, that individual always maintains the natural ri ght to decide what will or will not be put into their own property . In this instance, their own body. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 Imagine another person telling you that you aren’ t allowed to put your jacket into your car, or that you can’t put a certain piece of furniture inside yo ur home. Why is it that most people would not accept that, but do accept this concept regarding their own body? – Because people can’t seem to separate the act of imbibing the substance, and the action that someone may subsequent ly take, which are two diff erent things . A person may have some drinks, and get drunk if they wish to; b ut if that person goes out on the street afterwards an d starts beating somebody up for no reason, they obviously have no right to do that . However, an individual maintains the rig ht to go drinking, or use cocaine, or even inject heroine into their arm. They obviously aren’t good ideas , but every individual has the right to do so if they please ; as long as their subsequent behaviour isn’ t immoral and wrong. A nd if it is, they are st ill fully accountable for the action s they took, that’s what personal responsibility is. The two separate acts of a person having the right to put whatever they want into their own body, and still being personally responsible for whatever he or she may do with their body afterwards, need to be clearly delineated , and separated from each other. Understanding this, we ca n easily see that the claim of “ right ” to dictate what will or will not be put into the body of another person amounts to a claim of ownershi p upon the other person’s body. Imagine somebody telling you that you aren’t allowed to eat carrots or drink orange juice for example. The claim of ownership upon another person’s body is slavery . Therefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery, b acked by violence , re gardless of the justifications made by thos e who claim such practises are necessary to uphold the common good . Since no individual a nywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person’s body, such behaviour can neve r be delegated to a group, and called a right . Therefore , all forms of prohibition are always wrong according to natural law. Lastly, we will examine L icences and P ermits , keep in mind to also visualise the same scenario with only two people as was mention ed before. In that sense, most people can readily see that no single person, or group of people i s able to legitimately make these claim s to wards another person; regarding taxation, prohibition, licenses and permits . We have gotten to the point where most people a ctually believe that certain groups of people have created rights for themselve s that other people don’t have. Licences and permits are claims that a group of people who call themselves ‘government’ have been giv en the “ right ” to prevent other peop le from exercising specific behaviours , e ven if such behaviours cause no harm to others, or their property . U nless those people petition (definition of petition: “a formally drawn request, that is addressed to a person or group of persons in authority or p ower, soliciting some favour, right, mercy, or other benefit.” ) , or pay the government for permission (wh ere the word ‘ permit’ is derived from) to be allowed to exercise those behaviours. This amounts to th e claim that rights are merely privileges that may be grante d or taken away by government at any time, based upon the people in governm ent’s preference or discretion. Remembering tha t the definition of a right is: ‘ any action which does not cause harm to another sentient being or their property. ’ It can b e readily seen that there is no such thing as the “ right ” to stop someone from exercising a right, since rights cause no harm. The claim over the rights of another person is called slavery , regardless of the justification made by those who claim such pract ises are necessary to uphold the common good . Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person’s right s, such behaviour can never be delegated to a group, and called a right . Therefore, all forms of licensing and permits are always wrong according to natural law."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Force vs. Violence Force and violence are often spoken about as if they are one and the same, and used interchangeably . Wh ile in fact, they are actually diametri cally opposed, polar opposites.  Force : “ The capacity to do work or cause physical change . ” → For any change to be created in the physical world in any capacity, physical force must be applied . There is nothing you can do to change something in the physical world, that doesn’t require for ce. The words you are reading right now were typed out by hand using physical force. Force is the capacity to perform physical work; physical change . “ Action which is in h armony with morality and natural l aw because it does n o t violate others’ r ights . ” → As soon as a person steps over that line, and uses initiation of force for coercive reasons or applications , that is what makes it violence instead of force . Force itself is not the same as violence. “ Action which one always possesses the r ight to take (in cludes defence against violence) ” → When you are approached with violence you reserve the right to use physical force defensively against such an assault. Vi o lence : “ The immoral initiation of physical power to coerce, compel or restrain ” → Initiation is the key - word here (definition of ‘ I nitiate ’ : to Begin / to Introduce / to Start). Nobody ever has the right to enact violence ; becaus e violence is always starting t he conflict . In short, t he immoral initiation of force is violence. What often happens in primary schools when two students ge t into a physical altercation, the teachers usually tend to say: “It doesn’t matter who started it.” While that is one of the absolute most critically important thing s that matters . Because the person that struck first, is the person that conducted violenc e, they initiated the immoral use of phys ical force . "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 “ Coercive action whic h is in opposition to morality and n atural l aw because it involves the violation of others’ r ights ” → This is exactly why it is called violence; it violates the rights of other peo ple. The act of violating rights is what violence is , it’s derived from the same root word , the Latin verb ‘Violare , ’ which means ‘ to T r eat with v iolence or dishonour . “ A ction which one never possesses the right to take ” → T here exists no such thing as the right to commit violence. H owever , one always reserves the right to use force in a defensive capacity, up to , and including deadly force. T he Two Pillars of Enlightenment The first pillar of enlightenment is the ‘ Sacred Feminine principle , ’ also called t he ‘ Non - Aggression principle . ’ This principle states: do not engage in violence . In other words, do not immorally initiate non - rightful use of physical force to coerce, constrain, or compel the rightful behaviour or free will choice of another sentient bei ng. The second pillar of enlightenment is the ‘ Sacred Masculine principle , ’ also called the ‘ Self - Defence principle . ’ This principle states: sentient beings have the inherent right to use force to defend themselves and others from violence conducted again st them . There i s no such thing as an enlightened being that doesn’t fully grasp both of these principles. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 Ownership The main reason our species continues to experience a systematic and growing loss of freedom is because we collectively do not deeply u nderstand ownership , and we continue to commit and condone theft . To own something means that, regarding that thing, an individual maintains: - Rightful p ossession (acquired without doing somebody else harm) - Control of u sage - Maintaining p ersonal r espon sibility N atural law can be essentially reduced to a single spiritual law: don’t steal . That’s all. W e have to collectively understand that all rights are property rights . Stop taking the property of other beings, and stop condoning the taki ng of propert y of other beings. Conscience Most people don’t seem to think of cons cience as knowledge, while t hat is exactly what it truly is . I t isn’ t behaviour, i t isn’t action ; i t’s knowledge. The word ‘Conscience’ is derived from the Latin prefix ‘Con - ’ which mean s ‘Together / With’ and the Latin verb ‘ Sci re’ which means ‘ to K now / to Understand . ’ So, the two combined mean ‘to Know t ogether . ’ Therefore, conscience is common sense , quite literally. All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive k nowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong behaviour according to natural law. Exercise of Conscience (A ction) : The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the definitive knowledge of the obj ective difference between right and wrong according to natural law has been acquired and integrated into the being . We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act either in accordance with it, or in disharmony wit h it. If we act in accordance with it , that is called the exercise of conscience . The Law of Freedom The law of freedom states: f reedom and m orality are directly proportional . As m orality increases, f reedom increases. As m orality declines, f reedom declin es. Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of people in any given society , is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and moral ity there is, the less tyranny and slavery there will be within that society . True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces moral relativism , the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wron g, so humanity may arb itrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.

(Inherent to c reation) ” → Things that are inherent to creation are no t made or caused by humankind. “ Harmonized with, due to knowledge & u nderstanding . (or rejected, due to i gno rance or contradicting beliefs)” → Natural law isn’t something that’s based on a person’s compliance, b e cause a person has to fear the “ punishment ” of not understanding it. If you don’t understand it, and don’t live according to it, the result or consequence will be inescapable . If you behave a certain way, t here are certain consequences. And i f you change your behaviour , you’ll change the consequential results . “Universal; exists and applies anywhere in the u niverse regardless of location . ” → There is no place you can go in the physical u niverse where natural law doesn’t apply. “ Eternal and i mmutable; exists and applies for as long as the u niverse exists, and cannot be changed . ” → Natural law is immutable because it cannot be changed by any a ction that any being in the universe is capable of taking . Man’s Law (government) : “ Based upon d ogmatic beliefs .

Before 1920 it wa s legal, and after 1933 it was made legal again , a ll because of what some politicians wrote on pieces of paper . F or man’s law this means ; i f a particular man - made law is in harmony with natural law , then it follows logically that it is redundant , since it is stating a truth that is pre - existing and inherent in Nature . Therefore , the writing down of that concept and calling it a law , is both unnecessary and irre levant . If a particular man - made law is in opposition to natural law , then it follows logically that it is both false (incorrect) and immoral (harmful to others ), or in other words, wrong . Because if it isn’t based in natural law it means that it is causi ng somebody harm by taking something that belongs to them, whether it’s a right, or any physical possession . Therefore , it can n ever be legitimately binding upon anyone .

N o t a single person or group of people is capable of “ granting ” or “ gifting ” rights to anyone else, nor is any person capable of revo king rights from anyone else. “Government is nothing but men acting in concert. The morality and value of government, like any other association of men, will be no greater and no less than the morality and value of t he men comprising it. Since government is nothing but men, its inherent authority to act is in no way greater or different than the authority to act of individuals i n isolation. Government has no ‘ magic powers ’ or ‘ authority ’ not possessed by private indiv iduals. Let he who asserts that government may do that which the individual may not assume the onus of proof and demonstrate his contention. ” – Chris Lyspooner, Lud wig von Mises Institute The word ‘ Government’ is derived from the Latin verb ‘Gu b ernare’ whi ch means ‘to Control / to Rule / to Direct . ’ (just as was shown earlier with the ety mological breakdown of the word ‘Sovereign , ’ there is no “V sound ” in classical Latin . This can be readily seen in the name of the ceremony for electing a g overnor; they ar e called ‘ Gu b ernatorial elections. ’ ) The second part of the word ‘Government’ is derived from the Latin noun ‘M ens’ which means ‘Mind . ’ Therefore, p ut together the word ‘Govern - ment’ etymologically means ‘ Mind c ontrol . ’ The etymological origin of the Engli sh suffix ‘ - m e nt’ is often debated, yet it is quite clear that those who created the English language deliberately chose ‘Mens’ the Latin word for ‘Mind , ’ to mean ‘the State of - ’ or ‘the Condition of - , ’ in direct keeping with the first Hermetic principle ; the principle of mentalism . W hich demonstrates that in order for any particular event, circumstance, state or condition to exist in our current manifested reality (the p lane of e ffects), it must first have existed in the mind (the p lane of c ausality).

M ainly, the right s to command, compel, coerce and co nstra in . Authority is based upon an equally illusory concept called ‘Jurisdiction . ’ The word ‘Jurisdiction’ is derived from the Latin noun ‘Jus / Juris’ which means ‘Right / Law , ’ and the Latin verb ‘Dictere’ which means ‘to Speak / to Say . ’ Thus, the word ‘Jur isdiction’ literally means ‘ to Say what the l aw is . ’ In other words, to “make up” or to “ decide ” what the law is. “ Authority ” is an illusion of a diseased psyche, based entirely in violence and built upon the false belief that some pe ople are “ masters ” who have the moral right to issue commands, a nd that other people have a moral obligation to obey those commands . Simply put; slavery . The belief in the legitimacy of “ a uthority ” is the belief in the legitimacy of s lavery . Ultimately, “ a uthority ” is the idea that man can become God , and through jurisdiction , dictate the law , and dictate what is right and wrong. The concept of government and the concept of authority are forms of (false) religion, yet most people fail to see it that way. The word ‘Religion’ is d erived from the Latin verb ‘Religare’ which means ‘to Tie b ack / to Hold b ack / to Thwart fr om f orward p rogress / to Bind . ’ A false religion is a system of control based in unchallenged, dogmatic belief which holds back the progress of consciousness. We sh ould stop trying to make our religion truth, and start making truth our religion. The One T rue Divide There is only one true divide that separates humanity into two distinct types of individuals. The criterion for t his divide is whether or not a person b elieves in “ authority , ” and therefore believes that there is legitimacy to slavery. That is the only divide which truly separates us .

This “authority” means th at certain people, who call themselves ‘ government , ’ have the moral right to issue commands to those who m they rule (those under their jurisdict ion), and that t heir subjects (slaves) have a “ moral obligation ” t o obey the arbitrary dictates (laws ) set by their “ masters. ” Most simply put, a statist is someone who believes in the legitimacy of slavery . Anarchy : Co nversely, an Anarchist is a person that knows ther e c ould never be legitimacy to “ authority ” or “government” because those terms are simply euphemisms for violence and slavery, which are always immoral and in opposition to natural law. The word ‘ Anarchy’ is der ived from the Greek prefix ‘An - (αν - ) ’ which means ‘Without / the Absence of’ and the Greek noun ‘Archon (αρχων) ’ which means ‘Master / Ruler . ’ Anarchy does not mea n ‘Without r ules’ – i t literally means ‘ Without r ulers / Without m asters . ’ The only permanent rules that are in place, are the ones of natural law. No Masters = No Slaves It seems self - evident that anarchy is the true meaning of freedom, and yet when you ask a person what anarchy means ( to them ) , and what they associate it with, the answer will most likely be : rioting, looting and destroying other people ’ s property , in one word; chaos . Which is literally the exact opposite of what anarchy truly is . "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 The Fear of Chaos Chaos shouldn’t be v iewed as something to be feared, it should rather be viewed as a teacher . Definitely a h arsh teacher, but a teacher nonetheless. It t eaches us through the apophatic process, what not to do.  What you see pictured above is obviously a bad idea and you probably shouldn’t do that ; if your desire is not to burn your hand up to th e point of blist ering and your skin coming off. H owever, if you don’t care about that happening , then by all means, keep your hand right on that burner . But if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining that condition . That me ans you can’t keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or natural law will take over and burn your hand. In our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be burned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is switched on, and NOT be burned ! ” B u t obviously , it doesn’t work that way. If you don’t want to be burned, your hand can’t be kept there while the stove is on; if you don’t want self - inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you’ve got to align your behaviour to natural law. Which means you’ve got to know the objective difference between right and wrong behaviour , and through free will choice deliberately choose r ight action over wrong action . And only then, will you no t get burn t . True freedom includes infinite possibility , which, by definition, includes the possibility of chaos . This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free. For real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there could be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpect ed happening, something going wrong, or some o ne getting hurt ; b ut if you are living in that state of fear, you are living in a very lo w state of consciousness. F ear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because it i s based in fear (see ‘natural law expression s ’ chart on page 22 )."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 The fea r of the possibility of chao s is the fear of true freedom . This can also symbolically be seen as the “ d eath ” of th e imagination. Imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced . This is because, according to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world (plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of caus ality). If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible. Through their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), m ost people advocate the legitimacy and continuance of “ authority ” and government , and are therefore actually advocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery . Those who believe that “ authority ” is necessary and that it must continue, have been duped into believing that human slavery is neces sary and must continue in order to preven t chaos. Violence and slavery cannot prevent chaos; violence and slavery are chaos.

Which can be a difficult truth to l earn , and to accept for a lot of people. Fo llowing orders means doing what you are told to do, without judging for yourself whether or not the action you are being ordered to carry out is right or wrong behaviour . If an individual is following orders, that individual can impossibly be exercising co nscience , because by definition, exercising conscience means that one is wilfully choosing for themselves right action over wrong action. Following orders should never be seen as a virtue of any kind ; if you are acting based solely on what someone has told you to do, there is no morality found in that whatsoever. Ther e is no such thing as moral ly following orders , the two terms are contradictory. Therefore, “I was just following orders” i s never a valid excuse or justification for immoral, harmful behaviour . T his sorry attempt to give up personal responsibility should never be accepted as a valid excuse for such behaviour. The order - follower tries to abdicate their personal responsibility for their actions and pretend the blame lies with the order giver; whi ch is an obvious lie (to themselves , mainly). They could loo k you dead in the eye and say “I’m not responsible for that. I just did it ; but I’m not the person who’s responsible for it, because I was acting on orders from somebody else .” It’s astonishing th at they somehow truly seem to believe that statement can be regarded as true, in any way. Sadly, many people nowadays believe that there is legiti macy to this criminal behaviour because a grou p of people calling themselves ‘government’ have somehow be en im bued and gifted with such “ rights . ” The people in government believe they have rights that others don’t ; b ut what’s even worse is that the people w ho are actually affected by their immoral behaviour, they believe it too. “You assist an evil system most eff ectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evi l. A good person will resist an evil syst em with his or her whole soul.” – Mahatma Gandhi, pre - eminent leader of the India n Independence Movement "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Moral Culpability Moral culpability is the determination of who is ultimately at fault , or deserving of blame for the commission of actions which resulted in harm or loss to others. The word ‘Culpable’ means ‘at Fault / De serving of b lame , ’ it is derived from the Latin noun ‘Culpa’ which means ‘Fault / Blame . ’ The people that act out a certain behaviour and cause harm, loss, chaos or trauma to others always carry blame. Who actually carried out the holocaust in Germany? – T he people that followed the orders to do so ; therefore, order - followers is the answer. And they are always in the form of police or military; t his is why a totalitarian state is referred to as a ‘ Police State . ’ Because they are the people ultimately respon sible for bringing that condition into manifestation through their behaviour. The order giver ( president / m ayor / judge e tc.) makes a command, the order - follower obeys without question, and through their behaviou r make that condition a reality ; t hat’s why it’s called a police state. Because every police state that has ever existed, has always been created by police following orders. Because they don’t want to think for themselves , they don’t want the personal responsibility and they don’t want to truly kno w the difference between right and wrong for themselves, like a responsible adult person would . Note that the term ‘ MORE’ is underlined and capitalized; the order givers are also morally culpable, that is not the question. The question is “ Who is MORE mo rally culpable? ” T he answer is always the order - follower, at any time, in any place.

The order - follow e r always bears more moral culpability that the order - giver , because the order - follower is the one who actually performed the action , and in taking such action, brought the resulting harm into physical manifestation . Order - following is the pathway to every form of evil and chaos in our world. Again, i t should never be seen as a virtue by anyone who considers themselves a moral person . Order - followers have ultimately been personally responsible and morally culpable for every form of slavery and every single totalitarian regime that has ever existed. Responsibility vs. Abdication Responsibility ( the ability to respond ) : An individual’s personal responsibility to choose right action over wrong action for themselves is always their own . One can only (falsely) c laim that they are abd icating personal responsibility for such choice to someone else , i t can never actually be done in reality. It’s merely a claim when an or der - follower says , “I am not personally responsible, because this person told me to do it” and wh at it actually truly is, is just a lie .

You alone make choices. You alone are answerable to the conse quences of your behaviour . The feeble excuse that your boss required it, or the establishment expected it, holds no truth or justification .” – David Icke, English Author Lots of people erroneously believe that they can hand over their natural law right to defend themselves to another individual, or entity. In making such a false claim, they have attempted to abdicate a responsibility which always belongs to them , and can never be given away . “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little t emporary safety, deserve neither, and will lose both.” – Benjamin Frankli n, one of the Founding Fathers o f the U . S .A. Self - Loathing vs. Self - Respect People who don’t want to t ake responsibility and become adult human being s are in the psychological condit ion of ‘ Self - Loathing . ’ W hat this means is , they hate them sel ves ; n obody who wants to perpetuate slaver y can possibly love themselves. Self - loathing is the underlying psychological condition that causes people to attempt to abdicate their own personal resp onsibility to exercise conscience, and fall into patterns of order - following and justification . Just as it is not possible for an order - follower to truly be exercising conscience ; it is also not possible for an order - follower to truly love themselves . Thes e states cannot exist simultaneously, for they are contradictory psychological conditions. Self - loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been buried into the subconscious mind , instead of being confronted, dealt with, an d healed. Such trauma could fo rm feelings of inadequacy ; whether they are real, suggested, or simply i magined. A mind - set as such is a psychological p rison , and yet, people suffering from self - loathing usually don’t seem to have any desire for true freedom ; ‘ t hey a re in the cage, and t hey love being in the cage . ’ T he only kind of people that have no desire for real freedom, are people in the psychological state of self - loathing, that do not love themselves. Self - r espect heals self - loathing ; i t is about introspection ( observation or ex amination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotional state) . The word ‘Respect’ is derived from the L atin prefix ‘Re - ’ which means ‘A gain’ and the Latin verb ‘Spectare’ which means ‘to L ook at . ’ – ‘To take a nother l ook at o neself, ’ is where true respect starts. You cannot give somebody somet hing that you don’t already own yourself . If you don’t have $10, - in your pocket you could impossibly give it to someone else . Y ou must obtain it first, before you can give it away. Therefore, nobody can give respect to anybody else unless they first developed it inwardly. Self - respect must come first , w hich is why people in th e state of self - loathing don’t respect anybody, lea st of all themselves. Only self - respect can heal self - loathing, and therefore help put an or der - follower on the path to exercising conscience.

In order to speak the l ost word , a person must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium ( balance ) between the left and right brain hemispheres. In such a state of ba lanced consciousness, the individual has come to know the s elf (microcosm) , as well as the working operations of natural law ( macrocosm ) , and in doing so has come to understand the objective difference between right and wrong behaviour. O r as they are referred to in F reemasonry, ‘Light (Knowledge)’ and ‘Darkness (Ignorance) . ’ In the balanced state of consciousnes s generated through the knowledge of natural law, a person is finally able to speak the lost word , which is: ‘ N o .’ It is considered the word of all power in Freemasonry . W hen we say no to those who claim to be our owners, thos e who claim that they will dec ide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our rights ( all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the knowledge, care, and courage that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be “ lost . ” “Know your Rights . ” – The reason you have to know what the difference between right and wrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have , i s because t hose who don’t know , won’t say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner). Teaching Natural Law to Others a.k.a. the Great Work Education is the only solution , k nowledge is the solution ; and the propagation of that knowledge is ‘ E ducation , ’ w hich means ‘to L ead out from . ’ – The Latin verb ‘Educere’ means ‘to Take - / to Draw - / to Lead out from . ’ L ead ing a person out of darkness (ignoranc e) is what a real teacher does. Rather than “ pushing ” a person out of that darkness, the teacher will go fir st and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accura te path, that person can follow the same discovery process . However, it must be a repeatable process; a s was mentioned earlier , natural law isn’t a religion or a belief system, it is a science . Shift Happens? A ‘ Quantum Shift’ in human consciousness is required for humanity to become free of its self - imposed state of slavery. Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. Anybody tha t thinks that ’ s the case is very naïve, overly positive, and in some form o f right - brain imbalance. Wheth er or not this shift will occur mainly relies on the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves enormous effort, dedication, a nd persistence . We cannot give up. There is a saying in Alchemy that has been referred to as the ‘catchphrase of the alchemical tradition’ the saying goes: ‘Labore et c onstantia’ which means ‘Work and c onstancy . ’ Constant effort is go ing to be required to get this boulder up the mountain , and in the condition in which humanity finds itself today it will most likely go kicking and screaming. Teaching natural law to others is not an easy task , it usually isn’t fun, and we’re definitely not going to get it d one in a day. Therefore, we are going to have to continually work hard on this matter, or the quantum shift simply will not happen at all . "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 A quantum shift has requirements : The word q uantum is derived from the (same) Latin noun ‘Quantum’ which means ‘A mou nt . ’ In order to tip the scales of truth and justice back in to balance , a certain amount of people actually need to be doing the great work of hel ping other people to receive this knowledge of natural law . Simply put, h igher amounts of people are required . Individual behavioural choices, either based in harmony or in opposition to natural law, combine in energy and effect, and, in the aggregate , influence the quality of the manifested shared human experience; we collectively create our shared experience. Th is dynamic acts as a perfect expression of the principle of c orrespondence : “As above, so below; as below, so above . ” Decisively contrary to the “ New a ge ” view. I n order for a quantum shift to happen, once again, higher numbers are required . The Great Wor k The great work can only be performed after one has already realised the truth regarding natural law , and brought oneself (one’s own actions ) into alignment with it. From that moment on, the teaching of the great work can begin; for once that has been don e, there is no more internal contradiction or opposition within that person. From there on out, you can legitimately start teaching it to other people because you know it deeply enough, and have truly aligned your behaviour to it. The great work is what co mes next. The great work is the arduous task of influencing other people to go through that same process of positive change, that you yourself have gone through. It is to help them realise that in supporting a nd condoning the legitimacy of “ authority ” and “ government (man’s law), ” they have actually been supporting and condoning the legitimacy of slavery . And that they were immoral fo r having done so ; convincing a person of that is hard work . B ecause people usually don’t want to hear th is , t hey want what t hey think is true, to be true. In short, what the great work comes down to is to get people to abandon their (false) religions . T he false and dogmatic beliefs which hold back the progress of consciousness by impeding the reception of knowledge of natural l aw. The Swiss psychotherapist Carl Gustav Jung descr ibed the great work beautifully ; “One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious . The latter procedure, however, is disagreeabl e, and therefore, not p opular.” The true great work is to become a teacher of natural law; a nd as the old saying goes ‘ many hands make light work . ’ “ Educate and inform the whole mass of the people . That is the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.” – Thomas Jef ferson, 3 rd President of the U. S .A. “In every declining civilisation there is a small remnant of people who adhere to the right against the wrong; who recognise the difference between good and evil and who will take an active stand for the former and again st the latter; who can still think and discern, and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual decay of their day.” – excerpt from the book ‘ Toward a New World Order’ by Donald S.

Nobody ever said that the truth is going to make you feel wa rm and fuzzy inside; the truth can be horrible, and yet it n eeds to be embraced as a lover. “There are only two mistakes one can ever make on the path to truth; not starting , and not going all the way .” – Buddha, Religious leader"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 Lastly, we need practical real - world skills . The e nd goal isn’t to have just you yourself knowing th is information ; but to communicate this information to the masses. And t o be able to communicate truth to others, knowledge and certain skills are required. Technology is something that improves life for us , and makes life easier f or us. In this technological era we live in, it is absolutely crucial that we learn to use t his technology as our tools for communication of truth. Some examples of those practical skills are: - Organisation : W hether it be a semina r, a meeting, or any other coming together of people . - Communication : Good vocabulary, and organisation of words; to communicate concepts . - Graphic d esign : For making power - point presentations , flyers , websites etc. - Presentation : Whether in front of a group of friends, or an audience full of strangers . - Audio : For making podcasts, or any other form of broadcasting audio . - Video : For making compilations, vlogs, or any other form of video presentation . - Website development : To accumul ate your findings and make them accessible to the world . - Networking : Can also be called ‘people skills , ’ referring to direct communication . - Marketing & p romotion : To le t others know where to find this information. If most of us do not have these skills, we won’t be reaching the optimum number of people. W e have to become the new media , that is dedicated to truth, and put it out there f or other people’s edification. When we deeply understand knowledge as important as this, we have a moral obligation to sh are it with others; what gives us the right to keep it to ourselves? If you keep taking in more and more kno wledge, you’re building up more and more pressure within yourself . I f you don’t have an outlet valve for that pressure, you become “ Niagara Falls i nside a water balloon , ” one day, it’ s going to burst .

This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks . Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt meagrely to compete with God . All are intractably sceptical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which w e have been conditioned to think .” – R ichard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor The conditioning of our thoughts is what has kept us in this prison, and only now are some people beginning to see the actual depth of it. We are living in ‘Post - Apocalyptic’ times, in the literal sense of the word. The word ‘Apoca lypse’ is derived from the Greek prefix ‘Apo - (απο)’ which means ‘Away f rom / Off / Removed f rom’ and the Greek verb ‘Calyptein (καλυπτειν)’ which means ‘to C over / to Conceal,’ hence the word apocalypse literally means ‘to Reveal’ or ‘to Take out of h idin g . ’ Therefore, t he apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been lifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out there , and available for most people to find . We have to make, what h as been called ‘The Cosmic Apology . ’ The word ‘Apology’ is made up of the Greek prefix ‘Apo - (απο)’ which means ‘Away f rom / Off / Removed f rom’ and the Greek noun ‘Logos (λόγος)’ which means ‘Word.’ Hen ce apology literally means ‘to Go away from the word’ (to tak e back something you said), or ‘to Give b ack the word.’ If a person says something they didn’t really mean, or something the y want to retract , they apologise; t hey are “moving away from” what they have said. The Greek noun ‘Logos’ is derived from the Greek verb ‘Lego (λ ε γω )’ which m eans ‘to Speak / to Say’ ( this is where the English word ‘Lexicon’ comes from) . The Latin noun ‘Lex / Legis (Law)’ is also derived from this same Greek verb. God, not man, is the a uthor ( a uthority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence. Humani ty’s work is to learn to listen to God’s word, which is, natural law, spiritual law , moral law, God’s law ; and to align its behaviour to that law. Humanity must make this cosmic apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to God, and collectively a ligning its behaviour with natural law. This is accomplished when we open our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word ‘N o ’ to evil. The very beginning of this thesis started out with the chapter ‘Before we b egin’; now we have begu n, and it’s up to you to take it further. What you wi ll eventually do with this knowledge is entirely in your hands . "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 Conclusion Which of the two will we choose? There is no answer to that question yet. Each individual has to make that decision for the mselves, and that will eventually be expressed in the aggregate. “A free people claim their rights as derived from the l aws of Nature , and not as the gift of their magistrates.” – Thomas Jefferson, 3 rd President of the U . S .A. “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the l aw of Nature for his rule.” – John Locke, English philosopher “Nature, to be co mmanded, must first be obeyed.” – Francis Baco n, former Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England If we want the forces of N ature on our side we must learn, and adhere to , the principles of natural law. If we do no t align our behaviour to it , N ature will not stand with us, it will conti nuously s tand against us, and that will create more strife and suffering in our lives. “There is a law that man should love his neighbour as himself . In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing, or the upright gait. But if he does not le arn it, he must perish .” – Alfred Adler, Austrian Psychologist This process should be able to be done a lot faster than a few hundred years ; if we accept the key that is shown in this thesis . Which has the power to unlock all the locks, and all the doors, to a ll the “ mental cages , ” w hen we make the decision to climb the “ladder of consciousness” through an act of our own free will choice and effort. B e cause for most it won’t be an easy process ; it involves a lot of deep introspective work. However, if we d o this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves , by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculin e forces within each one of us. And by recognising our own inherent sovereignty, and recognising there isn ’t , and never has been any legitimacy to slavery, control, authority or any other form of external rulership of human beings as subjects. The tarot card pictured here was also shown at the beginning of this thesis. There is a deep connection to be understood about the tarot tr adition and other mystery traditions regarding knowledge of natural law. Specifically, the deeply interwoven relationship to the Middle - Eastern Kabbalistic tradition. This tarot card is known as the Justice Card (Justice: based on the Latin word ‘ Jus ’ mean ing ‘Right or Law’) This card represents balance between the two pillars of Enlightenment (Feminine / Masculine ), Holding the sword of truth in the right hand, and the scales of justice perfectly balanced in the left hand. It represents sovereignty, alignm ent with truth, and the manifestation of order, which can only happen when we align our behaviours to the principles of natural law.

It may be a difficult journey, but it can definitely be done . And I f we all choose to do so, we’re going to see advances and creations beyond what we have ever experienced here on Earth. T he world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of natural law. The changes we will experience are going to be so positive, and so transformative that we can barely even imagine what the world will look like on th e other side of that work. It is up to each and every one of us, personally , to take on that responsibility and go down that path for ourselves; should we hope to ever reach that point. The main task now is to inform as many people as possible about the wo rkings of natural law, true morality, and freedom.

The understanding of natural law is centred upon bringing our own conscience into alignment with objective morality. This means definitively knowing which behaviours are rights ; because they do not cause harm to other sentient beings, and which behaviours are wrongs because they do cause harm to other sentient beings. Understanding natural law means truly having conscience, which is the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between mor ally right and wrong human behaviour . Living in harmony with n atural law means exercising conscience, and wilfully choosing morally right behaviour over morally wrong behaviour, once the difference between the two is clearly understood. When people begin to live in harmony with natural law in the aggregate, and are t herefore moral, they become and remain free. When human beings live in opposition to natural law, and are therefore immoral, they become and remain enslaved.  Contact: michaelgleeson@mail.com"}]
