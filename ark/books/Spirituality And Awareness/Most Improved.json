No matter what our circumstancesare, humanity has this uncanny ability to change. Its never too late. In westernsocieties we have been told by authority figures like (but not limited to) fieldexperts, government officials, and academic professors that certaincharacteristics of human nature can’t be changed, that we are stuck with ourgenes to a certain extent. These positions are based on a host of ideologiesthat were created by schools of thought desiring to control the human mind togain or maintain a power differential over human beings. Schools of science aresometimes no different. I call this fake science “Scientisim”. I borrowed thisterm from Mark Passio from his podcast “What on earth is happening” Markdescribes Scientism as a school of thought put into place to make a particularmanufactured science look real though subterfuge.Most of what we have been told about our world is bullshit, brought on by peopleand institutions that make money off of the ignorance of a society. This“bullshit” happens with most of our modern dilemmas politicized into chargeddebates. Experts who hold a position of authority on a topic in question havehelp from powerful people to maintain an illusion of “authority” over the mindsof the population. Many of these positions are very difficult to bring down.Most of these so called “Experts” would rather maintain the illusion of scienceon a great many topics rather than admit ignorance to maintain positions ofpower. Ancient structures like the Plato of Giza is one prime example of thissubterfuge. The Pyramids are characterized as tombs. In reality no one reallyknows what they are or how they were made. In order to maintain the illusionthat our sciences are correct, History books tell us what they probably are andhow they were likely made.We can rise above any limitations that are imposed on us by these schools ofthought. I believe my transformation is living proof of humanity’s ability torise above self-imposed slavery. All one needs is the will, knowledge and a planof action.This book came about after I had a Cerebral Hemorrhage in the spring of 2017.Afterwards I fell into a deep depression. Before the cerebral hemorrhage I wasalready struggling with my life purpose, and I was seriously unhappy about it.For many years of my adult life I felt stuck in the events of my life. And Ijudged that I really shouldn’t have been in this predicament in the first place.I am smart, I have a very supporting family, and I am providing a valuableservice to the community. When I compared my feeling of sadness to what Icreated in my life I thought that I might not have a reason to be sodisappointed by it. But something was missing and I was determined to understandwhat it was. I started this call for help. Not a typical call you would make toa friend or loved one, but an internal need to find answers to difficultproblems though introspection. Many of life’s problems can be resolved by directobservation and listening to inner truth.My call for help was answered in the information I found during this journey,and the actions I put into practice to test what I was learning. This book is aaccumulation of what I learned from many people who are on the same path. Thepath of wanting to discover truth about themselves and the world.Many of the things you read in this book are my own personal opinion. However alot of what I experienced came about though practice. After my CerebralHemorrhage, I started looking for answers and actively trying new behaviors. Ilearned different ways of acting in the world by attempting new and empoweringbehaviors. These new behaviors brought me to a discovery of certain objectivetruths about the universe and the world. Many of these understandings willappear to go against much of what is said about reality and the world. Myunderstanding is that perception about the world can be subjective, but oursubjective experience does not alter, or make different, certain characteristicsof the Universe. These certain characteristics of the Universe exist, (whetherwe want them to or not) and real life events based on these characteristicshappen, regardless of our subjective experience. Secondly, these particularcharacteristics are static, and do not change even though we can change ouropinions about them. When a practitioner with consciousness comes into contactwith what I call Cosmic Law, and the practitioner aligns ones actions to CosmicLaw principals, the Universe teaches us how to really live. This law is composedof principals like: Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, and Causation.These principals all exist, operate, and have a objective effect on our reality,and we experience these effects through our consciousness, (if we allow them to)regardless of our mind’s perception of the world. Once we align our actions tothis law, everything changes, we become co-creators of the Universe instead ofco-destroyers of ourselves.I will often use misspelled, and incorrectly hyphenated words to draw theattention of the practitioner to the hidden meaning of certain words. This iscalled “Green Language”. At first you might think that this method is worthless,or annoyingly cheeky. But if you will take the time to notice that certain wordsactually have a different meaning then what is taught in modern education, youmight have a change of heart.This book is an accumulation of knowledge based on what I have learned, and it‘smy experience. You are free to agree, disagree, or question my assertions.Before you do, I ask that you give my words some time to sink in, and propertystudy, by way of impartial evidence. Part of being a warrior for truth isentertaining thoughts, and ideas in the mind without the need to outright rejectthem. Play with the thoughts, and ideas as if they are true, and if they don’tfit, throw them out. But if something fits for you, hear the call. Determine foryourself why it’s true, and what you can do to make it apart of your life. Ifyou desire to live in a better world.I thank all the truth seekers out there. Most specifically, Mark Passio for hisobjectivity, and his dedication to truth discovery, at great personal expense tohimself. Most of what I have discovered about objective truth came from hisstudies. I’d be a Solipsist by now without his contribution. I also would liketo thank Anita Moorjani for her compassion and love, and for having the courageto write about her Near Death Experience. Her writings helped me realize thatthere is more to life that exists outside of normal reality. My wife forsticking with me through tough times, her innocence has shown me that I don’tneed to look at the world though serious eyes all the time. The love my mom anddad gave me, which helped me finally realize my calling. The philosophicalteachings of James Allen, and all of the people that have played their part inbringing the “Constructive Living” practice to the West. Without this practice,I would still be trying to figure out why I’m so depressed, instead of acting tomake my world better. I also wanted to thank my life coach Patricia London forsuggesting I write a Autobiography about my life, even though this book turnedout to be part Autobiography, and part Philosophical Meditation.This book is about what I learned on my journey toward the discovery ofobjective truth, I hope it helps you like it helped me.Scott Larson"},{"pageContent":"HOW THIS ALL HAPPENED…Scott Larson12/24/18> Change may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean you can’t go out kicking and> screaming. - Scott LarsonIn August of 2017 while working, I suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage. Very suddenlyI started to feel sick, my eyes rolled in different directions. Since I couldn’tsee where i was going I collapsed. I was conscious, but my eyes were going intwo different directions. This disorientation was too much for my brain, and Ihad to keep my eyes shut. My wife called the ambulance, and I was taken to ahospital.After the doctor determined I had a Cerebral Hemorrhage, and that I didn’t needsurgery to relieve any pressure on my brain, I was put in intensive care. Ithink the cause may have been a blood clot in my brain, but the doctors couldnever really determine what caused it. They chalked it up to high blood pressurethat was out of control. I did have a history of very high blood pressure formany years that I was trying to maintain by diet, but I was over weight, and hadbreathing problems that might have contributed to the problem. While I waslaying in the hospital bed, the worst possible thing happened to me. I realizedthat was still alive. And the second worst possible thing then happened, Irealized I still had to live with myself.A terrible depression came over me that I could no longer hide from. I realizedI was living a terrible life. I had a loving family who supported me, but I wasa lost case. I didn’t know where I was going in life. I would often startprojects, and fail to complete them. To hide this truth from myself and others,I distracted myself with computer games. I let my health and environment go,sleeping until the early evening, and since I was unconsciously angry about mylack of direction, I was taking it out on the people who loved me.I thought that the world, and everybody else was the cause of my suffering. Ifeveryone would just get their act together, I would be ok. I blamed the people,the corruption of western society, and the suffering it is causing, foreverything that I was going though.After I got out of the hospital, I started to look for some answers. If theUniverse wanted me to live, I sure as hell was not going to continue living as Iwas. By some miracle, I finally figured out that all suffering was caused by myown actions, and inaction’s. On a subconscious level, I suspected I was angry atmyself for refusing to actively take part in my life. I found this group onlineReddit group called “Critical Shower Thoughts”. It was there I discovered peoplethat were also going through many of the same things that I was going through.Someone suggested I look into this Japanese practice called “ConstructiveLiving”, and that’s where my life changed.I still don’t really know what to do. I’m only facing what comes to me by takingcare of what’s important. I realized that I need to reach out for what is rightby trying new things, that before I didn’t think I could do.This book is for my family and all the people that have been downtrodden bylife. You do not have to be a victim of life. The thoughts that you think aboutyourself, and the world are just that, thoughts. They have no power other thatwhat you give them. You can change for the better no matter what is happeningaround you, if you make a choice to do so. Its never too late and its never oneto many. The Universe gives us plenty chances to make something different in ourlife happen. In fact, hardships, as a result of our choices, are the Universe’sway of knocking at the door. You only need to open it, and let it in to see whatpossibilities are there for you. Its true that some possibilities are harder toaccept then others. In that case, time is required for wounds to heal beforethere can be an acceptance of possibilities that are beyond your reach. Be kindto yourself, all will be resolved In time."},{"pageContent":"A BRIEF HISTORY"},{"pageContent":"GRADE SCHOOL TROPHYWhen I realized that I could get better at something.Scott Larson12/24/2018When I was in my teens, I attended a Catholic middle school. One day I had tomake a decision. I had to chose a physical activity as one of my classes. Ididn’t like people getting close to me, otherwise the might discover my secret:My unreliability. Physical activities required others to rely on me not to messup. Since I was somewhat of a misfit, having others rely on me was veryuncomfortable for both parties. I was content sitting at a classroom desk.Imagining my own little world that I could control. To keep others from figuringout my secret, I would cause mishaps to avoid having to participate in class.Since I had to take a sport, I signed up for basketball, it was the only sport Iliked to watch.In the beginning I was terrible. I missed most of my shots, I double dribbledmore times then you can count, I found myself outside of the court often, and Iswore profusely at that age, something I picked up from my Dad. So I was oftenpenalized for that behavior, and found myself setting on the bench. Even thoughI disliked other kids relying on me, I hated being on the bench more. I had thisOCD thing about trying to look good, and I knew that if I could improve, I mightget noticed by this girl I liked, who was on the cheerleading team. If the ballwas passed to me, and I was attempting to advance to the net, and someonestepped on my toe, I would find myself off the court, and on the bench,penalized for swearing at one of the opposite team members.But by the middle of the season, I started to get better, and curb my foullanguage. Since I was the tallest kid in my class at the time, team mates wantedto pass me the ball because I could jump well. So when I got better atdribbling, and shooting, I found myself with the ball often, doing that verything. My shot average changed from 30% to 60%. At the end of the year, Ireceived my first trophy. My coach had “Most Improved” engraved on my trophy.That was the first time I realized I had the capability to get better atsomething.Everything when down hill from there of course, but later in life, improvingmyself became my strongest point. Knowing I could improve allowed me to takeshortcuts though self-judgment. I found that if I focused on what I was doing,instead of thinking about why I couldn’t do something, I was able to get betterat things I wanted to do in my life very quickly. For some reason, I foundmyself being effected by self-judgments only in a minimal way. If, and it’s abig “IF”, I applied myself. That proved somewhat of a hit, or miss throughout mylife. I couldn’t maintain my focus on a central goal for very long, I found itto limiting. So I wandered though life taking jobs where I could."},{"pageContent":"GROWING UPWhen my world was in chaos, electronics showed me the way out.Scott Larson12/24/18I don’t remember much of my younger life, except what I saw in familyphotographs.When I was five years old, my mom took me to our local fair. She put me on amerry-go-round ride. I got on the horse, but as the ride started moving Istarted to wonder what is happening underneath the ride. Instead of enjoying theride as it was spinning, I was leaning over the edge of the disc floor trying tofigure out how the ride worked.I remember my uncle Jim’s workshop in the basement of my Aunt’s and Uncle’s homein Chicago. Across the way, my aunt Judy lived close by. You see, my familylived very close to each other, if not in the same complex, then close by in thesame neighborhood.My Uncle was a electrician. He was a union worker in Chicago. And his hobby athome was fixing electronics. The basement workshop was covered in electronics.Looking back, I realized the space was utilized very well. My Uncle had screwsand other small electronic pieces hanging in glass jars from the ceiling.Everything was organized by type of use. I remember the first thing he taughtme. How to ground myself using a rubber mat, I don’t think he wanted me to getelectrified.When I was about eleven, my parents would often have me stay at my Aunt’s andUncle’s house while they were on vacation. My Uncle, and I assembled electronickits together. Assembling electronic kits was fun for me, I didn’t understandthe comings and goings of adults as a eleven year old, and I don’t think Iwanted to. But some how, I wanted to understand how electronic technology couldbe applied in the world. My first application was putting together a burglaralarm kit. The kit utilized a silver metal ball, sitting on a thin pedestal,surrounded by a cone of tinfoil. The device could be set anywhere where youwanted to be alerted by sound, if a burglar disturbed the object on which it wasplaced. I used it in my room to detect unwanted guest from entering my room whenI wasn’t there. One day I caught my sister entering the room, but wasdisappointed when I found it was for some benign reason. I think my sister wasusing my window as a look-out to see who was approaching from the road. Ithought that was cool to be able to use technology to improve, or augment mylife.During my teens I started interacting with computers and small gadgets. I likedhow creative I could be when operating computers by learning how to program andcreate art. Electronics was an outlet for me to understand and make sense of myworld. When I grew into adulthood I was walking around with gadgets, fixingcomputers and providing information technology solutions to people who neededthe help. I like the work, but as life when on I started to notice thisemptiness. Computer work was fun, but there was something missing. Later in lifethis emptiness turned into depression.Throughout my life I felt like some unknown presence intervened to protect me.When I got back from the hospital and I started looking for answers to mydepression. A year later I was a completely different man. I found my lifepurpose, and it slapped me in the face often. I had a hard time avoiding it. Ithink the universe want me to heal the wounds I created in my life, and to healthe wounds I created in the people close to me. Healing myself mostly startedwith how I was treating my family. Like my Dad, I had an anger problem. Ithought everyone around me was the cause my grief. The real cause of my anger,and sadness was refusal to deal with my unresolved grief. Once I came to theconclusion that everything I did and was, was about me, my world started tochange for the good.I started to see a life coach, she showed me that I needed to stretch myself outof my comfort zone. I met others online who showed me an approach to overcomingdepression called “Constructive Living”. A process for making my surroundingsbetter, and taking responsibly for my bad behavior. I started attending a men'sgroup connect to Mankind Project. I started to learn about how to utilize aritual process to look my demons in the face. I attended one of MankindProject’s “New Warrior Training Adventures” and really learned what it’s like tobe humble. Most of my adult life I avoided the responsibility of dealing with myinner world because I didn’t know how to trust myself to be kind, and loving. Asa extension of not trusting myself, I didn’t know how to trust others.I now run my own information technology business, attend some of the MankindProject events. I help my family around the house, study the main topics ofHermetics, and Alchemy, keep an eye on the changes that happen in society froman observer point of view, and write about what I am learning. I am a very happyand fortunate man. I appreciate all of the help I have been given, realized, orotherwise."},{"pageContent":"MortalityMORTALITYInstead of enjoying life, I spent most of my time trying to figure things out.Scott Larson12/24/2018I remember in my twenties I became a baptist Christian. I shared a apartmentwith some Christian students. I was heavily into gaming back then. I brought mycomputer to the house, and was playing computer games there. I showed all thepeople in the house all the games I played. Looking back on it now, the subjectmatter of some of my games didn’t really inspire the Christian way.I remember half way though my stay at this apartment, I felt that I was causingharm to my room mates, by playing games that were not beneficial to what Iunderstood as spiritual development. I packed up the computer and sent it to mymom’s house. My room mates were surprised and impressed. I wanted my house matesto like me, and deep down I knew I wasn’t really setting a good example.I was loved as a child, but like all families there were parts of it that werenot quite right. My parents did the best they could, but they learned negativetraits from the world. I may have allowed those negative traits to be passed onto me. I realized that every decision I made about myself made up who I became.Regardless of the reason behind the choice I made about myself, the past is thepast.For instance I judged that my Mom was never comfortable with herself. She triedvery hard to have everyone like her. Looking back I noticed that I took on someof those behaviors. I attempted to create artificial reasons for people to likeme, instead of accepting who I was. I saw later in life that trying to impresspeople was a miserable way to live, and I learned to drop that behavior when Istarted working on myself.Learning how to relate to the world kindly is a efficient way to sharpen thespirit. Look for bits of truth about existence, and practices that can result increating a positive life.Like the merry-go-round ride, I strive to find out how the Universe’smerry-go-round ride works. I feel attached to the Universe in some way, Inaturally think that understanding myself is about understanding the fabric ofreality. I have learned that it’s actually the other way around. Understandingthe self opens the door to understanding the Universe, and how it works.I think my search was spurred on by my realization of my mortality. If I wasgoing to die someday, I wanted to know what it was like before I crossed over. Inever thought I would find the truth about that, but the act of searching forthat truth made me feel better, and it was a way to distract myself from myfailing life. To my surprise, I did find answers on mortality.I found some truth on that subject, but its hard to know for sure what its likewhen you die. There is some kind of objective truth out there, but I thinkeveryone experiences it differently based on the knowledge they bring with themfrom this world.Recently, I read a a statement from the Church of light1 that sums up what Ithink is happening about crossing over:> Physical, Mental and Spiritual Planes of Existence refers to the triune> constitution of the individual. The individual Soul, which is not immortal,> resides within the Mental (astral) plane. The physical body (that resides upon> the Physical Plane) is the organ by which the Soul gains experience and gives> birth to self conscious awareness through the process of friction in the> material world. The spiritual body is fragmentary in most of us…it is the body> we build by unselfish contribution to Universal Welfare. It is the body that> we must construct before we are able to live on the Spiritual Plane of> existence where we will attain immortality after we experience what is called> the “second death”.This rings true for me. I always thought that this body was an instrument to a“Mirror” self and that this “Mirror” self had a permanent residence somewhereelse in the stars. Having a “Mirror” self does not, in my mind, devalue thislife existence. I am here for a reason, and I need to do my best while I’m here.What I do here has an effect on my “Mirror” self.Eventually, I moved on to use what I discovered to make this world a betterplace to live. Progress, in the Universe (from a human perspective) is veryslow, big changes in our human paradigm happen over centuries. This book is acontribution to that long road, the great work that we all are doing to evolveinto timeless beings.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Normally, to avoid therealization of my life situation, I would involve myself in distractingbehaviors to avoid distress, like entering different worlds by playing computergames. But somehow the event had changed me. I could no longer convince myselfthat everything was “OK”. Imagining myself to be in another world wasn’t workingthis time. The layers of mental activity I had created to hide my deepdepression were gone, and for the first time I got in touch with the facade Iwas using to hide how miserable I felt. I wanted answers. I was tired ofsettling with distractions. One day, while I was browsing an online forum on thesocial media platform called “Reddit”, I came across an idea called“Constructive Living”. In applying this practice to myself, and my surroundings,the experience of “Doing”, instead of “Thinking” brought me to the conclusionthat misery is created by wallowing in distressful thoughts. Stress anddisharmony was being caused by wishing things were different. Instead, thematerial suggested that to fix the turmoil in my life, I should try to takedirect action in my environment on a day to day basis. And I should work towardtaking care of my environment regardless of how I felt. I had a glimmer ofcuriosity about how “Constructive Living” could improve my future.The next day, I looked around my room, the living room, and the kitchen. I didwhat ever task came into my head. As soon as resistance crept into my mind, Ivowed not allow myself to become stuck on the whether-for’s or why-for’s ofcleaning my surroundings. I did this for a few days, and I started to feelbetter. Months later, my whole life changed. I was imbued with this energy, andpower to complete goals I made for myself, that were left by the way-side a longtime ago. My depression started to melt away, and my attitude became one ofbeing helpful, instead of harmful. Instead of trying to avoid situations Ijudged I didn’t feel up for, I did the “Just do it” Michael Jorden way instead.I know it sounds silly, and back then it crossed my mind that it would neverwork, but the practices of “Constructive Living” do work.Please understand that I still experience sorrow from time to time, but it’srelated to the self I am leaving behind, as I am working towards my goals. Whichis a separate matter that needs to be dealt with. Before I started this work, Iwas focused on systematically eliminating all of my character flaws to heal mydepression. But the “Constructive Living” practice showed me another way. AfterI realized that the practice was working, I started searching for others whowere doing self-healing work. And I found other material that helped me targetmy conflicting behaviors. Another reedit user posted a list of life improvingbooks. I found one author, James Allen who had a multitude of books aboutintention, and actions. My mantra changed from acting on what brings mepleasure, to acting on a intuition of benevolence1 It’s not a easy thing to doat first. I didn’t really know what benevolent behavior was in the beginning.But as I started to take action from a non-reactive a place of love, kindness,and for the greater good, events in my life started to turn positive. At firstIt was like walking up hill without the proper exercise, but with practice itkept getting easier. Turning away from an selfish based mindset got easier, as Iwanted to create a better future for the greater good. After looking back onwhat I accomplished I thought, “If I can do this, I wonder what else I can do?”I still struggle with a few things that sit deep with in me, but now I have thisconfidence that I can overcome anything. What helped me was listening to JamesAllen’s philosophical teachings while I practiced ”Constructive Living”. Theseteachings go hand in hand, one works on the mind communication the other on thebody communication.I can barey control the positive changes in my life now, all I can do is ridethe current of life, and move a rock or two on the way toward a destination tosomething bigger. I was at a point in my life where I was ready for real change,and these practices worked very quickly. My appreciation and enthusiasm for lifehas increased ten fold, and I place the honor where it belongs, on the source ofall life. I don’t have any specific view of God. I think there is definitelysomething out there, but I’m not so definite I am capable of understanding whatit is. It seems that creation is related to the connection between life forms.I have found that working on my inner state, while living constructively hashelped me create the conditions I want to see in my life. This involved a efforton my part to change my negative mindset about myself, and the world. Beforethese practices, I was seriously effected by what I read or heard. Whateverinformation I took in, regardless of whether it was true, or not effected mymood for the day. I would experience these depressed or angry moods at whatseemed like random times.What I didn’t realize during these indulgences, was that something was trying toreach out to me. Maybe it was a message of: “Hey! Work on something that iscausing these moods, Scott.” I didn’t know what was causing them, until Istarted listening to James Allen’s work. His work pointed me in the rightdirection. In his work, there is this idea that throughout a human life, choicesare made positive or negative in every situation we encounter (non-decisions arestill decisions). When we make positive choices it effects our lives, and ourfuture positively. When we make negative choices those choices have a oppositeeffect. The choices we make have a cumulative effect on our consciousness overthe course of our lives. Even when we forget that we made these choices, thesechoices still have a psychic half-life on our mental projection of ourselves,and the world. These decisions, positive or negative, alter our perception ofour world, for good or ill.I have noticed that when I leave certain areas of my life unattended, depressioncan sink in to my consciousness. And that depression sometimes manifests asrage, or deep sadness. When I chose to ignore these states of being, Iexperience bouts of emotional instability.I wanted to stop being unstable in my emotional life. I decided to focus on howmy choices (based on past experiences) were effecting me as I went about my day.I started to make choices for the “greater good” instead of choosingself-preservation. I found that my survival needs became met when I stuck to my“greater good” principles, no matter what situation I was in. Avoiding difficultsituations in life, and not being 100% honest in all my interactions wasactually causing my emotional instability, and I was spreading that harm topeople I came into contact with. It was if I needed to make these people pay,because I chose not to deal with my emotional baggage.When I chose to accept my frustrations as self-creations, it becomes easier torealize change in my life. It took a few months discover the source of some ofmy darker feelings.With the help of James Allen’s work, I started to unravel which behaviors areharmful, and which are beneficial. Day after day, I watched my behaviors. When Isaw one that was harmful, I decide to replace that lower level thinking withhigher level qualities. I apologize to people when I caused harm, and I forgivemyself when I create harmful circumstances. I practice this over, and overagain. Eventually after a few weeks of practice, this joy of life opened up, andthe suffering I was experiencing started to diminish. I still struggle with deepseated emotional wounds, but I choose to work on these wounds. When I canrecognize the stages of acting out from harmful thoughts, It’s easier tostabilize my experience.Modern culture has a low opinion of the concept of morality, mainly due to lackof education. The accepted view I have encountered in my day to day interactionswith others is that living a moral life isn’t necessary. We make our lifesituations how we want to make them good or bad, and the freedom to choose ismore important that some rule about how to live. I see now that morality is notabout restricting my creative expression of life, Its really a code of conductthat I choose to adhere to, to protect myself, and others from harm.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. benevolence (n.) : c. 1400, “disposition to do good,” from Old French benivolence (Modern French bienveillance) and directly from Latin benevolentia “good feeling, good will, kindness,” from bene “well” (see bene-) + volantem (nominative volens) present participle of velle “to wish” (see will (v.)). In English history, this was the name given to forced extra-legal loans or contributions to the crown, first so called 1473 by Edward IV, who cynically “asked” it as a token of good will toward his rule.]↩"},{"pageContent":"WHY DIDN’T I DIE?Scott Larson12/25/18> Grief is just love with no place to go. ~ Jamie AndersonTo be on this planet in this time, is a challenge to say the least. I wonder ifthe children of other centuries said the same thing in their time? Everything ismoving very fast in my time. A high degree of conflict, and tyranny exists inthe world that is going unnoticed.An example of this conflict, is the specifics that led up to the 9/11 twintowers destruction. A real inquiry into the specifics of the event was shutdownin the very early stages of the commission report. Many families that hadvictims of the disaster wanted answers: How was the planes even able to continueoperating in our air space, given our air defenses?On the ground we had some significant changes to airline security protocols thatresulted in major abuse to freedom of speech. Activists are now being restrictedfrom flying, if their names appear on what’s called a “No Fly List”. A list thatis reserved for suspects of terrorist activities. I see parallels betweenchanges in our National security protocols, and how these protocols are used toprevent dissent. Was the goal of the 9/11 destruction to hold back an alreadyincessant tide of dissent? Against centralized government run amok? My questionis: Was there a premeditated goal, causing the event to happen in the firstplace? And if there was premeditation, who was involved in making this eventpossible?How do you make sense of a world that has been turned up-side-down by corruptionand greed? And how do I live with the part I played in this corruption?I see quite a bit insensitivity in our current conditions of society. More andmore people that are unable to provide for themselves are are living on thestreets. Many people that are unable to provide for themselves are being soldmedication to cope with an unhappy life.The truth is that I lost my sense of direction a long time ago when I deducedhumanity didn’t have a future. Almost dying just brought this “feeling lost”situation closer to home.My wake-up call came when I watched the reporting of what happened on 9/11.Watching the buildings free fall, the outer materials being ripped off thebuilding as it collapsed vertically into a neat and tidy pile of rubble. Thatwhole collapse seemed more alien than real. I have seen other skyscraperbuildings being demolished by explosives that didn’t even compare to theperfection that was in the destruction of the twin towers. At the time I was notaware of the “wrongness” of that collapse on a conscious level, I just felt sadfor the people who were trapped. What devastated me afterwards was the adversereaction to different view points by the mainstream media as they stuck to theofficial narrative, and how people were attacked for asking difficult questionsabout the nature of that collapse. Personally, I never bought the Islamistairliner story. I speculate the 9/11 incident was just an excuse for greedypeople to go to war, and to destroy any evidence of harmful actions. A yearafter the incident, the world went on with life. I guess in my own way I did aswell. Even though I carried on with life, something about that event inspired meto live by truth.Not that I was living a totally dishonest life, but I did realize I needed tolive a life of principles. I didn’t know whether I was coming or going, and thatcreated instability in my life. Before the Hemorrhage, I was exploring differenthobbies. I wanted to be a filmmaker. To move toward this endeavor I took variousclasses on filmmaking, and screenwriting. I wanted to write and direct my ownfilms. Films that showed the false nature in many historical events, and how themind clings to normalcy, to maintain a stable ego identity in the mists oftraumatic situations. And ultimately, how this psychological state ismanipulated on a societal level by people that understand how psychologicalpatterns can be created in the mind to control thought and actions. Also Iwanted to show how apathetic1 tendencies can be created in the mind of apopulation by instigating events that bring about this psychological trauma.Groups of people can have there own hive mind, and these group minds can bemanipulated on a social, and political level. The more I learned about thistopic, the more I realized then that it was going to be hard for me to live in aworld I despised. But I only despise the world for what it has become, not whatit’s capable of becoming through genuine effort on a individual level.The question of why I didn’t die may have something to do with what littlecontrol I have over events. I do feel like the Universe is waiting for me tocomplete something. How true that feeling is I still don’t know. All I know isI’m still here, I have been given support by many good people as I am changinginto a person of integrity. Is the Universe is using me to teach others how tolive? Or is the Universe is using others to teach me how to live… I think itsboth. I often think of the legacy I will leave behind when I leave this world.Although I’m not sure how, I think on some level the knowledge I absorb in thisexistence will exist as a tool to be used in another transitional world after Iam gone.During the trip to the hospital, I remember specifically that I was consciousthe whole time. My balance and vision were effected, and I had to shut myeyelids to prevent myself from being knocked off balance by my brain on morethan one occasion. But during this whole process I knew on some level I wasn’tgoing to die. I often visualize other worlds and places I could be, and maybe, Iwas sad that It wasn’t my time to transition to a new world.I realize i’m here to do something specific, not just for myself but for thegreater good. I appear to be doing something right as the quality of my life isimproving. I’m thinking and acting more positively. I don’t focus on actionsthat disempower my spirit, and I’m actually making progress with unravelinglife’s challenges.While I am on this planet, I need to do what I can to make this world a betterplace for everyone. When I am gone the only thing left of me is the legacy Ileave behind. Is this legacy going to help, or hinder humanity? I use thisstance to contemplate on my thoughts, and actions in each day. Every day is anew beginning that starts with the right intentions. Someday I will die, butprobably not until I have accomplished what I am here to do.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

The dream centered around the house my family lived in during my youngeryears. The house was an eight-room two-story house. Thinking back it was prettybig. In this dream, the house took on the size of a shopping mall. Outside asemi-truck was parked, blocking the front entrance. The front door to thismall-house was the size of a stadium entrance. Restaurants, and pubs replacedrooms you would find in a typical home. It was two levels with an escalator atthe entrance. In the center of the mall-house, on the ground floor, was thisamazing open kitchen supporting the upper level. It had no walls, it was onlysupported by large columns of marble like a building made in Rome. Themall-house itself had seen better days. I was standing in the front lobby,looking around. A few kids I knew as a child were removing some debris on theupper levels. I made my way to the upper level, and joined them.I noticed that we were working together to remove the debris that appeared tohave broken off from the ceiling and had fallen to the upper floor.Then the dream switched on me and I was standing by myself near the upper partof the escalator. My wife, mother, sister, and stepdaughter got off theescalator, and appeared before me in a fashion show style. Each family memberwas wearing a reflective dress. Each family member wore a different color dressthat seemed to represent all the main colors on the spectrum.When I awoke I knew I needed to tell somebody about it. So when my Wife, and Momcame to visit me, I told them about the dream. Then after I left the hospital, Icalled my Dad about it. Our real family house in Trevor, Wisconsin, wasdestroyed by a fire when I was in my late teens. I thought the dream was tellingme I was supposed to fix up the property, and I was in a point in my life whereI didn't know if I was going to continue in my current profession. So I asked myDad if he wanted me to sell the property, or fix it up, and rent it out. Wekicked around the idea for a while. My dad did not want to sell the property,and it would be too expensive to fix it up.So that was the end of that, I am not really clear on what I the dream wasabout. After the first option was a “no-go”, a second thought came to me thatthe Universe wanted me to get into the restaurant business. I like to cook, butI don’t know if running a restaurant is in the cards. I like the idea of servingothers in some way. People, food, and pleasant environments always appeals to meon one level. This dream helped me realize I need to be more open to otherpossible career paths. After my Hemorrhage, I find myself takingwell-intentioned risks in personal endeavors, often without knowing why. I oftenland in places that are secure, and positive. It gives me hope that I could havea fun, and interesting life exploring different callings."},{"pageContent":"OBSERVATIONS"},{"pageContent":"APPRECIATIONScott Larson12/25/18> “Appreciation is the subtle generator of a good life.” - Scott LarsonAppreciation is one of those subtle things that shouldn’t have any real worldeffect on life. It’s one of those qualities I admired in others. For most of mylife appreciation was an after effect of obtainment. What’s funny about thisstate of mind, is that obtainment of short lived pleasures rise, and fall, andare gone from memory in a heartbeat. Where ongoing qualities of appreciation,like having a home, a loving wife, and providing a quality service to thecommunity lasts a life time.Life is a gift. Its amazing that we exist at all. We live on a spinning rock outin space, revolving around the sun at a high velocity. Space, which seems to beexpanding with no end, exists in a vast vacuum where nothing can exist. So far,planet Earth is the only known planet to have complicated life forms in ourgalaxy. The Universe is a grand mystery. Generative appreciation comes fromcontemplation of this grand mystery. Appreciation is generated, when onechooses, for a time, to remove oneself from the micro operations of life to seethe bigger picture.Making the “right” decisions in life comes from appreciation of all life. If onefeels imposed upon due to one’s living conditions, it may be hard to see howgenerating a state of appreciation helps at all. When I was a young boy, myunderstanding was limited. Based on my limited understanding, my choices seemlimited as well. I felt that life imposed itself negatively on me. Looking back,I realized that this state of mind was a choice. The choice to remain a victimof life, led up to who I became as an adult. Whether it’s nescience1 orignorance2, it’s really a choice, unconscious or not. In making a consciouschoice not to be a victim, my circumstances changed fairly quickly. Regardlessof what the world does to me, I realize that my subjective experience is aboutme, how I see myself, and how I chose to respond to any given situation.Contemplation on the quality of appreciation brought me closer to being a goodhuman being. And this realization caused me to act in ways that reduced harm tomyself, and the world.When depression or anger sets in, try different behaviors/actions that mightalter that mood. Maybe walking at night calms the spirit? Don’t feel like it?Right, curiously I’m going to do it anyway, and see what happens.Significant change of heart only requires a leap of faith. To look at an idea orbelief in a slightly different way. True knowledge is gained by experience,understanding is gained though introspection. Book knowledge is only theorieswaiting to be tested by the reader. The more we act on experiential knowledge,the more we will have the capacity to appreciate what is happening around us. Iwonder what would happen if we appreciated the events of our life.Appreciation is a capacity to endure life’s challenges without succumbing to theparalyzing effects of negative consequences. The more we live in, and act out ofappreciation, the more we are able to respond in a positive way, the moreconnected we become to life, and the more life can respond to us.When we become connected to life, the more life can reach our hearts, and helpus achieve our life’s goals, assuming those goals have some kind of alignmentwith the plans of the Universe.What if there isn’t a plan for the universe? I act as if there is a plan, andwhen I generate this quality, my purpose in life becomes clear. I don’t think itmatters whether a plan exists, or not. What matters is the actions of theindividual, and the effects of those actions on the world.However subtle it may seem, the Universe gives back to those that truly givefrom the heart of appreciation. True giving comes from a generous spirit. Truegenerosity comes from practicing an appreciative mindset.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. I use the world “nescience” to mean to “not to know” and “innocent”. The innocent is still subject to the law, but unlike the ignorant they do not accumulate karmic debt. The etymology of nescience has the term “ignorance” in its definition but the two words “Ignorance” and “Nescience” are not the same when you actually look at the terminology.↩ 2. I use the word “ignorance” to mean refusing to act in a positive direction on knowledge. Ignorance is deliberately choosing to act against what you know to be true. I will sometimes incorrectly hyphenate the word. “ignore-ance” is used on purpose to draw attention to the true meaning of the word, which is to knowingly ignore information. People that chose to ignore information and act counter to what they have learned accumulate a karmic debt and will suffer an effect by way of Cosmic Law on themselves at some point in their soul existence.↩"},{"pageContent":"BELIEF VS KNOWLEDGEScott Larson12/25/18> “Belief is faith, Knowledge is knowing” - Scott LarsonYou are driving on a freeway at night. A bridge appears ahead. A good portion ofthe bridge is obscured in a thick fog. You come to a stop at a signal light atthe entrance. Beyond the signal light, you see cars cross the bridge, anddisappear into the fog. The light turns green, and you proceed. Because the fogis so thick, you have a hard time seeing, so you slow down. To have faith thatyou will exit out the other side requires belief. The belief anchored in aprevious experience of successfully driving though the fog unscathed, given theinformation that is available: Sound, light, and physical characteristics of theroad.Belief helps us fill in gaps of what we are unable to discern with our senses,helping to make a quick decision without actual data. Just because you havedrove through thick fog successfully in the past unscathed, doesn’t mean youwill do so the next time. A new set of circumstances might present themselves.There might be a brick on the road, causing you to stop. Without reliable data,prolonged beliefs turn into mental certainty. It’s like believing you can driveover any fogged out bridge unscathed without actually testing that belief. Whena untrained mind spreads a unfounded belief, it creates errors in our sharedperceptions of our world. Like a virus, as that error spreads, it becomespopular opinion. After the belief becomes public knowledge, consensus makes thatbelief a perceived fact. In civilized societies, there is a strong tendency forthe human mind to create a psychological identity around these perceived factsthat have no basis in reality. The mind becomes attached to the preference ofthese perceived facts being true. If the mind comes to the realization thatthese perceived facts are false, it creates a experience of death in the mind.The mind loses it's way, and the body responds to this loss in some constrictingway.BELIEF VERSUS KNOWLEDGE ARTICLE 1I came across the article below while researching the concept of the meaning ofthe word, “Belief”. I pulled some quotes out of the text to illustrate a pointabout the difference between knowledge, and belief.> “Man, know thyself and thou shalt know thy God”> “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven (which is within you) and all these> things shall be added unto you,”> He must become purified bodily and spiritually if he would attain the> priceless “Union” which will crown his labours. This cannot be accomplished at> once, but without a very definite effort it cannot be done at all. The first> thing then is a definite effort in the right direction.> This must be the certainty of Knowledge and not of Belief, and even if the> attainment of Knowledge is not the final goal (for it still implies duality,> viz. a Knower and a thing known), and someday, perhaps, this too must be> transcended, still until then let us Work, let us will to Know, let us forget> ourselves in our striving to become that Greater Self which is All Knowledge,> so that for each of us the Day may Dawn when, wrapped in adoration, we shall> Love and Worship, “Knowing as we are Known.”True knowledge can be found in two ways. The first is from passing knowledgebetween the species in a form of communication. The second is listening to thebody. Inner knowledge can spring up from within. It’s just there when you needit. When the mind is cleared of road blocks (ego identification) Knowledge canspring up everywhere like weeds in a garden.Consider the possibility that knowledge is not in the actual comprehension ofthe thoughts or words that are conveyed to us, but that through experience,personal “knowings” will pop into ones mind, and a correlation happens betweenthe body and the “knowing”. This is known as synchronicity. We all have withinus a shared “truth” about the circumstances in this life existence, and thistruth is accessible to everyone, even if some choose not to access it. Iunderstand “knowings” to be states of certainty that come from “knowhere”2,brought on by a subject related to an ideal that one is striving towards, oralready has within oneself, being aware of it or not. A state of certainty canbe a feeling, a statement in the mind, or something that is verbalized. It canalso be an action that generates a feeling of oneness, or wholeness. Even “Just”anger can be a “knowing” that can cause one to spring into selfless action tohelp another.In taking in printed information, test this process: don’t give to much weightto what you take in. I mean that: liking, hoping and being excited about a topiccan still happen. Instead of storing this information directly in your thinkingconsciousness, find another place for it.When you work to store this lesser weighted information along side (instead ofoverlaying) your thought process, ideals, energy, and states of equilibrium willpop into the body. When a preference is put on these states, instead of thecontent itself, a funny sensation might occur. It almost feels like it's avoice/action/thought not my own. When this happens to me, I attempt toincorporate this “extra-sensory” knowledge into my life, by trying it on like Iwould try on a piece of clothing. I’ll use it in a sentence, or I’ll act on itright away, and where the action leads. Mostly, I am looking for a feeling.Afterwards I start to feel this kind of satisfaction or a feeling ofaccomplishment, as if I labored all day to accomplished a important task. Whenthat happens, I know I have successfully incorporated inner knowledge into mylife, and I might not exactly know what it is on a conscious level. This innerknowledge can some times exist out of my awareness, but comes up when it’sneeded.This may seem like a very esoteric process, but that doesn’t mean that it’swithout value, the value comes later upon reflection of sudden, and significantchanges that happen in a life situation. When I look back on my life, I realizethe ideals that I held dear all my life are actually being accomplished, one byone.Accomplishing ideals can happen from belief, but I wonder if the accomplishmentof ideals that spring from belief alone have this empty quality to them thatinstills a feeling of never ending searching, or a blind ambition to accomplishwithout a feeling of purpose or joy.EXERCISEHere is an example of an experiment I did while I was working on this section, Icreated a list of “knowings” that came up when I took a moment to contemplate ontwo of the quotes I selected from the Bible. Please note that these “knowings”are just words that pop into my mind that seem to come from “knowhere”. But alsonote that you may come to realizations differently, depending on how you preferto process Information: Auditory, Visually, or Kinesthetically. How you preferto store information might depend on your personality type4.What I do is read a sentence, and then sit still with it in my mind for amoment. I choose how it’s related to what I already know so far in directrelationship to my ideals.> “Man, know thyself and thou shalt know thy God”Knowing, oneness.> “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven (which is within you) and all these> things shall be added unto you,”Order, resolution.Then I generate a statement that involves follow my ideal.Knowing and oneness brings order, and order brings resolution.Then I generate a affirmation that I will use to continue my ideal throughout mylife.I will know myself to bring oneness, when order ensues I will watch forresolution.The point here is to generate some statement that makes me feel resolute. Thenbeliefs can come, and go with out effecting my decision making.VISUALIZATIONImagine you are driving to the beach from far inland on a country road. The roadis long, and empty, except for endless fields of golden wheat. Finally you see asign pointing in your direction, “Beach this way”. You stop at the sign, and getout of your car. There is a smell of salt, and the air is cold. You look around,and see that the trees are swaying in the wind.You walk back to your car, get in, and continue driving in the direction youwere traveling. The wind starts to pick up, the flora changes from grass, andweeds, to succulent plants. And then your see it, a reflection in the ocean ofthe sun rising on the horizon. The road turns into sand, and you stop. You getout of your car and walk toward the ocean. The sand then turns into mud and youarrive at the shore.“Beach this way” is extraneous information given the fact that the signs of abeach are all around you. Can you not make a good assumption that if you kepttraveling in the direction the sign recommends based on your own observation ofthe quality of air that you will arrive at your destination?This is how one can come to objective truth, we all share the similar sounds andfeeling of arriving at the beach. It’s subjective in the sense that we all pickup on the same sensations of arriving at the beach, but we all recognize thesesensations differently, depending upon how each person process information, andeach person’s particular level of awareness. The data: Wind, smell, andtemperature of the air all exist in the objective nature of our planet. Oursubjective experience is how we feel or receive this data and how much of thisdata we can experience.Belief is like the sign on the road. It’s a preference for a specific state toexist. The sign might, or might not be true. It might point in the wrongdirection, but do we then ignore the wind, the quality of the air, and thelandscape changes because the sign is telling us which direction to go? Beliefsare thoughts about a state that exists, or is non-existent in the world aroundus.Be aware of your beliefs, contemplate on where they come from, and whatconclusions you make about the world because of them. The important stuff isobservable, and shared between all human beings. To come together as a tribe ofhumans, consider that the divisions we are experiencing in this world (politicalideologies) are based on beliefs that have no foundation other than a sign onthe road, a state of preference. Coming together involves us giving up ourpreferences.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BeliefThe be-, which is not a natural prefix of nouns, was prefixed on the analogy ofthe vb. (where it is naturally an intensive) …. [OED] Meaning “conviction of thetruth of a proposition or alleged fact without knowledge” is by 1530s; it isalso “sometimes used to include the absolute conviction or certainty whichaccompanies knowledge” [Century Dictionary]. From c. 1200 as “a creed, essentialdoctrines of a religion or church, things held to be true as a matter ofreligious doctrine;” the general sense of “That which is believed” is by 1714.Related: Beliefs. Belief meant “trust in God,” while faith meant “loyalty to aperson based on promise or duty” (a sense preserved in keep one’s faith, in good(or bad) faith, and in common usage of faithful, faithless, which contain nonotion of divinity). But faith, as cognate of Latin fides, took on the religioussense beginning in 14c. translations, and belief had by 16c. become limited to“mental acceptance of something as true,” from the religious use in the sense of“things held to be true as a matter of religious doctrine.” 1.

Care that embodies beinghumble. Experiencing a devastating storm can manifest the quality of beinghumbled. It’s the realization that there are processes at work in the Universethat are bigger than the totality of a human experience.Being humbled brings clarity of mind, a connection with life, and awareness ofwhat is happening outside the self.The qualities of humbleness, and arrogance cannot exist side by side in aspecific human experience. Arrogance has the qualities of: Superiority, inflatedworth or self-importance.We all have similar lots in life. In perfecting our character, having contemptof others, divides all of humanity. Contempt is really self-inflicted harmexpressed into the world from agreements we made with ourselves due to atraumatic event. An agreement can be made with the self to be closed to harm,and at the same time be closed to love. Like a pendulum, the self swings fromthe side of a victim, to the other side of a victimizer. This swinging from oneextremity to the other prevents a balanced life.Rising above strife, and sorrow involves putting aside judgments of inferiority.You may balk at the idea of judging another as inferior, but what about therepublican or democrat? When opinions differ, do we not assume inferiority inanother? This does not mean that we give up judging situations that have animpact on our life situation. It only means that we work to give up harboringharmful thoughts that come from perceptual judgments of a persons character,that are really based on some limiting belief we have about our own character.Perfection of the self requires silent observation. Be aware of the Ego’s needto draw attention to the self. The ego is like a caged animal just waiting foran opening to get out. It becomes released during certain validation seekingbehaviors. Ego behaviors, are infectious. The unhealthy desire to make the selfknown creates a mental position of self-superiority in the mind. Very suddenly,a force of strife comes into the air, causing a desire to attack, and defend.As the quality of humbleness, and compassion is practiced, the quality of havingfaith in others becomes apparent. Every person has the innate ability to setmatters right in there own heart. I have observed that people unconsciouslyresent \"do-gooders\", people who make it their job to fix the life conditions ofothers as a way to hide fixing themselves. Deep down, every individual knows theright way to live, but have made a personal choice not to. Over time, autonomycan be surrendered, in exchange for the feeling of fitting in. Practicing“otherly” non-interference is a sign of maturity. Maturity is revealed when itis discovered that goodness is stronger than evil, and that people willself-gravitate toward doing good when given an opportunity to do so. To harbormistrust in others is to become a victim of mental projections. This sets theself apart from others, causing the fall into egotism.Refuse to give into tactics, or concepts, that cause division. The societal mindcreates it’s own own lack of self-reflection. To feel safe, this societal mindworks to steer the group in directions that are not always beneficial.When faced with a difficult situation that engages a feeling of being wronged, Iattempt to practice a state of non-response. I sit with the discomfortingfeeling, knowing that I alone have generated the feeling. I cannot be wrongedunless part of me feels deep down that I can be harmed. I return to the memorythat the soul is indestructible, and flood the body with a feeling of compassionfor myself and others. I resolve to remember that the soul will carry on afterthis life, and it’s important to remember the lessons of non-attachment. Aboveall, I work to forgive myself when I cannot rise above a situation. Every personstruggles in certain areas more than others. It might take a life time, or manylifetimes to resolve certain karma.When we allow ourselves to become divided by reacting to the emotionaloutbursts, or psychological attacks from people with a lesser thought process,we actually fit into their particular level of thought for a time. Eachoccurrence accumulates the surrendering of the will, and it becomes difficult tofind balance.By recognize our similarities we create a feeling of community. Then ourcollective good will exends out into the world.There are times when I need to respond with a calm, and sound mind to anemotion, but there many times when I don’t need to respond at all. I have foundthat finding the determination, and will to know the difference is an importantpractice.I work to forgive myself when I fall, get back up and resolve to never fall inthat particular place again. When I don’t give up, I get stronger, and failless. The more practice I put into strengthening my resolve to improve, thebetter I get at improving. More importantly, I resolve not to use failure as aexcuse to give up. We are not destined to fail, we are destine to rise above allthat is causing this world harm.There is a field of energy that we all contribute to, and whatever we put intothis field is exactly what we get out of it. We will create the conditions wewant to see when every human being on the planet changes their thinking, andworks to create a greater good. This happens one by one.It will happen, all it takes is a few of us to light the way. People all overthe world are realizing that they don’t want to suffer any longer, and arerefusing to allow themselves to be controlled by inner demons. When we maintaincare in all our dealings it’s very hard to sink into qualities that harm life.Humanity will rise above all the poisons of the world when we learn to harbor\"Care\" for ourselves and each other."},{"pageContent":"CONFLICTConflict is that little death that slowly eats away at the soul.Scott Larson12/25/18Wanting superiority over a situation, or another creates conflict in the heart.Superiority over a situation implies personal gain. Real gain comes from within.Generate a quality that is most beneficial for the situation, this is done bygiving that quality to the situation or person without the need of a return.The Universe is one giant mirror, it reflects back what a conscious individualcreated. When a quality is generated in a conscious person, the Universegenerates a force or energy equal to that quality. Energy and force can take onforms that are not always apparent.For example: A mentally unstable person is screaming obscenities at people in aCafe. You are at this Cafe being bombarded by these obscenities. Many arenegatively reacting to this person in what ever way they picked up in their ownlife situations. If you have a inclination to react negatively to a situationlike this, but instead decide to go within and check in with your own internalstate, what happens? In checking in with yourself you might find that you have apreference for an old reaction of fear that wells up inside of you, but thequality is different now because you brought the light of your consciousness onthe feeling. Now under that fear you detect compassion for yourself. You comeback to that situation with the screaming person. Now in place of that fear allyou have inside of you is compassion. Instead of reacting to fear in the way youmight normally have done, if you had a preference for that reaction, you chooseto respond by smiling with compassion at the screaming person. The situationpasses and the energy dissipates. You realize that the mentally unable person iscalming down. Then the people around you who were negatively reacting to thisperson are either detained in some fashion from intervening or become silent andunderstanding of the screaming person.We could say that the quality of compassion was reflected back to the encounter.But not in a form that is easily recognizable. Or some other event caused thatchain reaction. The Universe works in ways that we can’t always understand atour current level of awareness.How we decide to respond, determines the quality of a conflict. Sometimesconflict needs to be generated to bring understanding to a situation, how thatconflict is handled determines the quality of the outcome.Most of the world’s modern societies operate by a set of principles that are putinto motion by artificially created competitive laws. Due to ill conceivedsurvival \"at all costs\" ideologies, many choose to live in fear of losing theirjob, social status, or in some case their very life. The laws themselvesactually cause the generation of selfish desires. Many pursuits of self-interestends up harming the greater good. This dynamic between people who pursueself-interests, and the people who are negatively effected by theseself-interests, become conflicted. This creates a polarity between the poles ofvictimization, and victim. Then parasitic people come in and try create a biggerdivide so that an outcome can be generated that benefits an interested profitdriven party. It’s killing us. When we allow selfish driven pursuits to becomemore important then the wellbeing of the planet, and it's people, sufferingensues. We sell our communities down the river for profit, so wealthy familiescan survive. How long do you think this way of living can last? We have tochange, now. For the betterment of all life. There exists a place of peace inthe eye of the storm. Choose the path of a higher path of living, even wheneveryone around you is contributing to the chaos. Recognize that our futurecannot be sacrificed for short lived security. Avoid situations, and positionsthat put one in conflict with life. Ask yourself, \"Is this endeavor worthsacrificing our future?\". If it isn't then drop it, and move on to somethingthat gives humanity meaning and hope. It's not worth sacrificing your mental,and emotional state by contributing to making the world a worst place to livein. You are directly responsible for your life, and the lives you affect by yourdecision to include yourself in endeavors that cause harm to the world. The world will change for the good, as more and more people choose this higherpath of living. This is when the benefits of Cosmic Law become directlyaccessible to us: Peace, prosperity, and harmony without selling your communitydown the river.People are pitted against each other in debates about how to handle theseself-created dilemmas. Using a form of dialectics, power differentials arecreated by people who have learned how to throttle the power of the mind. Onetactic is using mass media to create stigmas on topics that are not clearlyunderstood by the masses. This creates fear, and confusion, making societieseasier to control.We all want to feel safe. In our inner life, and in the world. I think safety isgenerated by maintaining a philosophy of self-government. Work to make your ownlife safe. Don’t wait on others to protect you. Like a military leader who ispreparing for battle, take charge of your life. Keep watch on your mind. Becomeaware of weak points where enemies can get in, and compromise your security.Build defenses in the mind that counter-act attacks by others that wish toprofit off of your unprepared state of mind. Become aware of your surroundings,get over your fear, and talk to your neighbors, family, and friends aboutcreating a solid community of preparedness.In convincing the German people to go along with the Nazi regime, JosephGoebbels on the “Big Lie” once said that:> “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually> come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State> can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military> consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to> use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of> the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”When you see the world for what it is, only then can you change it. If you are ahunter, and try to determine your prey’s habits by what you think it might do,rather than what it actually does, you end up being sorely disappointed, andmisled by your own mind. This is what exactly happened to the German peopleunder the rule of the Nazi regime. Don't assume people that have a survival \"atall costs\" mentality won't lie, cheat, and steal to convince you to go alongwith a program that is totally against your wellbeing. But don't be afraideither, you can't act in a clear capacity if your mind is on high alert all thetime. Just recognize when something is amiss, and chose not to be apart of itwith your time, money or energy wherever possible.Generating self-conflict is the last area of my life I still struggle with. Thiscondition is deeply seated in my personality, and my personality still has acertain kind of effect on me. There are times when I will wake up from a dream,and in the dream I am being tempted into conflict. If I allow it, this feelingwill effect my entire day.For me, conflict starts with a small frustration, or annoyance that leads tofull blown strife with myself and others. I have a expectation for a certainstate to exist in the world. For example, I ordered some food, and was not happywith it, or someone made a comment that I mistook for an attack on my character.Work at becoming hyper aware of inner thoughts, and feelings. Notice whenfrustration, or annoyance starts to well up. Go within, and check-in with theself. Make a choice to focus on inner needs, not external mental creations. Inthe case of the food not being prepared the way I want, I can accept the foodas-is. Or I can just send it back if I know I wont like it.On the matter of the comment, I can go within, and ask myself, \"Is this commenttrue about me?\". If the answer is, “Yes”, then I could thank the person, and goon with my day. If the answer is “No”, then I can be assured that the comment isabout the other person, and not myself. I could generate compassion, for myself,and others, and stay silent until the moment passes.Awareness, making a decision, and acting is key. If you don’t intuit of what isgoing on inside you, you don’t have the ability to make a decision, the worldchooses for you.We will know peace when we: 1. Choose to take responsibility for our actions that lead up to conflict. 2. Stop the small things from become bigger things, by taking honorable, inner-truth, actions in the world.Oppressor, and oppressed, are co-conspirators in ignore-ance1. Or both partiesare nescient2. From the outside looking in, the knowledge of polarity in allthings allows us to recognize that suffering exists only in the push, and pullof both sides of a polarity: Weakness of oppressed, and the misapplied power ofthe oppressor. Breaking out of this dynamic involves having love for both theoppressor, and the oppressed; condemning neither. Take responsibility for yourown action, or inaction that creates a oppressor, or oppressed situation. Aindividual can only rise above any situation by lifting up ones thoughts. Aindividual can only remain weak by refusing to lift up ones thought. We can’tchange others, but we can be examples for each other. Being examples for eachother changes the world, for the greater good, however slow it might be.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. I use the word “ignorance” to mean refusing to act in a positive direction on knowledge. Ignorance is deliberately choosing to act against what you know to be true. I will sometimes incorrectly hyphenate the word. “ignore-ance” is used on purpose to draw attention to the true meaning of the word, which is to knowingly ignore information. People that chose to ignore information and act counter to what they have learned accumulate a karmic debt and will suffer an effect by way of Cosmic Law on themselves at some point in their soul existence.↩ 2. I use the world “Nescience” to mean to “not to know” and “innocent”. The innocent is still subject to the law, but unlike the ignorant they do not accumulate karmic debt. The etymology of Nescience has the term “ignorance” in its definition, but the two words “Ignorance” and “Nescience” are not the same when you actually look at the terminology.↩"},{"pageContent":"DOINGScott Larson12/25/2018> “Our lives are either good, or bad, enslaved or free, according to it’s> causation in our thoughts. For out of these thoughts spring our deeds, and> from these deeds come equitable results.” - James AllenBegin the day with doing whatever needs to be done, without an inclination, for,or against the action. Look around the immediate environment. The mind will pickout things to do in it’s own orderly fashion. Do it with out indulging inthought. If a though comes to the mind, redirect the quality of that thought tothe attention of the task.It’s easy to contemplate on doing, quite another thing to act. When a situationrises that is not preferred, a tendency arises to want to judge the situation,instead of acting to make it better.As I am learning to be more kind, patient, and compassionate, situations ariseto help me gage my progress. There is always something to be learned. In thisexistence, our lives will never be quite perfect, but in striving for perfectionwe can come close. As a human family, we are in each others life for a reason.Instead of avoiding each other, and situations we don’t like, accept thediscomfort, and learn from the experience.Don’t be discouraged by the self’s constant mishaps. Know that imperfection ispart of a grand scheme to help us practice to be better human beings. Accept themishaps as lessons from life. Imagine a strong but loving teacher who does notlet the pupil get away with bad behavior by calling it like it is. There arepeople in the world like that, seek them out. These people care about thewellbeing being of humanity. Sometimes just knowing that good people exist isenough.When times are tough, listen to the heart, it’s a soft voice. It will alwayscommunicate in a way that protects wellbeing. Our soft voice try’s hard not tobe noticed. Respond to its commands without thought. On the other hand, a loud,and critical voice will always try to destabilize the inner life. This obnoxiousvoice is never in the business of looking out for wellbeing. It wants to berecognized at any cost. Recognize that you can acknowledge that loud voicewithout being destabilized by it, and at the same time don’t confuse the softvoice as a unrecognizable murmur. Listen to the soft voice even though it’strying to stay hidden, be still for as long as it takes to receive the message.With the loud voice, simply recognize that you are the master of it. Not thatyou are better than it. Like a dog that looks up to its master, the master looksout for the dog’s wellbeing, a real master knows the foolishness in trying toconvince the dog of who’s boss. The master never harms the dog by assuming thedog is the lesser being. The soft voice is like a compassionate friend that doesnot try to stand out. The soft spoken are the ones that should be listened to,they light our way.In day to day dealings with others, when we act selfishly to put ourselves on apedestal, we are on a track of destruction. When we put the self above life,true life becomes obscured by mental illusions. Then we expect everything, andgive nothing. When we cut ourselves off from living a true life, we have nothingto give but misery.I have found that life’s troubles are not caused by others, life’s troubles arecaused by each, and every person’s internal agreements with themselves. Theworld marches on like a parade band. It marches to a tune set by our collectivewill. We cannot change the tune by screaming warnings to the band from thesidelines. It can only be changed by being strong enough to enter the group andgoing against the grain with a different tune. One that protects the wellbeingof all, and is created by you. Then after a time, single band members mightchange direction if the tune is true.We create that tune by living a life worth living. Stop giving in to thecollective will, say no often (with kindness). Be prepared to be attacked bypeople that want to steer you back to a herd mentality. After these tests, theUniverse will put the right people on our path, and help us on our way.CONSEQUENCESConsequences happen as a result of our actions. The term “You reap what you sow”is a good metaphor for this process. There is the sowing of seed, how oneperforms that. Then there is the season, how long one has to wait for theharvest, and then there is the reaping. Each part has a process, and a timeframe. And that time frame can change depending on the season, or by the type offruit being sown. The seasons of the Universe change dramatically depending onthe age we live in. So don’t expect to calculate these seasons with any accuracyunless you are a mystic. And if you are not called to, don’t even try. Justrecognize that payment for any previous debt’s are due. You can pay now, or paylater. The choice is yours.For instance, I was verbally, and sometimes physically, abusive to my family. Ilearned this abuse from my father. My abuse would take the form of anger whensome situation didn’t go my way. I didn’t necessarily reap the consequences ofthat treatment of others right away (but I have reaped consequences right awayfrom other actions). It took twenty years to finally reap the consequences ofthis kind of behavior when I married my wife. The abuses I caused to the peoplearound me became an identity I brought with me into our marriage. My wifealready had a abusive family, and we played the victim/aggressor/savior rolestogether.Because we both had such a similar history of abuse, we would behave in such away as to escalate the process to the point of explosion. I love my wife dearly,and this cycle of abuse was destroying us, so I decided to do what ever it tookto stop it.Once I started working on my rage, which came about due to the thought processesof being wronged, my actions changed. I remind myself that my anger is about me,and that I have control over my reactions no matter what was happening in frontme. I stop reacting to my own preconceived judgments others have about me, andwork to create the life I want t see: Happiness, Calmness, and compassion, formyself and others. I draw on these principles in everything I do. I think I hadto reach a breaking point before I really took this practice to heart. There wasa time when I thought nothing would change in my life situation no matter howhard I tried. My situation did change, drastically, after a few months of afterpracticing ”Constructive Living”. My family started recognizing my efforts, andthen I also noticed that each individual of my family was learning how to bemore loving.MOMENTUMActions we take in the world have a certain momentum. Like stopping a vehicle,time is required before coming to a complete stop. In this way, our actions mayseem to carry on even after a course of action changes. Do not give up. Theremay be cosmic reasons why we sometimes still reap negative consequences. Keepworking on: * Refusing to harbor harmful thoughts about yourself, others, or the world and replace them with kind and loving thoughts. * Continue to respond to situations with compassionate resolve. * Act for the good of all where you are able. * Be at peace in ones own heart during day to day activities, regardless of conflicting thoughts that spring into the mind. But when one is not at peace accept the non-peace, and move on with your day. * Work toward maintaining a routine of self-enriching behavior. * Remove oneself from situations that don’t support ones new way of living as best as possible.I work to not engage myself in drama, idle chatter/gossip, or requests to bedrawn into conflicts. I work to do what is necessary to support family, friends,or acquaintances, without the need to get something in return.Every action has a purpose, even when we can’t see it. Try to see the purposebehind every endeavor. How it relates to your ideals, or principles, (yours orothers) and make a choice if you want to be involved in that endeavor.If one lacks strength to stick to agreements, forgive oneself and keep trying.One may look like a fool in the eyes of others for the flip/flop behavior, butone day the strength will come to honor ones agreements. A person who labors forsuccess is honored for fruits of one’s labor, and the trials are soon forgotten.If grief remains one’s life, the Universe wills it for some purpose. Lookclosely at one’s day to day actions. Make two lists of actions. Separate actionsinto \"Truthful\" and \"Wrongful\" actions. Work to remove wrongful actions fromone’s life.Work towards clearing current harmful actions, and make amends for anyself-create suffering. This practice usually leads to the beginning, and end, ofturmoil. One exception is agreements we made in the past, to take on otherbeings karma. Sometimes agreements can be made, and forgotten. Turmoil can comeback when one turns away from any ideal, or principle.Cancel all of your internal agreements to take on outside karma. You can do thisas an affirmation in your head. Generate the quality of resolve in your body. Dothese kinds of cancellations after you wake up in the morning. If you have aschedule that precludes waking up in morning hours, then do the affirmationright before you start your day. I have experienced that its not a good idea tocancel or make any agreements before going to sleep, those agreements can liveon in your mind, if you haven’t developed a strong mental capacity to ignoredark thoughts. Create a regiment around this affirmation for at least two weeks,and up to three months. It takes this long for your unconscious mind to unwirethose agreements.EGODoing the work of self-improvement works better without a desire to tell othersthe specifics of what I endeavor to accomplish. I often think about my motivesbehind my wish to explain myself. What motives do you have to tell others aboutyour pursuits? I have found that I tell others about my internal pursuits to getsome kind of ego boost. I wonder if this ego boost involves self-importance. Iwant to be seen as a \"do gooder\". I like the validation I get from others, whenthey ask me about my pursuits. But when I engage in this behavior, it reallysabotages my internal world, as now I am focus on this external view I haveabout this pursuit.When a group has made a pact to work on internal beliefs, then sharing a goalmight actually help instead of hinder. The hope is that the people in the groupwill see the true motives for sharing. Understanding motives for any action isimportant. Knowing the “why” of a action can give one the freedom to makehealthy choices. Actions that are automatic, and devoid of choice, lackconsciousness. Strive to bring conscious choice in one’s life at any cost."},{"pageContent":"LAW OF LIFEScott Larson12/25/2018> “The universe aligns with those who aligns themselves to the Law.” - Scott> LarsonA great effort is being put forth to deceive thinking beings into a lifestyleentirely dependent on society. Psychological studies have shown that repetitivemessages sent to the brain end up in the belief system of the individual throughwhat’s called an “Illusory truth effect1” . Mass communication platforms areused as tools by powerful people to create certain dominant patterns of thoughtin the minds of the people. It’s not the fault of one political camp, oranother, it’s a relationship between the people and it’s creations. There is aneed to a maintain power differential, for survival purposes, and a need tomaintain security, to feel safe. This has been a ongoing relationship betweendominators and victims for a very long time. This dynamic goes back as far aswritten history allows, and then some. At some point in the past, humanity gaveup it’s autonomy in exchange for perceived security. Humanity was duped into thebelief that we need help from positions of power to maintain this security. Inwanting to feel safe in our environment, we become caught in ideologies thatcentralize our power into systems that don't serve us. The concept of anideology is not a problem in and of itself. Today, ideologies are fed to societyto maintain the appearance of autonomy. This is done so that there is aperception of freedom in a mental prison of our own making.An example of this is national politics. People choose to believe votingactually has a positive effect on society. In reality, the system of governmentis tightly controlled by power wielding groups that operate behind thecandidates to maintain a power differential over society, and these people workvery hard to keep the depth of that control a secret.One of the ways power wielding groups maintain this perception of false autonomyis by stigmatizing certain knowledge. Occult information is one such example ofstigmatization. Though religious doctrine (fear of the unknown) and scientism(contempt of the abnormal) much of humanity’s past has been covered up by thefalse perception that Occult knowledge is evil, or not considered worthy ofattention. Many Occult systems of thought use observation to discover truthabout a subject, it just uses non-accepted forms of stimuli.When taking in new information, that runs against this cultural mindset, noticethe adverse reaction you might have when an idea runs counter to a belief.In the book “The Kybalion2” the Three Initiates describe certain principles thatexist because of a law that operates behind workings of the Universe. This lawis cosmic in nature, and it affects all objects that exist within it. It governsall relationships between consciousness and the Universe.The term “world”, which is different from the term “earth” (a living planet) isa mental construct that reflects the state of consciousness of all beings thatexist on the planet.This cosmic law interacts with us. When a human takes an action based on athought, that thought creates an emotion in the body, and the resulting actionhas an effect (delayed or not) in our day to day interactions with reality.A small example of this effect is taking a irresponsible action. Anirresponsible action is one that is taken without considering the consequencesof that action’s effect on oneself, or others. It might be possible that theharm goes into the Universe, comes back to its creator at a later point in time.Years later, an physical attack might happen by an unknown person for noapparent reason. This incident may have been the result of a law. Theconsequences of an action may not be easily discernible from outwardappearances. Much of the effects in relationship to consequences is a internalstruggle of the person that “may” or “may not” be noticeable in the world.A “wrong” can be made “right” by making amends in some fashion. What fashionseems to be determined individually. In many circumstances, It may seem likethis law can be escaped by doing nothing, or continuing on a irresponsible path.Only this law decides if you need a lesson later in life to completely resolve acycle of karma3.The Universe and it’s laws is very balanced when dealing out justice. We do notalways see the effects of this justice in our limited perceptions.The best way to “right” a harmful action in the world is to discover your own“wrongs”, and “right” them in your own life.PRINCIPLES OF LAWUnderstanding Cosmic Law brings one the power to improve the understanding ofthe true self.A dominant world view has been established about personal discovery of realityin modern societies. This ideology is fairly dominate in western societies, ifnot all societies of the world: “The self, and all of it’s manifestations is allthat can be known to exist”. The implied meaning here is, “Truth is only aperception of the mind. Everything that is perceived to exist outside the selfis just a manifestation of the mind”. Hence, truth is subjective. This is calleda “subjective experience”. It is true each individual has subjectiveexperiences, but that does not negate objective reality. There are truths thatexists independent of the mind. An example of a subjective experience is when aevent happens, you feel, or perceive something a certain way, and that way ofperceiving may, or may not be in alignment with the external reality. Subjectiveexperience is mental, emotional and perceptual, and objective experience is theresult of actions taken in relationship to cause and effect. Objectiveexperience happens independent of what is experienced subjectively.We inhabit a creation. The Earth and all life, the stars, and the Universe is acreation. This Universe is created by what I understand as the “Galactic Core”of the Universe. This core is at the center of the Universe and, all mattercomes from it.I don’t think it’s possible to understand what the “Galactic Core” is in ourcurrent state of existence. This dilemma is similar to a black hole (gravitywell) in outer space. We understand a black hole event to be a spacial anomalythat warps space, and time. No energy (light and physical matter is energy) inthe Universe can escape from this particular spacial anomaly. Gravity is sostrong that it sucks everything into it like pouring water into a funnel. We donot yet have the capacity to observe what comes out the other end, due to thearea of effect a gravity well has on energy. We can only observe the affectsthis gravity well has on the surrounding space, by what is passing from outerrim of this creation into the hole in the middle.We know that the Universe operates by a set of observable laws. To preventconfusion, I call this Cosmic Law. All Laws are based on a set of principles.When we work to understand principles of law, that study can allow anunderstanding of effects the Law has on our existence.Regardless of our beliefs, Cosmic Law has a measured, and immutable effect onall life. We feel this effect in the actions we take in the reality we occupytogether. For example, in most cases, jumping of a cliff into a deep chasmwithout the means to slow decent is going to result in damage to the body.Holding a belief that one can fly isn’t going to spare the body from the falldamage. This effect is obvious to any person who contemplates on the subject.And it operates in other matters, like the choices we make in life.The principles that make up Cosmic Law are:Please read “The Kybalion4” for more information about this Hermeticunderstanding of the universe. 1. Mentalism: The universe and all it’s creation is mental in nature, brought about by a master creator, or creators. 2. Correspondence: There is a connection between all things known, and unknown. 3. Vibration: Nothing is at rest. Even objects that appears at rest; everything moves; everything vibrates. 4. Polarity: Everything in the Universe has a spectrum of opposites. 5. Rhythm: Everything in the Universe has a spectrum of rising and falling. 6. Causation: Everything in the Universe has a effect that springs from an cause. 7. Gender: Everything in the Universe has within itself the ability to generate life by the interaction of the masculine and feminine principles within the object.The main principle I would like to focus on is Causation. Understanding thisprinciple enables one to understand, and live by a code, or a law that governsthe will to do “right” in all situations.It is said that one cannot know what a “right” action is in all situations. Icounter that if one understands the principles of the Universe, one cannot go“wrong” in any action. As soon as a “wrong” action is taken, the practitionerwill see it’s flaw immediately. Upon reflection, the practitioner can use theprinciple of Rhythm to swing back in the other direction, correcting the courseof the practitioner’s life. The nature of evil, is one of ignore-ance5, ornescience6. Evil and “wrong” doing is created by way of illusory thought. Whenwe give into a mental construct such as temptation, it is not the object thatcreated the temptation, it is the mind’s construction of the object. We giveinto a perception of an object, when the tempting thought was allowed to takeroot in the mind. Then, over time it can take root in our heart, and then we actfrom this desire. Over extended period of time it becomes automatic to go fromthe construct of desire, to the act of desire. Please note that desire, in andof itself is not bad. We can desire good things. When desire is used to dominateothers, and prevents us from acting with love, one might need to question itsworth. I had to question my own actions when I started to see women as objects,rather than human beings.When we understand the framework of Cosmic Law, and how it operates in ourlives, we can apply it to our own expression of life.Understanding this framework enables us to rely on truths that exist in theUniverse. These truths can be applied to decision making, without the need torely on input from others.Input from others is not bad, in and of itself, the problem is very fewunderstand the principles behind what they believe. And this “ignore-ance” or“nescience” of what begins a understanding, makes us blind to what actuallyexists, as opposed to what we think or feel exists. Every time we interact withlife, by turning on the TV, or listening to another being, we are absorbing arecreation of event. Most of us accept, and reject information based on beliefsrather than experiential knowledge. Many beliefs come into the mind by thedissemination of external information (from our society), with no objectivefoundation.If one is unable to question or filter information by a proven method ofrealization, to fit in, a being will take in beliefs from outside the selfwithout question. It happens early in life, then the process becomes secondnature. In our teens we forget that it ever happened. In our adult life we endup acting out of mental personalities created by these false beliefs. Look intoschools of thought that help the practitioner think critically. The TriviumMethod of Study is one working method of critical thinking that was used inclassical education7.When the practitioner experiences an effect that does not align with thepractitioner’s internal state of mind, there exists a misalignment. Since theUniverse and it’s laws are not part of human experience the misalignment alwaysexists in one’s own perceptions, and to correct the misalignment thepractitioner has to align ones behavior to Cosmic Law. If the practitioner doesnot to alter ones subjective experience, internal suffering will eventuallyensue.We can have a subjective experience, and be open to changing that experience,when it is not in alignment with objective reality. I always thought that myemotional anger, and rage was brought on by the actions of others. Can youimagine how I felt, after I learned that expressing unwarranted anger toward arecipient caused objective harm to that individual? Some situations require justanger, and just action, but it’s the quality, or motive behind that action,which causes the effect to be negative or positive.I chose to be angry based on decisions I made about my subjective experience.Decisions I made had a emotional foundation, based on what I learned from myparent’s own subjective experiences.Another principle that I would like to focus on is the principle of Polarity.Everything in this world has a negative, and positive charge. Nothing isperfect, but one can strive toward perfection, if one creates the will. Thisconcept freed me from clinging to a specific view point, on any topic. Allthings being equal, the truth is somewhere in the middle of any pole.Choosing not to fall into a polar opposite generates healthy outcomes. WhenGeorge Bush acted as president of the U.S., he was playing the role of makingwar in the Middle East. To make this war happen, he used the 9/11 event as amethod of convincing the population to go along with his subjective experience.He used the term “You are either with us, or with the terrorists”. That kind oflanguage should be a red flag that the speaker is working to create a pole ofopposites. Either side of that pole sits the domination of the pole creator.The principle of Rhythm can be used to generate thoughts that create a feelingof freedom from an outcome. Events can rise and fall outside of subjectiveexperience. Actions can still be taken by the practitioner to make the worldbetter, but without having to cling to the outcome. Taking action for what is“Right” in a world of “Wrong”, may involve realizing that their might be anadverse reaction to such an action, for reasons we might not always understand.Speaking the “truth” may be the best that one can do. It is up to the peoplethat hear the call to act, and sometimes that call does not get through at theright time.FRODO & SMEGAL AT THE FORBIDDEN POOL, A STORY OF CAUSE AND EFFECT.In the “Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers”, the main characters Frodo and Samare captured by the Rangers of Ithilien, and taken to a secret cave. This caveis hidden by a waterfall. Outside the cave, and beyond the waterfall lays apool.Faramir holds them in this cave to consider what to do. One night, Faramir wakesFrodo, and takes him to this pool. When Faramir, and Frodo arrive at the at thecliff edge, Faramir points to his company of Rangers, they have their arrowstrained on the creature Gollum at the bottom of the pool. Faramir uses thissituation to draw out the truth that Frodo is hiding about his relationship toGollum. Initially when Frodo, and Sam were captured, Frodo lied about knowingGollum (to protect him from capture).Frodo finally gave in, and told Faramir that the creature Gollum was bound tohim. Frodo asked Faramir if he could go down to Gollum, and try to talk him outof the pool to prevent the tragedy.Gollum was in the middle of catching fish when Frodo came upon him. Frodocommanded Gollum to come away from the pool. Gollum was initially skeptical asto the situation, given the fact that he escape capture when Frodo and Sam weretaken. Frodo asked Gollum to trust him, and finally was able to lead Gollum awayfrom the pool. Then the Rangers capture Gollum.Faramir questions Gollum about where he is taking Frodo, and Sam. Gollumverbalizes the feeling of betrayal at the pool, and in the dialog betweenGollum’s split personality, reveals that Frodo has the Ring of Power, and thatGollum is taking Frodo and Sam to Mordor to destroy it.I want to use this as an example of of how all of us, with mind, body, and soulhave two parts in us: The lower pool where Gollum resides, and the higher cliffwhere Frodo resides. There are forces outside of us that, in their confusion inwanting to feel safe, destroy the lower for the higher.The lower self exists for a reason. The fact that it creates mischief, and harmis only due to our ignore-ance of how the lower was created. Instead of goingdown to that part of ourselves to lift it up, we leave it at the bottom of thatpool. Only when we are called to answer for our behavior, do we descend intothat pool. Working to take “right” action in all of our dealings minimizes theeffect our lower selves have when it encounters a situation it judges as abetrayal, or abandonment. Working towards being accountable, and honest in allsituations, prevents the blow-back that our unconscious Gollum would use tocreate a situation it needs to bring the self into balance.The lower part of ourselves is like a our little self we abandoned. As we matureinto adults we leave our child-like self behind without realizing it. Whenproblems start to arise in our adult lives, we don’t really understand that ourturmoil is coming from our abandoned child-life self.Frodo is our best self trying to do the right thing, Gollum is our lower selfdriven by the need to be protected, and out of that need comes greed. It doesn’tunderstand that sacrificing the spirit to gratify that need causes harm to theself. So when we go down to that part of ourselves, and try to pull it out ofthe darkness, its going to feel betrayed. Consequences will arise out of thisfeeling of betrayal. The best one can do is honor the effects, however bad theyare, until one gains control over that part of the self.Indulging in despair is a sure sign that one has sunken to the lower level. Thisis ok, and not ok. It’s ok to make mistakes, not ok to continue to indulge inthat darkness when one discovers the totality of the self. Its also not ok toavoid making improvements to prevent these negative behaviors from happeningagain.Do not dwell in the past, or the future of these situations, you leave a doorwide open for Gollum to come in and drag you into the forbidden pool.Frodo should have spoken the truth about Gollum immediately, and accepted theconsequences of that truth. When we act from falsehoods, regardless of thereason we will pay the price as Frodo did. It doesn’t always happen right away,but eventually we will pay.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

You may have friends that can share in your experiences, but it’s lonely1because only you can do the work of changing your inner life. In the movie agroup of adventurer’s go on a quest to reclaim their home. Just like the story,you will need a key, and map (your father), and you will only be able to findthe door by shining the light of your self on the key hole.Inside the Lonely Mountain is gold representing your birthright, generationalknowledge that has been hoarded by your father and kept from the world. Thedragon came to put and end to that, and now its your task to undo your fathersdamage by slaying the dragon, and sharing you gold with all people unselfishly.A inner character with the right heart condition is the only one that can slaythe dragon. In this case your bowman is that character. He has a family to takecare of, and he is selflessly trying to make a better world for everyone.Manifesting the spirit of sharing is the only way to create long lastingconditions of peace and prosperity for all. And until we do, the world willremain held in darkness. Servants of evil will continue to use selfishness toinfluence every person on this planet. Whenever we choose to hoard that whichshould be shared freely, we are in the grasp of this evil. If you want to seethe world in a better place, do your best to let the quality of hoarding go.In the movie, the character Gandalf hinted at what needs letting go of. When hewas talking to Bilbo at Bagend in the beginning of the story. Gandalf askedBilbo, “When did things become so important to you?”. And then the big one, “Theworld is not in your books and maps, Bilbo Baggins, it’s out there.”We cannot solve the problems of this world by solely reading books about theworld and looking at maps of the terrain (taking in, or convey information aboutthe happenings of the world). These are only representations of the real thing.When we unconsciously accept representations, in exchange for the real thing, wecan become deceived by our own mental illusions. When Bilbo said he was aBaggins from Bagend, Gandalf had to remind him he was also a Took. I assume thathis Baggins side of the family were intellectuals and the Took side of hisfamily where doers. Bilbo was choosing to focus on only part of the truth. Wetend to focus on part of the truth to convince ourselves that taking risks isn’tworth it. Searching for our true nature (Homeland) can be really difficult todo, but we can't really progress in life until we leave our comfort zone, andexperience wider possibilities that exist only in stepping out our door.My family migrated from Italy to America, in the eighteen hundreds. Theymigrated to America due to the corruption of the Italian government. When myfamily settled in America they chose to give up the Italian language entirely.This decision came about because they were concerned about social pressure. Whenwe give up our heritage, we give up our inherent value. This causes theindividual to look externally to find something replaces that loss.And now our generation (1970-2018) are paying the price of that choice. Thesocial pressure to be something that we are not is at a all time high. Ourinfinite value is in our decision to operate autonomously. When we give up thatautonomy, in exchange for being apart of a corrupt society, then fear of beingdifferent spreads, and effects us all.Bilbo left his belongings behind, and helped others reclaim their homeland. Inthe process he found something true about himself.To reclaim our homeland, we step outside our door, leave our belongings behind,shine the light on the keyhole, open the door, slay the dragon, and most of allshare.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Since I have never experience a long trek before, I wantedto see what it’s like. One day I decided to walk to a near-by town to visit anational park. The walk was about ten miles, I left my little city of Sebastopolbehind, taking the backroads, and trails to avoid main road traffic. I walkedthough some country that was sparsely populated. Since I am used to driving fromtown to town, I hardly experience the world turning. In my zone of reality,events go by so fast that I barely notice them. As I walked on these backcountryroads, I felt this sense of peace that I was apart of something bigger. The sunwas shining, and the heat was warming my skin. The birds in the trees weretalking to each other. The horses, and cows were looking at me while eatingtheir meals. I think they were wondering what I was doing walking alone on aroad less traveled. It was amazing. It was also the first time I used thetechnology of my mobile phone to help me reach my destination. The Google mapsdirections feature has a “walking” setting that calculates the length of time ajourney might take on foot. Unfortunately It doesn’t recognize which roads aredangerous to walk on, and the time it actually took to make it to my destinationwas short by an hour. That was ok, just the realization I was on the right trackwas enough for me. I think next time I would look at a map and chose saferroads.When I got to the park I was exhausted. I laid down on a bench, and took a nap.During this half-wake, half-sleep rest, I had this vision in my mind of a monkeytrapped in a prison cell in my head. It was rattling the cell door to get out. Icame to the realization that unhealthy striving after objects, or feelings arelike the monkey in a cage. It’s almost if I am carrying around another personinside my head, or its like sharing a body with two minds. I know a part of meis indestructible. This part is aware of my “other” nature. Along-side the“other” self, there is this monkey rattling it’s cage, in an attempt to get outof its prison. There have been times in my life when I allowed this creature outof its cage. In these moments I am usually not conscious of my mental, andemotional state, my mind becomes flooded with harmful thoughts to myself orothers. My body then responds with unhealthy emotions, and then I act in a waythat creates discord in my surroundings. But looking back at at thisself-created discord, there is a part of me that wants to return to balance. AndI struggle with effort to return to a place of peace. But since I alreadyresponded to the emotion based on the thought, the damage is done. Eventually itreturns to it’s cage and waits for the next opportunity to be let out.By repetitively harboring unhealthy thoughts, unhealthy character traits getcreated in the mind. These character traits eventually end up in thesubconscious, to be projected out into the world when a familiar event occurs.These dark characters hide in the shadows of their prison cell. They becomestronger, and stronger during each escape. Eventually these character becomeunnoticeable. Undoing the shadow nature of these characters requires awareness,effort, and focus. When a event happens that triggers any of these characters,there is more time to make a choice. Sometimes it can be very difficult to choseto turn away. The key in breaking the cycle of abuse, is having compassion foroneself. Having a goal to improve awareness minimizes the amount of controlthese characters have.Some desires are healthy, like wanting to create a better world. Others likeblaming the world for my insecurities, are not.Identifying patterns of behavior, what situations causes them to react becomesthe first step in changing them for good. The next step is bring them out of thedarkness and into the light. These characters don’t become apparent until someintrospection happens. Some character traits are created during childhood andmight require help from an outside skilled facilitator."},{"pageContent":"PARTICIPATIONLife will not serve you unless you’re an active participant in it.Scott Larson12/25/2018Bringing positive change in one’s life requires active participation. This seemsobvious, but how many times have we sat by at let “wrong” events happen toourselves, and others, that we never wanted to happen? At some point there needsto be a reckoning for a action, or in-action, and a submission to theconsequences.Situations can change from bad to worse, or from bad to good depending on thelessons the Universe wants us to learn. Responding in a consistent mannerdetermines the outcome of any situation.Cultivating active participation can be different for everyone but the basicsare: 1. Engagement 2. Care 3. AwarenessENGAGEMENTImagine you are a parent. You are at the park with your child. The child walksup to you, and attempts you grab your attention. But you just don’t have thetime to listen. You’re preoccupied with an ailment that weighs on your mind. Thechild is pulling on your shirt sleeve, but you don’t have the ability torespond. This situation happens again, and again. The child starts to wonder ifsomething is wrong with himself or herself, and that child takes that idea withhim into adulthood as a character trait. The child acts out this trait that“Something is wrong with me”.Doing your best to engage with the people around you creates the healthyconditions you want in your life. You are the Captain of your ship, the way yousteer it determines where you end up in life.Let’s say you stay home and entertain yourself as a way to escape from life byplaying computer games, or watching TV. Someone invites you to a party ofinterest that might test you, but you declined because you’re afraid of what mayhappen…Testing the spirit and the soul though engagement creates a feeling of purpose.I have found that the more life is avoided the more suffering ensues.CARECare is a subtle quality. When applied to the self, great things can happen.Apply a specific quality of attention to thoughts and actions. This qualityinvolves slowing down the thoughts in the mind, and paying careful attention toeach thought to make sure that it fits into your life purpose, and if it doesn’tthrow it out to make room for thoughts that do align with your life purpose. Ifyou don’t know what your life purpose is, you can discover it through theseprinciples.Then you can respond to a situation with kindness, the state right beforebecoming aware. It sets the tone of awareness, and sharpens the quality ofawareness one can bring to any situation. Then the quality of event becomeseffected by your quality of awareness.AWARENESSYears ago, I wanted to write and direct my own screenplay. Even though I thoughtthat adapting a story I wished I could write was participating in life, Itwasn’t really my story. I felt like I was doing something good with my life bytrying to adapt another author’s story, but what I was really doing was tryingto live a “story maker’s” life. I did this by rewriting a preexisting story tofit another medium. I didn’t understand the difference between “right” and“wrong” actions. I though that whatever made me happy was “right” and whatevermade me feel miserable was “wrong”. I found that the real truth is the qualityof doing. Feeling “good”, or “bad” is the direct result of an action taken.I didn’t really work to create experiences (in my life) that would allow me towrite from the heart. Every time I tried it to adapt a story that I did like, Iwasn’t able to connect with the material, it just resulted in suffering.Finally after reading a passage from one of James Allen’s books, it clicked. Hesaid something along the lines of, “You can’t write a story until you live it.”That was the first time in my life when I realized that I was trying to create alife without living it. I wanted to live some other author’s life because Iwasn’t really living my own. I created these stories in my mind that I wasbecoming a author. It was a attempt to feel like I was living a genuine life.Most of these flawed decisions centered around the idea that, “I could make itbetter”.Real participation has to happen on some level in ones life. Living thoughperceived success, or failures of others is a spectators sport. Watching a goodplay or film has its place, but be careful of replacing entertainment with adesire to live a life worth living.Start small. If you work long hours visit the library for an hour, after, orbefore work. Let material you experience inspire you to take an active role indiscovering something true about yourself. Let that take you wherever itcreatively leads in that short span of time. Eventually, what you learn fromthat experience, may blossom into something else, and you might find that theUniverse changes to support where you want to go."},{"pageContent":"TRUE POWERYou have the power to love, or the power to survive, which will you choose?Scott Larson12/25/2018Wielding power is often misunderstood, or misused.The perception of how power is used operates in two camps: * Wielding power in the pursuit of love: Being loved and showing love. * Wielding power in the pursuit of survival “at-all-costs”: Lacking love, and a lack of showing love.Power on the side of love is often misunderstood as an a abuse, no matter whatthe circumstance is. Many people give away personal power (Individual value) tobe accepted by society, and to shield themselves from being perceived as amalcontent.POWER ON THE SIDE OF LOVEWielding power in the pursuit love may involve: * Holding a high position, or status, in society. * Using a position, or status, to do “right” when everyone else is doing “wrong”. * Having discipline to not misuse your position, or status, to gain a self-advantage over your fellow men, and women.To fit into society, we have learned to destroy our individual value. We becomeafraid of losing our position in life, and to get by, we lower our status asfree individuals . We avoid confrontations with people that are propped up asbosses, and authority figures out of fear of being cast out of society. Wedevalue ourselves every time we take in, and/or act on a belief that we know isnot true, and then we tend to resent ourselves for not living up to our ideals.We naturally extend that resentment to any person that wields personal power. Inworking to fit into society, in this unhealthy way, we become used to feelingsmall. We want others to feel the same way, so we project our inadequacies onothers to counteract this internal imbalance. These cluster of behaviors, thatare closely associated with devaluing the self, creates disharmony in the world,and is the number one cause of loneliness.POWER ON THE SIDE OF “SURVIVAL-AT-ALL-COSTS”Power that is misused usually comes from the ideology of survival “at-all-costs”mentality, where lack of love exists. Power is misused by many people who fitinto this category. The reasoning is that in order to maintain the classstructure, and position in a particular society, the people have to be led tobelieve that they need a group that represents a collective Mom or Dad. Thegreatest amount of damage is done by people who understand this dynamic andapply it to taking advantage of others. This dynamic is understood well enoughto know that most of society will willingly destroy their own individual valueto fit into society. To feel safe, and secure, society works to destroy theirown power, and works to make sure others do the same. When a whole generation ofpeople become slaves to feeling inadequate, society becomes controlled by thispower differential. A group of shadow brokers who work for a class of peoplethat align themselves with the survival “at-all-costs” ideology, use this“fit-into-society” dynamic to get what they want out of power-givers (us) bymaking people feel like they don’t fit into society. They do this by controllingthe culture of a society. These people work to create unhealthy social dynamicsin the fields of art, science and news. There is a collaboration withgovernments to create laws and to disseminate fearful interpretation of theselaws to create panic, and disharmony in the minds of the public. Since it’s noteasy to maintain social order though force in a civilized society, the ultimategoal is to create the a unconscious feeling of subjugation. This causes thepublic to inadvertently trade their inherent worth for worldly positions, orpossessions. When conditions of fear, or lack, are repeated in the news, thesequalities become second nature in the mind, without any resistance. This dynamiccan go on for generations, until someone, or a group challenges it, and by thatpoint there are public relation specialists that know how handle thesesituations. After the conflict has been created, they side-step the conflict,and move on to the next newly created “fear”, or “lack”, perception. Whilepeople are bickering over the previous dialectic, a new one is able to take theplace of the previous one, without any resistance. This continues indefinitelydue to our currently level of awakening. We are currently coming out of thislower level of awareness as we precess to the age of Aquarius.When personal identity (who you think you are) is obtained from society, itsvery hard to stand up to dynamics that take away individual worth. Mentalidentity constructs are run by the unconscious mind, making it very difficult tosee when it's happening. Most of us don’t even know that there is a problemuntil you start to unravel negatively charged emotional reactions that createthe felling of inadequacy. The first thing that can be worked on is to loosenthe hold society has on the identity of the self.True power lies in stepping out of the “power-giver” / “survival-at-all-costs”dynamic, seeing both as they really are, and not how you want, or wish them tobe. This usually means giving up positions of victimization or subversion. Oncea decision is made to do that, being controlled by this power differential isseverely minimized.Be aware that knowing how this power differential works obligates you to act onthe knowledge. It also obligates you to resist victimizing oneself and others.Giving power to victimizers, by lowering the self to the level of reaction, hasto be given up as well. This obligation will present itself in what you choose,and choose not to do as a result of this awareness. If you avoid acting on whatyou know waves of suffering will come into your life. Attempting to hide in oneof the two roles, I described, out of familiarity won’t last. Eventuallyknowledge of this dynamic will cause cause you to step outside of it.When one takes responsibility for both poles of victimization, one can come intotrue, and healthy use of power. The negative perceptions of wielding healthypower over the self can no longer have a strong effect on the psyche.FOR THE POWER HUNGRYThis section is for criminals: Thieves, Murderers, and Adulterers. > \"May this be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.\"> (S2) Galadriel “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”Power over others takes one down a path that seems on the surface beneficial,until one comes into contact with disharmony that manifest itself as a result ofthe damage one creates on the soul. This damage may not be noticeable rightaway, as the effects can be avoided for a time, especially when you are feedingoff of the feeling of illusory invulnerability.The damage that one creates in the world, to maintain this kind of life style,will slowly start to interfere with one’s ability to maintain this powerdifferential. One will start to notice dark feelings, and unfriendly situations,that seem to come out of “knowhere”1. There might be a desire to attribute thesedark circumstances to a streak of bad luck, but the Universe works in Causation.Since Cosmic Law operates outside of time, any effect can manifest itself longafter a causal action was committed. And the effect of these actions can becumulative. At the end of ones life, effects can start stacking up from previouscauses preventing a person from experiencing peace of mind.Start now: Every day sit down, and evaluate the harm one has created, and iscreating. Make a pact to make small changes at first. Work to avoid harmfulacquaintances, and events that requires contact with harmful acquaintances, by acreating secret alternative engagement that precludes one’s involvement. Then inthat alternative engagement do the complete opposite of what one would have donein the harmful engagement. If the event involved thievery, go out and give acomplete stranger something that one attributes personal value to. Start small.The important point here is to be creative. Otherwise it will not feel like agenuine counter-engagement, and one will lose interest quickly. Maybe one is inline for coffee, quietly (so that no one can hear) whisper to the barista thatyou are going to pay for a drink, for a person that one judges is the mostlikely candidate for theft. Then leave the store as quickly as you can. Thepoint is to not be around for any contact, or acknowledgment of the act. Thenafter awhile check one’s surroundings, watch for other positive signs in theenvironment that one is on the right track.If one has been taking counter-actions like this, and nothing gets better, keepgoing, there might be lot of karma built up, or one might have chosen to pay forsomeone else’s karma, from a pact one made with oneself in the past. Don’t stayin the past, and don’t stay in feelings of resentment for any reason. Just paythe debt, and move on, expect ones life situation to get worse, before it getsbetter.If one murdered a person out of a need to feel powerful, and one feels a senseof “No escape”, think again. Paul from the Bible was a murderer of the innocent.Eventually even he came to his senses. Paul became so powerful in the regard ofdoing “right” that he could not be swayed to do “wrong” for any reason. He knewwhat a life of “power-over-others” was like, and chose never go back to it. Whenhis life came to and end, he had a positive impact on the world and inspiredothers never to give in to retaliation, and hate.One can come back from anything, believe it. When I was in my teens, I was in anout of prison for thievery. I came back. Now I am a servant of truth, and happyto be a servant of something that is worth while. We are all servants tosomething, even when we don’t know it. Be a servant to truth, and no matter howhard life gets, acting from truth is a refuge that can protect one in times ofgreat stress, and disharmony. It’s not an easy path, and people that takeadvantage of others will fight \"tooth and nail\" to curve you back into line, butstand your ground. Eventually, victory will come, and that victory changeseverything.Doing the “right” thing becomes easier, but not until one completes the “Trialby Fire”. Then after proving oneself, time, and time again, the path of lightwill open up, if one is open to letting it. It will make a person into somethingawesome, for the good of all.When you die, you will never be on this planet again, go out for a good reason.Don’t die with negative effects weighing on your life, you will bring them intothe other world, where you will either have to work them out, or be a servant tothem again. All will be revealed, the Universe has a long memory, and you cannotescape your karma. Better to deal with it as soon as you can, then the taskdoesn’t become too heavy to carry out, making it that much harder to bear.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Another misspelled word to draw attention to the connection between knowing and nothing.↩"},{"pageContent":"RESPONSIBILITYScott Larson12/25/2018> Life becomes a spectator sport when decisions are made on our behalf. - Scott> LarsonIt’s how we respond (or lack of) that determines the quality of our lives.Personal responsibility happens when we start taking notice of the effects wehave in the world. Like a Sonar, we can sound out wounds inside the heart byremaining still, and waiting for something to come to the surface. When it does,we can chose to face it, or avoid it. Responsibility starts in the body,becoming aware of what is causing a stir in the body, before it gets expressedas harm on the world.Taking refuge in sound principles helps us to better understanding ourselves,and our actions. Just like understanding the principle of gravity prevents usfrom falling from a 5 story building. Aligning our behavior to sound principlesis the best way to sound out the causes of turmoil. Turmoil is a effect of amisalignment with the principles of the Universe. Everything has a cause andeffect, everything operates with vibration, polarity, gender, rhythm, andcorrespondence.As we live though events of our time, we see bad actions inside many harmfulcauses in our world. But who sees the accumulation of harm in our own choices?In my age it, has been reported in studies1 that the weed killer Roundup ishaving a negative effect on humans, if not all life. The chemical is used todestroy any plant life that isn’t genetically modified to resist it. In orderfor this to work, crops need to be genetically altered with the correct sequenceof the chemical to provide that strain of particular plant with the properresistances needed for the plant to avoid destruction.What lead up to it’s use? Was it a need to produce food faster, to keep up withdemand? Or was it a blatant attempt to kill people? Many people that callthemselves Civil advocates don’t care about the reasons why the chemical cameinto existence. They just want it stopped. But I wonder, by not looking at thetrue cause for it’s creation, are we doomed to allow some other effect to takeits place?I’m not defending evil. I think evil doing should be stopped. But I also careabout the causes, and our individual involvement in those causes. There are manychopping at the branches, and few chopping at the root. This is like makingsocial drug use illegal without understanding why people take drugs in the firstplace. If you don’t get to the root of the problem the only people that benefitfrom laws that prevent its use are the legal systems put in place to stop theabuse.We can’t keep relying on others to fix the problems of the world. Or blamingindustry for creating problems we caused to come into existence. To stop anabuse, understanding the cause of the abuse is what stops it. Taking properresponsibility for your personal involvement in it. Avoiding blaming systems,and people that bring evil into existence if you are doing nothing to stop it.When I was growing up, my mother and father worked long hours to bring what thefamily needed. My grandmother, and grandfather worked to save money to providefor our family’s future.The responsibly I have now, is to let the world know that the suffering that weare going though is caused by our inability to self-govern, and to stand up forwhat is “right”. After I returned home from the hospital, I realized that mydepressed emotional state had always been operating in the background, evenbefore my Cerebral Hemorrhage. This depressed state wasn’t getting any better byfocusing on some past harm that caused me to be the way I am. Nor did looking tosome future that was fleeting.After my Cerebral Hemorrhage, I realized I had nothing to lose, I decided to trysomething different no matter what the cost. I choose to stop allowing myself tobe harmed by the thoughts, and feelings of others. Most importantly, I workedhard to prevent harm, to others, by healing my impure thoughts. All my sufferingis caused by what I stand for.I have the same goals now, but different motives. Before my Cerebral Hemorrhage,I wanted to feel safe by being successful. But now I am starting to see that adesire for purity is me wanting success because I want to live by example. If Iwant the world to be better for the greater good, it has to start with me. Thatmeans sustained effort to make my world better.I discovered that these lower fleeting desires, are all transient things, thatcome, and go. When one lives a life based on desires that are fleeting, then onegets driven by whichever way the wind blows. Permanence is in the resolve ofliving a life of principles.Before my Cerebral Hemorrhage, I didn’t feel good about my life, and I didn’tcare too much about taking care of my surroundings. I rarely made my own bed,and I only cleaned my surroundings when the untidiness got in the way ofpursuing my unhealthy desires.It was only after I started working on refining my environment, without thinkingabout the plus or minus of the results, that I started to feeling better aboutmy life. The principle of performing a duty, of cleaning my environment, for thespecific reason of “it’s the right thing to do” without knowing exactly why, hasan effect like cleaning out your mind, or making it orderly. And it works onlywhen you do it solely because, “it’s the right thing to do”.When you take action for impure reasons, you really don’t have any refugee tofall back on when things get tough. If you are taking action because you getsome external reward, what happens when those rewards stop being delivered? Whatmotivation do you have then to make your world better? When the world stopsgiving you what you need, what do you have left to fall back on?When I was very little, I was physically tortured by the kids from myneighborhood. I sat on a bolder, while kid after kid lined up to hit me. Everyhit was like a signal to myself that I was not worthy of being alive. Every hitwas a pact I made with myself not to care, and to hate those who didn’t seethings my way.Since I allowed myself to suffer, and I was too afraid to do anything about it,I grew up taking on this sense that the world was wrong about almost everything,and I was mostly right.I was angry at the world for having a face of evil, even though on some level Iallowed that evil to happen by not speaking out. It would stare into me, wantingme to cause suffering, as I had felt it. I did feel a need to violently controlthe world around me, because my world was so out of control. This feeling ofbeing out of control in life, was due to a past agreement I made against my ownunlimited value.When we allow ourselves to be enslaved by fear, or inaction, the world takes ona quality of chaos in our heart and mind. Maybe it was a past hurt, by someonethat did something bad to you. And out of anger, and hatred, you made a pactwith your self never to allow it again. Or maybe you got tired of dealing withall the bad things in the world, and just shut down to let the world do whatever it wanted to you.I have found that the truth is very plain, when we act, or don’t act, from aplace of fear, anger, hatred, or indifference, it actually creates moresuffering in ourselves, and that suffering reflects out into the world. Whenenough people live though these attributes, it actually creates the conditionsfor the society we live in. Then external events reorder around us to give usexactly what we think we need, more harm, more control, and more ignorance. Weare allowing the world to bring us down by not rising above the turmoils oflife. This is the real reason why our world isn’t right. We just want someone toblame so we can continue committing “wrong” actions, and that makes us feelbetter when the world isn’t right.Truth, and love under all circumstances, is the only way to maintain balance ina world that has gone wrong.Give up talking about how bad the world is until you are satisfied with thedirection of your own life. Make adjustments to improve those parts of your ownlife and see if that doesn’t change the world around you.I want to travel, but I have people in my life who depend on me. Am I going todo what is “right” for myself, or am I going to do what’s right for them? I havefound that when I do what is right for others, I don’t have to think aboutmyself, and my needs, they seem to get handled by themselves. And in doing that,I create the conditions (much more slowly of course) for solving my own issuesand healing the world.Chose to take “respond-ability” for your own inner space, and watch that innerspace grow into outward space. We are all “respond-able” for everything that ishappening in this world by our choices to do, or not to do.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Iwonder if that avoidance is a tendency to want to distance ourselves fromself-judgment.No matter what is said on the topic, in Cosmic Law, “Right”, and “Wrong” actionsexist, and have consequences for the individual.The term “Right” comes from the concept of individual rights. When we are born,we acquire certain immutable, and inalienable rights, that are inherent as aresult of existence. Governments do not give us our “Rights”, contrary topopular belief. Governments only exist by our creative effort, and Governmentsonly exist to secure and protect our rights. In this age, we have allowedGovernments, to play “mommy” and “daddy” in exchange for giving up our some ofour rights, but that doesn’t actually take away our inherent rights. Only aperception has been created that Governments have all the power, and we havenone. Once individuals stop believing this, and start to self-govern themselves,Governments will cease to exist.A “Right” exists until an individual uses a “Right” to commit a “Wrong”. Thenthat “Right” becomes a “Wrong”, and its no longer a “Right”.THE RIGHT TO LIFEThe right to life deals with existence. Since we were born in this world, weexist, and it follows that we have a right to exist.THE RIGHT TO FREEDOMSince we exist, we have a right to live free from restrictions on our life.THE RIGHT TO PROPERTYThe right to property deals with limited, and exclusive use of a thing that hasbeen claimed. A thing becomes claimed once we exclusively use that thing on aregular basis.Holding property, but not using it is an abuse of property. In our currentsociety, individuals, and groups are legally allowed to claim, and holdproperty, even if it’s not in use. There are systems in power to maintain thisabuse, but just because someone is abusing a position of holding property doesnot make a “Wrong” a “Right”. The system has just decided to make that “Wrong” a“Right”. Exclusively owning land (which is not a thing) is also an abuse, landbelongs to all people. What gets built on top of land can be owned.A “Wrong” is the opposite of a “Right”. That means you don’t have a “Right” tocommit a “Wrong”. Hence why it’s called wrong.Right and wrong exists, and in our actions, Cosmic Law principles have a effecton our life. When you take an action that harms yourself or another being, thatharm is consider a “Wrong” in Cosmic Law principles. Belief about whether anaction is “Right”, or “Wrong” has no effect on these principles.The tendency to shy away from these terms seems to be related to self-judgment.No individual wants to be seen in this light. This is why we divest theindividual from the action. Individuals can only create a “Right”, or a “Wrong”action. Individuals that create “Wrong” actions can be seen in a negative light,and individuals that create “Right” actions can be seen in a positively light.Nothing can take that away from us (unless we allow it). It’s important toremember that when we allow concepts, and speech to change our way of thinkingthat creates a need to divest ourselves from our actions, we divest ourselvesfrom responsibility. Many individuals want to divest themselves fromresponsibility of their actions, so they can do whatever they want withoutconsequences. This is why there is a strong effort to divest humanity from amoral life. When you commit wrongs, you should expect to feel consequences forthat, and if that means that you are seen in a negative light, then so be it.Above all, individuals are not inherently “Right” or “Wrong”. We can change atany time. Individuals are fluid, and dynamic. This is why we cannot be pinneddown (unless we allow it) by any man-made law that takes away an individual'sinherent “Rights”, or any derivatives of those rights. But when talking aboutactions, its important to be clear about what an action really is. Don’ try andwater down the result of an action with politically correct speech, to try anddistance yourself from the effects that harm or good has created. Own the harm,and move on. Don’t make the harm a self-judgment about the totally of who youreally are. Work to make your “Wrong” actions “Right”."},{"pageContent":"THE FUTURE"},{"pageContent":"WHAT COMES NEXT?The rise of “Truth”, the fall of “False”Scott Larson12/25/2018We have come from an age where special interests have dominated many cultures.We have looked to others as guides to our awakening process. We have insertedourselves into hierarchies of power, and allowed those processes to set thecourse of our future.This model is dying. In the future, the practice of belief will change to thepractice of direct knowledge, or “knowing”, that comes intuitively from within.External study of a subject will be a companion to awaken knowledge that isalready within all of us.People will act from this internal knowledge, and the world will change to oneof great beauty, and peace. It will be a golden age of light, where suffering bythe hands of others will cease.We will see many organizations, and governments, that operate in a vertical, andcentralized fashion, that were used to control, and take power from individualsdie. Similar to co-operatives, horizontal, and decentralized networks of peopleworking together, as equals will take it’s place. Technology will be a tool tomake this happen. Social networks of the future will be run by decentralizedgroups of individuals, instead of centralized corporations. These socialnetworks will put the power to express ourselves into our hands, where itbelongs. People that want to maintain a selfish lifestyle, and profit off ofanother’s labor, will be isolated from society by their own actions, where theywill die off and become extinct; Or change, and become willing participants tothis new age.No longer, will humanity solely pursue self-gratifying endeavors. Insteadindividuals will come together as decentralized groups, and work toward thegreater good. This will happen in a cascade effect, over many generations, asmore and more individuals live by Cosmic Law principals.This reality will eventually become realized, but if you want to help it alonghere are some steps to make it happen: 1. Have a daily practice, and stick to it no matter what the cost. Apathy is a sneaky enemy to your wellbeing. If you become lost, get back into routines that clean, or organize your environment. You environment is a map, or reflection, of what is happening in your brain. Keep it clean, and organized. The more pristine your environment is, the more your mental and emotional life will prosper. 2. Find your life calling, or contribution, where you can use your talents to contribute to making the world a better place to live, for all. Stick to it, and don’t allow other people, or situations, to drag you out of your life purpose. If you don’t know what your life purpose is, spend some time by yourself every day exploring environments, or information that is alien to you. Eventually your life purpose will come to you. 3. Don’t be a victim - Don’t spend any energy on systems of power that are crumbling (partisan politics, and xenophobia) You have the power to change your life. Don’t give that power away to anyone. Blame, and resentment are indicators that you have given away your power to something outside yourself. You are responsible for the conditions of your life. Don’t enter into any agreements that make you small, or take away your power. You are 100% responsible for making your life work, and you are also responsible for the harm you cause in the world. Stop causing harm to yourself and others by refusing to live by good natured principles.We are creating a balanced life by rediscovering what we really want out oflife. We will use our “will-power” for self-change. I want to work towardsundoing all the damage I created for myself, and others. I plan on exploring theworld with my wife, meeting others that are different than us, and learning howother cultures transform grief, and suffering, into wellbeing, and hope. I willwrite about these experiences. When we work to express ourselves, healinghappens on some level. I would like my books to be a way for me to communicatewith my people (Mankind). I would like to share how my learning experiencesimpacted me, and I look forward to reading the experiences of others on theself-governing path. I learn the most from listening to contrasting experiencesfrom other people, and cultures.I see hope in the world today. I see a good number of people finding answers.Many people, that do the work of “Knowing Thyself” want to see humanity improve.People all over the world are creating endeavors that attempt to transcend thelimitations we have imposed on ourselves, by what we stand for, and create.I have seen a greater plan at work in the workings of the world. As I go aboutmy day, I feel this connectedness to all life, and the more I work to improve mysurroundings, the more I feel apart of this plan. I see this plan unfolding as Iwrite. There is a split happening between two worlds. On the one hand, there arepeople in this world that have created this dependence on the labor, andcreativity of others to survive, while contributing nothing to the greater good.And now they are falling into an abyss. People are discovering who they are,what they want to be, and refusing to remain dependent on others. And on theother hand, true individuals are endeavoring for the “greater good”. They arerising above war, and strife. The first group I call “The False”. Who continuetheir attempts at creating chaos, with the goal of wanting to reel individualsinto a false sense of fear, and suffering. This created perception, of fear, andsuffering, is used to dominate the world, when we allow it. You might have seenthis world of fear on the news, with the “It’s them, not us” program. Whenever areason is put forth to go to war with another country, you can bet on thisdomination program being in play. Current centralized communication networkslike national news, disguised independent news, social media platforms likeFacebook, and Twitter, are being abused to get individuals to comply withulterior agendas.War and strife gets us nowhere, It is not natural for humans to murder, andcause harm to each other. Conflict is a learned behavior that has seengenerations of ab-use and propagation.As more and more true individuals refuse to support systems of false power, andauthority, like most of our established institutions are, they will slowlycollapse, and fade out of existence. As these institutions collapse, our lifewill get worse for a time, as all poor founded creations do when they fail, thisis the time that clearing needs to happen. Clearing out the old for the new isdirty business. Like a house that hasn’t been maintained in a long time, it hasto be cleaned from the inside out. Then the light will shine in, withoutobstruction from the darkness. The time has come in this great precession forthe darkness to end.Tune the quality of one’s life by making informed choices. Humans operate like atuning fork. In fact, everything in the universe vibrates at a different level.The level you vibrate at, determines the quality of your life, brought on byyour decisions. As a chorus, we rise or fall in octaves, and join with others onhigher, or lower levels of vibration. The world is a manifestation of ourvibratory quality. When we help the majority of individuals rise together inoctaves, then the conditions everyone has been longing for will fall into place,without any need to fight for a better world. This doesn’t mean that the worldwill change by itself, we all need work toward being honest, compassionate,caring, and active in the goal of creating a better world for all. Don’t bedeceived by programs that promote passiveness as the way to bring change. Changestarts with a clear mind, but it doesn’t end there.The future looks bright, but the journey is long. The universe deals in eons,and humans deal in years. It may take many generations to create a future basedon “greater good” principles. Lets start now, for future generations."},{"pageContent":"CREDITSScott Larson12/25/2018Who I wish to thank: * “What on Earth is Happening” Podcast - Mark Pasio * “The End of all Evil” - Jeremy Locke * All the players in the “Critical Shower Thoughts” Subreddit. * Everyone involved in the “Constructive Living” practice. * James Allen for putting his work in the public domain, if more authors did that it would change the world.
