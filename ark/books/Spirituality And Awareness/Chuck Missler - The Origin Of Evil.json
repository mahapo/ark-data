Yet the sun contains only 1.9% of the angular momentum. The nine planets contain 98.1%. (This was known in the time of Laplace a century ago.) There is no plausible explanation that would support a solar origin of the planets. James Jeans (1877-1946) pointed out that the outer planets are far larger than the inner ones. Jupiter is 5,750 times as massive as Mercury, 2,958 times as massive as Mars, etc. This is also a dif - ficulty with current theories. Other Enigmas There are three pairs of rapid-spin rates among our planets, each within 3% of each other: Earth and Mars; Jupiter and Saturn; and, Neptune and Uranus. Why? Earth and Mars also have virtually identical spin axis tilts (about 23.5°). Why? From angular momentum and orbital calculations, it would seem that these three pairs of planets may have been brought here from else - where . Why does Mars have 93% of its craters in one hemispher e and only 7% in the other? It would appear that over 80% of these craters occurred within a single half-hour! Alternative Cosmological Views Uniformitarians cling to the presumption that things have remained essentially unchanged over billions of years. Catastrophists believe that the universe has been sub - jected to a series of catastrophic events (fiat creation - ists are included in this view). View any surface in the solar system and you will find craters and disruptive evidences. Under a constant rain of interplanetary debris, the Earth accumulates about 100 tons of extra - terrestrial material per day. The Origin of Evil Part 1 The Temptations of Christ • Making stone into bread (Lk 4:3,4 ; Mt 4:3,4). • The kingdoms of the world (Lk 4:5-8; Mt 4:8-10). • The Temple pinnacle (Lev 4:9-12; Mt 4:5-7). An Offer by the Owner The Lord rejected Satan’s offer, but not because He didn’t recognize his ownership—Christ knew that Satan did have these kingdoms. Ultimately Christ will rule over the kingdoms of the world—but not as a vice-regent of Satan! Today, however, the Devil is still the prince of the power of the air. He is the one who is in back of the kingdoms of our world, whether we recognize it or not. A Few of Satan’s Titles • The Prince of This World (Jn 12:31). • The Prince of the Power of the Air (Eph 2:2). • Head of the World—Ruler of Darkness (Eph 6:12). • The God of This Age (2 Cor 4:4). Origins? We know that the angels were created before the earth was (Job 38:1-15). We first find Satan in the Garden already fallen (Gen 3). Questions: When did he fall ? How did he gain his position of power ? The Nebular Hypothesis: A Modern Myth Some four billion years ago, the sun had ejected a tail, or a filament, of material that cooled and collected and thus formed the planets...

When did Satan fall? Is there a “gap” (interval) between Gen 1:1 and Gen 1:2? In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Genesis 1:1 This is certainly straightforward (and if you fully grasp that verse you will have no problem with any other verse in the Bible!). It is the next verse that raises some basic issues: And the earth was without form, and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Genesis 1:2 The words “without form and void,” Whbow” Whto tohu v’bohu , will become critical elements of our vocabulary. Whto tohu means without form, confused; Whb bohu means void, empty. (The w vav between them is the conjunc - tion “and.”) When we examine a declaration of God in Isaiah we note an apparent contradiction: For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain , he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else. Isaiah 45:18 The same word for “vain,” WhTo tohu (without form, con - fused), appears in both verses, and would appear to contradict the declaration in Genesis 1:2. The phrase in Genesis 1:2 also appears in Jeremiah: I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. Jeremiah 4:23 Whenever you find an apparent contradiction in the Biblical text, we should rejoice! It may be what the rabbis call a remez: a hint of something deeper. It’s like a signpost saying, “Dig here! A treasure is hidden here.” So this compels us to more carefully examine the passage in Genesis 1:2. The verb “was” is actually a transitive verb (indicating action) and the word order (normally, conjunction-verb- subject-object) is reordered to suggest the transitive pluperfect form: “had become.” (It is so ordered in the International Standard Version.) It is the identical transitive verb which appears in Genesis 19:26, where Lot’s wife “became a pillar of salt.” Furthermore, we also find that the initial conjunction, “And,” is an adversative conjunction (“but”) and is so ren - dered in both the Septuagint and Vulgate translations. (It often suggests a significant time delay.) Putting this all together suggests the following rendering: But the earth had become without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. There appears to be an interval of some kind—perhaps eons—between verses 1 and 2. It would seem that the earth was not originally “without form and void,” but had been subjected to some kind of catastrophic judgment prior to the sequence that continues in Genesis 1. The “Gap Theory” was originally suggested by Thomas Chalmers in 1814. Compare: George H. Pember, Earth’s Earliest Ages , Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1907; Donald Gray Barnhouse, The Invisible War , Zondervan Publishing Co., MI, 1965; and Arthur C.

The Power Behind the Throne The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Page \u0018 Page \u0018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: Ezekiel 28:1,2 “I am a God”: Cf. Isaiah’s words of the King of Babylon (Isa 14:13, 14). For similar examples: the boast of Pharaoh Hophra (Ezek 29:3); the praise given to Herod Agrippa by the Tyrians (Acts 12:21); Paul’s description of “the man of sin” uses nearly the same words (2 Thess 2:4). “I sit in the seat of God”: Tyre was known as the Holy Island. The city was thought of as rising from its waters like the rock-throne of God. [Sanchon., edit. Orelli, p. 36.] “Though thou set thy heart .” The words remind us of the temptation in Genesis 3:5. The Prince of Tyre “Ruler” dygIn” nagid means ”the man at the top“ (1 Sam 9:16; 10:1; 13:14; 2 Sam 7:8 ). Ezekiel had prophesied against the whole city; he was now singling out the city’s leader for a special word from God . “King” = %l,M, melek. The language, though primarily here applied to the king of Tyre, as similar language is to the king of Babylon (Isa 14:13, 14), yet has an ulterior and fuller accomplishment in Satan and his embodiment in the Antichrist (Dan 7:25; 2 Thess 2:4; Rev 13:6). Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Ezekiel 28:13 Eden was on the earth...see also the description of the New Jerusalem in Rev 21:18-21. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Ezekiel 28:14 Cherubim are super angels (Isa 6; Ezek 1, 10; Rev 4 , 5). Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. Ezekiel 28:15 Christ was the one who created him. God used the Logos to create all things, including Satan. So, Satan, even with all his power, is still only a created being. Ezekiel described the king in terms that could not apply to a mere man. This “king” had appeared in the Garden of Eden (v.13); had been a guardian cherub (v.14a); had possessed free access to God’s holy mountain (v.14b); and had been sinless from the time he was created (v.15). By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Ezekiel 28:16 He was driven out of the place of sanctity (Ezek 28:14) that he had occupied (cf. Ps 89:39). Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. Ezekiel 28:17-19 Lamentation on The King of Babylon How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? Isaiah 14:12-17 When did this happen? (Cf. Jer 4:23-26). All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned. Isaiah 14:18-20 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

A Glimpse of the Dark Side (Daniel 10) Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days. Daniel 10:12-14 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.

Our Present Predicament America is in moral free fall. We are victims of spiri - tual warfare. Our government is now the purveyor of immorality. Why are we surprised? Governments have always loved crises: they provide the rationale for in - creasing budgets and bureaucracies, and subjugating the population. Most new dictators create external crises to consolidate their internal powers. In our country, they long ago learned that social crises serve as well as military ones. There is one insight that supplies a key missing link: immorality results in social crises. Is it any surprise to learn that governments have an enormous incentive to promote immorality?! The Armor of God For Spiritual Warfare Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Ephesians 6:10-13 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take t he helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Page \u0018\u0018 Page \u0018\u0018 to make known the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. Ephesians 6:14-19 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:2 Thou madest him [for] a little [while] lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands. Hebrews 2:7 Adam through sin forfeited his dominion. Did he ever have dominion over the angels? No. The last Adam, however, gained dominion over everything (Heb 2:7; Ps 8:5-9). Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him. Hebrews 2:8 Yet, some unfinished business remains (1,000 years worth?) Eventually, joint-heirs with Him? (Cf. Rev 21:7; Rom 8:17). But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. 1 Corinthians 15:20-28 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Romans 8:31-36 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
