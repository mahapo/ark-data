UNIVERSAL SCIENCE of DIVINE LIGHT There is an abundance of universal knowledge, truth, techniques and man- tras that can help attain a deeper connection to one’s self and the universal consciousness. The teacher who evolves from a universal light brotherhood or a guru parampara is able to guide the seeker along the spiritual path into the divine light consciousness. However, this can only be accomplished with pure love and a desire to help others become their own guru and master. In truth, guiding another seeker along the journey to their enlightenment helps to build a solid foundation for the universal community of light conscious- ness to expand brick by loving brick. This is especially important as we jour- ney through the changes of 2012 and into the “Golden Age”. It is with great humility and surrender that this book was created. It was in- spired through the writings, wisdom and words of many great authors, teachers, masters and incarnates, as well as through a divine light connec- tion to the Akashic. My intent is that those who read the contents of this book, see not my hand, but experience the wisdom of evolution and the beautiful universal truth shared by all. From the microcosm to the macro- cosm, there is only one light of collective divine love. Love and Blessings to All ... ... Children of the Light"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Introduction We have chosen a beautiful time in our evolution to take our birth. Rather than approach the aspects of 2012 with doom and gloom, this book was written to present a clear understanding of the multi - leveled reality that ex- isted historically and that will exist in the future. It sheds light on the 200,000 year history of evolution from the ape - man, to the human being, and into the spiritual being. Our journey becomes less daunting if we use common sense and the Akashic to allow a flow of information that weaves together a histori- cal puzzle. By integrating the past with 2012 and beyond, we may understand and pre- pare for the significant transformation about to take place. Evolution is inevi- table and by putting the facts into perspective, we can prepare ourselves to meet the upcoming events that may affect us both on a physical and spiri- tual level. The bottom line is empowerment, because as we attain true un- derstanding, we empower the choices that allow us to be free of the illusions that prevent lucid thoughts and clarity on the level to which they resonate. The truth is what it is, however, personal empowerment comes from being our own guru and taking responsibility for our spiritual and physical plan- ning. When researching other views please remember the misinformation and fraudulent cover - ups created by the powers of church, state and global illuminati that have distorted the facts and truth about JFK, 911, Swine Flu, WTO, GMOs, Electric Cars, holistic Cancer cures — and the list goes on. Truth, transformation and knowledge of how everything integrates into the reality of time - space and light consciousness can only be attained through trusting one’s inner being and connecting to the place of peace and spiritual love that guides us. Be wise and search for this truth, as truth will not search for you. Personally and spiritually as I have grown in life, I have tried to find truth in places where truth does not exist, but through love all becomes clear."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 What is Love What is love, but the pure essence of the soul expanding into another form, as it allows two to become one and one to become formless with all that is, and all that will ever be. Love is beyond this life, and yet it is all that we really are. Love knows no boundaries, no limits to its making or its sharing. It softly crosses the valleys, the oceans, up the mountains moving beyond the most distant stars. It is as gentle as the most beautiful dream, but is beyond thought. It has no form and no desire other than to be collective with all that can accept its magnifi- cent radiance. Unconditionally it is and will always be, it is formless and mindless and fills the human heart with all it can handle, overflowing its lim- ited capacity of self, ego and conditionings. Love has no boundary on its pure compassion, nor does it understand self or can it be captured and horded. It is free flowing as the summer winds that blow though the mountain trees or like the forest streams that nourish all those that come to share it’s refreshing essence. Love is and will always be and never was there a time it did not exist, nor a time it will not be. The formless, mindless, thoughtless, all compassionate unconditional love is all there is, and all that will ever be. Love is the spirit, the loyal friend that guides us through the emotional rains of life, with no desires or conditions. Love is all that we are and all we can ever be, there is no more and no less, everything else is just the illusion. Love is all I have and all that I am ... Brad C.

beautiful and immaculate giver and sustainer of life. As our true mother, she is both the macrocosm and our microcosm. She shares our Kundalini energy, Chakras, and is our civilization’s beacon to the uni- verse, and reflects our human discretion as the mother of our earthly family. There was a time when humankind was in resonance with this living, breath- ing integral part of our universal body. This dharma is to understand that we are part of her, just as she is part of us. We must live within sustainable boundaries that respect the balance and the laws of this living universe and stand up to those who deceive us by disrespecting and plundering our pre- cious home. Disrespecting Mother Earth is akin to denigrating the laws of “cause and ef- fect” and the fundamental nature of “karma”, which holds that for every ac- tion there is an equal and opposite reaction. If we collectively approach 2012 with sensitivity and responsible global actions, this along with collectiv- ity of the spirit may help avert the devastation predicted, while allowing the transformation to the higher light consciousness. Mother Earth"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Essene Brotherhood Loving and respecting Mother Earth was a main part of the wisdom and cul- ture of ancient times. As our current civilization became more “modernized”, leaving our roots of the family farm, this connection, wisdom and natural un- derstanding was lost. Many great spiritual masters, subcultures and indige- nous peoples still carry on traditions that understand the power and gifts that Mother Earth supplies to us freely. There is a beautiful integration of all things from the microcosm of our body to the macrocosm of the universe, and Mother Earth is part of this intricate web woven gently through the cos- mos. The archaeological discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1946 revealed that two thousand years ago a commune brotherhood of spiritual people known as the Essenes lived together in a sacred community. They understood and executed basic alchemic earth and metaphysical connection principals and lived life according to the basic laws that govern the divine connection be- tween humankind, Mother Earth and the universe. Many great souls including Jesus, Joseph and Mary, John the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and others who changed the direction of our history and spiritual world have been associated with this community. Their spiritual life and knowledge of the metaphysical mysteries were unknown to the main- stream society of the times, resulting in controversy. Consequently, fearing persecution the Essenes withdrew and lived collectively far outside the cit- ies. Some of the great souls of the brotherhood would leave to expand their wisdom and spiritual base, understanding their universal connection to the great teachings. The Essenes were masters of the ancient arts, spiritual understanding and metaphysical sciences. They possessed advanced knowledge of the stars and light consciousness and worked collectively to advance their spiritual Essene Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 understanding and connection. They also felt they were decedents of a great ancient civilization that had perished ages before. The brotherhood of light was responsible for the spiritual knowledge and growth of Jesus and other masters as they journeyed into the metaphysical world seeking spiri- tual enlightenment through the door of the universal light consciousness. As workers in the realm of light consciousness, they also had direct access to the secrets of the Great Pyramid and its hall of the initiates. They under- stood alchemy with an aim of achieving ultimate wisdom as well as spiritual immortality. They believed this power of light could defeat the darkness in- hibiting human assent. Ancient scrolls reveal that after leaving the Essene community, Jesus spent seventeen years mostly in India, Tibet then Egypt before heading back to Jerusalem at 30 years of age. From age thirteen to age twenty - nine, he was both a student and teacher of Buddhist and Hindu holy men of India. From Jerusalem to Benares, Brahman historians recorded this beautiful journey, and even today they still know and love him as Saint Issa — their 'Buddha'. The teachings of the Essenes were universal without boundaries or borders. Each day and evening the Essene collective would meditate and give thanks and love to Mother Earth, the heavenly father, the angels of light and the aspects (deities) of the divine that allowed their sustainable connection to Mother Earth and the universal divine light consciousness to continue and grow. In the evening they would praise: The Heavenly Father and a different as- pect each day of the week: The Angel of Sun, The Angel of Water, The An- gel of Air, The Angel of Earth, The Angel of Live, The Angel of Joy. In the morning they would praise: The Earthly Mother and a different aspect each day of the week: The Angel of Power, The Angel of Love, The Angel of Wisdom, The Angel of Eternal Life, The Angel of Work, The Angel of Peace. Essene Brotherhood"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Tree of Life The Tree of Life represents all living things including every culture and spiri- tual master of the light. With its branches reaching skyward toward the uni- versal light consciousness, and its roots going deep in the mother earth seeking and creating the balance of all living things, it dwells in three worlds, of heaven, the earth, and the underworld, connecting all three. It represents both a feminine symbol, bearing nourishment, and a masculine symbol of strength. This wonderful Tree is mentioned many times in the Bible, from Genesis to the Book of Revelation. It is said; one who eats from the Tree is given \"eternal life\", because to eat from the Tree of Life is to drink the knowl- edge of the light consciousness. The Tree, imbibes the above ground or positive world, as well as the evil or negative below ground world. It is also three dimensional, and is the gateway to the light consciousness and the dark side. The crop circle above (right) is a diagram of the Tree of Life from the ancient tradition \"Kabbalah.\" This is a Hebrew occult philosophy said to be from the Middle Ages, and based on a mystical or metaphysical interpretation of the Scriptures. Some biblical scholars believe that origin in fact dates much fur- ther back to the ancient Sumerians, Egyptians, or even to the Atlantians, which is more probable given that the wisdom is universal and beyond the scope of one religious concept. According to the Kabbalah, a person must metaphorically and spiritually ascend the ten points of the Tree of Life to re- unite with the Divine. As one increases his or her spiritual capabilities, one increases the capacity to contain more of the light pouring in through these ten branches, and so draws nearer to the universal divine light conscious- ness. The Tree of Life has many symbolic spiritual meanings and reference points. The Tree sets out the wisdom or the 'map of the Universe'.

The Tree of Life, in the Kabbalah consists of four worlds; Atziluth, the highest of four worlds, it represents the fire and creative energy, Briah, the second, “World of Creation” it represents the water and re- ceptive energy, Yetzirah, the third, \"World of Formation\" it represents air and forma- tive power or energy, Assiah, the forth, “World of Action” it represents the earth and mate- rial energy. The Tree also represents the Chakra system within the human body as each Chakra rotates and vibrates at a specific frequency based on the har- monic patterns or frequency of our lives. The Chakra system also forms the energy grid within the human body that produces the color and field of the “Aura” and can be used in healing as well as evolving spiritually through meditation. The empowering Kundalini Shakti energy is described as a coiled up serpent lying dormant near the base Chakra until being awakened. The purpose of awakening the Kundalini as mentioned later in the book, is to allow our connection to the power of creation. This energy will spiral, almost DNA like, up through the Chakra system around the Yin and Yang channel as it connects. The action of this energy is also known as the Caduceus (above) shown as a double - helix serpent moving around the Tree of Life or spinal column and out through the Sahasrara (crown) Chakra, to where it connects to the uni- versal light consciousness. The Tree of Life also represents all the primordial masters, incarnations, great teachers and sages, as flowers on this divine Tree. They are trans- lated as a fragrance of its truth into the human awareness, but the knowl- edge is not connected to the human ego, dogmas or conditionings, this is because humankind cannot alter or change its form. It is pure universal light consciousness manifested as “one” truth and represented by the different masters or flowers on it’s branches. Historically, instead of enjoying the fra- grance of this whole Tree the illusion of earthy power, money or control at- tracted the lower self of the human ego. In this illusion the beautiful flowers of Jesus, Buddha, Krishna etc, were picked from the Tree and put into the lapel promoting the dogmas of organized religion and false teachings. So the flowers slowly died and with them the wisdom and knowledge that con- nected them to the fragrant Tree. In today’s world these beautiful teachings of the primordial masters are still divisible into sects and religious dogma.

To be divisible is anti evolution, all are one light, one drop in the ocean of divine light consciousness. All are “ONE” in the NEW Golden Age. Over the ages of our spiritual evolution, the pure divine knowledge of light and solar occultism was horded by the dark forces, to con- trol and divide humankind. We are “children of the light”, and for too long our innocence was suppressed, oppressed and deceived as we followed, believed, worshiped, and were force fed anti - God dog- mas in the name of spirituality. We have learned our collective connection to the light conscious- ness is not divisible by religion, false gurus, self - proclaimed mas- ters or any secret society. This connection starts within and no mid- dle person is required for ascension to the divine. The reveling of 2012 will finally open the door to our evolutionary and spiritual truth, but beware of the great deceivers; they will not give up their domain over human kind easily or gently.

The earth is also transforming through a period of great change, and these changes are mirrored within us, our bodies, our DNA and our ascension to the 4 th – 5 th dimensions. As this happens, more than ever before, we are be- coming consciously aware and drawn towards spirituality and personal de- velopment. It seems everything that is happening now, has been predicted in the Mayan Calendar. As mentioned in other parts of the book, “Time” as we know it, is also speeding up — or collapsing. Mars polar ice caps are melting, there is a heat wave on other planets and the Sun is also heating up. This all equates to a massive galactic frequency change. To back this up, many years ago Scien- tists discovered that the earth gives off a pulse. This pulse or frequency that is similar to a heartbeat is called the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of the Earth. It has been stable at approximately 7.8 cycles per second for thousands of years, and was even used by the military because of it consistency. However, since 1980 this resonance has been slowly ris- ing. It is now over 12 cycles per second! This mean there seems to be less than 16 hours per day instead of the old 24 hours. So “linear time” as I un- derstand it, is measured in increments of astronomical or atomic motions, while “nonlinear” time is described in increments of free flowing progres- sions. Seems some scientists actually believe the earth will stop rotating for about three days when this pulse reaches 13 cycles per second — sometime around 2012. So it stands to reason then, if time really is speeding up — flying faster than our calendars indicate: then our internal clocks will also be thrown off by whatever is happening. So its okay to be late for work!

This numinous tale has captured our attention for years. Atlantis has shaped many aspects of the history of civilization, as the guiding architect of the Great Pyramids and the Mayan calendar. It is said the founders of Atlantis were half God and half human — similar to the Hindu mythology and folklore about Star Teachers from the star constella- tion Pleiades . Ancient Sumerian tablets also speak of planet Nibiru and the Anunnaki as having shaped our early civilizations by DNA modifications then enslaving people. It is believed Atlantis was during a time of great power. With an abundance of rare, unusual minerals, they were able to harness solar power through the use of crystals. They also had the ability to move freely through land, water and air using aircraft and guided vessels. The Atlantians not only enjoyed all of our “modern” advancements, but those that still remain undiscovered today. Machines and lasers were used for rejuvenation of the body and their technology assisted in developing their psychic abilities, including telepathy and astral traveling. According to Plato, the last civilization of Atlantis existed about 12,000 years ago. The surviving poets, priests, and others were able to pass along its legends of wealth and tales of a cataclysmic end. Plato's writings of Atlantis are the only known records of its existence other than in the Hall of Records that remain hidden in the Labyrinth or under the Sphinx in Egypt, as foreseen by the clairvoyant Edgar Cayce. In his trances Mr. Cayce also described Atlantians as thought - form beings — projecting pure white light energy — but gradually taking on a more material density of this Earth plane after engaging in acts of the lower self and self - indulgence. They then began to separate into two groups — the Children of the Light who followed the Laws of One, and those that chose to Past Civilizations"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 follow the Sons of Belial and their carnal pursuits. According to Greek folklore, a change occurred in Atlantis after the fourth race of man had completed its pinnacle of development. A power struggle ensued after the humility, truth and dharma of the Children of Light (“spirit masters”) was overcome by the transgression, treachery and dishonesty of the Sons of Belial. As this terminal condition festered, the universal divine authority was steadfast to destroy Atlantis in an attempt to revert back to where humankind would once again live a dharmic and evolving spiritual life. This resulted in destruction from the great floods, leaving little record. The fifth race of man then emerged into what is now our current modern civilization. Interestingly, the early Christians have a similar story in Genesis about Noah and the great flood, where he was warned by the Gods through vi- sions to prepare and build his Ark so he could escape the cataclysm and establish the new Earth civilization. Could Noah have been from Atlantis? The survivors of Atlantis also spread into Africa and to Central America, es- tablishing their knowledge and advancing the civilizations of the Maya, Egyptians and others. Even today the Mayan elders recognize their heritage as descendants of Atlantis, although most of those records were either lost or preserved in the great Hall of Records in Egypt and the Mayan calendar. It is believed a few of the light and dark forces of the fourth race of the At- lantian civilization survived, building foundations within our current civiliza- tion, and setting the stage as we move into 2012 and the final battle of Ar- mageddon. According to the Aztec calendar, our modern civilization is in the 4 th great cycle with the 5 th starting after the great purification of 2011/2012. It appears that we are in a similar cycle of corruption that Atlantis experienced before its destruction. Lemuria — Mu According to many channeled sources, the ancient civilization of Mu was destroyed 26,000 years ago by earthquakes, subduction and submergence during a period of the Earth’s last alignment to the dark rift (or end of the great cycle). It is also said that Queen Moo (a survivor from Mu) may have founded the ancient civilization of Egypt, and that other Mu survivors ven- tured to China and Central America, giving rise to their advanced civiliza- tions of the time. The Great Sphinx It may be in the best interests of Egypt’s history books and tourism to have their descendants take credit for building the Sphinx, but it is not their work or vision.

This is a ma- jor contrast with Egyp- tological dating that claims the Sphinx was created about 4,500 years ago. Edgar Cayce, the famous clairvoyant of the 20 th cen- tury, mentioned in a physic reading that survivors of Atlantis built the Sphinx around 10,500 BC, and left behind a “Hall of Re- cords” that contained all the knowledge of their lost civilization and the true history of our past great civilizations. There are many cultures including the Mayans that link the sinking of Atlantis to the building of the Sphinx, claiming there is a chamber beneath the paws that contains the legendary \"Hall of Records”. Cayce also prophesied that this Hall of Records would be discovered and opened by 1998. Unfortunately that did not happen, however in his favor there was a seismic survey done to the Sphinx that indicated the existence of several unexplored tunnels in the rock beneath, including a large rectan- gular chamber about 25 feet beneath its front paws. Curiously, they also dis- covered a massive underground labyrinth of large halls and rooms in the Gaza Plateau but the government has halted exploration until the year 2012. If the of Hall of Records were discovered before 2012, it would expose the truth about our history and behind the religious and political dogmas we have been forced to embrace for thousands of years. When 2012 does ar- rive it won’t matter, since the world will be in the throes of a major chaotic transition! Edgar Cayce connected the opening of the Hall of Records to the second coming of Christ (or Shri Kalki) at the time of revelation — the Arma- geddon and 2012. This is just another example of the politics and power preventing truth and progress and hindering the evolution process of humanity by re - defining our deeper historical heritage. So what would really happen if the records indi- cated that we have been misled and misinformed about our spiritual under- standing, alien contacts, and galactic proof of the coming cataclysm? Pyramids There are beautiful metaphysical references of how the pyramids were built, but where did these ideas come from? The truth is, there are hundreds of pyramids around the world as well as on Mars and the Moon, and they all Past Civilizations"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 seem to stand on gateways of energy, vortex or power grid centers, that could represent a form of “star - gate” between planets. Many believe that the pyramids act as a portal to the inner world and another spiritual dimension connecting through time - space to the universal light consciousness. What we know for sure is they are scientifically designed instruments that harbor a complete detailed knowledge of the stars, galaxy, Sun, and planets, Earth's dimensions, rotating speed of magnetic field, gravity, time, space and en- ergy, and the life force of body, mind and spirit. In ancient times the Great Pyramid was also known as the hall of the initiates, where the connection to the great forces of the 5 th dimensional light consciousness was attained. The “Aquarian Gospel” states this is were Jesus achieved Christ consciousness. The four sides of the pyramid represent the four dimensions of time space, with the 5 th side representing the 5 th dimension or the totally liberated human being. It is said Atlantis was a top Earth connection with the pyramids as entrance portals to the center of the Earth — possibly a different dimension. The Hopi Indians say they knew of entrances to huge underground cities. A properly aligned and constructed pyramid is a source of peaceful energy and can be helpful in all aspects of life — including curing disease and nega- tivity. Harnessing this energy in the next age will be part of the building blocks of our outward connection to the stars.

Who built the sophisticated harbor city near the shores of Lake Titicaca (Peru) more than ten thousand years ago, and the UFOs and flying machines noted by most ancient cultures? Could it realistically have been the descendents of Mu or Atlantis? Since the Mayans, Sumerians and most ancient cultures have painted images or a history that depicts Gods from the sky or Aliens in spacecrafts dating back; in some cases; long before Atlantis or Mu, this seems unlikely. Could it be that there have been many great civilizations on Earth over the past 200,000 years, whereby these ancestral descendants were the forefathers of Atlantis and Mu? There is a strong historical connec- tion to aliens throughout ancient history where renderings of spacecrafts and beings from the stars were the norm. These renderings are charted around the world and it is fair to assume they shared their knowledge with inhabitants of Mu and the Atlantians. who in turn shared some of their knowledge with the Mayans and Egyptians. Sumerian stone tablets also show visits with the Anunnaki from planet Nibiru over 6,000 years ago but their history of these aliens goes back 200,000 years. Our modern global society is the first civilization that has been subjected to constant denial by the religious and political powers that control the media, our thoughts, and our history. If the mass population were to relate to a higher life form, it would de - stabilize their dominance, so they hide the truth to maintain control as the “highest authority”. Consequently, all information about alien presence has been kept TOP Secret, along with creating multi - million dollar misinformation strategies. This was clearly evidenced during Roswell, and later with crop circle sightings, where misinformation to the media reduced these warnings and messages to nothing more than an elaborate hoax created by a few drunken English men in the dark of night. Yet, the fact is aliens have been part of this world since the beginning of civilization and may even walk among us. The powers that control us are surely aware of this, and most likely using the aliens to access advance technologies to increase their power base.

To staunchly deny that life exists on other planets of the solar system and galaxy is the epitome of arrogance and control. Government and religious interests have done a good job keeping our attention on terrorists and flu vaccines instead of 2012 and the reality of alien presence. These highly evolved alien life forms dwell in both our 3 rd and higher 5 th di- mensional planes. Those residing in the lower frequencies may be consid- ered lower evolved and not so friendly toward humankind but technologically advanced. While those in the higher dimensions of pure light consciousness guide our evolution and promote our spiritual assent to the light conscious- ness. This would easily explain some of our ancient history that describes Avatars, Gods and Deities that radiate pure love and share divine wisdom through the Vedas and similar historical books of wisdom and, Meta sci- ence. These evolved alien spiritual beings have attempted to guide us using the frequency of their evolved spiritual communication, but our conduit opening is very weak on Earth. So due to our inability to tune in to the higher fre- quencies of the light, some higher evolved aliens are using crop circles to communicate with us, through an advanced form of Cymatics. However, as we transform into the higher consciousness of the 5 th dimension though 2012, and the morphing of our respective DNA, and channels of light awak- ened, the use of symbolic messages through crop circles will no longer be required.

In Sanskrit this group of stars is known as Krittika, ruled by Shri Agni Devi — the God of Fire. Kritikka is known as the star of fire where power is born. In In- dian mythology it is believed the Deity Lord Karttikeya, the second son of Lord Shiva, and Goddess Parvati originated from there before coming to the planet Earth. Legends and stories about this star cluster can be found in almost every cul- ture. Aztecs, Australian Aboriginals, Chinese, Columbian Amazons, Egyp- tians, Greeks, Hebrews, Hindus, Incas, Japanese, Maori, Mayans, Native Americans, Old Europeans, Persians, Romans, and South African tribal cul- tures all have storytelling legends about the Pleiades. The star cluster of Pleiades is “the connection to our higher light conscious- ness” our galactic family. It is this region of space that has signaled to Earth through their crop circle messages that a higher light consciousness is watching and helping us understand what is occurring during the ascension of 2012. Pleiades is the gateway bringing centering and balance to the higher self. Throughout the ages, these masters of light have helped us un- derstand our connection to the living library of the Akashic and universal light consciousness in our spiritual evolution, and they will appear before 2012 to support us during our forthcoming transformation. Many legends of Pleiades are found around the world, and all seem to point to their protection and ultimate help during our evolution and transformation.

This ancient and complex re- ligion has no clearly defined religious associations, but rather a family of faiths that extended from the monistic triad, (Brahma, the Creator, Vishnu, the Preserver, and Shiva, the Destroyer) to a pluralistic Hindu theism (the Supreme Being or collective light consciousness manifesting qualities as many Deities or Gods and Goddesses). The mentors and benefactors of ancient Hinduism were Pleiadian and Orion’s star teachers. It is said the myths and spoken traditions such as sto- rytelling arose from Pleiadian traditions and spiritual teachings. Many of the immortal or spiritually evolved Goddesses and Gods described in the folk- lore of the Vedas as Deities, were in fact beings of Pleiadian ancestry in hu- man form that came to Earth during ancient times and past civilizations. For example: the Lemurians of Mu were descendants of Pleiadian star teachers on the continent of LEMURIA, but before LEMURIA was destroyed they acted as the mentors for those living in India. The spoken traditions, tales and spiritual protocols of the Chakras and Kundalini evolved from the an- cient Pleiadian and Shamanic ancestry into the early traditions of ancient Hinduism. The Vedas — ancient Hindu scriptures created in the form of mantras or hymns, were the timeless and eternal religion of dharma, and shruti “cosmic sound of truth”.

Their calendar is reputed to be the most accurate in the world: off by merely 2 seconds every 100 years. This calen- dar also refers to this period in our history as the \"Apocalypse\". This means all will be revealed — the history of civilization, our true connection with the stars, and all things relevant to our transformation into the light conscious- ness. During this Apocalypse (or time \"between worlds\") many of us will ex- perience personal transformation and changes — all of which are part of our journey and the reason we chose to be here during this period of great con- version. The Mayan believe this is the time to work through the karmic resi- due of our collective civilization, and individually to attain a higher atone- ment. Hence, by 2012 and just beyond we will have transcended to the 5 th dimension and our planet Earth and the solar system will finally come into galactic synchronization with the rest of the universe. As a result the earthly quarantine will be lifted. This transformation is occurring now into and be- yond 2012 and our DNA is being reprogrammed from a double helix to eventually a 12 - strand \"upgrade\". This evolution of our DNA will correspond with the 12 Chakras — 7 in the physical plane and 5 outside or above the crown or Sahasrara chakra. The Mayan say we are evolving into the sixth world, which is actually “blank”. This means as co - architects, it is our responsibility to immediately start implementing the new world and civilization of peace and attunement, while becoming the spiritual change we want to experience in this new era. Mayan Calendar The creators of the Mayan calendar gave birth to a system capable of track- ing both astronomical and non - astronomical cycles of nature, and calculate eclipses, galactic alignment and conjunctions. With these complex math equations and time scales of lunar solar and planetary systems they could Mayans"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 even chart future events such as the solar eclipses a thousand years in ad- vance. The length of their calendar’s sub - cycles even matched natural cy- cles such as human growth and the snakes shedding their teeth. They also could see the orbits of the observable planets and calculate the length of the journey around the sun. The Mayan calendar is much more complex and accurate than our current annual calendar. It is actually an astronomical computer that predicts the ages, solar and galactic events. Referring to the Mayan calendar, Dr. Jose Arguelles wrote in \"Time and the Techno - sphere\" that the date of August 13, 3113 BC is as precise and accurate as one can get for a beginning of history. The first Egyptian dynasty is dated to ca 3100 BC; the first “city” — Uruk in Mesopotamia, also ca 3100 BC; the Hindu Kali Yuga, 3102 BC; and most interestingly, the division of time into 24 hours of 60 minutes each and each minute into 60 seconds (and the division of the circle into 360 degrees), also around 3100 BC in Samaria. Given the fact that this data documenting the beginning of history was so accurately placed, it must be concluded that the end of history on December 21 st 2012 be deemed equally accurate. So how did the Mayan people create a calendar that is the world's most ac- curate calendar ever, off by only 2 seconds every 100 years, or did they? All research shows that the Mayan calen- dar has two circles that interact as one. They are the TZOL KIN (sacred calendar) and the TUN calendars. This calendar cre- ated by the Mayans started recording time in 3,114 BC and the calendar abruptly ends in 2012 AD — “The End of Times”. The calendar known as TZOL KIN has a cycle of precisely 5,125 days . It is based on the 26,000 - year cycle of the star clus- ter Pleiades. This is mirrored by 260 days, pairing the numbers one through thirteen with a sequence of twenty (name) days. A Mayan baby’s first name is as- signed based on the day they were born, (260 names). This was done pri- marily for vibrational reasons that corresponded to the universal vibration and astrological correspondence. The Mayan believe that thirteen is the vi- brational universal force found in all things, the source of all knowledge, and representative of galactic movement. The twenty is derived from the number four, representing Measure, and five is the number of the structure’s primary matrix (the center and four cardinal points). The calendar also predicts a combination of several cosmic cycles within the movement of the Sun, Moon and Venus. The days on this calen- dar are made up of 13 intentions (energies) and 20 aspects of creation x 13 = 260 days. Mayans"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 The TUN (divine) calendar is 360 days, where the two circles line up every 52 rotations. Beyond the physical aspects this calendar also maps out astro- logical events within our galaxy and beyond. By contrast the western calen- dar is 30 days/12 months but the Mayan uses the numbers 20/13. No inac- curacies have ever been found in the Mayan calendar. According to the Mayan calendar we are experiencing the climax of an evo- lutionary stage — the last few years of this 26,000 year cycle! This cycle will end December 21 st 2012, with a rare celestial alignment, aligning the galac- tic and solar planes. Here the winter solstice Sun will conjunct with our Milky Way galaxy, creating a “sky portal or entrance” into the “dark rift” of the Milky Way galaxy. This will create a morphogenetic genesis. This means, DNA transformation and its connection with the universal light conscious- ness. Dr. Jose Arguelles, a historian of the United States, has devoted his life studying the Maya civilization. In his book \"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology\", he explains the Mayan calendar with great knowledge and de- tail. The Mayan calendar states in our solar system \"The Great Cycle\" of 5,200 years, (3113 BC to 2012 AD) is ending. In The Great Cycle, our Earth and our solar system are racing across the \"Galactic Beam\", which origi- nated within the core of the galaxy. The diameter of this Galactic Beam is 5,125 Earth years across, so it has taken 5,125 Earth years to cross through this Galactic Beam. In the Mayan prophecy it states after crossing through this Galactic Beam, our solar system will experience a fundamental and spiritual change — one that we are currently starting to experience on many levels. It is also believed the transition leading up to 2012 is a very important period before this \"Galactic Synchronization\", called the purification or \"Earth Re- generation Period\". In many different scriptures it has been called the End of Time, Armageddon or the time that will ultimately renew and evolve human- kind and the universal consciousness into the next phase of our spiritual evolution. This is consistent with the dawning of the new Age of Aquarius as the age of enlightenment, and the translation of the Bible’s Lord’s Prayer “Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven” could be easily interpreted as the coming new age. The Mayans believe they are direct descendants of Atlantis and other great pre - civilizations, all of which lived on the Earth but were destroyed by cata- clysms when the powers of their societies were misused and the connection with the mother Earth was lost. Because they have been through it, they un- derstand how the changes will manifest, and that the build - up we are experi- encing is in fact the beginning of the purification period or end of times as we know them.

It is said few will survive the devasta- tion that results. Then as the fifth age manifests, humanity will finally realize its spiritual destiny. With the advent of yoga and meditation coming to the west over the past few years, this awareness is beginning to manifest — although mostly still in the intellectual domain of understanding. The “Yoga business” seems to resonate with past dogmas and attachment to money.

We have evolved past the old “world is flat” doctrine and the fantasy our moon is made of cheese. It seems there are those who still sell us the fantasy, keeping us in the dark, uninformed so as not to unravel or rattle the power structures that benefit from the farce that UFOs do not exist. UFOs don’t exist only because the political and/or religious media and dogma doesn’t want them to exist. So maybe it is time common sense evolves, and modern thinking discards out dated 1950’s concepts about UFOs and moon cheese. Lets consider the billions of stars with planets just in our Galaxy, beaming eons longer than our Mother Earth and Solar Sun. It would be very illogical and egotistical to think that Mother Earth is the only planet with intelligent life in this universe, or that 200,000 years of human history makes us advanced! Maybe were advanced to the primates and ants but not to the vast intelligent life forms that inhabit the cosmos in multiple dimensions. It would also be naive to believe our governments, and the powers that truly run them are an honest bunch with our best interests in mind. So when we take off the blind- ers we can clearly see the universe is beaming with intelligent life. Our hu- man history has piles of verified UFO contact, sightings and abductions. So why have we been misinformed and lied to time and again about the exis- tence of Alien intelligence and their ongoing contact with some of our World Governments? Well for one, the aliens know our true history, and I would bet it does not coincide with the versions we have been fed by the Govern- ments and religions. The other reality is, who ever controls this information and technology controls the world, and those that have this information do not want to hand it over to the democratic public, or the mainstream govern- ment for scrutiny.

They also speak about the ongoing contact our government has with the Gray Aliens (Grays) and trading UFO technology for looking the other way on the abductions of a small percentage of the population. Just think of the growing missing people lists, the war in Iraq, and the thousands of use- less killings over oil before we say — our Government? Not possible! This information has been hidden since the 50’s in small independent top - secret classified sections of the Government in Area 51 and others, with special outside interest groups benefiting. It was not always this way, explains JFK researcher Professor Lawrence Merrick, author of the book: Killing the Messenger: \"It appears that some individuals within our government were determined to maintain the secrecy surrounding captured UFOs -- and decided to silence the President before he could speak.\" He also goes on to say \"I was surprised to find that Ken- nedy handed Governor Connally the speech, which was on note cards, to Sahara — North Africa 6000 BC Tassili Mountains Rendering Medieval painting with space craft clearly shown Who Are We?"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 look at, shortly before the motorcade set off at 12:55 p.m.,\" The Professor’s research reveals that just days before JFK’s trip to Dallas, he met with his predecessor President Dwight D.

He took them to five expert handwriting analysts, who all agreed that this speech was \"95 percent certain\" to be Kennedy's. This is the speech that President John F. Kennedy was to give the day he was assassinated: “My fellow Americans, people of the world, today we set forth on a jour- ney into a new era. One age, the childhood of mankind, is ending and an- other age is about to begin. The journey of which I speak is full of unknowable challenges, but I be- lieve that all our yesterdays, all the struggles of the past, have uniquely pre- pared our generation to prevail. Citizens of this Earth, we are not alone. God, in His infinite wisdom, has seen fit to populate His universe with other beings -- intelligent creatures such as ourselves. How can I state this with such authority? In the year 1947 our military forces recovered from the dry New Mexico desert the re- mains of an aircraft of unknown origin. Science soon determined that this vehicle came from the far reaches of outer space. Since that time our gov- ernment has made contact with the creators of that spacecraft. Though this news may sound fantastic -- and indeed, terrifying -- I ask that you not greet it with undue fear or pessimism. I assure you, as your President, that these beings mean us no harm. Rather, they promise to help our nation overcome the common enemies of all mankind -- tyranny, poverty, disease, war. We have determined that they are not foes, but friends. Together with them we can create a better world. I cannot tell you that there will be no stumbling or missteps on the road ahead.

Whether we believe the JFK story or not, does not matter. What matters is that humankind has a long history of Alien contact, at least 200,000 years and probably much more. There are countless cave paintings, carvings, art- ist renderings, statues, historical lore, modern sightings, NASA and earth photos, videos and Crop Circles to support this reality. Yes! We have been, and are being visited almost daily. Seems as 2012 approaches sightings are getting much more common. Most governments have been making fools of their citizens for years, under the guise of “National Security” that allows the secret society that really controls policy to move far beyond the controls of the governments. They now have advanced technologies through reverse engineering of alien crafts as well as the information they have traded ab- ductions for. This mess is beyond the scope of our innocent understanding, as there really are two different unelected powers controlling this information and our Governments. This was the leading concern of JFK and the reason he wanted to make the UFO speech public, and the main reason he was murdered. Please Note : The special interests of the Government, and secret societies aligned with the Illuminati will continue to distort, and promote disinformation through controlled media. This is done to quiet and confuse the population as they have become very good at this, starting in 1947 with the Roswell UFO crash, then JFK’s Warren Commission, on to 911 and the following oil wars of the arrogant Bush government. Stone tablet records of the Sumerians tell stories that date back 200,000 years, where Aliens genetically altered the DNA of our primitive ancestors. This is not far fetched considering we are currently doing the same thing now, by manipulating the DNA of plants and animals to benefit our race of humanoids! DNA fusing ages ago by the Anunnaki does seem reasonable, and this would sensibly bridge the missing link in Darwin’s theory of evolu- tion. So if we let go of the conditionings set in motion and mainly created by government and religious dogma — it makes logical sense. What we should remember when trying to figure out if our DNA was fused with a higher alien intelligence is that 3 or 4 primary races make up the mod- ern human race. The Genome project research stated there is a 2 – 3 % dis- crepancy in the genetics of the 3 - 4 dominant human races. It was also Who Are We?"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 stated these races had up to a 15% discrepancy in their reactions to things like a flu virus. It is also genetically unworkable for 3 or 4 different skin tones and features to have evolved naturally from the Homo sapiens over our 200,000 years of evolution. This is all off the charts when the modern sci- ence of genetics is applied to the old theory of human evolution. If we move into The Book of Enoch , as well as Jubilees , it connects the origin of the Nephilim with the fallen angels, and in particular with the Grigori (watchers). Samyaza, who is depicted as an angel of high rank, is said to have led a rebel sect of angels descending to earth to have sexual inter- course with human females: “And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one an- other: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.' And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to aban- don this plan but to do this thing.' Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hun- dred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound them- selves by mutual imprecations upon it.”.. The fallen angels according to these texts, who begat the Nephilim were cast into Tartarus or Gehenna, the place of 'total darkness'. Jubilees also states “ God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to remain after the flood, as demons, to try to lead the human race astray (through idolatry, the occult, etc.) Until the final Judgment”. This final judg- ment is coming in 2012. Remains of ancient giants, discovered in India Note size of the man digging Note the size difference humans — gods.

So lets put on our thinking caps and say they were Anunnaki de- scending from the sky on space ships via Planet Nibiru. Also a closer review of the Old Testament reveals two brothers, known as Enki, and Enlil. They are mentioned in many ancient, scrolls and texts, including the Bible, where they are referred to as giants. However, in the original Hebrew version they were known as the Nephilim. The Nephilim do appear in the Bible: Genesis 6:4 - 6 “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days, and also after- wards, when the sons of the Gods came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.” Translated, it means that the Anunnaki or Nephilim bore children with our earth women, so it would seem we descended genetically from these higher evolved alien beings. So given the beautiful and unique color, features and DNA discrepancies within the three or four distinct races of peoples evolving on our planet, it would be fair to say there have been many interplanetary visits.

References to these flying machines are commonplace in ancient Indian texts, even describing their use in warfare. The Vimanas was said to be able to fly within Earth's atmosphere, into space and travel submerged underwater. The Vedas describe Vimana’s as having various shapes and sizes. The Sun, Indra and several other Vedic Deities were depicted as being transported by flying wheeled chariots pulled by animals, usually horses. The Vedic God Pusan, had his chariot pulled by goats. The \"Gaja Vimana\" had the more (powerful) engines. The primitive artists of the times could only understand power as coming from a source of animals. So the type of animal represented the power of the engine so to speak. The \"Agnihotra Vimana\" means with two engines, and word Agni means fire in Sanskrit Gaja means elephant in Sanskrit, and in some modern Indian dialects, the word Vimana still means aircraft.

He stated it is more than just a natural satellite revolving around the Earth. There are a number of oddities, including how astronauts spoke in code about UFOs seen there, and the strange lights verified by Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Tellinger also mentioned instruments, which picked up large amounts of wa- ter vapor despite mainstream science saying there was no atmosphere there, as well as countless observations of lights on the lunar surface. Tellin- ger stated the moon is \"most likely being used as a base for extraterrestrial craft.\" This may also explain the Dark Side of the moon theory, and why the moon does not really rotate. The multi - national Space Station astronauts have also noticed many lights with countless UFO sightings. Another important fact: based on various density tests, it has been shown the density of the moon would be the same as a moon that was hollow. The moon has been dated to be about 1 billion years older than the earth, with its rocks being millions of years younger than its own surface dust. This leads to many more questions. Tellinger also discussed a recent discovery of a site in South African dubbed, \"Adam's Calendar\", which research states is around 75,000 years old. \"We have found something truly remarkable, truly unique, and most likely the oldest manmade structure on earth,” According to surveyors who have examined it, he states the site was \"a circular structure, like Stone- henge\" that features rocks that aligned with \"the cardinal geographical points of Earth\" along with the solstices and equinoxes similar to Stone- henge. He explained dating of the site was initially derived from the fact that the points of alignment “did not match up” with the modern position of the Sun. In part, it was using archaeoastronomy that they determined the age of the monument. This dating system would make sense given that fact that the Earth has experienced numerous pole shifts, where the land mass align- ment with the sun would have changed. Another pole shift is set to happen again around 2012.

According to the 6,000 - year - old Sumerian cosmology, Nibiru is the twelfth planet in the solar system. The Dwarf star of this mini constellation is 8 times the size of Earth with two planets and two moons rotating around it. One of the Planets is home of the aliens called Anunnaki. The research re- veals this constellation is on a 3,600 year elliptical orbit around our Sun. Currently, Nibiru can be seen with the naked eye in the skies in the most southern hemisphere as it moves to- ward our Sun. By spring 2010, Nibiru will be seen with the naked eye in the northern hemisphere — passing by the Earth in 2012. It is feared this passing will bring the Pole Shift and major cataclysms.

The last time this event happened 3600 years ago, there were survivors and tales of its passing. The following is a quote by African Zulu elder and spiritual guide of the Zulu people named Credo Mutwa, who spoke of a story still told by his ancestors. Its a legend where a strange Star passed by the earth thousands of years ago: \"Let me tell you two last things please. One, it is this, that I am told by the great storytellers of our tribes, that fresh water is not native to our earth. That at one time, many thousands of years ago a terrible star, or the kind called Mu - sho - sho - no - no, the star with a very long tail, descended very close upon our skies. It came so close that the earth turned upside down and what had become the sky became down, and what was the heavens became up. \"The whole world was turned upside down. The sun rose in the south and set in the north. Then came drops of burning black stuff, like molten tar, which burned every living thing on earth that could not escape. After that came a terrible deluge of water accompanied by winds so great that they blew whole mountaintops away. And after that came huge chunks of ice bigger than any mountain and the whole world was covered with ice for many generations. \"After that the surviving people saw an amazing sight. They saw rivers and streams of water that they could drink, and they saw that some of the fishes that escaped from the sea were now living in these rivers. That is the great story of our forefathers. And we are told that this thing is going to happen again very soon. Because the great star, which is the lava of our sun, is going to return on the day of the year of the red bull, which is the year 2012.\" Who Are We?"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 Creation Before creation there was silence. There was no life and no living thing — no worlds, stars, flowers, oceans, valleys or mountains. Then through the light of divine consciousness a thought became manifest, and through this thought, creation was born and the universal sound of creation (Om) be- came manifest. The Audi Shakti (feminine aspect of all creation) then whis- pered this holy sound and the forming of worlds began vibrating at the uni- versal frequency. This created the universes and all aspects of all things transcended to their places on the planes of life and creation. A beautiful living garden called Mother Earth was created to sustain and nurture life, and the human children of the light started their spiritual evolution. As the children evolved in their crude human forms, their inner light connection to the universal light consciousness was also evolving and they soon under- stood their accent was far beyond the 3 rd dimensional realm. This realization has become more apparent as 2012 approaches, and we open up to the light consciousness to guide us through the multi - dimensional transforma- tion — soon upon us. Creation has many meanings on many levels: from the creation of the soul and universal light consciousness, to the creation of civilizations and the sci- ence of our modern intellect. Our creation seems beyond the comprehen- sion of our intellect in the current plane of our spiritual awareness. Our Earth has hosted the creation of many great civilizations such as Atlan- tis, Mu, Mayan, Inca and all were destroyed by cataclysms or some other unknown fate. Our current civilization has evolved under the subtle guidance of the divine light consciousness and the alien beings that have previously come to Earth acting as gods. If we reference creation through the eyes of the Kabbalah, Tibetan or Tan- tric Buddhism, Adam and Eve are viewed as symbols of male and female energy. The presence of the Serpent, believed a dividing force, was neces- sary for creation. The belief was that it gave humankind the opportunity to evolve to the Light on its own. One veiled version of the Adam and Eve story Who Are We?"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 represents two Gardens of Eden, one represents the higher self, the other the lower self — while evolving to the higher Garden is the destiny of human- kind. “Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven”. — Bible. The next ques- tion is: what does all this represent in terms of our past, present and future evolution? For us to understand our future, we should first understand the past. Over 6000 years ago the ancient Sumerians wrote their history onto thousands of stone tablets, 500 of these tablets depict a story of aliens called Anunnaki that hailed from the Planet Nibiru, “planet of the crossing.” Their story tells of aliens genetically altering our human DNA and enslaving humans to mine gold used as reflective dust to save their planets atmosphere. This story resonates given the fact that over the past 20 years, we have genetically manipulated the DNA of sheep, and other animals in the name of our own science and survival. So it would be fair to assume this happened 200,000 years ago using ape like grunt workers to mine their gold on our planet. It is interesting our science maintains modern man is 200,000 years old, evolv- ing out of Africa. This parallels the Sumerian tablets, with a twist. The twist is 200,000 years ago, in the land of Eden (Africa) the Aliens created a hu- man hybrid from the dust. Would this dust be the DNA to genetically modify human beings? Also interesting: the human being has 46 chromosomes or 23 pairs with 28 major deformities, all tolled over 4,000 genetic deformities. This is said by science to be off the charts (not normal) considering our modern species is only 200,000 years old. Also primates have 48 chromo- somes, humans have 46, so unless we were genetically fused or manipu- lated we could not have evolved from the chimp or ape family. It is also a fact of science that a new species like us should have few, if any, genetic deformities. The law of nature dictates that when a species has deformities it ceases to exist, but with the human, it is the opposite. We can see that anatomically, modern humans first appear in the fossil re- cords of Africa about 195,000 years ago, and studies of molecular biology give evidence that the approximate time of deviation from the common pri- mate ancestor of all modern human populations was 200,000 years ago. Well this seems to correspond with the Sumerian stone tablet account that our genetic modifications were done by the “Gods” or Anunnaki in Africa at a place called Eden also 200,000 years ago. The tablets also speak of the for- bidden fruit as a sexual act between Eve and the fallen Reptilian Anunnaki “Serpent.” It seems likely that the serpent (Saturn/Satan) seduced Eve and through this child of their union, Cain, the Serpent seed lines of the Anun- naki began. This seed line can be traced to modern times through a vast family tree including the British Royalty of Queen Elisabeth, Pharaohs and Political leaders such as both George Bush senior and junior. Genesis 6:1 - 4: “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of Who Are We?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 all which they chose... There were Nephilim in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.” In Genesis 3:15a : \"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.\" Enmity means there is mutual hatred be- tween the seed lines of Satan's and of Eve's. So it sounds like there is “two” seed lines created with Eve, the serpent’s son Cain and Adam's son Seth. The facts in the Dead Sea Scrolls and verses in Gen 3:15 make it clear: Sa- tan had his own seed line ancestry established back in the garden with Eve. The Sumerian tablets clearly mention mod- ern mans origins or re - creation and coloniza- tion of the Earth through genetic manipula- tion of our species. DNA manipulation does not make the Anunnaki our God, or make them divine, just as our modern scientists are not divine because they managed to manipu- late the DNA of sheep. The Anunnaki did not create the universal divine light or any life on Mother Earth, in fact the opposite. The Anun- naki or Nephilim, descended from Planet Nibiru where their aggressive reptilian super race known as the Anunnaki governed. This descent to earth caused the anti - evolutionary domination not in tune with our evolution to the light consciousness. A better definition for their descending might be “those who came down”, “those who descended”, or “those who were cast down”. The \"Nephilim\" in Hebrew, means \" they who have come down from the heavens to earth\" ref- erenced in the Hebrew Bible, Book of Genesis and the Book of Numbers. It would seem the Anunnaki are the foundation of the anti Christ; a force that has been around since ancient times to manipulate, confuse and control our civilization until Planet Nibiru comes again in 2012. This manipulation started, when the Anunnaki switched the gender of the universal creator God from the Mother (Audi Shakti) to father: which was the dominant force on their planet. It was the Anunnaki who introduced polygamy, incest and pedophilia, which are characteristic to their culture. Such traits evolved into other cultures, including the ancient Egyptian royalty and the patriarchs of the Old Testament who followed the laws of “God” ordered by the Anunnaki. These satanic traits also evolved in the doctrine of many modern secret so- cieties of the Illuminati. Descendants of the Anunnaki were known as the “fallen angel” or Nephilim: sons of God. They were named as Saturn or Satan — the evil angelic host that was evident to early man.

This dominance was easy to identify in ancient times when the people were physically enslaved. The form of dominance started to change after the last great flood. People evolved spiritually and started to identify with their connection with the universal light consciousness and col- lectively united under one banner to build the “Tower of Babel” to the heav- ens. This tower symbolized their desired independence, and need to con- nect with the divine creator. The alien “Gods” empowered at the time felt this was a challenge to their authority and domination, so they segregated and enslaved the peoples of the known earth into different languages and races. The Anunnaki “God” Horus understood that our forefathers were weak when divided, easy to control and to enslave. Thus different kings and kingdoms rose up created by the Anunnaki seed line. The Ancient Egyptians believed that their Pharaoh was the God Horus, son of Re, the sun God or a direct descendant. So when a pharaoh died it was believed he united with the sun, and a new Horus would reincarnate and continue to rule on earth, thus the lineage of the dominant Pharaohs and kings continued: eventually crossing religious and political boundaries to grasp and hold power. Another major challenge to their domination occurred when Moses led his people to freedom against the will of the Egyptian Phar- aoh. Their world changed and so did the approach to enslavement.

In today’s world; money, mind control by the media, and control of Governments are the real power, and they have this. We are no longer working the mines as slaves, but are enslaved most of the year to pay off debt and taxes, which mostly benefit the world banks and corporations con- trolled by secret societies and the Illuminati. These controlling factions can be traced back to the Pharaohs and Anunnaki or linked in some way to their Royal or Aristocratic Blood lines (blue blood). Their power and influence has become more powerful: but much subtler and cunning. So as 2012 ap- proaches, we need to understand that any doctrine that enslaves or divides us is anti - Christ, and not part of the collective oneness we seek with divine light consciousness. The Anunnaki and their de- scended seed line have cre- ated many of the dogmas and power structures used to con- trol, confuse and corrupt the minds and pure spiritual knowl- edge that threaten control of their expanding power base. They have horded the meta- physical and spiritual knowl- edge over the ages, while pro- moting dogmas that confuse and divide. This arrogance started with the absolute power given to the Pharaohs. This connection between Horus and the Phar- aohs was promoted by the Anunnaki to stabilize their kingdom and frighten the slaves into submission. This power base evolved and spread over the ages, as their Kings and dogmatic Religions promoted anti - Christ principals. We are now living in the time of the great revealing, and the secret societies are starting to be revealed — along with their true intentions of global domi- nance. In modern times, the Illuminati or ancient seed lines, understand the human will not become enslaved willingly. So they disguise their agenda to enslave and control our minds and the world.

The reality is, these alien “Gods” have manipulated us since ancient times, to prevent our peaceful and spiritual evolution into our family of the light con- sciousness. Originally, the Anunnaki did not understand humankind would evolve spiritually as well as physically, and over time we eventually started to rebel against the enslaving “Gods” or kings. We are still evolving but with two aspects to our being: the physical — that was genetically manipulated, and the spiritual — that is truly evolving beyond their controls. The Anunnaki and their descendants (the Illuminati) now control the worlds economy, drug industry, disease industry and information networks — this is the anti Christ. So as 2012 approaches the battle of Armageddon is manifesting on many physical and spiritual levels. This will start with Alien contact foretold in the crop circle warnings as planet Nibiru gets closer, and soon life will change as we know it, and the deceivers of the anti Christ powers will be exposed. True spiritual evolution: Is creation continually moving beyond each realm of its existence? An existence that previously bound us to the limitations cre- ated in and by this physical body and its 3 rd dimensional conditionings. In creation there is a sacred significance of “Om” the sound of divine creation and the advanced principals of love and light consciousness that manifest as a pure frequency of the new world and 5 th dimension. Thought creation manifests into visualization of light partials becoming mass on the level or frequency in which we reside. So as the drama of 2012 and earth regenera- tion unfolds, our spiritual destiny will evolve, and the lower evolved species like the Anunnaki and their earthly representatives will be left behind and the “First will be the Last”.

A German sect first used the name Illuminati in the 15th century. Like their predecessors they practiced dark occult and professed to possess the occult Knowledge of Satan . Over time, the Illuminati has been successfully manifesting its agenda: creating and controlling shadow governments that super- sede and manipulate elected national governments, mili- tary and banking systems. The goal of the Illuminati sect is total global con- trol with no respect for human life or any form of democracy. Its New World Order is about modern enslavement — using all methods and means to ac- complish this goal. In recent times, this has been accomplished through a rabid campaign of fear media and dark military operations that created a spurious terrorist threat — the war that can never be won. The great reveal- ing of 2012 will allow the light to shine on the lies and deceptions of the Illu- minati anti - Christ forces, because we are the light and masters of this den- sity, not the satanic Illuminati. The light will prevail! Secret Societies have been in place since ancient Egypt, with a purpose to retain the knowledge of the metaphysical sciences, and keep this informa- tion secret: as a form of control and power. The European societies origi- nally borrowed aspects from, and created various cults, sects, covens, fra- ternities, societies, and churches from the ancient Osirica — a professed Black Egyptian Masonic order. Their membership has been programmed and conditioned to believe this knowledge elevates them above their fellow brothers and sisters of the spirit. This is an illusion and in essence anti Christ.

The anti Christ does not want the evolution of the spirit; its only goal is world domination, keeping society as slaves to their corruptions and dogmas. This is done with no compassion for the millions that suffer and die needlessly. It has been done by the same seed line since the beginning of civilization. The Mayan and Hopi elders say we are living during the end time of our civi- lization. It is the time of revelation and the great revealing of truth. This re- vealing extends deep into our ancient history and into the base fiber of our social consciousness. The negativity and darkness surrounding our civiliza- tion has always stemmed from greed, control and ego: rooted deep in our lower evolved self. The dogmas all feed the dogmas that share the illusion of power in the realm of the lower self. So as 2012 reveals the true essence of our spiritual being, and our history will no longer be a place for the dark secretive groups that feel they are above the collective light. There is no caste system in the realm of divinity, and there is no hierarchy where one can buy a position within the light consciousness. The goal for global domi- nation is servicing the lower self, just as Hitler and all those before him that failed — did so because they follow the path into darkness and the abyss. July 1782 had the Illuminati join forces with Freemasonry at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad. The Illuminati goal was to establish a New World Order or one World Government that they can control.

In 1992, Dr John Coleman published Conspirators’ Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300. Dr Coleman identifies the players and carefully de- tails the Illuminati agenda of worldwide domination and control. Dr Coleman accurately summarizes the purpose and intent of the Committee of 300: \"A One World Government and one - unit monetary system, under permanent non - elected hereditary oligarchists who self - select from among their numbers in the form of a feudal system as it was in the Middle Ages. In this One World entity, population will be limited by restrictions on the number of children per family, diseases, wars, famines, until 1 billion people who are useful to the ruling class, in areas which will be strictly and clearly defined, remain as the total world population. There will be no middle class, only rulers and the servants. All laws will be uniform under a legal system of world courts practicing the same unified code of laws, backed up by a One World Government police force and a One World unified military to enforce laws in all former countries where no national boundaries shall exist. The sys- tem will be on the basis of a welfare state; those who are obedient and subservient to the One World Government will be rewarded with the means to live; those who are rebellious will simple be starved to death or be declared outlaws — thus a target for anyone who wishes to kill them.

T he knowledge came to Earth long be- fore Atlantis, and represented the universal knowledge of light, and pure solar occultism. During the early days of Atlantis, the divine knowledge was shared. But over time a deviation of the knowledge evolved and the seed lines of the Anunnaki or dark forces battled for dominion of earth. Their agenda became the dominant force, and eventually, Atlantis was destroyed by a higher power that would not accept the direction towards the lower self. Some es- caped the final days of destruction, with the knowledge intact. This set the stage for the next age of man — where the knowledge became secretive, horded and hidden. The reason this knowledge was not shared, was simply to have control over the people. The sacred knowledge was the same for priests of the Druids and Maya, who like the Magi of Persia and Priests of Heliopolis in Egypt, were all priests of the sun god. This corruption of the Star or Light Teachings manifested secretive sects, and distorted versions of the divine reality, of one universal teaching for all. The people’s innate spiritual thirst for truth became ripe for the religious dogmas that resulted and filled the spiritual void. The void was filled with false knowledge that en- slaved the peoples under the controls of the anti - Christ. The divine is one body, one mind, and one collective voice — anything else is anti - God. The Masons date back to Ancient Egypt, with their occult customs, ceremo- nies, hieroglyphics, numerology and chronology of the stars. They have al- ways had an agenda: as they expanded their domination: erasing other cul- tures’ spiritual foundations and replacing it with dogma in order to divide. The evolution of the Catholic Church, and the inquisition during the middle ages is just one example. It was about 200 years ago, when these powers finally realized they could no longer control people by the sword. So they started to search for ways to control Governments and the minds of the population. The ancient and pow- erful seed line, and their interconnection with the Illuminati, Masons, Church and the Royal bloodlines have one agenda of total global control, and spin- ning their web of anti Christ ideology.

It is obvious his concerns resonated truth, as he was killed by the very forces he was going to expose — those secretly building a covert shadow government behind the scenes. “Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: The very word se- crecy is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inher- ently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwar- ranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers, which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an ex- cuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to with- hold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know. But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to re - examine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country's peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self - discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of \"clear and present danger”, the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security. Today no war has been declared -- and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy is advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, marching troops has crossed no borders, no missiles have been fired. If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self - discipline of combat con- ditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our secu- rity. If you are awaiting a finding of \"clear and present danger”, then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent. It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions -- by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper.

Kennedy’s assassination was a smoothly coordinated plot by the Illuminati to protect their special interests vested in the Banking system, the CIA shadow operations and the covert secret arms of the military industrial complex — including UFO’s. These special interests included reverse engineering captured alien space technologies, and global plans for the New World Order — to control the world through military and financial manipulation. The sham known as the Warren Commission investigating the JFK assassi- nation was the first in a series of controlled misinformation campaigns — successfully directed by the Illuminati puppet masters . With 9/11 and the current middle east wars, we can clearly see there is a major attack on the innocence of the world populations. It also shows the length to which the Illuminati will go to execute their plan for world domination, and, to inflict upon us, their New World Order — an ongoing satanic manifesto like their last failed attempt in Nazi Germany. September 11, 2001, the eyes of the world were focused on a sad and un- necessary loss of innocent lives at the World Trade Center. And, at the same time, most media networks appeared to lose their moral backbone to report and investigate what was an obvious covert military strike . This is more proof that major US and international media is owned or controlled by the Illuminati — through an integrated web.

This is not to say that the innocent citizens working within the infrastructure are Illuminati — they are not. They just don’t understand and realize who con- trols the top of the pyramid, and that their strings are controlled and pulled by the Illuminati Puppet Masters . The certainty that four large commercial jets vanished in the northeastern United States the morning of 9/11 created unparalleled events and dealt a crippling blow to what was left of US democracy. What made it so incredible, was that after each World Trade Center skyscraper was struck by an alumi- num framed commercial aircraft, the massive reinforced steel framed build- ings collapsed. The official story reported that jet fuel fires melted the steel in the buildings causing the collapse. Scientifically, this is impossible. Jet fuel will not burn above 1520 o F (825 o C) and studies show the high - grade steel used at the WTC would have to be at least 3000 o F (1650 o C) under sustained heat in order to melt. In reality, most of the jet fuel burned up dur- ing the impact explosion — so how did this high - grade steel melt? It was the first time in history that fire caused collapse in a steel structured skyscraper: and it happened twice on the same morning — September 11, 2001. One month prior to these attacks, WTC owner: Larry Silverstein, expanded two insurance policies to include Acts of Terrorism . His insurance settlement was US$7.1 billion. Coincidentally, George Bush’s brother was a principal in the security company responsible for protecting the WTC. This firm turned off security at the WTC, and on many occasions sent their security person- nel home along with their explosive - sniffing dog teams, during the months leading up to 9/11 — even during times when private contractors were ac- tively working in both towers. Currently, 800 top US Architectural Firms and many engineering and demo- lition companies: insulted by the official 9/11 Government account, are de- manding an Independent Investigation — citing that the WTC buildings were destroyed by a Controlled Demolition, not airplane fires. Bomb - like explo- sions were seen blowing out windows and were heard by many first re- sponders in their personal accounts. Some of these people were threatened and told they did not hear blasts or explosions. Military - grade Nano - Thermite dust was found over the crime scene in Man- hattan during cleanup. White - hot molten steel was dripping from the burning south - tower’s 80th floor — a sign of Nano - Thermite explosives.

Barium Salts and other nasty bio- logical components, all of which have been proven to cause severe illness in humans and animals, and will stunt and kill vegetation growth. So what are Barium Salts and Colloidal Aluminum? Barium Salts in the body have been used in the past to track released terror- ists. Under Marshall Law, military technologies will be able to track popula- tions by following the traceable Barium. Symptoms of barium poisoning include: nose bleeds, respiratory distress, hard mucous coating in the back of the throat, increased blood pressure, changes in heart rhythm, stomach irritation, brain swelling, muscle weak- ness, liver, kidney, heart, and spleen damage. Colloidal Aluminum is used to pacify the population. Exposure to this sub- stance causes: nausea, vomiting and joint pains. Long - term exposure causes impairment of brain functions — such as memory and balance. These debilitating symptoms are now common in adults in the Pacific NW and have increased dramatically over the past two years.

Did you know sodium fluoride is a common ingredient in poisons, anesthetics, hypnotics, psychiatric drugs, and military nerve gas? Independent scientific evidence shows fluoride causes various mental disturbances and makes people dense, submissive, and subservient, while shortening life spans and damaging bone structure. Fluoride is in fact a byproduct of the aluminum industry and the public was hoodwinked into adding it to drinking water by the Mellon family who are a direct bloodline, and close friends of the British royal family, and dictators of US policy through the Illuminati network. The first use of fluoridated drinking water was in the Nazi prison camps like Auschwitz in Germany. It was offered by the Illuminati's notorious pharma- ceutical giant, I.G. Farben which today is known as “Bayer”. This mass medication of the water supply was not given to the inmates because the Nazis were concerned about their teeth! Fluoridated drinking water was given to sterilize the prisoners and force them into quiet submission.

This Anti Christ — 666"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 would be called \"gentle opportune lobotomy.\" So the real reason behind water fluoridation is not to benefit children's teeth, it is to reduce the resistance of the population to domination and control of the “New World Order”. Any sustained use of fluorinated water will effect a person mentally and physically. This would include beer, soft drinks, and toothpaste. Dr. Jennifer Luke from the University of Surrey in England found that the pineal gland is the primary target of fluoride accumulation within the body. Up until the 1990s, no re- search had ever been conducted to determine the impact of fluoride on the pineal gland — a small gland located between the two hemispheres of the brain that regulates the production of the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate the onset of puberty and helps protect the body from cell damage caused by free radicals. The Pineal Gland looks like a tiny pine cone, and it produces a chemical called DMT (N,N - dimethyltryptamine) an extremely short - acting but very powerful psychedelic. In his book DMT: The Spirit Molecule , Dr Rick Strass- man researched the endogenous DMT's role in dreams, meditation & spiri- tual experiences, birth, alien entity contact, near - death & death experiences. The research showed it could very well be the entry and exit to this and other dimensions and worlds, and the collective unconscious. The Illuminati have understood the power of the Pineal Gland since ancient times, and in- tentionally want to suppress this spiritual awareness and opening to the light consciousness from manifesting. Please Note: the pinecone on the staffs and structures of the Vatican, as well as ancient Egypt. The 'third eye' or 6th chakra is connected to the pineal gland. As our vibra- tion or frequency rises through meditation or spiritual experiences, it acti- vates and opens, allowing a connection beyond the 5 senses of our limited physical vision and into the light consciousness. This connection takes us beyond the illusions we have been conditioned to accept in the 3 rd dimen- sional reality, and instead allows a full expansion into the vast spectrum of the divine light consciousness, while opening our connection to the spiritual transformation of 2012.

Over the ages the knowledge of vibra- tions, solar occultism and sacred geometry has been kept hidden and secret by the Illuminati forces - so our civilization has become child’s play to ma- nipulate – The reality is vibrations and sacred geometric ratios rule our den- sity and reality. The Illuminati know this, and manipulate us, using the knowledge and lower vibrational fields to manipulate and control us. Thus keeping our senses and powers under evolved and focused on the lower density. The mark of the beast represents all the distractions and things cre- ated by the beast that will keep our attention on this lower density; TV, fear media, war, satanic music or lyrics, pornography, drugs, etc. The illuminati goal is to keep our attention enslaved, and prevent the spiritual evolution from transforming our awareness into a higher density of spiritual light con- sciousness and the higher spiritual density manifesting in 2012 and beyond. False Gurus Mark 13:22 – “ For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.” In the new age of transformation we must learn to be our own Guru and Master, and not be mesmerized by, or empower the false teachers. We need to look beyond the saffron words that would take our innocence and money — leaving disillusioned children searching for the promised love and light we imbibe already.

An advanced form of Cy- mantic sound wave energy creates the circles; similar to a sound wave that creates sacred geometric symbols in the sand moving through water. It ap- pears that the aliens contacting us have perfected this form of communica- tion. The symbols, mostly of a spiritual, scientific or astrological significance, were created to communicate and depict future events up to and beyond 2012. Unfortunately, some crop circle designs were created by hoaxers try- ing to get their 15 minutes of fame. They attempted to discredit the real messages and confuse the population about the real message and what will happen in 2012. It is a cosmic chess match pitting humans against the real alien crop circle designers. Consequently, the aliens have improved the complexities of the sacred geometric designs, woven beautifully and created so we can no longer doubt their origins. Circles are bent at a 51° angle but not broken. The crystalline structure of the grain changes after the circle is created, and the seed will usually produce more berries after that happens. The messages in the various crop circles include the 13 Baktun cycle of the Mayan as well as a time reference between the time a specific circle was created until the December 21 st 2012 Galactic Alignment. Some circles com- municate that they are working on a vibrational communication structure. A very unique series of circles also showed the broken DNA cell and later cir- cles with a cell metamorphous or evolution to a double or triple helix. This was clearly a message that our DNA will be or is changing through 2012.

This dark rift or black hole has an estimated mass of one trillion stars and creates an enormously strong gravitational field. Because it is so massive, it spins incredibly fast which causes the Galactic plane to be reportedly thin causing our galaxy to have its spiral shape. On December 21 st 2012 we will be aligned into the center of this dark rift. Much has been written about the forecast of 2012 cataclysmic and transfor- mative events. There are many views and opinions speculating on what it all means. After extensive and thorough research, this book offers an accurate portrayal of upcoming events. First, it is important to note that the foundation of the events and transforma- tion provided here is based on scientific research — ancient Sumerian re- cords of past planet Nibiru fly bys and the Mayan Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. These align with the period of December 21 st 2012 and the end date of the Mayan Calendar. This time period also parallels with inter- pretations of many assorted historical legends, numerological constructions, prophecies, and warnings of the Indigenous peoples around the world — including the Aztec, Mayan and Hopi Indians, the ancient Sumerians, Edgar Cayce, Bible revelations and extraterrestrial crop circles warnings. It is diffi- cult to dispute the facts. (See crop circles) Our solar system completes a full cycle through the zodiac or procession of the equinox every 25,800 years. On December 21 st 2012 it will be the end of this cycle as our sun will again rise in a direct alignment with the dark rift, or center of the Milky Way galaxy — like it did 25,800 years ago. This dark rift is also known as the black hole — Cosmic Mother.

This transformation aligns with the evolutionary galactic acceleration that has been morphing for years now and with it, a feeling of time flying by and spiritual oneness and a deeper seeking of truth. Part of the population is aligning itself with the vibrations of love and light energy as we evolve from \"the 3 rd dimension\" through the 4 th and into the 5 th dimension. December 21 st 2012 is the gateway through this transformation and the purification time for Mother Earth. Based on the data and facts, this purification will be within the realm of a catastrophic event with a pole shift and other occurrences mentioned in this book. After this global purification, the dawning of the new spiritual age will manifest and the new age and calendar will begin. As we move closer to 2012, the negativity bubbles up as we hit barriers in many aspects in our lives that attach to the 3 rd dimensional illusions. Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 The catastrophic reality of 2012 started to scientifically gain attention and momentum back in 1982. This is when NASA noticed a strong pull on the planets of our solar system as they orbited near the constellation Orion. NASA quickly decided to launch an infrared telescope in 1983 and discov- ered a dwarf star constellation. This dwarf (brown) star has 2 moons and 2 planets — one of which is known as the Planet Nibiru or Planet X. The proud astronomers at NASA joyfully announced their finding in 1983 but over the years they discovered that this constellation is on an elliptical orbit around our sun and is now crossing into our solar system. Since this has become apparent NASA has both minimized and denied any concern, how- ever many NASA staff astronomers began leaking photos on You Tube to make the public aware of what is actually coming. There is no doubt this dwarf star constellation is heading our way on a 3600 year elliptical orbit around our Sun. Its projected orbital path may well be between Mars and Jupiter and should arrive in full view in the northern hemisphere by spring 2010. This is not really a new event as the ancient Sumerians have wit- nessed this eerie occurrence in the past and documented it in historical writ- ten records. They claimed that planet Nibiru and its super race of alien be- ings first came to Earth as Gods some 200,000 years ago during the planet Nibiru fly by. The records coincide with many other ancient records that mention the cycle and the cataclysms that occurred. Historically pole shifts have come to pass over 171 times, with scientific evidence of volcanic lava flows changing direction after the magnetic north shifted. 2012 is the Armageddon or “End Times” and the transformation to a higher collective light consciousness and what needs to be done on the earth plane for this regeneration to happen. This transformation is also part of a shift in awareness that has taken countless civilizations and ages of evolution to manifest. We are now living during a special time in our evolution. On the physical level our Mother Earth is about to realign the poles with a “pole shift”. This will bring destruction and catastrophes similar to what Atlantis experienced but it is also a purification period and life will go on and we will rebuild a new Earth and create the Golden Age. On the spiritual level the 2012 transformation will allow the Golden Age of enlightenment to be established as the forces of light and darkness com- plete the battle of Armageddon. Fortunately, the “good guys” will win, and the 1,000 year peace of the Golden Age will be established on Earth. It is important to remember that 2012 is the beginning of the new age and spiritual transformation. It is a \"consciousness shift\" from the 3 rd dimension human awareness into the 5 th dimension of collective light consciousness. It is a time when all the battles of the past will dissolve into a higher aware- ness of our Mother Earth, each other, and the historical connection to the stars. Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 Sun Spots The picture on the right shows the sky alignment on December 21, 2012 — the end date of the Mayan calendar. On that day the Earth also aligns with the serpent’s mouth of Ouroboros and the Galactic Centre that harbors a number of potential gamma - ray sources, including a super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy — the dark rift where magnetic in- fluence is enormous. If the gravitational pull of this is not enough for a pole shift, we also have Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun in alignment, as well as Sat- urn, Venus and the Sun in alignment, and not to be out done — Neptune, Mars, and the Sun in alignment. So what is going on? This simultaneous gravitational tug on our Sun would definitely add to the solar storm projec- tions that have been said to be 30 – 50% stronger than normal in 2012. On July 31, 2006 a reverse polarity sunspot was spotted that gave birth to the next maximum solar cycle #24. This emerging cycle, combined with our planet’s declining magnetic field, may have severe consequences for Earth in terms of climate, electrical grid systems, human behavior, and pole shift- ing. This solar cycle occurs when the Sun goes into its maximum emissions period. The peak of this increased activity and cycle will correspond with 2012. Given the Earth’s weakening magnetic field at this time, this could be very significant with major sun spot eruptions on the Sun starting up again and especially when the December 21, 2012 alignments are taking place. To appreciate the dangers we should first understand that the bubble of pro- tective magnetism that surrounds the Earth from solar wind is called the magnetosphere. Historically, this magnetic field deflects most of the Suns particles into a circular path around the Earth. Solar wind and flares can change rapidly like our weather found here on Earth. Strange events are the result. Earth's magnetic field has been weakening, and our magnetic field has become far more unpredictable over the past 20 years. NASA's spacecraft have revealed a break in the Earth's magnetic field — 10 times larger than previously thought. So when this happens we are in un- Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95 charted territory, as solar wind can flow in through the breach for powerful geomagnetic storms. Best case scenario would be a total disruption to our telecommunications and weather patterns — worst case is the pole shift as predicted by many, includ- ing top scientists. After a reverse sunspot was noticed, David Hatha- way, a solar physicist at the Marshall Space Flight in Huntsville, Alabama said: \"A backward sunspot is a sign that the next solar cycle is beginning.\" Hatha- way explained: “Sunspots are planet - sized magnets created by the Sun's inner magnetic dynamo. Like all magnets in the universe, sunspots have north (N) and south (S) magnetic poles. According to NASA the sunspot of July 31 st popped up at solar longi- tude 65° W, latitude 13° S. Sunspots in that area are normally oriented N - S. However this one was S - N, opposite the norm. This tiny spot of backward- ness foretells a really big solar cycle that will peak around 2012. This is above and beyond all the Galactic alignments happening at the time. He also explains that solar activity rises and falls in 11 - year cycles, swinging back and forth between times of calm and storms. NASA planners and sat- ellite operators are bracing for the next solar cycle, expected to be the stormiest in decades. When these sunspots and solar flares return, danger- ous proton storms in space and bright auroras on Earth will push the Earth’s protective but weakening shields to the max. NASA scientists have also warned the protective bubble around the sun that helps to shield the Earth from harmful interstellar radiation is shrinking and getting weaker. New data has revealed the heliosphere; the protective shield of energy surrounding our solar system; has weakened by 25% over the past decade and is now at it’s lowest level in 50 years. Without the heliosphere the harmful intergalactic cosmic radiation would make life on Earth almost impossible by destroying DNA and making our climate uninhabitable. So what will happen in 2012 when the sun spots hit their peak and a dwarf star the size of Jupiter: with its constellation, orbits past the Earth and our Sun? This dwarf star is about 8 times the size of our Earth with a huge gravitational and energetic significance — not only pulling opposite against our Earth rotation, but magnetically battling our Sun as well. We also have the Galactic Alignment with the dark rift as well as the Sun’s gravitational alignment with the planets mentioned. This will increase solar activity well beyond what is mentioned by NASA and maybe even a baked Earth sce- nario in parts of the world. (See Prophecies) Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 Pole Shift Many of us wonder whether or not pole shifts will really happen. Something to ponder when posing this question, is to ask why the hairy mammoths in Siberia were flash - frozen with tropical vegetation in their mouths thousands of years ago, and tropical vegetation found under layers of ice in Antarctica? The Earth is exceptionally magnetic. The crust achieves its opposite mag- netic charge via the electro - magnetic currents created by its different spin ratio and the enormous gravitational field of the moon also helps to hold the crust in its rotational axis. Our magnetic poles are currently several hundred kilometers from true north and south, and at an accelerated rate over the past 10 years they’ve been changing their positions. Pilots now need to adjust their navigational instruments almost daily when proceeding to regions of the north or south pole. This means that the Earth’s axis has a slight gyroscopic \"wobble\" which may also be a sign of the Earth’s core spinning faster than the crust. Could this be the beginning signal of an impend- ing pole shift coming our way? Interestingly, shifts are not so rare in the big picture, as the magnetic poles have skipped around the world 171 known times — each with cataclysms included. Noah’s Arc, the sinking of Atlantis and other past great civilizations were wiped out. What effects will this galactic alignment with the dark rift, and a dwarf star constellation the size of Jupiter zooming by Earth’s orbit with its two moons and two planets in tow, have on the Earth? The passing Dwarf Star (Planet Nibiru) grips the Atlantic Rift magnetically, so the Earth does not turn past this grip until the constellation passes and loses the grip. This is solid sci- ence and is cause for great concern to our civilization, but NASA is not talk- ing about it. NASA scientists recently projected the Sun's magnetic fields will be extremely strong with extra violent magnetic solar storm activity — up to 50% stronger than normal during 2012. This will happen with the magnetic poles of the Earth — already in decline and steadily weakening. Is it all really just coincidence or is 2012 the year everything seems to be- coming to a conclusion? I personally feel; without question; this pole shift is coming — based on all the different factors and information available. The New Earth If it is off by one or all the factors mentioned, the pole shift would be sudden: taking about an hour with the Earth’s rotation stopping for a few days or a week: during which time extreme stress will build between the Earth’s crust and its core — along with major climate changes and super storms. This shift and stoppage has happened many times before. It has been written in his- Changing pole stars — pole shift Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97 tory and recorded in indigenous folklore worldwide as “the long day or the long night”. This would make sense since the Earth stops rotating for a while. During a pole shift we can expect many ma- jor events to happen that will change the ge- ography, and all life, as we know it. When the earth stops rotating during a pole shift, many cataclysmic events occur. Major vol- canic and seismic disturbances, super wind storms, displacement of water with two mile high Tsunamis or water displacements on coastal areas, Subduction of landmasses and mountain ranges, new land masses and, disappearing land masses. Severe electrical storms, super tornadoes, nuclear fallout from facilities not shut down in time, and Hurri- canes with land winds in excess of 400 miles per hour. This unfolding comes in a few stages. First, as the crust separates from the core, the vibration would start, then over just a few minutes the crust along with the core will start to slide and find it’s new location. During this slide, massive water displacement in the form of tsunamis or tidal waves will move over the Earth covering the coastlines and moving inland 300 - 500 miles. This happens as the earth spins and then stops: the water will continue to move, as it is fluid and separate from the landmass. Pole Shift of 16 degrees Galactic Alignment"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 Then as the Earth’s core aligns it will settle, but the solid Earth’s crust will proceed slowly on until it settles into its new alignment. This is when and where massive earthquakes occur and mountain building starts. Mountain Building Mountain building hap- pens quickly during rapid subduction of one plate under another — not just along the tectonic plates. There is a friction be- tween the plates where crumbling of the upper or softer plate occurs. Crumbling relates to pressure and release, and can result in aggres- sive jolting and upheav- als that create new cliffs or protruding rock, and rock slides from nearby mountains. Those holding - on will be heaved skyward, with barely a safe place to cling to. Subduction releases pressure by pushing peels of land up- ward and forward that separate from the lower levels. This sudden thrust happens with the rock shelves, cliffs and projectiles crashing down. Com- pressed rock can also move horizontally into nearby space or land not al- ready occupied by anything as solid. This said, those in a valley can: without warning, find rock shooting out of hillsides, and rock spears shooting up un- der their feet. Additionally, when two plates collide, one plate may be pushed under the other — raising magma from the mantle that will form dan- gerous and violent volcanoes. As a result, the mountain building process in mountain valleys or near young mountain ranges is precarious, and overall not a good place to be.

But history states that relationship was misused and corrupted similar to today’s world. It was the misuse of the blessings that brought on the destruction of those past civilizations along with the karmic reaction and journey created by those ac- tions.

There will be major Earth shifts and changes, and likely alien contact, along with the fall of the social and political systems, and the unrest that directly follows.

These records contain all knowledge of human and universal ex- perience, and the history of the vast universes. They are metaphorically de- picted as a library or \"universal computer hard drive\" or the \"Book of Life and Mind of God\". These universal records are updated with each thought or action and can be accessed through different levels of spiritual aware- ness or astral projection. It is this connection that allows the great prophets such as Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus and others to access the future. Michael Newton an hypnotherapist and author of \"Journey of Souls\" & \"Destiny of Souls, Evidence of Life between Lives\" has many accounts of the Akashic Record, or working with subjects in deep states of unconscious- ness. He witnessed that before souls are incarnated, they go to a cosmic “library” to view the pages associated with the lives they choose to enter in order to evolve. The pages are not in an actual “physical” book and are ethereal as opposed to physical text. It appeared that although there may be definitive waypoints along the course of our lives, our free will can change our paths, events and out- comes. As the soul prepares for a life with the intent of learning a particular lesson or satisfying a karmic debt, the soul will also choose a family and a body that will help them with the lessons for this incarnation. For many, some of those images of the book survive \"birth amnesia\" and become our intuition that serves us during our lives. There is also a soul mate or guard- ian angel that may help guide our intuitions.

So as our state of awareness evolves beyond the current chains of the 3 rd dimension, we will be able to influence our history, and this will become the reality not the exception. Transformation Edgar Cayce – “ now is the time of which the Archangel Gabriel spoke. Our planet will change. Our bodies will change. The people of the earth will be changed. A new world is going to begin, transforming us for the long awaited new age.” We have chosen a very special time to be born, and as we enter into the cusp of 2012 and beyond, a wonderful new age of spiritual transformation will manifest. This is where the lower levels of human awareness are morph- ing into the higher universal spiritual light consciousness . This metamor- phous is taking place on many levels — mostly beyond the realm of human intellectual comprehension. The crop circles above are messages from the higher light consciousness of this impending transformation. The left circle is our evolving DNA and the right one is the human butterfly that represents the transformation or metamorphosis in the Mayan and Aztec mythology. This circle is over 500 x 400 meters in area, appearing overnight. The impending age is all about transformation and understanding of our new found place within the universal consciousness. We are indeed evolving our frequency and vibration to a level where we may reside along with other more evolved life forms within the light based universal consciousness. The frequency of time is speeding up (or collapsing) and the planets of the solar system also have been heating up. The heartbeat of the Earth or Schumann pulse has been 7.83 cycles per second for ages, and was a very reliable reference. Now the military states our global heartbeat has been rising slowly since 1980. It is now over 12 cycles per second; creating the feeling that our day is only 16 hours instead of the 24 hours we are used to. But, is time really moving by faster? Yes it is! This change is being arbitrated from the centre of our galaxy the Hunab Ku, and everybody on this planet is mu- tating. Some are more conscious of it than others.

There is a beginning and an end to all things but there is a renewal at the end of the time cycle. The Mayas also believe Hunab Ku created time and controls it. So it is very difficult to simply dismiss the Mayan Cosmology as they left remarkable evidence that their \"time keeping” wisdom produced extremely accurate results. The current civilization inhabiting the Earth has been one living with a dark social disease that has infected most aspects of our planetary vibration and global society. It has allowed the displacement and detachment of our spiri- tual roots and has disenfranchised the relationship we have with the Mother Earth and our spiritual path. This is our addiction to the illusion of money or power rather than evolving our spiritual union with universal light conscious- ness. It is true many great masters and teachers have incarnated to warn and guide us back toward the light but to little avail as we continued to mis- represent their words and allow dogmas while walking a path of disillusion- ment and ego. The more we lost touch, the more we polluted and disre- spected our Mother Earth — the provider of physical life. We were led into, worshiped and followed religious dogmas that led us further off the path of spiritual truth. We allowed leaders that represent the Illuminati and social elite, and continually exercise forms of warring barbarism that is anti God, and will not merge with the enlightened future of the 5 th dimensional plane. Our civilization has taken the road of a dark social karma similar to the road of past civilizations that ended in cataclysms as the distance between the spiritual reality of evolution and the ego expanded. In doing so, we have turned away from the evolutionary path of enlightenment and basic laws of universal dharma. Our modern collective ego has allowed us to hear only that which we want to hear, feeding us false knowledge, attachments and conditionings to put us to sleep and appease our taste for social falsehoods that have been so easily consumed within the bubble of our illusions. This is a direct result of projecting our lowly evolved free will, instead of finding the innocence, wisdom and humility needed to find and stay connected with the divine elements of creation. So now comes the period of the great regeneration — the clearing and oppor- tunity for new spiritual awareness. The 2012 universal transformation has started, and is casting a light on the darkness within ourselves and our global society while allowing spiritual awareness and evolution to manifest. As our society becomes spiritually aware, this light is shared and the collec- tive frequency will eventually change the vibrations of the collective compre- hension. Falsehoods of the past will no longer be accepted and the pattern of indulging the diseases of the lower self will no longer be accepted. This is the only way out of the cycle of earthly cataclysms that come our way every 10,000 years or so. As we change our collective vibration and evolve the power of our divinity, we will be protecting ourselves. This is similar to how a great Rishi or spiritual master easily merges with and controls the universal forces of nature: such as weather in the jungles of India.

Age of Aquarius The Golden Age of enlightenment is upon us, and with the “holy water” of the ages, the water bearer of Aquarius awakens the awareness of the seek- ers of the universal light consciousness. Every 2160 years, the constellation: visible on the early morning of the spring equinox, changes. In western as- trological terms, this means the end of one astrological age (Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (Age of Aquarius). Over the course of 25,800 years, this procession of the equinoxes makes one full circuit around the ecliptic or the full 12 signs of the zodiac. All prophecies say that the thou- sand year peace will begin after 2012 as we enter the Age of Aquarius. On a vibratory level this is also the time for the transformation of our conscious- ness into the realm of higher light awareness of the 5 th dimension. Sacred Geometry Sacred geometry is the metaphysical science of mathematical ratios, harmonics and proportion found in music, light, architecture, art, and cos- mology.

By analyzing the personality of these patterns, forms and relation- ships of interconnectiveness, insight may evolve into the mysteries, laws and tradition of the universal science of the light consciousness. It is also understood as we deepen our understanding toward the universal laws of sacred pattern recognition, that communication with extraterrestrial beings will be established and we will advance our understanding of sound and symbols to a level beyond the 3 rd dimension. The 3rd Dimension The fundamental principles that operate in the outer universe are known by modern science as the natural laws. In our 3 rd dimension, the four ancient elements (earth, water, air, fire) pervades our earth plane existence. But there are subtler laws that rule the metaphysical spiritual planes within the realm of spirit consciousness — as all true nature of matter exists within these laws. There is a massive transformation currently taking place as we approach 2012. Through a massive galactic shift of the universal conscious- ness and pure light energy, our 3 rd dimension awareness is expanding through to the subtler 5 th dimension. This shift is what is causing the stress and anxiety for many as they try to hold on to the illusions of the 3 rd dimen- sion. The unstable and disintegrating structures of our former 3rd dimension are no longer enough to hold our lives and world together. Through 2012 Mother Earth will also be making her transition by clearing the negativity of the past while setting the stage for the enlightened Age of Aquarius . The reality is the galactic shift is part of a divine evolution into the next realm of consciousness: hence holding on to the illusions and attachments of the 3 rd dimension will only cause anxiety and fatigue. As the higher self manifests, we will come to recognize all that exists in this 3 rd dimension is of a lower evolved reality, but as one evolves into the next realm of consciousness — a metamorphous occurs. This transition was his- torically done though Kundalini awakening or spiritual meditation. This is where the awakened spiritual energy rises and spirit transcends ( self reali- zation ) the boundaries of the earth plane (3 rd dimension ) transferring through the 4 th into the 5 th dimension. This is where time and space is be- yond the others and is functionally very different from any of the spatial di- mensions we have intellectually known before .

Throughout the ages, most schools of wisdom have taught that our true spiritual potential and higher purpose involved evolving into the next level of spiritual evolution — the realm of divine light. This divine light realm consists of much subtler vibrations than we experience in the gross level of the physical realm. This omnipresent spiritual light consciousness resides within all matter, forms and manifestations. It imbibes the purest love and flows gently though all dimensions of time - space. It is not a concept or an intellectual particle that can be manipulated or contemplated. It is what is — and whether we un- derstand its origin or not, it does not matter. What matters is that we search out that quiet place within, that will allow the peace and balance to open the doorway to the realm where the light resides. Once this door opens, we jour- ney beyond the realm of self, and one will attract the qualities of humility and innocence as the eternal child within manifests.

When we were born the energy of the light and stars imprinted our DNA; astrologically speaking; for the physical life journey at hand — as all things are interconnected via energetic sacred geometric patterns of light con- sciousness. The universe in reality is a vast field of life interconnected and watered by the prime creator — using pure love and light. We have taken our birth at this time because we wish to master the evolutionary process, and be able to dwell in the higher densities.

There are a multi- tude of cultures and societies existing in space as their has been through the many ages of humankind here on mother earth. Our planet has layers of energy grids and cosmic doorways. The main pur- pose of the Mayan knowledge was to help lift these time locks. Time travel also exists.

They are part hu- man and part reptilian — they evolve in the lower density and are a direct seed line to the Illuminati. They promote a satanic agenda to be worshiped by those of us who do not have the divine discretion to understand our true connection to the light consciousness. These alien gods are the master ge- neticists, that two to three hundred thousand years ago, played a key role in our evolution by dismantling (turning off) all but our basic DNA — leaving only the double helix. This earthly quarantine allowed humankind little control of the light frequency receptors (chakras) and limited our connection to the uni- versal light consciousness — isolating us from the living library of the uni- verse and hiding our true history.

We have the power of Free Will and it is important that we do not give away our authority or our powers. We must also be responsible for our actions and words: because it is much easier to manifest what we believe and project during this transformation. During this time of great revealing, not only will the dark past be revealed, but present day dogmas, belief systems and false teachings, will also be exposed. So it is important that we let go of the old concepts of money and spiritual dogmas. The new golden age is all about releasing ones self from the bondage that prevents flow to the light and knowledge of the higher frequency. It is important to know that when we face the dark or shadows within ourselves, we are creating an opportunity for liberation from the lower self as our “thought creates” and manifests our reality. This power will become manifest as the 2012 transformation occurs.

We are truly magnificent beings. Members of the vast family of light — born into the earth realm to help create this shift: because love is the key to our universe. Our technology will only allow evolution to grow so far. When one is focused on ego or self, the vibration and frequency is only able to go so far and then its evolution ends. There is only so much that can be achieved within this 3D density. This is the case of the lower density extraterrestrials. Because of their technologies, the Anunnaki have been looked upon as Gods throughout our dark history. Humans, on the other hand, evolve — as love is the key that opens the doorway to the infinite universal light con- sciousness: where all possibilities of expansion exist. We are a beautiful and perfect reflection of the Prime Creator, the Maha Devi (mother goddess) of Vedic lore. It is all one source of light with different names. To grow deeply into our true potential, we must understand who we are and our connection to the light. Humility, meditation, wisdom, divine knowledge and discretion, will help open the 2012 doorway to the higher self. Then when we embrace the Prime Creator, the earth mother will open up the liv- ing library connection to all life forms: as all life forms have chakras inte- grated with the light.

The 5 th di- mension and beyond is the eternal “now” that allows this reality to exist. Cy- cles of our 3 rd dimensional day and night are only perfunctory markers of the cycles, but have no real effect or power over the present moment. This all means that what we feel and experience in the present moment is thought- less awareness — the true reality of self. The past and the future have no relevance in this state of spiritual thoughtlessness, and until we ascend into the 5 th dimensional plane where past, present and future are integrated as one moment beyond time and space, we are unable to understand the con- nection we have with the universal light consciousness. It is beyond thought and the limited human intellect. As we evolve our attention through the pre- sent moment and into the next dimensional level or spiritual plane of life, our connection to light consciousness will allow us to expand into the farthest reaches of the universe — beyond time - space. This period of our Earth’s history and civilization is coming to an end in 2012, but the Golden Age that follows will allow an evolution into the higher light awareness. This will transform our physical understanding into the higher spiritual self that vibrates at the higher frequency of the universal light consciousness. This transformation is the foundation of the new Aquarian or Golden Age, and the 1000 - year peace. It will allow us to get back in tune with our Mother Earth and our connection to self - healing, natural herbs, crystals and solar power while respecting the life force energy as Children of the Light — evolving our destiny back to the garden. The Alpha and the Omega of our collective journey, the garden where only the light of the spirit will evolve, leaving the darkness of greed, ego, power and false knowledge fighting for the illusions they create. Spiritual Evolution"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 Omkar — OM The OM or A - U - M is the primary mantra in the an- cient Vedic traditions (pranava mantra) and the most sacred symbol in Hinduism. It represents the sound of creation and the three deities in the Hindu trinity, in Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The vibration of the A - U - M represents the three as- pects of the totality of creation. OM is also a man- tra in Buddhism but without the Vedic deities. Buddhists believe OM is the primal vibration from which everything was created and into which eve- rything returns at the end of the great cosmic cycle. The ancient sages and Rishi believed our universe was created by the divine thought of the Adi Shakti ( primordial cosmic feminine energy ). The OM represents an advanced form of Cymantic vibration frequency, which fuses thought into light matter, then sound. The sound then manifests as a sacred geometric life force creating matter. The OM frequency is also about merging three primordial powers, which manifest as “A,U,M”. The “A” is the power of pure desire, and represents the beginning, start and emanation of the universe and life. It is also the waking consciousness (jagrat), conditioned by time and space. The “U” is the power of action and represents the sustenance of the uni- verse, its in the middle between creation and destruction. It also represents the Dreaming Consciousness (svapna) with the subconscious mind, pre- dominating the awareness. The “M” is the power of evolution and represents the ending, destruction, and death of life and the universe, life is also the power of regeneration or rebirth. It also represents the Dreamless Sleep (nidra), which is a deep sleep state without any disturbance of dreams. “A,U,M” in its fullness, is the divine sound of crea- tion through to its eventual destruction. It repre- sents all living things, from the microcosm to the macrocosm that have a connection to the light, or source frequency of creation. Our Mother Earth is fully alive within this frequency, and vibrates at the tone of the OM frequency. This is why when we visit the forests of nature we subtlety feel the OM vibrating through us, as it allows for peace, still- ness and balance to manifest within our being. This generates the feeling of relaxation, and the connection we experience with nature.

The four Vedas are the continued manifestation of this Adi Sangeet that combined vocal music, instrumen- tal music and classical dance. The evolution of the core teachings of the Vedas, Upanishads and the melodic Sanskrit language, are just an extension of “OM” and the evolution of the Adi Sangeet on this physical plane. The OMKAR manifests within the Adi Sangeet (primordial trinity of divine music) though which the Adi Shakti handed down this blessing to Lord Brahma. It was then destined to humankind, and through our spiritual evolution, it eventually manifested with the great enlightened Rishi, Munis and Sages of ancient times. These great masters tuned into the frequency of mother earth and the vibration of universal divine love (OM) to manifest the beginnings of divine music on earth, thus developing the foundation to the Vedas. Vibrations The belief of many cultures is that “The Word” of God created life, and the cosmos. Translated it means; the pure desire manifested pure thought “divine will” into a form of light frequency or vibration that transformed our surroundings into a form of physical mass or matter. Vibrations exist on all levels or planes of existence; they can be subtler fre- quencies or grosser dependant on the source. The difference between the various planes of existence is that vibrations become subtler and purified more with each level achieved. They also represent a pathway or connec- tion between all things in multiple dimensions of time, space, light and sound energy. It seems many people place their faith in their physical senses, trusting only what they see, hear, touch, smell and taste in the 3rd dimension. In doing so, they do not feel the subtly of vibrations, and disconnect to their psychic faculties, and close off the connection to the higher, but subtler self - awareness principals. When we become subtle in our awareness we under- stand vibrations exist and transcend the present, as well as the past and future, crossing into the realm of the ethers and Akashic. The more evolved the soul, the subtler the vibration frequencies, and the dimensions the soul can travel to, or attain. This understanding helps us to realize that time, as we know it does not control the universal patterns of multi dimensional travel or evolution. It is the subtle self, the innocence of pure vibrational light frequency. So as we evolve our awareness into the higher level of our evolution, we will fuse with the pure light frequency con- sistent with the next realm of our spiritual evolution.

A good metaphor is to imagine that the chakra is a lampshade, and the Atman or spirit is the light that gives essence to the vibration of the chakra. The Atman or spirit light shines through the koshas, and takes on the colorings of karmic residue and vibration frequency of the thought, action or the lifetime good or bad. The goal is to become more and more subtle which allows attunement to the higher light frequencies. The Atman has been best described as “indescribable”. The self realization of yoga meditation experienced in the ancient traditions is to become thoughtlessly aware, as this will allow the light of the divine love to connect with and imbibe ones body, mind and soul in all aspects of life. Yoga — Union There are many kinds of yoga everywhere today, but the practice of pure classical yoga dates back to the Upanishads, 5000 – 1000 BC. The yogis encouraged union with the finite jiva (transitory self) and with the infinite Brahman (Sanskrit: to grow). The great Yogis and Rishi taught that every- thing is part of this divine universal light energy and the physical postures were just one aspect of the pure Yoga of spiritual attunement. This new Golden or Aquarian age of yoga beyond 2012 allows the transfor- mation from the human being into the spiritual being. It is important that as the 2012 global shift manifests, we understand it is our karmic responsibility to find our yoga (union) with mother earth and the universal light conscious- ness through awakening our spiritual source. This is important in order to positively affect the global vibration and raise its frequency to balance our civilizations karmic debt and minimize the cataclysms of 2012. The proces- sional galactic cycle is ending and we need to attune with the vibrations of the universal light consciousness as it is through this atonement to our yoga that we will best understand what is truly coming our way via the earth changes and transformation. Spiritual Transformation There are numerous astral planes of light and life within the universal con- sciousness that vibrate beyond our 3 rd dimensional world — a place where the past and future exist in their own “now” on parallel planes of existence. With the 2012 transformational and dimensional shift, we will finally see the previously closed gateways to the stars open up and our earthly quarantine lifted. This transformational shift is already happening and vibrating faster each day as 2012 approaches. Untrue relationships are ending and the de- sire for a more spiritual atonement and understanding is calling. These changes are happening on many levels.

It appears that the vi- brational frequency is increasing within the galaxy as the galactic alignment of December 21 st 2012 approaches. This shift or change will affect all aspects of our 3 rd dimensional world as we know it. This will transcend our Kundalini en- ergy through the Sahasrara chakra (crown) into the 5 th dimension of light con- sciousness — birthing a new awareness. This is the true “born again” prophesied but misunderstood through erroneous dogmatic religious interpretations. During this shift or transition, what we believe and where we put our atten- tion will greatly determine how we position ourselves during the 2012 trans- formation . Now is the time we must stop and be in “yoga” (union) within to hear all that is being communicated to us through the light consciousness, as this information will protect and tune our awareness to the profound ap- proaching changes. This is a beautiful convergence into a higher harmonic frequency and a new vibratory awareness that allows a reconnection with our ancient spiritual history and our Mother Earth. It is the birth of our spiri- tual evolution and the quantum leap into the realm of the light conscious- ness and reconnection with our creator. This frequency shift or vibrational change appears to align with the theory that our unused DNA does not code proteins. Many researchers now be- lieve this is where we will attach our currently unused abilities such as teleki- nesis, teleportation, clairvoyance, telepathy and others. The “Human Genome Project” has revealed that our DNA is not genetically set. Only 10% of the human DNA is used for coding and for reproduction of proteins. The rest, approximately 90%, is referred to as junk DNA, which scientists say is confused and unnecessary to our body. This was the norm until renowned Russian Dr. Pjotr Garjajev of the Human Genome Project, revealed the junk DNA is actually our link to the deeper realms of our spiritu- ality. This would explain the DNA messages of the crop circles where bro- ken DNA images are shown to evolve in a sequence of crop circles, trans- forming into double and triple helix DNA. As 2012 nears, this DNA transfor- mation will help plug us into the full 12 chakras of the 5 th dimension.

There is a deep knowledge and dharma associated with the yoga passed down from ancient times. So one must be careful of the boundaries of today’s modern physical yoga and not confuse it with spiritual awakening. To indulge the ego and illusions of the lower self becomes a false understanding of the pure aspects of our true spiritual evolution. Too many times during our history we have allowed the lower self to dictate pol- icy on our spiritual assent creating the justified dogmas of religious beliefs and their hierarchy. To become enlightened or a master, one be must “Be” enlightened or a master, we cannot buy a certificate or take a course that tells us we are. When we try to attach a business sign or certificate to enlightenment, it loses its essence and purity and becomes just another re- cycled dogma with a new paint job. The ancient yoga tradition mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Gita, re- fers to three kinds of classic yoga. According to the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, the purpose of yoga (union) is to lead to a silent mind. This silence is the starting point for the mind to accurately and objectively reflect reality without its own distortions of ego and conditionings that surround us daily and through our lives. Physical yoga does not create the reality of pure spirit, which is above the mind, but only prepares the mind to evolve into to it. This is done by assisting in the exchange of a mind full of thoughts and desires, to a still mind that may then access the next level of thoughtless awareness and spiritual attainment. However, this depends on where the attention is. The great masters have aligned themselves with the knowledge of attain- ment through their teachings and deep traditions. This transition from hu- man being to spiritual being is established through introspection, detach- ment and release of the earthly conditionings while using the subtle system of Chakras and their principals of dharma to connect to and guide to our deeper awareness. Subtle System — Yoga"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131 The universe within is a beautiful interconnecting network of nerves and sensory organs that decodes the outside physical world. There is also a subtle system of Nadis and centers of energy (Chakras), which monitor our physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual energy. Depending on our state of spiritual alignment, we can connect to the universal collective of love and divine light energy through understanding this subtle universe within and how it connects to the divine. The path to self - realization (true yoga) or union is to gradually move inward to experience the balance and purity of divine love at the eternal center of our consciousness. One cannot evolve spiritually through the (left side) Pin- gala Nadi — moon side/past/emotions — nor can we evolve through the (right side) Ida Nadi — sun side/future/planning. Nor can we evolve through books or our mental intellect. To evolve spiritually we must find peace and balance in the center or present moment so the Kundalini can rise up through the center path of evolution (Susmina Nadi) and establish the true yoga and connection to the universal light consciousness. As one passes through the limitations of the lower levels of self, ego and attachments and balances the attention, then the 'Sahasrara' or 7 th chakra will awaken to nirvana and self - realization will be experienced. At this stage one knows we are all part of the universal light of divine consciousness, and awakens to the subtle aspects of the divine, deities and angels. Chakra The name Chakra comes from the Sanskrit word meaning “spinning wheel”. There are 12 Chakras, 7 of the physical body and another 5 above, that allow ascension to the higher dimensional planes as we evolve beyond the 3 rd dimension. These spinning energy wheels rotate at a divine frequency, acting as the transducer of the pure universal divine love (light) energy (God) as it enters and merges through the human physical form. This divine energy moves through the chakra system manifest- ing into the physical body through the meridi- ans known as Nadis. These Nadis also corre- spond to the energy meridians used in the ancient Chinese medicine tradi- tions. Each chakra is designed to supervise and maintain the perfect opera- tion of the spiritual and physical bodily systems under its control. This purifi- cation is done by spinning in pure or positive vibrations, and spinning out impure or negative ones. Each chakra also imbibes a different quality and aspect of the divine (Deity) as it spins and vibrates in tune with the divine Subtle System — Yoga"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 frequency of universal pure love and the dharma. An enlightened being will manifest the blessings of the divine power with all the Chakras spinning in harmony and in tune with the universal vibration of pure divine love. As the person advances their spiritual aspirations through meditation and light work, the vibration of the chakra will change to a higher frequency creating a pure light energy or white light aura. This enlightened state was manifest within the great saints, masters and sages like the Christ consciousness of Jesus and the great Buddha. Contrarily, the “un - dharmic” life creates blockages and karmic residue debt and this imbalance causes disorders to manifest as the Chakras spin out of balance and out of the divine frequency that vibrate with the universal “OM”. This creates the “hell” within as the residue of negative actions is taken on as karma or vibrational residue, and will affect our frequency when we pass from the human physical form, into the ethereal state of spirit. Our Chakras also correlate directly to the Mother Earth’s energy vortexes and grids that appear around the earth and through the universe. Places like Sedona Arizona and pyramid centers are some of the grids and portals of the universal consciousness that connect to the Earth. It is all intercon- nected, from the microcosm of the cell of the body, to the macrocosm of the universes; it is all one life force. Just as the body has bacteria and virus in- fections that affect the body, the universe also has lower evolved life forms that affect its flow. So as 2012 approaches we should look at the earth from a galactic point of view, and how in our current state of evolution, we affect other planets and life forms on a vibrational level.

This is felt as a peaceful \"fountain\" of the divine all knowing awareness and coolness. The Kundalini is interconnected with the universal feminine power of Adi Shakti.

A spiritual Puja is a very powerful way to cleanse our surroundings, and ourselves since the Puja awakens the deity and manifests its love and power, destroy- ing negativity while leaving a resonance of beautiful vibrations. From a spiritual perspective a Puja ceremony should not be conducted for personal means but to express our love, devotion and surrender to the di- vine light of universal consciousness. The Puja is also a deeper formal way of doing meditation to imbibe the qualities of the deity or the divine while de- claring one's surrender and faith to the universal love and divine light. Symbolically the Puja will represent one of the various deities, or goddesses like Shri Lakshmi or Shri Ganesha in particular.

Kumkum and turmeric powder: Red is the color of Shri Ganesha. The red powder also stands for our emotions or for our inner wisdom. The turmeric powder stands for our inner purity and on the negative side, for our inner pride and egoism. Prasad: When we offer our ignorance to the divine, it is suffused with knowl- edge and light. The word \"Prasad\" is a combination of two words, \"pra\" + \"sad\" — that which is near life and truth. The food that is offered to the divine is a symbolic representation of the gross human body into which the worship the divine breathes new life and new light. When we share the Prasad with others, we share the love, discretion and knowledge we collectively gained during the Puja.

It is from this place we can become our own guru and master, and empower the light that guides our spiritual evolution. Too many times we look for spiritual answers of guidance from others instead of going inward, and connecting to the source of our light. Part of the problem preventing our assent to higher consciousness has been the attachment to the idol, or symbols of idol worship. These consist of false gurus or teach- ings, dogmatic religious beliefs, and even some of our movie or sports stars. What ever divides or distracts us from our direct connection to the divine light consciousness is anti - God. When we shift our attention to third party idols or gurus instead of going inward, we lose touch with our own discretion and our connection to the divine consciousness. Our spirit is part of the uni- versal light consciousness; so we must trust and develop this connection. There really is no fast food or quick way to spirituality, we will never find our truth by looking into someone else’s mind or reading their books. Although in the beginning it is nice to formulate an understanding based on many opinions, however, we then need to go inward. In the western world we hear of so many masters, but who are the masters? A fee paid, earning a certifi- cate will not create a spiritual master. Just as wearing a Mercedes Benz logo around your neck does not make you a car. So which Gurus do we trust, and do they really understand the reality of spirit? Or are they just money or power orientated companies, looking to take your innocence and confuse you, based on their own confused reality. The truth is you are the light, you are beautiful, and you are your own Guru and Master. You do not need to follow, as you have the key to the light you seek. Just be wise enough to turn it on, and empower yourself. 108 Names In Sanskrit numerology, the number 108 has a universal vibration and deep spiritual significance as it corresponds to the sacred geometric laws of crea- tion and sustenance. The Indian Subcontinent rosary has a set of 108 man- tra counts. Since ancient times 108 has been a sacred geometric number to the Indian as well as many other spiritual belief systems. The Indians were excellent mathematicians and 108 was thought to have special numerologi- cal significance. Also the Sanskrit alphabet has 54 letters, each with a mas- culine and feminine aspect — Shiva and Shakti. (54 times 2 is 108). Saying a set of mantras 108 times creates vibration. Subtle System — Yoga"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141 Maha Devi — Divine Mother Goddess The Maha Devi is known as the Divine Mother or Audi Shakti, the primordial power of creation. Maha Devi means goddess, and the goddess has many aspects or forms. Adi means “primordial” and Shakti is the “power”. So Adi Shakti means primordial power of God. At the beginning of time only these two aspects existed: God and his Shakti power. With endless love she cre- ated whole universes, which are nothing but a beautiful cloak that Adi Shakti created to make Shiva visible. She is the “Mother Goddess,” the one who dwells in the center of the gal- axy — the power of the creation or mother of all. Unlike what some doctrine may say, the omnipresent Devi has not incarnated in the human form. Seems money or power orientated groups seeking to control followers have wrongfully stated that she exists in human form. Her most familiar mytho- logical forms are the ferocious aspects such as Durga and Kali, or the be- nevolent, such as Parvati. In the aspect of Parvati, she is the feminine as- pect of the holy trinity — Shri Shiva being the masculine or Father, the god of destruction and regeneration — and Shri Ganesha, the son and remover of obstacles. Maha Devi is also the mother of all life on Earth — the gentle divine aspect of nature and life bringing rain and protecting against disease. In reality all are one, and one is all because the light is formless, creation and evolution is both destruction and regeneration.

To meditate, first sit with palms upward and keep attention loose and easy allowing thoughts to flow in and out with out attaching to them. When you become more subtle toward the meditation the Kundalini will awaken and you will begin to feel sensations – tingling, numbness, slight heat – you may feel the Chakras within your fingers. These sensations will tell you where the Chakras blockages are that stem from past lives or current situations and actions. As you deepen in your meditations you will start to feel coolness on your hands. This represents the cool breeze of the holy ghost (Adi Shakti). This also means that the Chakras have cleared and that Kundalini is rising unim- peded. The process can be helped along by the elements of earth, fire, wa- ter and air through various ancient cleansing treatments such as burning camphor, shoe beating, and foot soaking to name just a few. Meditation Meditation is a discipline where one attempts to go beyond the reactive, \"thinking\" mind and into a deeper state of spiritual awareness. Meditation is established on three base levels: (1) Alpha beginner — attention on objects, etc. (2) Beta more advanced — attention on the inner being. (3) Theta the self - realization, enlightened state — where one connects to the all knowing, divine light consciousness becoming thoughtlessly aware. Meditation — Mantras"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145 All levels involve turning attention inward and finding the peace and balance in ones life. One should also try to meditate in the morning and evening as they have different vibration potencies. It is best during the sunrise as we face east to welcome the new day and the earthly mother, and her seven angels into our heart and life. At sunset we meditate facing west as we welcome the heav- enly father, and his seven angels into our heart and dreams. To Meditate First we should sit in silence for a few minutes, and allow all the thoughts of the day to dissipate, if they refuse just ask them to leave and say “not now”. After we settle, put your right hand (action) on our heart, in the heart resides the Spirit and energy of the universal light consciousness. From our heart we should ask the Divine Light Consciousness to imbibe us and then spread out to the whole world. We are connected to the Divine and whatever we desire will happen if we have full confidence from within our self. With eyes closed and palms facing upward we then start our meditation. 1. Put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side, the centre of your Dharma. Here we say — Let me be the light through my dharmic life, through my righteous- ness. Let people see the Dharma by which my enlightenment has become my power and my pure desire to ascend. 2. Take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, of the stomach on the left hand side. The centre of pure knowledge (VOID). Here we will understand Divine Law, and what really is Kundalini and the Charkas. So let the attention be more on the di- vine love than on all the mundane human conditionings and drama. 3. Put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen and close your eyes. Mother Kundalini has given me the awareness to be- come my own Guru and master. Say the affirmation. Let there be no neglect. Let there be dignity in my character. Let there be wisdom in my behavior. Let there be compassion and Love for all things from the cell of the body, to mother earth, to the universal light consciousness. Let me not show my ego, but have a deep divine knowledge about humility and Love. Meditation — Mantras"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 4. Raise your right hand place it on your heart. Here we expand and encompass the whole Universe with my Love, and every mo- ment we should imbibe the beauty of God’s divine pure love.

I will not indulge the falsehood. I will not escape my faults but face them. I will not try to find fault with others, but in my own wisdom for- give. Let my pure love become so great that I understand all life is my family, all is one. Let the feeling that I am part and parcel of the whole imbibe my entire being and attention. 6. Your right hand on your forehead, say: Divine Mother Kundalini I forgive everyone, I forgive myself. 7. Put your right hand on the backside of your head and say here: All I do: I do without ego, I do without attachment, and I do with- out fear, because I am in the attention of the divine light con- sciousness, the heavenly father, and the earthly mother, and all the angels of divine light. 8. Put your hand on the crown of your head and say: Please guide me to the light, let me become the light, let me share the light. Mantras Through the study of Cymantics and sound vibration, we can understand the foundation of the mantra’s power projecting desire into reality. In Sanskrit, “manana” means to meditate. The OM is the first, and universal Mantra of creation, and also represents the universal tonal frequency to which our Mother Earth (nature) vibrates. Every planet, galaxy and star system, in fact, every single life entity has a vibrational frequency. The Earth frequency of 136.1Hz, is also the frequency of ~OM~. In recent brainwave research, this cosmic note or OM frequency, helped meditation achieve the desired \"Theta\" brainwave states quickly. The translation of this OM or Earth frequency into the Sanskrit Mantra Meditation — Mantras"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147 evolved by way of the ancient Rishi and Indian Sages, through the ancient Vedic traditions of India. Mantras are a way to connect with the universal light consciousness, through recreating the divine tonal aspects that reside within and outside our human form. Mantras represent our subtle connection or key to all creative forces, including the deities and the divine aspects of our Mother Earth, Heavenly Father, primordial masters, and the Adi Shakti power. It is also a customary practice within Buddhism, Sikhism and Jain- ism. A Mantra is a word or tone spoken or sung in meditation. It is the re - creation of a spiritual tone “OM” or an extension of words that have a divine connota- tion creating the vibration and connection that has a direct effect on the in- ner spiritual Chakras and physical being. When a soul meditates and chants a mantra, he/she is first imbibing the spiritual energy for the specific purpose or chakra, for which the mantra is intended. Mantras add to the vibration awareness by recreating the tonal sound of creation within. This is done by chanting the spiritual sound or mantra that allows different levels of divine connection. For this reason, great emphasis is put on correct pronunciation (resulting in ancient development of a sci- ence of phonetics in India) and understanding the meaning of the mantra, as the qualities and blessings are manifested through the current meaning and pronunciation. Pure desire to evolve ones spiritual ascent is also important to attaining this awakening — second is humility and controlling the ego. It is also important to know that wrong pronunciation or misuse of the sacred mantras without understanding divine protocols is not useful. Daily mantras/ affirmations can be used to divert the mind from basic instinctual desires or material attachments such as OM — \"I am a pure love and awareness\". Mantras are most effective while sitting in meditation. By using the Sanskrit names we are invoking the vibration of the name or tone that has a specific goal and connection to the divine aspects passed down from ancient times. The seeker usually absorbs these mantras by focusing on a specific chakra or deity that will manifest the results desired. So when a realized soul or seeker meditates and says a mantra, he/she is manifesting the spiritual en- ergy for the specific purpose or chakra the mantra is intended.

To open the Chakra or when the residing deity of the Chakra recedes, it is because the qualities of that Chakra do not maintain themselves without constant attention and spiritual nourishment.

It is said these laws were written on stone tablets by the divine and given to Moses so he could take his followers to the next level of their spiritual aware- ness. They were spiritually destined to escape the enslavement of the Phar- aohs and their seed line. Since society was less spiritually evolved during this period — idol worship and slavery was the level of their understanding. The commandments were offered to the masses to encourage a new spiritual awareness, but as Moses tried to de - condition his followers and connect them to their spiritual essence, he was met with resistance and negativity by the powers that be. As time evolved through the ages the qualities of the Chakras have been gently awakened through the primordial masters or incarnations sent to guide our awakening. This is similar to a child in preschool evolving to high school with different teachers along the way. Each step in our spiritual awareness has been awakened at the beginning of a new age by a divine incarnation. Our evolution correlates directly to the spiritual awakening of the Chakras, now with the Sahasrara chakra opening during the Age of Aquarius (enlightenment). We are now leaving the Piscean age (water sign) and symbol of the early Christians (fish). Over the past 2200 years the shipping industry and the great armadas controlled communication and trade. Now as we ride the cusp of the Aquarian age (air sign) we see telecommunications, air travel, etc. The great clock of the cosmos correlates to this new age of enlightened awareness as the next step to our spiritual evolution. This evolution of our awareness from the ape - man to the human is complete, and now the trans- formation into the age of enlightenment has the human being evolving into the realm of the spiritual being or 5 th dimension. Yet, even in today’s modern world we still find idol worship and dogmas. Our modern version is through the movie, pop and sports stars or the gurus that 3 — Nabhi Chakra"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"183 line up as avatars — masters using saffron words to promote their “branded” divinity for money, power, control or adoration, which is nothing more than pampering the ego. They take advantage of the seeker’s innocence and ma- nipulate them, claiming that the way to the divine is through them. But the only way to the divine is through understanding that we are our own guru and master, responsible for our own evolution. This was the message of Moses and all the great saints and incarnations. This new awareness coming in the golden Aquarian age will now allow us to evolve and deepen our divine collective discretion and to understand and connect to the true yoga of self and the divine consciousness. Laws or 10 Commandments of Moses 1 - I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not have Gods before me. ( This was a reference to the Idol worship of figures at the time, whereby the connection to the divine directly through the Yoga had been lost.) 2 - Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Respect and Humility 3 - Remember thou keep the Sabbath Day. Most of the great masters mentioned this as the time to connect with the Divine. 4 - Honor thy Father and thy Mother. It is the dharma of right conduct 5 - Thou shalt not kill. It is based on the law of Karma, and cause and effect – for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 6 - Thou shalt not commit adultery. It is the Dharma of right conduct 7 - Thou shalt not steal. It is the law of Karma 8 - Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

It is about Lord Rama who was born in a royal family and was forced into exile from his kingdom for fourteen years. Dur- ing this period his wife Sita was kid- napped by the 10 - headed king of the de- mons called Ravana, who was the king of Lanka. Rama with the help of his brother, Lakshman, and an army of monkeys un- der the leadership of Shri Hanuman, set out and rescued Sita in the great battle. Spiritually, the Ramayana is about devo- tion, loyalty, family roles and respect of elders, and the people on Earth who suf- fered from the demon king Ravana. This evil king terrorizes the people of Earth, especially the religious people by preventing them from performing religious rituals. But Ravana is also a great devotee of the three gods who rule the universe: Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserve, and Shiva the destroyer — and therefore has their blessings. But the people of the Earth, who suffer from Ravana, rise up to heaven to visit the gods and ask for their help. The gods decide that Lord Vishnu will incarnate as a human being on Earth and destroy Ravana. So what does all this really mean? Could this be about a ruler from the planet Nibiru put in place by the Anunnaki to rule the Earth beings? This the- ory is not so far - fetched when we relate it to the Sumerian history which states we were enslaved by these aliens in ages past, or to the gods like Brahma who evolved as light beings from the constellation PLEIADES. But all the answers will be revealed by 2012.

OM represents the sound of creation, the universe and the three deities of the Hindu trinity, the trimurti (“three images”), of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The vibrations of A - U - M represent the fullness of creation, and the three as- pects. Shiva is the destroyer, his role is viewed as beneficial, since destruction is necessary for creation and destruction can also represent sublimation of the lower physical energies into devotion. Vishnu incarnates in a form (avatar) in each cycle of time to rescue the uni- verse. He represents the maintenance of balance in the universe; this is done through support of physical and spiritual laws. Brahma sitting on a lotus indicates that he is always rooted in the ultimate reality, the transcendent aspect remains hidden beneath surface aware- ness. The four heads of Brahma represent the manifestation of conscious- ness as mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkar) and conditioned - consciousness (chit).

It was written in a poem of 100,000 verses — the Veda Vyasa, the longest epic poem ever created. It also contains the philosophical treatise, the Bhagavad Gita. This is where the Vedic struggle between the deities of truth and light battle the powers of darkness, division and falsehood. This is relevant to the long lasting battle of human kind, as the forces of the anti - Christ try and prevent spiritual evolu- tion. 2012 is relevant to the battle. The Bhagavad Gita represents numerous subplots, and interpretations on theology and morals. Shri Krishna not only helps his brother Arjuna under- stand the basis of social laws of civilization, but the absolute map to under- standing the riddle of life, self - discovery and inner fulfillment. This epic re- lates to many things on many levels, including the battle of the self on the physical and spiritual levels that happened during the last great cycle. It represents the power of detachment and witnessing the drama of life, to pre- vent one from invoking the law of cause and effect (karma). This battle could also apply to the ancient mythological civilization of Atlantis or even before, or to a battle between alien beings that inhabited Earth long ago. 5 — Vishuddhi Chakra"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"232 Bhagavadgita — 10th Chapter This is a time where Lord Krsishna sums up and describes the attainment of salvation by the paths of karma. Krishna explains the meaning of renuncia- tion and the effects of the modes of nature on human consciousness and activity. He explains Brahman realization, the glories of the Bhagavad - gita, and the ultimate conclusion of the Gita: the highest path of spirit at the time, is absolute, unconditional loving surrender unto the Lord Divine, which frees one from all sins, brings one to complete enlightenment, and enables one to return to Krishna's eternal spiritual abode. The Lord explains that while on the journey to enlightenment one must offer up and surrender to the pure essence of God. The Perfection of Renunciation Verse 1 — Arjuna said, O mighty - armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of renunciation [tyaga] and of the renounced order of life [sannyasa], O killer of the Kesi demon, Hrsikesa. Verse 2 — The Supreme Lord said, To give up the results of all ac- tivities is called renunciation [tyaga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced order of life [sannyasa] by great learned men. Verse 3 — Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activi- ties should be given up, but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance should never be aban- doned. Verse 4 — O best of the Bharatas, hear from Me now about renun- ciation. O tiger among men, there are three kinds of renunciation declared in the scriptures. Verse 5 — Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls. Verse 6 — All these activities should be performed without any ex- pectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Prtha. That is My final opinion. Verse 7 — Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also cer- tainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.

The Vedas The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts of our civilization, it is said that the Rig - Veda was compiled from as early as 1500 BC over a period of several centuries. According to Hindu and other Indian tradition, the Vedas were not of human origin and were supposed to have been directly revealed, to the ancient Rishi and Sages, thus are called ś ruti (\"what is heard\"). There is a strong connection and likelihood that the wisdom, and language (Sanskrit) of the Vedas, was given by the Star Teachers of the Pleiades galaxy . It would also make sense that there is only “one” truth of the light consciousness, the stars, and solar occultism. Seems that different alien “Gods” that came to earth, either promoted this knowledge, or suppressed it — based on the agenda of the teachers (Gods). Once the knowledge was taught and im- bibed in the spiritual foundation, there became a strategy by the dark forces (Anunnaki) to suppress and color the knowledge, and to confuse and divide. Thus humankind’s suffering began and will continue until the great revealing of 2012 that establishes the Golden Age.

It is a book that masterfully merges the ancient knowledge and wis- dom of the past, the 2012 transformation period, and the evolution of the spirit into a deep; but easy to understand; bridge to the coming Golden Age. At a time of great trials and tribulations within and outside of our realm of comprehension, 2012 Enlightened presents a refreshing truth and the limit- less boundaries of our ascent as a civilization on the brink, and as individu- als transforming into the spiritual plane of the 5 th dimensional collective light consciousness. This insightful book is beautifully written and packaged with a powerful blend of 2012 facts, Sanskrit mantras, evocative artwork and design, creating a oneness and clarity that travels beyond our past, present and future journey as evolving spiritual beings. It is a masterpiece of love translated from the light awareness. Doom & Gloom is a mental concept of fear: that is not our intent or focus in this book. This book is about empowerment — with truth and understanding we become empowered to see what is, and to make decisions, and take re- sponsibility for our knowledge (or lack thereof). The reality is the media of the world, in most cases, are afraid or controlled by the forces that have been suppressing this truth and knowledge. This does not mean that it does not exist!"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"About The Author Brad C Carrigan A spiritual visionary and teacher, author, recording artist and playwright, Brad was born in Ottawa and educated in Winnipeg, Paris and India. At the age of four, a beautiful spiritual event established the path of his life journey. At nineteen he discovered meditation as a vehicle to seek the higher self and patterned his life toward finding enlightenment. As his life evolved, Brad lived in India and studied the ancient metaphysical sci- ences as well as Indian devotional music in the Sanskrit, Hindi and Mara- thi languages. This attunement allowed him to give numerous mind, body and spirit seminars and devotional concerts. But it was back in India meditating by the Yamuna River where a profound awakening of the Kundalini energy (self - realization) was experienced. During this moment in time, the deity \"Shri Ganesha\" lovingly transcended and hugged him in a vision dream. This hug was experienced by a transfer of pure electro - magnetic light energy. He woke from this beautiful experience feeling crystal clear, and a new world of spiritual clarity. Soon after this profound experience, his connection to the Akashic deep- ened along with a commitment to share the universal knowledge of Kun- dalini awakening without charging money for the teachings. These experiences helped to establish Brad's life path, and over the years he has devoted himself to understanding, integrating and deepen- ing his spiritual assent, and sharing this knowledge of the light conscious- ness and the 2012 transformation.
