For some of us (me included), it can be difficult to fully believe in the Law of Attraction. Logically, we are open-minde d enough to know there's something behind this way of thinking. We also want to believe having everything we want could be as simplistic as ge tting clear about what it is that we want, asking for it and having faith it is on its way. But after years of being ta ught that \"things don't come easy\", many of us reach a point where we do want to change the wa y we approach our life and want to untangle ourselves from limited (and limiting) beliefs. We want to take comfort we are connected to something bigger--something that connects us all--and that a greater energy is working on our behalf. If you're still learning about how to make the Law of Attraction a staple in your life, reading many of the books which have been written about manifesting is always beneficial. Personally, I went on the Web searching for articles on the subject. Not only did I want to learn about the Law of Attraction in a bite-sized, quick-to-read format, but I want ed to find some new teachers. The articles I have included in this e-book are ones I have come across and, not only enjoyed, but found useful. It is my hope that they will help you increase your knowledge in the same way they have mine. As I write this, I wish I c ould say I approach everything in my life having a full confidence in the Law of Attraction. I don't. But with each passing day, I am learning more, practicing more and accepting more. I have to admit, the more I do utilize the Law of Attrac tion the more free I feel. I hope you experience freedom as well. Enjoy these articles!

By Kate Corbin “What you resist sticks to you like glue.” – Judith Orloff The Law of Attraction states that you w ill attract into your Life whatever you focus on – whether you want it or not. Therefore, although you may not have gotten what you wanted, you di d get what you asked for. You Always Get What You Ask For. If the waiter serves you something you truly dislike, keep in mind that the Cosmic Café never gets an order wrong. You ne ver get something you did not request. You are never served someone else’s order by mistake. Q: Waiter, I hate Brussels sprouts. Why do you keep bringing me Brussels sprouts? A: I keep bringing you Brussels sprouts, young man, because you keep focusing on Brussels sprouts. Q: Waiter, I distinctly ordered the roast duck and you brought me a hot dog. A: Well, Sir, you do not order in words. Y ou order vibrationally. To get roast duck, you must vibrate roast duck. Q: Waiter, why did you bring me the veggi e plate when I requested the escargot? A: Well, Madam, although you say you want the escargot, you are not vibrating escargot. You are definitely vibrating veggie plate. So what do you do when you’re served something you definitely do not want? You place another order. You place an order for what you want clearly and specifically and with all the passion you can muster. Then you give your full attention to what you do want. Place Another Order. Let’s say you manifest your dream job and later learn that it requires significant amounts of travel, which makes balanci ng the other aspects of your life more challenging. Not a problem. Now that you’re clearer about what you do want, place another order by specifically focusi ng on a job with no travel or minimal travel. As you focus on this desire, either th e travel part of your current job will be reduced or you’ll attract a nother job with the perfect amount of travel. Hold your gaze unwaveringly on what you do want so that you offer a clear signal rather than a fuzzy vibration. Max claimed to be surprised when he was laid off from his job. Closer inspection revealed that, some months earlier, he ha d declared – “I hate my job. I’m ready for a job I love.” The Universe believed him and got him out of that miserable Page 4 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology position. It was not immediatel y clear to him that this was evidence of the Law of Attraction working on his behalf, and he did spend a few days feeling shocked. However, he soon recognized that he wa s now free to find more fulfilling work. As he was able to quit listening to his ow n negative self-talk and the fear-based advice of family members telling him to “j ust get a job, any job,” he held out until he found – you guessed it – a job he loves. Who Ya Gonna Blame? If you don’t understand that you have create d an unwanted situation in your life through your thoughts and fee lings, you may look for excuses. You may play the karma card, blame your mother, or curse your bad luck. When you realize that your life is the way it is because of th e way you direct your thoughts – and for no other reason – you can seize the power to design your destiny. When you apply the Law of Attraction a nd order with focus and clarity, the Cosmic Café will serve you the most de licious life you could ever imagine!

Understanding these laws is critical to achieving success – learn them and work with them, not against them. 1. The Law of Perpetual Transmutation Basically, this law states that what starts as energy changes into what is physical. Everything around you – everything you see, h ear, smell, touch, or taste began as energy. The vibration of that energy form s what is physical. Everything is in constant motion, and that motion is alwa ys changing. Energy can not be created or destroyed, just moved and changed. Our thoughts make themselves manifest in the physical world. In other words, wh at we think about, we bring about. 2. The Law of Relativity The way we perceive any object, thing, pers on, or idea is always relative to how we see another object, thing, person, or id ea. It’s the way we gauge what we see – bigger, smaller, good, bad, better, worse. Th e whole universe is designed to work together, with all the laws corresponding rather than conflicting. All the laws apply equally to everything in the univer se regardless of thei r size, strength, or awareness of the laws. Everything in the universe has its own rate of vibration – high, low, and in-between – we can only ev aluate the rate of vibration based on a comparison with the rates of other things. In your life, you see this law played out as you compare yourself to other people. You are reasonably attractive, right? Now, say someone enters the room who has entirely unfortunate looks – you feel simply gorgeous in comparison. But what if a supermodel enters the room next? How good-looking are you then? It’s all relativ e. The core of this law is that everything in life just “is” – our pe rception shapes how we experience it. 3. The Law of Vibration Page 6 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology This law says that nothing is at rest in the universe – it’s all constantly vibrating. Our awareness of that vibration is wh at we call feeling. Our feelings are determined by vibration, and we determine our rate of vibration by our thoughts and the paradigms we use to look at life. You’ve experienced this if you’ve ever walked into an office or house where pe ople were just quarreling. The tension in the air is thick enough to cut with a knife, and you instantly know you’ve interrupted something unpleasant. Our thoughts consist of vibrations we send out to the universe. When we focus or concentrate on our thoughts, the vibra tions grow stronger. Thoughts are the strongest vibration to move through the universe. God created the whole universe – all that there is, seen and invisible – from nothing, using thoughts and words. People are the only creation who share the power of t hought with the Creator, and that makes us special. This power to think, this gift of spirit, is what it means to be created in the image of God. Our t houghts and prayers are very powerful, affecting the physical world we live in. Our awareness of vibration is what we call our feelings. We see what it’s like to be in a negative vibration when we say, “I feel bad today.” A positive vibration shows when we say, “I feel great today!” Since vibration originates with our thoughts, we can control whether we live in a positive or negative vibration pattern. You use your brain to choose wh ich thoughts you’ll en tertain – it doesn’t choose a vibration itself. You’re the ma ster of your thoughts , of your vibration. Your thoughts steer your central nervous system into the vibration you choose. Your mind is a storehouse of images – positive and negative, whatever you allow to take up room there. If you choose to dredge up, examin e, and review the negative, you will move into a negativ e vibration – negative feelings will immediately follow. The reverse is tr ue – positive thoughts lead to positive vibration and a positive mood. 4. The Law of Polarity Everything has an equal opposite – up/dow n, good/bad, empty/full. There is no such thing as a one-sided coin. No object ha s only a left side without a right side. Because everything not only has an opposite, but the opposite is also equal, we’ve Page 7 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology got an immutable law that we can unders tand. If you measure the room and find it is eighteen feet from the wall to the door , you’ll find it’s also eighteen feet from the door to the wall. Seems pretty obvious , but the understandi ng of this law will really change how you look at life. Say so mething you think is really bad happens to you – according to the Law of Polar ity, there must be something equally good about it, too. Mathematically, if something happens to you that you see as only being a little bit bad, the flip side is that there’s also a little bit of good in that, too. Because of the Law of Polarity, you also get to choose your thoughts on every occurrence in life – is this a good thing or a bad thing? In real ity, it just is. But you have the privilege of in terpretation – you can choose to view it as a positive or a negative. From that choice, you set vibration in motion, determine your feelings, and ultimately your actions and results. 5. The Law of Rhythm The whole universe moves in a repetitive rhythm. The tides, the seasons, day and night – we can count on these regular pattern s to stay constant. If anything moves forward, something else must move backward; if anything grows greater, something else shrinks. Every action cause s a reaction, and results in a rhythmic swinging of vibration. You see this law at work every day in the peak and decline of your energy, the ups and downs that you experience, the way that our days are sometimes full and busy and sometimes slow and lazy. It’s helpful to realize that our moods have a natural rhythm of ups a nd downs, and that even in the midst of a relatively down mood, we’ve still got control of our thoughts. Choosing good thoughts, even when we feel down, propels us into a positive vibration, evening out our emotions and keeping us moving toward our goals. 6. The Law of Cause and Effect This law states that for every action, th ere is an equal and opposite reaction. What you send out into the universe comes back. Luck, chance, and accidents are non- existent. Everything in the universe is s ubject to universal la ws, and everything that happens does so because it was cause d. We see the result of this law in the physical world – in our health, our bank accounts, and how people treat us. The way we get results we want is by work ing on the cause behind them. A changed Page 8 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology cause must produce a changed effect. One way to change your cause is to focus on it, using positive affirmations to point you in the direction you wish to go. In each area of your life, develop positive statements you can repeat in you r mind regularly. These affirmations should be in the present te nse, carefully crafted to focus you on what you really want. 7. The Law of Gender This law describes how every seed has a gestation period. We see it in nature all the time – you plant carrot seeds, and can expect to wait about seventy days before the carrot is ready to eat. If you c onceive a child, it ta kes about forty weeks for the baby to be born. The same is true for ideas. They are spiritual seeds, and take time to become manifest. You must be patient when you plant a spiritual seed, an idea. It will show itself in physical form when the time is right. Every idea that is given energy moves into th e physical world. Everything in the universe has a masculine and feminine side . We see it in every person and animal, and even in the plant world. The principle of both male and female in all things makes potential, regeneration, and motion possible. Both male and female are required for life to exist. This law dem onstrates how everything comes about, how things change from what they were into what they become. You may be familiar with some of these concepts – the structure and function of your mind, and the universal laws of the universe. Some may be completely new to you. Understanding them is so impor tant in the process of achieving your dreams, of living the purpos e-filled life you were designe d to live, of living in a way that is fulfilling and proactive. If you’re serious about making changes, about winning in life , about living up to your potential and helping everyone ar ound you to do the same, you’ll commit yourself to learning these Laws of Succe ss. Reflect on them, discuss them, and do all you can to comprehend them – teach them to others, too. The more aware you are about how it all works t ogether, the more you can put these ideas and laws to work for you so that you’ll experience more success and less frustration.

Or the \"cau se of death\" of many a grandiose desire? What’s the best way to sabotage yourself in getting what you want? Answer: thinking you have to figure out how to make it happen! In Law of Attraction world, \"how\" is well- known as a four lette r word. It’s the most common way to shoot down aspirations before they get time to grow. We do this to ourselves regularly - making the business of life much harder than it needs to be. Once we recognize a new desi re, what’s the thought right behind it? If it’s not something about why it can’t or won’t happe n, it’s very likely anxiety about how to make it come true. Last weekend I traveled to a part of my state I rarely visit fo r my boyfriend’s three day golf tournament. Since golf isn’t my thing, I recognized a \"feel good\" that was more in alignment with hiking. Although I was in a strange town with no gear, no familiarity with the area, no hiki ng friends, and no car, I announced I was skipping the tournament and going on a hike instead. Considering the circumstances, a very na tural thought at that point would be, \"How am I going to do that?\" Didn’t look li ke events were lined up to make that easy to happen. But I didn’t get hung up on how. I stayed with my desire: I wanted to hike; I wanted to get some fresh air and exerci se; explore new territory; and get some good time alone in nature. I didn’t let worry about \"how\" it would happen stop me. And in the absence of worry about how, I was able to find my way to action steps that allowed one of the best hikes of my life! I borrowed a car to look for the perfect hiking trail, which I didn’t find right away. But I did find bottled water and a map, which then led me to a tra ilhead five minutes out of town, to a gorgeous hike with steep switchback s and amazing views of the valley. Page 11 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology It was an amazing experience! The top of the trail opened onto a beautiful green meadow hidden from the valley road. Continuing through the peaceful meadow, I met two locals who tipped me off to a nearby and little known area of 2,000 year old petroglyphs. This hike was one of the most stunning, awesome, inspiring, humbling, unbelievably beautiful walks ever! I could have been there, OR, I could have been back at the golf course watching a long tournament, because I didn’t know how I could go hiking under seemingly restricted circumstances. Where does \"how?\" stop you in life? What are you hung up on because you think it’s your job to figure it all out? When you turn that responsibility over to the Universe (aka God, Spirit) and focus more on your desire than how to make it happen, miracles unfold! Instead of spending valuable time worki ng an \"action plan\" to reach your goal, consider spending a few of those minutes dwelling on the end result you want. Imagine what you’ll experience, revel in what you want to create. Enjoy the anticipation of it now, and let that desire grow and then attract the solution to you. After giving your dream some air time, all you need to do is take action that feels good. Forget figuring out \"how!\" It’s a trap door. The Universe will show you the way when you let it. Trust, allow, and leave the reins in th e Universe’s hands. Then prepare to be amazed!

The Law of Attraction, the most powerful Law in the Universe, states that you draw to yourself whatever you focus on – whether you want it or not. Like attracts like. Birds of a feather flock together. As you vibrate, you attract. You are a vibrat ional being interacting in a vibrational Universe. According to the Law of Attract ion, vibrations of a certain frequency magnetically bond with other vibrat ions of the same frequency. As children, we gained real world experience with the Law of Gravity as we dropped our toys and fell down again and ag ain. The Law of Attraction has been working just as consistently in our lives, but most of us haven’t fully understood it. Like the Law of Gravity, the Law of Attraction works perfectly and impartially at all times in all situations for all people. It is, therefore, alwa ys fair. It neither rewards nor punishes – although it may appear that way to someone who is fuzzy on the process. The Law of Attraction responds to your vibrational offering with a matching vibrational response. Your vibrational offering is composed of your thoughts and accompanying feelings -- your \"Thought-F eelings.\" Thought-Feelings are Energy and, like magnets, attract more Thought -Feelings of the same vibration. As you Think, you Feel As you Feel, you Vibrate As you Vibrate, you Attract At every moment, you attract to yourself what you are giving your attention to. You draw to yourself the essence of what you predominantly think and feel. By consciously focusing your Thought-Feelings, you can at tract what you want. And, happily, you can avoid attr acting what you do not want. Page 13 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology As you understand the Law of Attraction, you will: •learn to activate a vibration that f eels good by choosing what you give your attention to •create your reality in a ccordance with your desires •experience the joy of infinite possibility •feel boundless appreciation that you know how to be and do and have whatever you desire. Directing Energy. You crea te your life by no ticing how your thoughts make you feel and consistently choosing thoughts that feel good. As you continue to practice directing your thoughts, you will realize that you are the Master Creator of your own Life and that you really can be and do and have whatever you desire. As you set your dominant vibration to so mething that pleases you, the Universe will respond with more things that please you. As you focus single-mindedly on what you want, you are no longer giving Energy to what you do not want. Therefore, what you do not want no longer influences your experience. Because you get what you think about whether you want it or not, the take-home message of the Law of Attraction is: Direct all your Energy to ward what you do want. Avoid directing any Energy toward what you do not want. Kate Corbin is a Law of Attraction Life Coach and the founder of Gold Star Coaching.

The alarm clock is ringing, they keep hitting snooze, and in the meantime, the life they could be living is passing them by. Day after day, millions of people go through their lives wishing and hoping and dreaming that things could be better, with absolutely no knowledge that it is they themselves that perpetuate their own dissatisfaction. It is not the \"gifted few\" who create their realities. It's not just for those in the metaphysical community. It is all of us . Every single one. However, there are a few who have awakened to this knowledge , and make creating their reality a daily event...manifesting whatever it is they wa nt in their life with seemingly no effort! Meanwhile the rest of the world looks on in wonder and disbelief. They assume that these \"fortunate few\" are among the cosmically lucky. To be honest, the whole thing generates some anger in me. The problem is that we are \"dumbed down\" by society throughout our whole lives under the pretense that we are actually being inte llectualized. The \"scholarly\" tell us that metaphysical topics like reality creation are pure fa ntasy. Science insists on measurable evidence of everything before it will acknowledge such claims as fact. However, it's really not that difficult to comprehend. Even the most skeptical people should be able to gras p a few simple concepts like: Everything in the Universe is compos ed of Energy, including you and me. Even our thoughts are Energy. Through Energy, everything in th e Universe is connected. The Universe creates without effort, a nd in abundance. Just look around you. Page 15 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology Trees, rocks, air, planets, etc. all were created without stress, effort, or over- analyzation. The Force you choose to believe initiated the crea tive process doesn't matter. They are all there and were created effortlessly. You ARE a part of the Univ erse and through the power of thought, have the same creative power that manifests everything you see. The only th ing that limits your potential is your own belief system! Everything that occurs in your life is interpreted BY YOU. You add the meaning, you add the emotional response, you add EV ERYTHING. It is your thoughts that literally take the energy \"data\" and transpose it into your reality. What you consider \"real\" is nothing more than an agreement that you've made with yourself (and no doubt many others in some cases). This is how our reality has been shaped. This is how we have learned what is possible, and what is impossible. We learned it from OTHER PEOPLE. The problem is, these other people (family and friends perhaps?) have their OWN limiting belief systems which they ALSO consider \"real\". So human limitations spread like a virus, and we don't even realize what's happening. As discouraging as this is, many of us ARE waking up. I personally feel it my sacred duty to shake people out of this \"intellectual trance\" that limits them and show them what is truly possible. So what IS the difference between those who cruise through life in a seemingly perpetual state of bliss, with everything they want coming to them with no effort, and the rest of the population working at jobs they hate for the sake of doing the \"responsible\" thing, hoping that SOME DAY they can live the lives they hope for? The difference is that these people know their purpose, know WHY they absolutely HAVE to fulfill that purpose, and commit themselves to never stopping until they realize their dr eam. They may or may not have thrown the accepted definition of \"responsibility\" out the window. The only thing that matters Page 16 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology ultimately is that they now live live s they love, following their passions. You see it is our PASSIONS in life that tell us precisely what we are to do. When we follow our passions, our life lights up. We give off incredibly powerful energy which attracts our desires to us. That means people, money, objects, careers...whatever we want that is in line with our purpose. The Universe WANTS to provide those thi ngs we want most.

No one likes to be told that they did something wrong, but unless your life is \"heaven on earth\", you stepped off track a time or two alo ng the way, and you only have yourself to blame. When you look around your life right now, th e people and the circumstances that make up your existence are there because - directly or indirec tly - YOU put them there. As Esther Hicks says in the movie 'The S ecret', we are all \"magnificent creators\" of our existence. The problem is that most of us don't realize just how much power we actually have because the true methods that we use to create our existence cannot be seen or touched. However, that power is there, and it is creating your existence at this very moment, whether you understand it or not. The power that we are talking about is the Law of Attraction, and we wield that power with the thoughts that we hold in our heads, and the feelings that result because of those thoughts. The science behind the Law of Attracti on reveals that when we experience emotion, we create a very specific vibr ation. This vibration has a certain frequency based on the type of emotion that is being experienced and it acts as a magnet, attracting similar vibrations. Hence the name: the Law of Attraction. Here is the part where you come in as the Creator of your existence. All through your life you have been sending out th ese vibrations, and attracting similar vibrations back to you. If your life had always been filled with joy, love, confidence, and other similar emotions, then that is what your life would probably still be filled with. Page 18 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology On the other hand, all of us have had othe r experiences in life that weren't that positive. Negative emotions such as sadness, fear, grief, frustration, shame, and anger are things that most of us ha ve experienced, and most people have experienced them frequently throughout their lives. So if positive vibrations attract positive circumstances, then by the letter of the Law, negative vibrations must also attr act negative circumstances. This could be explained by the simple fact that you can't have good without bad, black without white, up without down, etc. Here is the best part, though. Every single moment in your life is a chance for you to start over again. It doesn't matter how much negative ener gy you have created in the past due to the experiences that have been a part of your life up to this point. You can make a conscious decision right now - at this very moment - to take control of these emotional vibrations and make the majority of them positive. It takes some work in the beginning because you will be used to having the same type of negative reactions to life that you have become accustomed to up to this point. However, a simple decision to react in a pos itive way - to see th e bright side - of any given situation will net you incredib le results in the long run. You will instantly feel better just because you w on't have the negative reaction that you would normally have, but the real re sults go much further than that. When you continually experience positive emotions over and over again, day in and day out, you will be creating more and more positive vibrations that will be attracting even more positive vibrations into your life. This may come in the form of materi al goods, money, opportunities, relationships, or pretty much any other positive things that you would like to have in your life. It may also simply come as an increased leve l of happiness, confidence, or surety of purpose and direction.

Nothing happens, no forward steps are taken until we first have a dream. But even when we have a dream, we can’t begin ma nifesting it until some important first steps are taken to lay the groundwork. To make a dream come true, what’s interesting is that we don’t have to in itially know HOW we are going to do it. Instead, the first critical st eps to achieving a dream are: A clear and precise vi sion of the dream. Sort of the big picture or overview of what you want. First we conceive, then we believe.” Being able to articulate and express the dream. In other words, it is important to know what is wanted, not just what is not wanted. Exchanging the feelings of fear, uncertainty, failure, or overwhelm, with ones of excitement and joy. Creating belief in the dream. For example, we might have the dream of permanently overcoming certain eating behaviors. Yet, until we articulate this desire and then begin regularly seeing and feeling the joy of our desired outcome, th e dream remains vague and distant. If the feelings surrounding a dream are ones of apprehension, fear, overwhelm, or indecision, the dream doesn’t have a chan ce of developing. As long as our dream stays enveloped in a fear state, the chan ces of achieving it are minuscule. To make dreams come true, we must be able to vi sualize them, believe in what we want, and be able to generate some exciteme nt about what we want. Dream boards are great tools that allow us to bri ng our dreams into reality faster! Page 21 of 27 "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Law of Attraction: An Anthology WHAT IS A DREAM BOARD? One simple, and powerful, way of making your dreams come true is to create a visual representation of the desired outcom e. What we focus on is what we create. Dreams Boards are great tools to help us focus on the particular abundance, joy or relationship that is important. They he lp us see our desires vividly while stimulating the brain. A Dream Board is a visual picture of the dreams we have for our life. It’s a big colorful poster onto which we place pictures of what you want to create. For example, if your goal is overcoming an eating disorder or losing weight, take a little time and ask yourself some meaningful questions. What would achieving the dream mean to you and those around you? What would the dream look? How would life be different? What strengths would you have? What would achieving your goal bring into your life? Notice what images come to mind. From these images we can begin to write down the dream or desired outcome. Remember to make it positive and in the present tense. The next step to turn thos e dreams into reality is to create a visual representation. Dream boards help us see th e images of our success. They help us to focus on the joy of our dreams. They allow us to cultivate the excitement necessary to take the action steps that bring dreams closer to reality. The key is finding pictures that help us focus and reflect on ourselves already in possession of the desired outcomes. WHY DO DREAM BOARDS WORK?

Repetition is key here. Recall all of the advertisements seen on television and in magazines. Why would a company spend millions of dollars in television advertisements to sell a .99 cent hamburger?
