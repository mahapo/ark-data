We start at the base center and work up. The ultimate is the crown center, which is almo st impossible to attain. In meditation we focus on the base center, bring a bright light up thru each chakra to the crown center a nd back taking deep breaths thru your nose and letting go thru our mouth slowly. Only focusing on the light and the chakras. If there is a blockage you will feel it. This is why you need to understand chakra meditation before yo u start. It's a wonderful way to cleanse your body of blockages. If one of your chakras is blocked you will feel a strange sensation, or different feelings, just relax and either stop or continue on by focusing on just that chakra to find out what the problem is. It can be worked out(healed). This is why people feel out of ba lance. One or mo re of there chakras are usually blocked. When you do the meditation you need to be in a quiet place and peaceful. Sitting with your feet on the ground and the palms of your hands facing up. Cl ose your eyes and take a few deep breaths before you start so you can rel ax. Then visualize a bright light and follow the above. "}]
