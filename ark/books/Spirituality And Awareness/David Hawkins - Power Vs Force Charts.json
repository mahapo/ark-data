Hawkins, M.D, Ph.D. Shame: (20) The level of shame is perilously proximate to death, which may be chosen out of Shame as conscious suicide or more subtly elected by failure to take steps to prolong life. In shame we hang our heads and slink away, wishing that we were invisible. It’s destructive to emotional and psychological health, and makes us prone to physical illness. Guilt: (30) Guilt manifests itself in a variety of expressions, such as remorse, self- recrimination, masochism, and the whole gamut of symptoms of victimhood. Unconscious Guilt results in psychosomatic disease, accident proneness and suicidal behavior. Guilt provokes rage and killing frequently is its expression. Apathy: (50) This level is characterized by poverty, despair, and hopelessness. The world and the future look bleak. Apathy is a state of helplessness, its victims needy in every way, lack not only the resources, but the energy to avail themselves of what may be available. Unless external energy is supplied by a caregiver, death through passive suicide may result. Grief: (75) This is the level of sadness, loss and dependency. Those who live at this level live a life of constant regret and depression. This is the level of mourning, bereavement, and remorse about the past. In Grief one sees sadness everywhere, this level colors one’s entire level of existence. Fear: (100) From the viewpoint of this level, the world looks hazardous, full of traps and threats. Once Fear is ones focus, the endless worrisome events of the world feed it. Fear becomes obsessive and may take any form. Fear limits growth of the personality and leads to inhibition. Because it takes energy to rise above Fear, the oppressed are unable to reach a higher level unaided. Desire: (125) Desire moves us to expend great effort to achieve goals or obtain rewards. Desire is also the level of addiction, wherein it becomes a craving more important than life itself. Desire has to do with accumulation and greed. Want can start us on the road to achievement. Hence Desire can become a springboard to yet higher levels of awareness. Anger: (150) As people move out of Apathy and Grief to overcome Fear as a way of life, they begin to want; Desire leads to frustration, which in turn leads to Anger. Anger expresses itself most often as resentment and revenge and is, therefore, volatile and dangerous. Since Anger stems from frustrated want, it’s based on the energy field below it. Frustration results from exaggerating the importance of desires. Anger leads easily to hatred, which has an erosion effect on all areas of a person’s life. Pride: (175) In contrast to the lower energy fields, people feel positive as they reach this level. However Pride feels good only in contrast to the lower levels. Pride is defensive and vulnerable because it’s dependent upon external conditions, without which is can suddenly revert to a lower level. Pride is fueled by the inflated ego which is always vulnerable to attack. Hence the downside of Pride is arrogance and denial. These characteristics block growth. Courage: (200) At the 200 level, power first appears. Courage is the zone of exploration, accomplishment, fortitude, and determination. At the lower levels the world is seen as hopeless, sad, frightening, or frustrating, but at the level of Courage, life is seen to be exciting, challenging, and stimulating. At this level of empowerment, one is able to cope with and effectively handle the opportunities of life. Hence growth and education become attainable goals. Obstacles that defeat people whose consciousness is below 200 act as stimulants to those who have evolved into the first level of true power. People at this level put back into the world as much energy as they take; at the lower levels, populations as well as individuals drain energy from society without reciprocating. The collective level of consciousness of mankind remained at 190 for many centuries and, curiously, only jumped to its current level of 207 within the last decade. P O W E R F O R C E"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Neutrality: (250) Energy gets very positive as we get to this level. Below 250, consciousness tends to see dichotomies and take on rigid positions. The Neutral condition allows for flexibility and nonjudgmental, realistic appraisal of problems. To be Neutral mean to be relatively unattached to outcomes; not getting one’s way is no longer experienced as defeating, frightening ort frustrating. This is the level of safety. People at this level are easy to get along with and safe to be around and associate with because they are not interested in conflict, competition or guilt. These people are comfortable and relatively undisturbed emotionally. This attitude is nonjudgmental and doesn’t lead to any need to control other people’s behavior. Willingness: (310) This level of consciousness might be seen as a gateway to the higher levels. At the Neutral level, jobs are done adequately, but at the level of Willingness, work is done well and success in all endeavors is common. Growth is rapid here; these are people chosen for advancement. Below the 200 calibration, people tend to be closed-minded, but by level 310, a great opening occurs. At this level, people become genuinely friendly, and social and economic success seem to follow automatically. People here are helpful to others and contribute to the good of society. They’re also willing to face inner issues and don’t have major learning blocks. With their capacity to bounce back from adversity and learn from experience, they tend to become self-correcting. Having let go of Pride, they’re willing to look at their defects and learn from others. Acceptance: (350) A this level a major transformation takes place, with the understanding that one is oneself the source and creator of the experience of one’s life. All people below 200 tend to be powerless and see themselves as victims, at the mercy of life. This stems from a belief that the source of one’s happiness or the cause of one’s problems is “out there”. At the Acceptance stage, nothing “out there” has the capacity to make one happy, and love isn’t something that’s given or taken away by another, but is created from within. Acceptance allows engagement in life on life’s own terms, without trying to make it conform to an agenda. The individual at this level isn’t interested in determining right or wrong, but instead is dedicated to resolving issues and finding out what to do about problems. Long-term goals take precedence over short-term ones; self discipline and mastery are prominent. Reason: (400) Intelligence and rationality rise to the forefront when the emotionalism of the lower levels is transcended. This is the level of science, medicine, and of generally increased capacity for conceptualization and comprehension. Knowledge and education are here sought as capital. This is the level of Nobel Prize winners, great statesmen, and Supreme Court justices. Einstein, Freud, and many of the other great thinkers of history calibrate here. The shortcomings of this level involve the failure to clearly distinguish the difference between symbols and what they represent. Reason does not of itself provide a guide to truth. It produces massive amounts of information and documentation, but lacks the capability to resolve discrepancies in data and conclusions. Reason itself, paradoxically, is the major block to reaching higher levels of consciousness. Transcending this level is relatively uncommon in our society. Love: (500) Love as depicted in the mass media is not what this level is about. For when this love is frustrated, it often reveals an underlying anger and dependency that it had masked. That love can turn to hate in a common perception. Hence love never existed for hate only stems from pride not love. The 500 level is characterized by the development of a Love that is unconditional, unchanging, and permanent. It doesn’t fluctuate – its source isn’t dependent on external factors. Loving is a state of being. It’s a forgiving, nurturing, and supportive way of relating to the world. Love isn’t intellectual and doesn’t proceed from the mind; Love emanates from the heart. Love focuses on the goodness of life in all its expressions and augments that which is positive. This is the level of true happiness. Only 0.4% of the world’s population ever reaches this level of evolution of consciousness. Joy: (540) As Love becomes more and more unconditional, it begins to be experienced as inner Joy. Joy arises from within each moment of existence, rather than from any other source; 540 is also the level of healing and of spiritually based self-help groups. From level 540 up is the domain of saints, and advanced spiritual students and healers. A capacity for enormous patience and the persistence of a positive attitude in the face of prolonged adversity is characteristic of this energy field; the hallmark of this state is compassion. People who have attained this level have a notable effect on others. They’re capable of a prolonged, open gaze, which induces a state of love and peace. At the high 500s, the world one sees is illuminated by the exquisite beauty and perfection of creation. Everything happens effortlessly and by synchronicity. A Presence is felt whose power facilitates phenomena outside conventional expectations of reality, termed miraculous by the ordinary observer. Near-death experiences, characteristically transformative in their effect, have frequently allowed people to experience the energy level between 540 and 600. Peace: (600) This energy field is associated with the experience designated by such terms as transcendence, self-realization, and God-consciousness. It’s extremely rare, attained by only 1 in 10 million people. When this state is reached, the distinction between subject and object disappears, and there’s no specific focal point of perception. Perception at the level of 600 and above is sometimes reported as occurring in slow motion, suspended in time and space – nothing is stationary, and all is alive and radiant. Although this world is the same as the one seen by others, it has become continuously flowing, evolving in an exquisitely coordinated evolutionary dance in which significance and source are overwhelming. This awesome revelation takes place nonrationally, so that there is an infinite silence in the mind, which has stopped conceptualizing. That which is witnessing and that which is witnessed take on the same identity; the observer dissolves into the landscape and becomes equally the observed. Great works of art, music, and architecture that calibrate between 600 and 700 can transport us temporarily to higher levels of consciousness and are universally recognized as inspirational and timeless. Enlightenment: (700 – 1,000) This is the level of the Great Ones of history who originated the spiritual patterns that countless people have followed throughout the ages. This is the level of powerful inspiration; these beings set in place attractor energy fields that influence all of mankind. At this level there is no longer the experience of an individual personal self separate from others; rather, there is an identification of Self with Consciousness and Divinity. This is the peak of the evolutionary consciousness in the human realm. At this level there is no longer any identification with the physical body as “me”, and therefore, its fate is of no concern. The body is seen as merely a tool of consciousness through the intervention of mind, its prime value that of communication. This is the level of nonduality, or complete Oneness. The highest level attained by anybody who has lived in recorded history – to wit, the Great Avatars for whom the title “Lord” is appropriate: Lord Krishna, Lord Buddha, and Lord Jesus Christ.

(on tongue, held in hand, hidden in env elope, subjects unknowing of contents tested weak every time) ¾ Everything that was false resulted in a weak response. ¾ Through this test people can determine if someone is being honest, if they should be in a particular relationship, if they shou ld be eating a particular food, if they should be going on a particular chosen holiday, etc. ¾ Powerful patterns are associated with health, weak patterns are associated with sickness. Every thought, emotion, word & action has one pattern or the other. Every moment of our day we are either moving towards health or sickness. ¾ Collective Consciousness : These experiments reveal that there is a higher power t hat connects everything and everyone. It reveals that the truth cannot be hidden even if the rational mind isn’t consciously aware of the truth. Through these tests people have come to realize the truth about things that they weren’t consciously aware even existed. ¾ Everything calibrates at certain levels from weak to high in cluding books, food, water, clothes, people, animals, buildings, ca rs, movies, sports, music etc. ¾ A lot of music today calibrates at levels below 200. Hence it leads to behavior associated with lower energy levels of consciou sness. ¾ Most movies will weaken people who watch them by bringing thei r energy levels down below the 200 level of consciousness. ¾ 85% of the human race calibrates below the critical level of 200. ¾ The overall average level of human consciousness stands at 207. ¾ Human consciousness was dangling at below the 200 level (190) for many centuries before it suddenly rose up to its present leve l some time in the mid 1980s. Hence Nostradamus’s end of the world predictions may have been avoided (he made his predictions at a time when h uman consciousness was at below the 200 level). For the world to stay at levels below 200 over a prolonged period of time would caus e a great imbalance that would undoubtedly lead to the destruction of all humanity. ¾ The power of the few individuals at the top counterbalances the weakness of the masses. ¾ 1 individual at level 300 counterbalances 90,000 individuals below level 200 ¾ 1 individual at level 400 counterbalances 400,000 individuals below level 200 ¾ 1 individual at level 500 counterbalances 750,000 individuals below level 200 ¾ 1 individual at level 600 counterbalances 10 million individuals below level 200 ¾ 1 individual at level 700 counterbalances 70 million individuals below level 200 ¾ 12 individuals at level 700 equal one Avatar ( eg. Buddha, Jesus, Krishna) at level 1,000 ¾ Any meaningful human satisfaction cannot even commence until the level of 250 where some degree of self confidence begins to em erge. ¾ When one’s consciousness falls below 200 at any given moment you st art to lose power and thus grow weaker and more prone to be manipulated by one’s surroundings. ¾ Parts of one’s life will calibrate at a higher level of consciou sness while other parts will calibrate a lower levels.
