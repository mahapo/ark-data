It is time that people know the truth about life on Earth so you can understand how powerful you really are. To the best of my knowledge, most of the content in this book has never been published before; that ́s because it ́s secret knowledge that the general public are not supposed to know about. But I ́ve always felt knowledge is for sharing and that is why I want to share these secrets with you. The content of this book comes from insider knowledge that I learnt from my involvement with governments, secret orders and societies and through personal spiritual development. What I have to tell you is contentious, shocking and even disturbing. But it also essential because without this knowledge you are nothing – yet you should know you are everything! With the insights and experiences I present to you in The Trap System you will come to understand that you are more powerful than you could ever imagine. You may not believe many of the things that you read in this book, that is your choice. But what I have to tell you is completely true from what I have learned in my own experience of this life and past lives. We are living in a prison planet and I want to help you break free! In addition to never-explained-before information you will also find meditation exercises and spiritual rituals help you discover who you really are. Practice these exercises on a regular basis and you will learn how to navigate other dimensions of yourself and finally understand how to get out of the Trap System and experience life like never before! These exercises and the forbidden knowledge that I will explain in this book will bring more balance and harmony to your life, more love and light, more success and reward. By practising regularly with the exercises you will learn how to use your power and achieve the success you deserve. You will learn how to make your desires manifest in the physical world and find peace and happiness wherever you go. Not only that, but you can teach your family and friends how they can be powerful as well. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Author's Background Information Before we begin I should tell you a little about me so you can appreciate how I have come to obtain this secret knowledge and my reasons for wanting to pass it on to others. Let ́s start with the l ast things first. My current life began in this world on 13 th January 1981. Born in Norway, I was raised by parents who were partially involved with the government and partially with the occult and other secret orders. Due to the influence of my parents I had a foot in both these circles from a very early age, my father introducing me to occult magic, esoteric wisdom and secret orders and my mother to the military bases where she worked. It was here that I subsequently came into contact with secret military and governmental programs and projects. I would like to briefly note that it was not by coincidence that I was born into the family I chose; it was ordained that I would have parents that could teach me the knowledge I needed for my soul to grow. Not even the date of my birth is accidental, random or coincidence. And neither is yours! The existence we live in now was planned a long time ago - something I will explain in more detail later in this book. A s time passed by my father passed away. This was a critical changing point in my life, both mentally and spiritually as it funnelled my interests and focus on life. At the time of his death my father was the Grandmaster of a small secret order operating out of Europe. It ́s headquarters or “Grand Lodge” was situated in Norway. It was my destiny to succeed where my father had left off and so I became the next Grandmaster of the Order. My elevated position bought me in touch with a deeper involvement of the occult and a stronger understanding of esoteric wisdom. I also came into contact with other secret orders and societies and connected with various members affiliated with them. Around the same time I also started to get stronger contacts within various governments and their respective agencies. I befriended people in very high positions both in Government and other types of work and activities. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In those days – and still today – I studied a lot of spiritual and esoteric practices and experimented with the occult and magical work on my own outside of the orders and societies. It is something I have been doing since I was a child and such things still continue to fascinate me. When I talk about the Occult and magic, it is nothing to do with the Devil or wizards and witches as we are lead to believe. That is the illusion. The occult is actually learning about your inner-self and putting into practice the techniques you can use to discover your higher soul. E mploying Occult techniques and experimenting with magic has helped me in my search for the “truth.” Along the way I have perfected some spiritual systems and practices that have given me experiences and insights to knowledge and understanding life and the world in which we live. And it is these spiritual systems I want to share with you in this book so that you too can explore other realms and discover knowledge and understanding for yourself. Thanks to certain individuals and the teachings I obtained from my membership in various orders and societies, my spiritual practices became more focused on something more tangible compared to the vast amounts of spiritual practices, systems and beliefs that are practised in everyday circles. When I s ay “individuals,” I am not only referring to actual physical people, but also what you could call astral entities; angels, spirit guides, guardian angels, or whatever you would like to call them. These entities guided me and showed me what really worked as far as spiritual exercises and practices go. It was these experiences that really gave me the profound spiritual experiences, insights, knowledge and understanding I want to tell you about in this book. In time I was able to develop my own spiritual systems that for the lack of better explanation just “came to me.” I still work with these systems and have great success with them and by reading this book you can experience your own insights and understanding. During those years, I also started having “odd” experiences in my conscious life on a daily basis. At the time I did not completely understand what was 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"happening or what it all meant. I don ́t mind admitting to you that at times it scared the hairs out of me. Some examples include the sightings of UFOs and strange “manifestations” of peculiar objects in my house. To give you an example, as silly as it may sound, one of the most common occurrences was the appearance of a tiny drinking cup made of metal no bigger than a centimeter. I didn ́t know what to do other than to collect them and before long I had a small amount of them in a drawer. On other occasions, the electrical equipment in my house would turn themselves on in the middle of the night. Everything from computers to video cameras came alive of their own volition. A very strong and emotional experience I had was a spontaneous out of body experience, or rather a sleep paralysis, accompanied with strange buzzing sounds and the feeling of a presence behind me. At the time I thought it was an alien abduction and it was only years later that I understood what it truly had been – the start on symptoms for an Astral Projection, or Out of Body Experience. Then I started having memories of past lives - which leads me to the Beginning. The Beginning To get to the b eginning was naturally a backwards process. It started with memories of “this” life, but at some point, sudden visions and memories of past events from other lifetimes started to emerge into my mind. They seemed like random visions at first and were not very detailed. All I had was a few short memories of certain events from a previous lifetimes such as deaths and a few memories leading up to the point of death in each lifetime. T he memories I had of these past lives eventually spanned over thousands of years, not only on Earth, but also on other planets both in our solar system and other solar systems elsewhere in the universe. Through systems I developed, I managed to regain more and more memories and details of those past lives, doing past life regressions on myself through meditations and a form of self-hypnosis and “inner vision quests.” 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"My work with astral projection and out of body experiences also helped greatly with inner my inner vision quests as it enabled me to visit specific times and places both of my own past lives as well as exploring the Universe, Existence and the Mind. Some of the techniques I used were also, and still are, employed by the governments and secret societies and orders, together with various other people I know. I have taken part in such practices within these organizations and have done various assignments and missions involving astral projection and various psychic work. I have also been involved with developing secret technology techniques such as mind control, teleportation portals for time travel, UFO and alien related events and much more. At some point I got too involved and got into trouble. I had contacts sharing too much information with me, and in turn I began sharing with others. It eventually led to a total attack on my character by governments and other institutions. In the end I was forced to leave my home country because of sharing hidden truths and secret agendas with the public. For the last 6 years I have been living in exile in South America. In that time numerous agencies have tried to shut me down - but I am still standing and more determined than ever to tell you my story. At the moment, I am still an active member of several secret orders and societies, which include: The Freemasonic Order, The Martinist Order, The Rosicrucian Order, The Order of Noble Knights of Co-Creation and Ordo Nous Ogoz. I feel as though this is as much as you need to know as far as my background goes. The rest of this book is about you. I want you to understand that you are trapped in a spiritual system that is designed to control mankind and I will explain how it works. However, the most important aspect of this book is how to escape the Trap System – and whether you do or not is entirely up to you! 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Part 1 – Overview and information - The Trap System: A general overview of the Trap System - Why you are imprisoned in a physical body, - Reptilians, your Higher Soul & the Creation of our Existence The Trap System is a complex cage based on spiritual and technological tools. The purpose is to keep people trapped in their physical bodies on Earth, even through many different incarnations over thousands of years. In fact, the whole purpose of reincarnation is so you stay trapped in this physical realm where you are unaware of how to connect with your soul and thus do not experience ones True Self. New Agers completely misunderstand this concept. Most of them believe that reincarnation is \"necessary\" for a persons spiritual development and that Earth is a \"School.\" It is not. Earth is a prison planet. If Earth is intended for spiritual development there are some major flaws. A large percentage of the western world for example do not believe in God and think religion is a waste of time. Also consider the fact that between each incarnation people are put into amnesia thus forget everything they ever learned in their last life therefore we are forced to start all over again century after century. I guess you could say its the \"devolution of the spirit\" rather than the \"evolution of the spirit\". This alone proves that reincarnation can NOT serve the purpose which New Agers believe. It is the complete opposite. Most people do not develop spiritually from one life to the next because they are stripped of everything they learn. Basically we are \"reset\" at birth and are memories are wiped. The reason for this is to make sure mankind stays trapped and lose all knowledge of our higher selves, therefore we cannot develop properly and 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"reach the levels of Self Understanding, or Experience our Higher Soul and True Being. We simply remain here in lower planes of the astral realm, ignorant, blinded and brainwashed. But as we shall discuss later, there are ways to avoid getting trapped in the system. The Trap System Explained I know what you are thinking: ” Who created the trap system and for what purpose?” The answer to that is other beings that retained their knowledge of the higher astral planes. Don ́t think that these other beings are some kind of evil aliens because they are not. They are just like you and me, after all, we all came from the same place and we are all One. However, a long time ago these higher beings decided that mankind would become trapped on Earth to serve as slaves and act as a source of money and food. We are slaves to powerful elite families the control legal and banking systems together with religions and are indeed part of the Trap System. Because these higher beings feed off our etheric energy we are also a source of food for them. These entities, or as many people call them, \"Reptilians,\" are working in both the astral planes and the physical world. They have their representatives here on Earth and have infiltrated the physical world and taken over the planet by controlling Governments, banking, religious institutions, media, food chains and various other leading corporations. As I mentioned above, t he Reptilian entities that keep us trapped here feed on the etheric body energy. What I mean by this is the energy we give off through our thoughts and emotions. They particularly thrive from negative energy, which is why world leaders cause so much pain and suffering by 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"creating wars, terrorism, crashing banking systems, disasters, inventing laws that are designed to restrict people ́s freedom, and creating paranoia and fear through media. These entities can influence the minds of people through different means in order to create specific thought patterns, behaviours and emotions. This influence is done from astral telepathical connections with victims, to various technologies that alter a person ́s state of mind. The powers that be are doing their best to keep their designs uttermost secret, which is why you will hardly find any information on this in any publications, especially not the mainstream media which they control. Very few know about the this part of human existence and even less want to accept it. However, there are people on Earth now who have chosen to reincarnate here to let people know the truth about their existence. We have done so at great risk, which is why we are few, as we too can be trapped into the complex construction of the Trap System. Even the initiated can lose their knowledge and insights of spiritual connections and Higher Souls from one life to the next. The reason for that is because the human body is manufactured to be very limited and is not generally capable of accessing its soul to any significant degree. However, a Soul Fragment must be in place in any Human Body for that body to live and function, and it is this soul fragment that holds the key to us unlocking the doors of the trap system. The Origins of Man and the various Gods and Entities In the beginning existed only the one Mind, the Creator, the Cause of all existence. Let ́s go with the scientific idea and say it was the big bang. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Whatever it was created powerful energies that manifested and designed other forms of existence. But these other forms of existence, what we call Gods, spawned from the Minds of the Creator. In turn the Gods created life which is how we have this physical existence on Earth. The Gods had different ranks and representations together with different polarities and functions. Our ancient ancestors understood this and believed that by concentrating on those ”Energies” you can ultimately enable the idea or desire to manifest. When The One, the creator, split into different fragments it caused duality – nothing can exist without an opposite. Therefore we have negative energy and positive which in turn causes Good and Evil. Since Creation has evolved through countless levels of manifestations and different life forms, it has created Beings who are different in nature from other Beings – simply because their origins of polarity are opposite. Therefore we get good and evil. It exists all over the Universe, not just here on Earth in the human race, but on many levels in other spiritual planes. This has lead to some Beings being termed here as the Good Ones, and some as the Evil Ones . It goes on at many levels between the Gods themselves, and indeed all the way down here between people of the Earth. Some of the Gods believe they are the True God because of have forgotten, or not truly realized, their true origins. It is the same for us in the physical World – we have forgotten where we came from and ultimately we do not know who we are or what we are actually capable of – and believe me, our capabilities are more amazing than you can imagine! In essence, all Life is One, simply due to everything existing within the One Mind, the First Cause, and thus all and everything is connected to each other. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Therefore all life has equal potential, meaning that even you can be a Creator, a God with the ability to manifest whatever you desire in your own World and reality. It is a complex topic, and there is a lot of confusion between Mankind and other Beings which has caused many problems for many lifeforms. It is the programming of the Mind that keeps you in the physical body, yet this also is true for the astral body, as the astral body is not the Soul or your True Self any more than your physical body. Nevertheless, you are still a spiritual being trapped in your physical body because your mind has been programmed to belief you cannot not exist outside of your physical body. There will always be some people who agree with what I am saying, and some who don't. Others want it to be true, but dares not believe it in case other people think they are crazy. It is impossible to convince anybody they can explore other dimensions of the Universe if they simply choose not to believe it. And it is your choice whether you want to accept what I am saying or dismiss it. However, I must say that if you choose to ignore your gift, you will miss out on many amazing experiences! For me it doesn't matter if you believe what I say or not. This book is not intended to force you into believing anything, but to make you aware of the possibilities and to give you the tools so you can experiment. What you choose to do with this information is entirely up to you. One thing I do hope you believe is that t he most important thing you can ever study is yourself; and the best person to listen to is You. This is something that you do instinctively yet are sometimes unaware of. One word of advice: Don ́t listen to your head, listen to your heart. You feel that something is right, you don ́t think it! This is something you can develop and learn to trust through spiritual work and rituals like the ones at the end of this book. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"But in the meantime let me tell you more about how the Trap System works and how we are controlled. The Illusion of the Lower Astral Realm In the lower astral realms we know as Earth, good and evil is an illusion. It has been created to keep us here. Yet, you can say they are real, as they do exist in your mind even in their illusional form. In a sense, it ́s the same way as a fantasy where you make something up in your mind that does not exist in your physical world - yet at the same time it does exist since you just made it up in your mind in the form of said fantasy. On Earth we are part of someone else's fantasy, but one we all contribute to because of the soul fragment that ultimately came from the Creator – The One Mind. However, you are controlled through programming and the illusions that you live in, even though the people that control us are also living in the illusion. Therefore, they have no more right to control you then you do to control them. Some of the people that control you are often referred to as the ”Elite” and some of them are the ones working with the Elite because they too have been controlled by the Elite to oversee the illusions that are designed to control the rest of us. In essence, the Elite are abusing the system. The original system that was created by ”God,” the original Creator, was to allow the soul fragments the chance to explore the Universe and experience different forms of life. However, the Evil Ones decided to abuse the system for their own gains by manipulating and controlling other soul fragments. And so we have the Trap System. But there is a way out and I truly believe that eventually everyone will be free. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Thankfully, some people on this prison planet of ours are already free and are doing their best to teach others. These so called enlightened beings can explain what is happening simply because they have observed the Good and Evil from many points of view. However, it does not come without its dangers. Spirit guides, angels, ascended masters etc are more often than not within the trap system themselves and thus also \"prisoners.\" The difference is they believe they are from a higher plane of existence and are free. But as long they are individuals in a human body, they are not true Selves, as only Oneness is True Self. Such beings are only to be found within the lower astral planes, however, they are aware of the higher trust can help guide people towards their True Self after death. Regarding your imprisonment in a physical body, I'm talking about matters that took place in the very distant past before your first physical incarnation. It was at this moment you allowed your soul and your True Self to enter the physical world in the body of a human being. However, you were lured and blindly believed what you were told by the Gods of those times. Fortunately, some souls recognised the trap and escaped, but continue to return to help mankind understand the true nature of their origins and abilities. We find example of this in the ancient world, such as the Pyramids in Egypt, Mexico and Peru. Some of you will know these original peoples as the Atlanteans. With these amazing structures they left clues and more and more people are slowly beginning to realize that there is more to our existence than this mundane life we experience on Earth. More and more people are learning of their True Origins and returning to the Source of All One. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"When the evil entities created by the fragmented original Mind eventually came upon Earth and discovered how mankind is programmed, they realised that it would be easy to manipulate us. Although the rulers have changed from time to time, they have always been negative energies, power-hungry and sinister. That is why war and murder of the innocent exists right the way through recorded history. The agenda of the ruling Elite is to gain more power and control by making people work for them without even knowing it. Some are even worshipped by us as Gods which further empowers them because we give them more energy. On Earth they mostly use religious and spiritual institutions, politics, media and money to suck up our energy. Their God in a sense is money because everybody relies on money to live. Yet in reality it has been created by the system and is actually worth nothing. With religions you are worshipping them under the pretence of you worshipping the Creator God. They also run the larger industries, governments and such which they can manipulate to their advantage and keep control by feeding the rest of us suggestions and lies they know we are open to believe. But these lies are merely a distraction from understanding your True Self. As I have previously explained, I disagree that we were physically incarnated here to \"learn\" anything at all. We could learn very wel l without these physical bodies as the astral realms of the lower levels are so close one can hardly tell the difference. So there is no need for a physical body other than to limit the True Soul so that it cannot obtain or retain spiritual knowledge. If you consider the fact that most people live their present live without any memory or knowledge of their previous lives, then reincarnation is a complete and utter failure. Learning comes from Higher Con sciousness and is independent of Physical conditions. We are all eternal beings with limitless knowledge and power 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"than enables us to explore the endless areas of existence – something we are all capable of if only we learn how to separate break free from the physical body we are trapped inside. The only lesson to really learn here, is that we are failing to find our true selves, and that true knowledge comes from much deeper aspects of our Being than blindly wandering around on Earth. Simply living does not teach you anything about your true power. They Elite entities are smart and have many ways to distract us so we don ́t discover the truth. They manipulate and control us in many ways ranging from spiritual means to school education, news & media, foods and the mind altering substances they put in them, vaccinations and health institutions that hand out harmful medicines made by pharmaceutical companies. They control us with technology such as sound frequencies, radiations, water systems, anything they can alter and pollute. They manufacture products to make your mind dull, filled with apathy, more open for suggestion, and trustworthy of the media, leaders and so on. I applaude those of you who do not blindly believe everything we are told. In fact I highly praise people who follow their own intuition and encourage people not to listen to what they are being told, but to conduct their own research. I would even advise you to conduct your own research into what I am telling you in this book. Some of the things I have told you, such as how we are controlled by a corrupt Elite is easy to discover. All you need to do is type into Google the name a major company, bank or politician plus ”corruption,” and you will find numerous news items that demonstrate the dishonesty of these cheats. Other things I am explaining to you are not as well written about and thus will have to be a matter of opinion and discovery. Therefore, I suggest you 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"take some of the things I tell you into consideration and listen to your inner guide. Over time, if you go looking for answers, you will be surprised what you will learn and the insights that you gain. T his world has its share of gullible people. And many of them write about what they are told for other gullible people to believe. During your research read widely and don ́t just take one person ́s opinion as the truth. To get on the right spiritual path you have to decide what is right for you and follow you instincts. Eventually it will all become clear and you will re-establish your contact with the All, your true Oneness. Evil is a lower level reality, indeed, but because of the lower level God wanting to have the powers and control of the Creator God. The lust grew, and as his power grew he took advantage of mankind in every way he could. You are NOT here for any ”purpose” - you are here because you are TRAPPED, in the ILLUSIONS and PROGRAMMING. The only time you will \"ascend\" or go \"further\" is when you realize this and manage to keep your awareness with you at the time of death. The only thing you will learn here is what deception, lies and illusions really are - not because you are \"supposed to\", but because you have been forced to. Y et your true purpose is in a higher realm of experience, your real selves are cleaner and more pure. here you are just a small grain of your own selves, if even that. You barely know even the slightest thing about yourself and your origins - and the few things you do know are mostly lies. Remember, in your current understanding of life you are in one of the lowest forms of existence. The good news however is that you can learn how to achieve higher realms of existence and create your own reality. As the Greek playwright Euripeds wrote, ”In each of us is a God.” 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"You do have these powers within you because in the end you are all One and part of the Ultimate Source, thus you can control and dictate your own lives if you want to - as long you learn how to. The first thing you have to do is accept you live in a world of lies and deceit. The second thing you need to do is to commit yourself to finding your true self, even though it takes some time to get to the core. I would expect that most of you reading this book are already aware there is \"something\" beyond your normal waking reality otherwise you wouldn ́t have been drawn to this book. You already know there is something beyond your \"dreams\" but perhaps you don ́t know how to look further than the realms of the physical world and experience a completely new aspect of yourself. There is no need for me to ask you to believe anything, nor is there any need for me to ask you to disbelief anything, that is your free will. I am here because I have experienced the many layers of the astral world and have visited other dimensions and want to pass on my experiences and knowledge to help make you journey somewhat easier. My purpose here is to serve you, bring you that spark of inspiration and self- realization that you all have within. I will teach you how to connect with yourself and come into balance with your being, harmony and Creation. Personally it is irrelevant for me if you believe me or not . I have nothing to gain from the decisions you make, nor will I lose anything. Only you have something to gain and something to lose. I am not here to make you believe a single word of what I say, but for those of you that I do resonate with, you already know what you need to do. When I say there is a lot of deceit out there, I am sure most of you would agree. Am I a deceiver? That is something you will decide for yourself. It is 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"good to be skeptical because when you look within yourself you will find a combination of tools that help you discover great things without ever needing help from others. However, especially in the early stages many people do benefit from some guidance. I, and many other spiritual teachers are here to help you on the way towards learning about yourself and understanding the divine laws that empower you and allow you to live in accordance with them - and thus reach higher levels of insights and understanding, as well as improving your own condition in every way. In the Trap System you are designed to work against yourselves, not because you want to or chose to do so freely, but because you are manipulated to think in a certain way. You are a prisoner sitting in a dark cell with a key to unlock the door in the corner. You don ́t know the key is there because you have never looked for it. I am here to help you search for the key and unlock the door. There are many other spiritual teachers like me who have gained true knowledge. But there are also spiritual teachers you offer guidance with the sole gain of making money. Be cautious who you work with and what you believe. Do not believe that anything is the Truth unless you feel it is the Truth. Learn to trust your instinct and you will know the truth. Even if something ”rings true” it does not make it true. In fact a lot of what seems to be true on the surface has been constructed that way for you and is often the complete opposite of what can be considered ”truthfulness.” Some people look up to spiritual teachers as if they are Gods, when in actual fact we are all Gods. What we understand to be God does not come here or \"visit\" you to help out. When the Bible says that God is omnipresent it is a veiled meaning to suggest you are your own God. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"W e are all co-creators, but there is what you can consider the Creator of the physical world, as well as numerous other Creators upwards on many levels in the higher planes of existence. There are also many out there who want you to believe they are your Creator or God, higher beings such as angels and aliens. But many of these non-physical beings and forms of consciousness from other planes are ”negative energies.” That poses us a slight problem and is the reason why there are so many failed predictions and disinformation coming from so-called ”gurus,” ”masters” and ”new age channelers.” Most people will blindly accept whatever they are told by ”higher authorities,” – but so do people who come into contact with entities – and like I said, some entities have negative energy and should not be trusted. This is of course is unfortunate, and those among you whom may be in contact with other entities should show extreme caution. At this level of existence everyone who is in this physical world is confronted with lies and deceit. The same is true of the spirit world. There are exceptions to this of course. You will find spiritual gurus in the physical world and spirit guides in the astral planes that are here to help and guide you. Very few people existing in this level of existence are in contact with higher beings or the Source, but there are plenty who are in contact with lower beings that pretend to be \"higher\" and thus give you false ideas of what they are - and what YOU are. And that is how you can identify negative entities. The same goes for your so called after life - in fact most people who find themselves free of reincarnation after death are located at lower levels of existence and are very close to the physical world. In most cases they live their lives there almost identically to how they did when they were here. The surroundings and landscapes and structures of the lower astral realms are 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"very similar to those of the physical one. Here too the deception and lies runs deep. This can be useful to have in mind both for your remaining ti me here as well as when you cross over to the next experience of existence - if you will just be able to keep yourself aware when doing so and remain conscious. In essence, to put it simply, Life is a preparation for Death. T o break free of the Trap System when you die and cross over into your next stage of existence you should request yourself to experience your True Form, your Real Spiritual Essence, and immediately fly as far away from Earth as you can. In order to do this you need to practice spirit travel in this life on a regular basis. By practising spirit travel you will be able to retain awareness and consciousness of your true Self at the time of death. What you need to avoid is falling into an unconscious dreamy state of being and go through reincarnation again. You also want to avoid being trapped in the lower levels of existence such as the lower astral planes which serves the purpose of keeping you trapped until you once again get reincarnated. You need to venture away from all familiar forms, towards realms of only pure consciousness where no being has any form and no form exists. Though, a being that is self-aware, can maintain himself in a state of freedom even in lower astral planes, and avoid the cycle of reincarnation, there are people living in astral realms that are wonderful and beautiful in every aspect, and have been so for thousands of years and longer. But these planes are still part of the lower level illusion of existence and not the True Form of Self. It is not even a merging with ones Higher Soul. You need to merge all your soul fragments with your Higher Soul, the real True Self that exists on a higher plane which is outside of the system that keep people trapped here. Then you are truly free, then you are truly One, 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"and Yourself, ready to explore the real existence and freedom beyond all the deception and lies, and move on towards the Source itself. You can retain memory of past lives, of the spiritual realms, of your Higher Soul, and so on even here in your physical body. There are meditations and exercises one can perform that puts you in direct contact with your true self so that you will be able to explore and understand yourself and gain great insight on reality and illusions. Many of these exercises can be found on my website under the Topic ”Meditations, rituals & self development.” The famous \"light\" at death also seems to be part of the trap system. There is no need to enter any light to go anywhere. When you die, simply tell yourself you want to experience your true spiritual essence, your real higher self. Tell yourself you want to merge with the Source, or experience the true God above all Gods. Remember also that your loved ones are always with you as they are all part of you and All, so you can always reunion with them for a while on the lower astral planes where you still find yourself experiencing life. Now you know about the trap system you can start to take your first steps to freedom and connecting with your Higher Presence. And I will explain more about that in the next chapter. 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Pineal Gland & Third Eye: Secrets previously unspoken of The Third Eye Chakra, the energetic center located and connected directly with the physical Pineal Gland, is something most people have heard of and are somewhat familiar with. Specially in todays spiritual movements, new age scene, and the search for \"self\" this is something that is constantly spoken about and always comes up in teachings about psychic abilities, meditation, spiritual practices and so on. However, people are commonly only told one part of the truth about the pineal gland. In fact, I do not believe anyone before me has ever told the other side of the story. The common knowledge is that the Third Eye is an important chakra to \"activate\" in order to reach spiritual insights and experiences, and that stimulating the Pineal Gland can be one way to achieve this. It is also widely known that two ways of activating the pineal gland is through use of psychedelic substances, physical exercise and through meditation and energy work. Whilst the above is true there is more to the pineal gland that we are not told about. Now prepare yourself because some of you will be shocked, whereas for others it will be something a ”Eureka!” moment. Then there are others that will laugh it off and ridicule it thinking that I am just making things up. But what I will say next for me is the truth as far as I have come to observe and understand. You believe what you want. The Pineal Gland is in fact part of the ”Trap System”! There, I said it, now let me explain why it is part of this Trap System. It ́s purpose in our physical bodies is so it can be used as a control mechanism to influence from a spiritual plane, and through psychic means. Without the Pineal Gland and Third Eye, we would be completely unable to have spiritual 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"experiences whatsoever, therefore we would not be able to be controlled through spiritual means - psychic forces, external energies, astral powers and so on. So by having implemented the Pineal Gland into the Human Bodies, those whom we can call the ones \"In Control\" are able to achieve great control and influence upon each and every person through methods that would not otherwise be possible. I have spoken of External Influences before, and this is how such External Influences can reach us mentally, spiritually, psychologically and emotionally. The Pineal Gland and Third Eye serves as the window TO the Soul, not FROM the Soul, in the sense that it has been created directly to influence us and NOT to let us have spiritual experiences or develop ourselves. The whole spiritual aspect of the Pineal Gland and Third Eye Chakra is simply a flaw which was not intended to let us gain greater understanding and spiritual insights, but to control us. The story of Adam and Eve in the Bible attests to man ́s understanding of his True Self when he eats the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. God, our Creator, did not intend for us to discover our power, but wisdom, represented by a snake in all cultures around the world, found it ́s way into man ́s mind through The Third Eye Chakra. Strongly related, while writing about this specific topic, is the truth behind Hypnosis. The reason people can be hypnotized at all is simply because of its ability to manipulate, control and brain wash people. This implemented mental system also has its own flaws in that it too can make be used to create positive attitudes such as many self help tapes we find on the shelves in bookstores. This is because hypnosis also stimulates the Third Eye and people have the ability to utilise the third eye for positive gains. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The C reation of the Human Body To summarize very quickly, the Human Body was created for a way to control the Soul that inhabits it, therefore imprisoning the Soul in the physical world. The human body is designed to be extremely limited and as far removed from its True Self as possible with little understanding of the ability is evolve and this great difficulties in developing. As we discussed in the last chapter, reincarnation serves as a part of the Trap System to keep people in physical bodies, and larger parts of the Spiritual Realms or Astral Planes are \"illusionary\" in the sense that they too serve as a Trap to keep people on lower levels of Existence until they are, for lack of better words, ”sucked back into the womb and reborn imprisoned on this filthy Earth.” With that, I will leave you to contemplate and research my previous material, and see for yourself whatever you feel. A Recap of the Illusions and Deceit of Life, Death, Existence & what keeps you in the Trap System It is the programming of the Mind that keep you in the physical body, yet this also is true for the astral body, as the astral body is not the Soul or your True Self any more than your physical body. Though, nevertheless, you are still spiritual beings trapped currently in physical bodies because of this Programming of the Mind. Good and evil exists all over the physical realm, I do not mean that is is simply something that exist here on Earth or in the Human race. In fact it does exist on many levels, what I am referring to is higher spiritual planes of existence where it can not exist due to the specific vibrational levels, or frequencies if you want, that these planes exist within. 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The most important thing you can ever study is Yourself, and the best person to ever listen to is You, and more people should spend more time on both those things. Good and evil is an illusion that exists in the fantasy you make up in your mind. It does not exist until you make it exist in the form of said fantasy. These \"others\" are those whom are controlling you through your programming and the illusions you live within, even though they themselves also are living in the illusions and do not know their own true being. Some of them are the ones we refer to as the \"Elite\" and some of them are the ones working with the \"Elite\" from other planes of existence, yet within the same Illusion. The ruling elite are abusing the system that was created to control you by the \"God\" I previously mentioned, the original Creator left but the System was still in place and kept you here and made you easy to abuse, manipulate and control, and thus these entities took the chance when they discovered this. The so called enlightened beings can explain what is happening simply because they can observe the Good and Evil from their own point of view after visiting the lower realms of the Universe. The problem is they too can be exposed to the deceit when they are down here, yet it is non existing in their own higher realm, even though that does not mean they have no knowledge of it. I n the very distant past before your first physical incarnation you were lured into the physical bodies of mankind and blindly believed what you were told by the God of those times. Some managed to escape as they could see what was coming and did not get tricked. Those people are what we know as Atlanteans. And now you are learning from this mistake and slowly realizing it and on your way to let the clouds clear and let the light in from your True Origins and the Source of All. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Here on earth they mostly use the religious and spiritual institution and banking and money for their models which are put in place for control and power. Their God in a sense is money which has been created for you to worship. They also run the larger industries, governments and media to keep their control in place and feed the people with more suggestions and lies that we are open to believe. I highly praise people who follow their own intuition and highly encourage people to not listen to what anybody tells them but to look up the information for yourself and listen to your inner guide. You may want to take some things into consideration as it may be useful for certain new insights but don ́t forget the world has its share of gullible people and some of the things you read will have been written by those who have been deceived. You are NOT here for any \"purpose,\" you are here because you are TRAPPED, in the ILLUSIONS and PROGRAMMING. The only time you will ascend or develop is when you realize this and manage to keep your awareness with you at the time of death. Your overall purpose is to discover higher self. In reality you are cleaner and more pure. On Earth you are a small grain of your True Self. You barely know even the slightest about yourself and your origins - and the few things you do know are mostly lies and deceit. The GOOD thing is that you can also create and be Gods, as you too have these powers within you because in the end you are all One and part of the Ultimate Source, thus you can control and dictate your own lives if you want to - as long you learn how to. The first thing you need to do is to realize you exist in a world of lies and deceit. The next you need to do is to move towards your truer self, even though it takes some time to get to the real core. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Reincarnation: The truth behind past-lives Memory Loss Our past and future lives a re determined by several factor. There is what we commonly know as Karma and there is our own beliefs and determination. I have determined - or chosen - to be specific people for the last few thousand years with the purpose of teaching Mankind to gain the necessary knowledge and insight to understand themselves. With each incarnation I have been able to perfect my teachings. A l ong time ago, other beings came to Earth and trapped Earth beings and enslaved them. They implemented mind program systems, soul capture, reincarnation, and systems to keep Mankind as slaves, not knowing their true Origins or Selves. You may have heard these being called the Anunnaki, Aliens, False Gods, and so on and their home is Nibiru, Hell, or even Heaven. After they left, the System was still in place, and humankind still suffers from Amnesia. We are victims of Mind Control, Reincarnation and Amnesia effects. These beings also return to Earth and abuse the system for their own agendas. The System is structured to deceive people from the truth and lead them to lower astral realms after death. It is designed to keep them within the trap system through reincarnation whereby you return as slaves and prisoners of Earth without remembering anything you learned in your previous existence. What went wrong for the creators of the Trap System was that we discovered we were in a slave system, a world created by greedy and ruthless gods. The symbolism of the Adam and Eve story, the Snake and the Tree symbolises Human Kind waking up from the Illusion, by experiencing their divine self through kundalini rising (The snake, also called Raising the Kundalini Snake). 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"In the story, the Tree of Knowledge opens itself (the Tree of Life in the Kabbalah) up with the gift of knowledge in the Apple, or Fruit of Knowledge, which indeed explains that all they did was to discover their true being; see the false from the real, good from evil, and so on. This in turn enabled them to further develop themselves spiritually and rise above the Prison World they were put within. Of course, gaining this Knowledge and understanding is the whole reason the God of the Bible got so furious. A loving God would obviously have let them be their True spirit with all knowledge from the very beginning. But evil Gods trap their spirits in physical limited bodies that suffer from the laws of reincarnation, amnesia, and ignorance. Polarity exists on lower planes of Existence due to the Source splitting itself and making new energies form so that in turn new creators of different polarities are formed. This continues all the way down to the physical world, and is why we have Good and Evil and so on. The Source, the True God, is Oneness and neither Good or Evil can exist as they are one and the same. But outside the source polarities are split up within different entities and individuals. Though we all have good and evil sides, some of us have more of one polarity than the other. Reincarnation and physical existence has nothing to do with learning, and Earth is not a School but a Prison. It was forced upon us. If we were here to learn it would only be logical that we remembered our past lives so we would not do the same mistakes over and over again thus fail to progress spiritually. Many people are still on the same level mentally and spiritually as thousands of years ago because of this. It also causes other unwanted effects such as lost souls after death, confusion, suffering, problems, all things a true god of love would not even consider putting our true spiritual infinite selves through. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"We are eternal beings, with infinite life, and when we free ourselves from physical imprisonment we can continue our path towards our true spiritual development . We we realise we are true spiritual beings with All knowledge about ourselves and our past we can pass to the next existence with intact memories whereby we can properly progress and advance on the spiritual planes of existence rather than having to start over all the time. I have fallen into the trap system and experienced lower life forms such as drug addiction. One of the problems with reincarnation is the memory- blockage, and erasure and resulting amnesia. Thus, it is rare for even advanced beings to remember who they are. It takes time for some memories to surface enough for that being to start realizing who he is, or at least enough to start pursuing a spiritual path that can lead to more of his memories coming back until he eventually finds and remembers his true spiritual essence and the way in which to remember everything. So, that means there are spiritual systems of Earth that are useful for such purposes but one should be aware of the mentioned traps and deceit built into the whole System, even advanced beings have fallen back to low states of being and are now trapped here without knowledge of why they are here or from where they came. You could be one of them. And in the end, all of you are advanced spiritual beings, souls coming from the Highest Source, you are just different fragments of the One Source making yourself experiencing individuality and different stages of \"development.\" 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Our Multidimensional Existence An overview over our Higher Soul W e have a multidimensional reality which we sometime lock into during moments of déjavu. This is the effect of different causes from one dimension to another. One of them can be a connection with one of your other selves, or soul fragments which relates to your interdimensional being. This is the most common cause. For a short moment of time you receive input from one of your other experiences; which even though time appears to separate them is actually happening simultaneously. That is what is meant by the expression, ”Call me Legion, for I am many.” In r eality we are more than \"one\" physical and spiritual being. This in a way is a myriad of parallel alternate versions of yourself existing in the same moment. Their development unfolds together with your own and all your other selves are connected to a \"higher self\" or \"soul,\" thus each of you has a soul fragment. Ultimately, we develop ourselves inwards, and not outwards, meaning that each of your own selves will not \"expand\" in consciousness from mental and spiritual progress, but rather \"implode\" into that \"higher soul.\" The experiences of all your alternate selves will at some moment merge with this \"higher soul\" and create a Oneness where you will experience yourself from a completely new perspective and see yourself as the true being you really are. Then, as this new \"Oneness,\" you \"ascend\" to higher realms and become free of all physical bonds on Earth whereby you understand how you are able continue the spiritual and mental development and understanding of your True Being. But there is more. After this \"Oneness\" is achieved in the higher 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"realms,\" there are new things to discover about reality of Being and Existence in other alternate or parallel dimensions. Because each of your existences contain a soul-fragment, or astral body and various other energy bodies, which are connected to the \"true\" soul we have the knowledge of are other souls to explore. And yes, each soul fragment is unique despite consisting of all time-frames from the past, present and future. In other words all your earlier incarnations and future reincarnations are connected to the ”Higher self,” living their experiences and existences on their own, without knowledge of the other soul fragments, or alternate selves, regardless of each soul fragment developing towards the Oneness with the Higher Soul, or True Self. Once that is achieved, all your alternate versions will merge with your Higher Soul and become the Oneness, thus able to move on towards further development, understanding and insights, as well as experiences on a higher level of existence. I appreciate this idea is difficult to get your head around, but think of your Higher Soul as the \"host\", and all the alternate versions on the lower planes are the guests. The tree example I used earlier in the book is a prime example of how the alternative system works. The tree is the host and has branches which are the alternative dimensions, and on the branches grow many leaves which are our alternative selves. At a certain point the life force, or sap, will be sucked out of the leaf (you) and back into the tree (higher soul) whereby they become one again. The shell of the leaf withers, falls and dies. But the tree does not sprout new leaves immediately, instead it evolves to another state of being - the Higher Soul – which encompasses all the life-force and sap (knowledge) it received back from its individual leaves, or soul fragments. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"This means that you are the soul fragment of your true Higher Soul. And at the same time there exists different other soul fragments in other bodies spread around in time and space living their own separate individual lives, not being aware of each other. However, every soul fragment plays an important role in the energy it feeds back to the Higher Soul. Our Higher Soul may in fact be a Higher Soul Fragment of yet another Higher Soul - and our Soul Fragments may become equal to Higher Souls on ascension after physical death, meaning they too get the ability to spread new Soul Fragments into new bodies, structurally in a way similar to how you can imagine the construction of a pyramid with one single slab of stone at top branching out into more and more stone slabs as you move downwards – with the upper lone stone representing the Higher Soul, and the stones expanding down below different Soul-Fragments. Further Explanation of the Soul Fragment This is perhaps where things become more complicated so forgive me if I insult your intelligence. It is not intentional and I imagine most of you understand where I am going, but as this is a very important section, I have to appeal to readers of varying degrees of understanding. We have already established that you are a soul fragment of a Higher Soul so let ́s start from there. At the same time other soul fragments exist in other dimensions, and these soul fragments have also been spawned from the same Higher Soul as you. Therefore several people live at the same time but in a parallel dimension and simultaneous versions of each other. This means that if any of the soul fragments experienced a past life regression they would all return to the same Higher Soul that spawned them. This explains why many people claim to have been various famous historical figures in the past. Most people would think only one of them could be telling the truth, and the rest either lie or be imagining it, but with the concept of 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the Higher Soul sending out Soul Fragments, one soul fragment can return to this existence with the knowledge they have learnt from another soul fragment from a previous existence. Therefore when a soul fragment is sent back to Earth or other dimensions by the Higher Soul they can take with them the experiences of another soul fragment from a past life and what it learnt from an alternative dimension. The incarnation of a soul fragment caught in the Trap system normally fails in finding or experiencing the Higher Soul it belongs to, ones True Self to call it that. Mostly, incarnated soul fragments, in the form of human people, will at best have some past lives memories going no further up the levels of their existence than that of a previous incarnation as a soul fragment on Earth or somewhere else in the physical realms, sometimes other planets. When it comes to the idea of reincarnation, this solution also solves the problems some would face when trying to mathematically calculate how many people are presently incarnated on Earth in comparison to how many physical people were around in more ancient days, where obviously the population was much smaller. Because of Earth ́s trap system, soul fragments from higher levels of the pyramid reincarnate from previous or alternate lives thus the population of Earth expands because the Higher Souls needs to spawn new Souls on Earth in the form of soul fragments in order to support the growing population of human bodies. Thus, the fewer people in the smaller population of the past are now represented in more physical bodies in the larger current population thanks to having split into more Soul Fragments that inhabits these bodies. At a deeper level, this of course also mean that we ALL are the SAME and ONE, considering that we have all been spawned from Higher Souls which 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"reach back to the Origin and the time when there was just the One Source, or as it is referred to in religion, God. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"External Influences & Unseen Forces Th e Elite that rule the Earth, the evil energies and entities spawned by the duality effect, are in control because they are using different forms of external influences against the population. This is mainly the use of spiritual means such as telepathy whereby they can implement thoughts of their own into your minds so that you believe they are your own thoughts. They can also direct your \"spiritual experiences\" by creating false spiritual realms - such as Christianity - for you to experience using deceitful guides. That is not to say that Jesus himself was deceitful, but the church that use him as a spearhead can use him in their own way to deceive. Indeed, a vast majority of all channeled information that is popular in the New Age scene that is supposedly independent of the Elite controlled religions are results of this deceiving method, and these entities being channeled are usually untrustworthy because they only serve the purpose of introducing with new belief systems to you that feed your spiritual hunger. The thing is s piritual hunger is the natural part of a humans psyche and at your core you are a deeply spiritual being. This is a subconscious knowledge people can feel. The reasons why religions are so popular is because they satisfy the Spiritual Hunger. But in the reality of the True Self, the only way to discover true reasoning is through meditation as this is where you will find your True Self through your guides and intuition. These mentioned negative entities will try to influence your mind to create specific thought patterns, behaviors and emotions through astral telepathy and various technologies just as much as religious control, the media, and so many other things in the physical realm does. Spiritual e xperiences such as meetings with Angels and Demons, to Guides and Advanced Beings who deem to tell you the \"truth\" actually take place on very low levels of Existence, and are far from what anything the Higher Self is really about. It is just a mere weak reflection of a fragment of Totality. That is why so many murderers and serial killers say they were visited by God and told to kill. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"But you will be pleased to know that there are ways of differentiating the bad from the good, both from external influences and other such unseen forces and methods of mind control. Mind Control Influences Mind Control is ver y much an external influence and there are numerous ways of how the corrupt Elite inflict these on you in order to distract you from discovering your true self. To some of you most of the following will be very obvious. To others there may be a few surprises you need to be aware of. Religion Relig ion is still very popular in many parts of the world because it goes hand in hand with spiritual experiences. The problem is it is means of thought control. Despite that fact being self-explanatory to the majority of people it is very effective at making others follow certain lifestyles, beliefs, personality and dedication. But that is because there is some truth in it – albeit very misguided! Tec hnology Many forms of technology exists in the physical for mind control . These are basically anything based on \"wavelength\" technology, which tunes into vibrations. Vibration affect everything, including the mind and how it behaves. Examples on this type of technology is sound waves. Most of you will know how sounds can induce different states of mind such as relaxation or excitement, especially from the musical industry, but sound goes much deeper than we realise and can be used in frequencies that have both mental and physical effects upon people. Some of these frequencies make people more \"dumbed down\", and open for suggestion by putting them in a hypnotic state so to speak. These sounds also are effective since they can be executed in frequencies of too high or too low vibrations to actually \"hear\" with the human ears, yet they still affect you. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Many people will recognize this if they have been doing meditations where they have used technology such as hemi-sync, binaural beats etc, to achieve various altered states of mind. Programs such as Neuro-Programmer, Brainwave Generator and I-Doser are good examples on software using this technology. Sounds can be used at frequencies too high or low for the human ear to hear it, and thus make it rather disguised, and still give various mental or physical effects on those whom are being submitted to it. Of course this goes for other technologies too based on the same principles, such as radio frequencies and other types of emitting signals that can't be directly heard or seen. The brain will automatically \"tune in\" or \"synchronize\" itself to such signals and \"align\" you with whatever that signal is supposed to \"align\" you to, such as making you more prone to suggestions and hypnotic commands, or to make you more aggressive, or create nervousness and fear and so on. Radio waves and related technology is also very hazardous to the mind and body and can be used to directly influence and control people. It is very effective since it is both invisible and undetectable without specific technological equipment. The \"Flicker Method\" relates to sound waves and radio waves etc since it too is part of the \"wave-based\" mind control technology. An important \"extension\" of the \"flicker\" method mentioned is the use of SOUND to achieve the same effects. Not only sound for that matter, but basically most types of technologies using \"frequencies\" or \"waves.\" You find the flicker method used in TV's and monitors. Light, sound, frequencies, vibrations are all very powerful tools that can be used and abused to create various mental and physical effects in humans. In addition, there is what is known as the ”Spiritual Method,” which is widely practised by the Elite. Needless to say, this effect is mostly ignored by those studying these matters, but an extremely large amount of energy is transmitted through psychic energies which carry a specific charge that will result in a specific effect when it is received. 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The \"spiritual method\" is widely practised and used to control and affect the population. It can be as extreme as actually \"injecting\" various thoughts, ideas and presumptions etc into a victims mind - even if this sounds silly or impossible to most people, the sad truth is that it is one of the most common methods. From my own involvement with governm ents, secret societies and orders together with my own spiritual and mental practices, I can categorically say that to me, the use of mind control through psychic frequencies is an absolute certainty. I have seen it performed and I have experienced it first- hand. The specific ways of initiating a \"spiritual attack\" against people differs. It can be done with symbolism (which is found everywhere and charged with very specific energies) to more complex rituals and ceremonies. The 9/11 attacks for example was a \"mega ritual\" that served several purposes. Spiritual warfare however is the hidden impact of the whole event. The good thing is that your mind (mental-spiritual) is the most powerful thing (including \"weapon\") in the universe, and you can protect yourself against everything mentioned in this whole section using your mind alone. Sure it takes practice, but now that you are aware of it, I do recommend you take some steps towards using the powers you already have and block such negative energies from being able to reach you. Other External Influences that Affect Thought Patterns Humans are subjected to various external influences, from energies, to entities, and other human beings. The list below gives you an insight into the various things that can affect your mind and the way in which you behave. The Collective Consciousness Carl Jung coined the term ”Collective Consciousness” to describe the effect of the group consciousness of humankind. Because everybody is susceptible to the collective consciousness this can be manipulated by injecting various thought-forms into it, and thus in turn affect a large amount of the 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"population all at once. In a sense, the collective consciousness can be called the \"Master User Interface\" since it doesn't target specific individuals, but the whole group. The Dream World This is connected with the collective consciousness, as well as other aspects that will be mentioned below. In the dream world people are constantly attacked and being taken advantaged of, mind controlled, and programmed. People are very open for suggestions in this state of mind. Hypnosis All people are very open for hypnotic suggestions and commands. It is built into the human psyche and a way to control and manipulate people. Some examples on entities and groups taking advantage of hypnotic commands and subliminal messages are The Media (News, Television, Movies, Internet, etc), Religions, Governments, various Leaders, Politicians, and on non- physical planes you have spirit ent ities such as astral vampires, angels and demons and so on. Archetypes These are entities that are part of the H uman Psyche and relates to the collective consciousness. These influence people in different ways and by different degrees through their psychic interaction with people and the way these entities basically exist and live within the conscious. These are more general and wide-spread energies / entities that affects all of mankind in contrast with angels and demons, astral vampires etc whom are more targeted at specific individuals. The Elite The group of entities in c ontrol of the planet are mainly responsible for putting into effect all the various methods of mind control and creating the physical world with human servant and slaves for those higher up in the 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"ranks. They use all of the methods mentioned above and engage in group rituals to affect the mass population of the planet. The Astral Plane This is connected with most of the above, from archetypes, demons and angels, astral vampires and the dream world to the Elite. A majority of external influence takes part on the Astral Plane because technically this is really where we exist in terms of spirit. There are many levels of Astral Planes and we are always connected to them, and therefore constantly affected by them. In turn we also affect them by our own thoughts and emotions. Again many groups and entities work from there including the \"Gods\" and the highest of our creators and manipulators whom work through all the mentioned methods and levels of existence from their location in the pyramid down to us. Planets and Celestial bodies Planets themselves are actually forms of consciousnesses and can affect the human psyche because they are filled with energies and archetypal entities. A good example is astrology. It is through the understanding of the energies emitted from the planetary bodies that a natal chart and horoscope can be created to tell personal and intimate details about a person ́s life, his past, present and future. Consciousnesses at birth is absorbed from various energies emitted by the different planets and celestial bodies and are implemented and charged into us which in turn become part of our personality and the way they are seen by others. We are charged with energies from planetary bodies at the moment of birth, and depending on the position of the planets, which ones are more close and their distance between each other, different types of energies are merged with the human being. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Some energies will have a stronger impact on you than others, therefore creating the basic makeup of your personality, your state of mind, your destiny and so on. Such planets will continue to affect you throughout your life, but the movement of the planetary bodies and the force of their various energies that you receive from them depend on where you are in the world. This is because some planetary energies are stronger in some parts of the world than in others. You can say that a person is not really himself, or his a pure being, due to these external influences. It is possible to learn how to minimize – or increase – certain energies emitted and received from such planetary bodies. Through this, a person can change his original state of being, or his blueprint, and make him filled with more of the wanted qualities, and less of unwanted qualities whereby you can become closer to your real being. Astral and non-physical influences Astral entities also influence people, and emit energies that are received and implemented in your mind and body. There are many types of non-physical, or astral entities – some of them influencing you on purpose with specific energies, thought patterns which alter the your state of mind. It can be said to be a form of mind control, and very few people will even notice these influences as they seem to be a part of your natural make-up – and thus people generally believe they simply are the way they are because that is how they are. Various diseases, ailments and other problems can also result from being exposed to such external influences by astral entities. One can protect oneself from being influenced by such astral entities, just as with any other external influence. This will usually improve a person ́s well being and certain astral entities are actually beneficial because they can influence you with positive energies that will heal, give insights, and help with anything from physical and mental problems to increasing success and happiness etc. Earth based influences Specific l ocations on Earth are charged with various energies that influence your mind, state of being and health.

As an example, many ancient pyramids and temples are built on top of positive energy spots, improving the people living there, and even giving them more profound spiritual connection. Technological influences Technological man-made devices also influence humans in various ways, mostly negative, as such devices often radiate negative and dangerous energies. Many such devices are built on purpose to manipulate human beings, influence them for mind control, to change their state of mind, and make them easier to maintain power over. Some examples includes radio stations, televisions, broadcasting stations, cell-phones and all different types of antennas, power grids, various electronic devices, computers, and so on. Human influences Human beings themselves greatly affect each other. Thoughts are telepathically emitted and received by others. This can be used for both good and bad, on purpose or unintentionally. As an example, if you have negative thoughts about a person, or even yourself, you will manifest these negatives energies to a greater extent within that person or yourself. On the opposite, having a positive attitude and thoughts about other people and yourself, will manifest positive energies and experiences for such people and yourself. Karmic and Past Life influences Karma is the energetic influence put upon yourself from your actions, whether this is physical actions towards others and yourself, or mental / thought based actions. Past Lives also can carry with you an energetic influence through reincarnations, from past events, experiences and actions – somewhat relating to Karma. This can be balanced out and cleansed through proper self-work. Also, again, such influences can be of both a positive or negative nature, affecting your present life in different ways. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A lot of the negative experiences, emotions, anger, hatred, depression, physical problems, difficulties in life, problematic state of mind and so on, is a direct effect of all the above mentioned external influences constantly being bombarded upon us. Fortunately, there are ways of protecting yourself and being aware of how you are influenced by external sources is the first step to taking the necessary actions to change your situation and improve yourself. Also, remember helping others is helping yourself and by helping yourself you will help others. 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"An Explanation of Ghosts and the After Life Ghosts exist on a lower level of the astral realm very close to the physical one where we live. For the most part ghosts are trapped in the lower realm for various reasons. Some ghosts are not aware they are dead, or they do not know where to go. They are in effect lost souls and have no one to help them to reach a higher astral plane. Other ghosts stay in the lower realm because they want to make contact with their family and loved ones and so on thus stay here on the lower plane. In some instances a g host can manifest and be physically visible, this is done through harnessing the energies in the environment around it when it finds itself here in the physical plane as an energy form. It can gather the molecules around it energetically so that they are structured around the shape of the ghost and thus become more dense and visible by light. Some emit energy in the form of light and thus become visible, but the same principle applies of structuring molecules around its energy core which this light is emitted through. An interesting thing about g hosts is that they can exist and manifest even after their soul has left to a higher plane, or has been reincarnated. This is due to the different layers of our beings, and sometimes an outer shell of energy is left which functions as a hologram imprint in its natural environment even after its former \"occupant\" has left. Thus you have the \"repeater ghosts\" which mechanically do the same action every time they appear. What we see is the energetic shell of the physical body after they have left the lower plane. This shell has a limited consciousness and is directly connected to its original \"occupant.\" This makes it appear and act as the original person, and sometimes, if enough consciousness is left over, it can even communicate. This often leads to people thinking they are in contact with their dead family members and so on, whilst in reality the \"true\" person has already left and gone elsewhere to other realms of existence. Channeling a ghost is merely contact with a \"shadow copy\" of the true person. 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Eventually this shell, or shadow copy, whatever you want to call it, will wear out its energy and dissolve into the Spirit, or the Ether as it has been called, which is the energy field in which the realm exists. In some cases, these \"shells\" can be entered by other entities, and thus they can keep it \"alive\" for a longer period of time and also pretend to be the original person and trick people that get in contact with it. This would in a sense be similar to how a physical body can be possessed by a spirit entity, except you have a spirit body - the shell - being possessed by another spirit entity. While all this happens, the Original Person, would find himself in one of several scenarios: Either he has been reincarnated and entered a new physical body, he is travelling around in the lower astral realms with his astral body, or he has ascended to higher astral realms and continues to have new experiences and insights whilst pursuing a new life as an ascended being. Most people, due to their lack of spiritual knowledge and understanding, find themselves in the lower astral planes after death in a form where they are what we can call \"lost ghosts\" as explained above. And this is the important part - our lives here are really a preparation for death, and we should do our best to gain as much understanding about the afterlife as we can before we enter into it so we will know what to expect and what to do once we are there. With the exception of Buddhism, religions completely disregard preparation of the afterlife and are responsible for people not being able to reach higher astral realms or discover their true self. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Truth about Alien Contact and Channelling The fact of the matter is there is no such thing as aliens on Earth, or for that matter, alien abductions - at least not in the sense that is commonly perceived. Okay, these experiences do occur, just not in the physical sense. They are spiritual experiences happening in the astral realms - or the spirit world. There are three explanations why people have these alien experiences: 1. People experiencing sleep paralysis and spontaneous out of body experiences / astral projections. These people will often feel as if they are paralyzed, can't move or scream, as they are being lifted up from the bed etc, something which they really are - but in spirit, by their astral body separating from their physical body - thus the reason they cannot move the physical body. In this state, hallucinations are common, both visual and audible, and even physical manifestations such as the sense of being touched and so on. People who fear aliens or have seen or read too much about such things already have an impression about them in their mind which allows them to imagine amazing experiences which seem very realistic for them. It is possible to think, feel and really believe you are being abducted by alien beings. In reality you are in a state of consciousness where their thoughts, emotions and fears greatly affects their environment you ́re in and manifests those fears in a dreamlike state - yet in a state of mind that is alert, awake and aware. 2. Another scenario is very similar to that described above, only this time the person is in actual contact with nonphysical entities on the astral realm and perceive these entities as aliens. They are not strictly aliens, but entities that are here with us all the time. Yes, you could consider them alien as they are not physically human, but they don ́t come from another planet either. These entities may act in ways that are perceived as either good or bad. They may have sex with the person for example, as there is a type of being that feeds on sexual energies called Astral Vampires, or \"succubussi,\" and although they are real beings, they are not aliens from other planets. They may also be spiritual 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ascended masters revealing great insights and information to the person, or they may be negative entities such as demons that can bring very unpleasing experiences to the person encountering them. 3. In a very few percentage of cases there are rea l physical beings involved, not aliens, but humans posing as aliens, mostly from the secret governments agencies and various sinister organizations that are carrying out experiments on the population. The experience therefore happens both in physical form where things like implants can be received, or in spiritual form manipulating the astral realms, basically a form of mind control and created illusions with a deeper agenda behind it. In addition to the above experiences, you will also find mentally ill people believing in things that are not real and imagining they are having a true experience, especially when they have dreams which they interpret as alien contact. There is also another issue that should be addressed, and that is when it comes to the people who claim to be in contact with aliens. Usually this is through channelling. Be very aware of this, in almost all cases no aliens are involved in such communication, but rather lower astral entities in the Earthly plane of existence, such as spirits of the dead and astral entities of various sorts who enjoy to play tricks on people. Unfortunately, a lot of people are gullible and blindly believe what they are told by such entities. One example is a certain new-age “alien channeller” that repeatedly fails in her predictions. She means well and is a woman with a good heart and soul, but unfortunately gets fooled by trickster entities. That is of course not to say that aliens do not exist on Earth whatsoever. In fact, mankind should be considered alien due to how we ourselves came here from elsewhere in the Universe, but there is certainly little to none contact by alien beings such like those depicted in popular culture in these modern days. 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Part: 2 – Practical Work, Exercises and M editations Life, a preparation for Death As an introduction to this chapter, I must emphasize my opinion that we should consider our lives on Earth as a preparation for our Death. With that I mean we should spend as much time possible on spiritual practices, esoteric work, understanding the occult, and looking into our past history and origins so that we know and understand how to pass into the afterlife safely and take the knowledge we learn in this life with us. The most important way of preparing for Death and to become familiar with the afterlife is through the practice of Astral Projection, something which will be mentioned a little later. If you look at the Egyptians, they built their pyramids as temples for spiritual development and to learn navigating the after-life. The tombs were used symbolically to “die” by inducing an astral projection from within them, and then as instructed by the high priests look for certain targets such as the alignments towards certain stars and constellations. Perhaps they even travelled there during one of their induced experiences, and reported back to the high priests what they had seen in order to verify their experience and know they were progressing with their preparations for the afterlife and spiritual existence to come? 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Basic Meditation & Energy work One of the most important things when it comes to the development of psychic powers and spiritual abilities is the understanding of and regular exercise of the energy system within you. You can achieve this through traditional meditation which is basically defined as a combination of visualization, altered state of mind and energy work. Here we will start with the very basics of meditation and energy work, as a sort of warm up exercise to get your body, mind and soul used to it, and to actually activate this energy current within you. Regular practice of this technique will strengthen your inner energy and psychic/spiritual powers, just like working out in the gym is making your muscles stronger. The exercise I will present here is very simple, but we need to start slowly in order to build ourselves up. Again I will use the gym as an example; when you first start going to the gym, you don't want to start out with the heaviest weights you can find, because you probably can ́t even lift them. And who knows, if you try too hard you may injure yourself. So, the rule is to start with the very basics and even though it may seem boring for some people, it is at least safe and will guarantee you follow a steady path towards great powers by gradually increasing the complexity of the exercises. This exercise is designed to make you aware of your inner energy that is constantly flows through your entire body. Not even just through you from within, but it is also entering you from outside through the universal source of energy that keeps all life alive and from where life began. We will get more into this concept in later lessons. Step 1. ------- Find yourself a quiet place where you won ́t be disturbed for around 15 to 30 minutes. Make sure there are no annoying noises or disturbing sounds. Unplug your phones so you won't get interrupted. This exercise is best done alone, or if you are not alone ask the other persons around not to disturb you for the next 30 minutes. It doesn't really matter where you do this exercise, 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"as long you have peace and quiet. It can be in your living room, your bedroom, or even far out in the woods by a lake at your secret place of harmony. Step 2. ------- At this point, once you are alone and undisturbed, you are ready to begin. You may do this exercise standing up or sitting down. You can even do it laying down if you prefer, but I would recommend a sitting or standing position as you are supposed to visualize energy coming down from above, through your body, and back up. So find your position, and make yourself comfortable and relaxed. When you are comfortable, try to relax all the muscles in your body. Take deep breaths filling your lungs and holding it in for some seconds, and while exhaling feel all the tension and troubles flow out of your system. Feel the muscles in your body relax. You should do between 15 to 30 of these deep breaths, holding the air in with your lungs filled all the way up for as long you can handle before you blow it out and keep your breath again for as long you can hold before inhaling again. Repeat this process for the mentioned 15 to 30 times until you feel very relaxed and comfortable. You may feel a bit light headed or drowsy from doing this, but don't worry that's normal. For each time you blow the air out of your lungs, imagine all tensions, problems and worries float out from your body, and as you inhale your body is filled with pure fresh new energy cleansing you through your whole being. Step 3. ------- Now it is time to start doing the energy exercise itself. You are completely relaxed, either standing, sitting or laying down. Your tensions and problems have been blown out of your body, and you are filled with a fresh, clean and pure energy. 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Imagine now that above your head floats a brilliant ball of pure white light, a great sphere of good energy, which is filled with love, joy, goodness and strength.

Visualize it and focus on it, and feel it growing stronger and expanding through the connection it has with the Great Source of all Existence, filling up with more love, more spiritual and psychic powers, more purifying and cleansing abilities, and imagine you feel its great shining light touching the top of your head. Stay for a moment in this state, imagining this great powerful bright white ball of light floating above your head. If you can't actually see it in your mind, don't worry, just know that it ́s there, and try to feel it. It is actually more important to feel it there above you, than actually \"seeing\" it. Step 4. ------- You now have a great ball of the most brilliant white light floating above your head with its rays touching your head and forehead.

It ́s filling up in your feet, charging up there, and you feel your whole body vibrating from the majestic and magic spiritual power this light is sending through you.

It is filling you up, connecting your very being with the greatest energies of the universe and God himself. You are becoming pure, powerful and mighty, filled with love and joy and amazing abilities and powers, and all bad thoughts or negative energies you may have had is now being cleansed and burned away from you, flowing out your hands, leaving only the great gift of the energies of love and goodness left within you, and filling you with psychic and spiritual powers, and letting you get in deeper touch with the spiritual world and the universal force which works through you and gives you all of this greatness.

Stay in this state for as long you want until you feel you are cleansed and filled with the great powers and now in direct contact with the divine. Then, when you are ready to get back to normal state, but still keep the powers you have gotten, just take a deep breath, hold it in for a while and blow it out while opening your eyes.

Feel this force coming from the wind when you are out walking, from the sun when it ́s shining upon you, even from the very water itself when it ́s raining. It is all filled with this great power, and cleansing energy, which will empower you and strengthen you as long you just stay aware of it and know you are always connected, and have the energy flowing through you. CONCLUSION: This was our first lesson. If things went as it should, you would have felt and visualized at least some of what I mentioned above. Even if you didn't really feel or see any of it, fear not, know this force is still with you as it has been described above. It is always here, all around us and within you. If you didn ́t sense it you are not aware it is there to take advantage of it. But with practice you will learn to open yourself up to it. You should practice this exercise once every day at any time you feel like it. After some weeks you should be starting to feel it take affect and find you are getting in touch with your deeper self and finding more harmony in your life. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"For some it may take effect almost immediately, others it will take longer. But don ́t worry that you don ́t feel anything initially, that will only stall your development even longer. With practice the sensations will come. I recommend you practice this exercise on its own for at least 1 month on daily basis before you move on to any of my other lessons . NOTES: You may want to listen to peaceful meditation type music when doing this exercise, as it may help you relax more and let your mind wander further. You may also find audio systems such as Hemi-Sync and Brainwave Generator useful tools and aids in performing this exercise in a better and deeper way. For a more meditative way of performing this exercise, you may imagine that you are somewhere else when doing all the steps mentioned above. As an example, you can visualize yourself in a great endless field of grass, with a beautiful blue sky and bright shiny sun above you, and lots of flowers and beautiful plants around you. Or any other type of surroundings or scenarios that makes you feel comfortable, relaxed and happy. Experiment and try find what works best for you. IMPORTANT: Do not get startled if you after some weeks or more of practising this exercise you start to experience unusual things, such as astral projection, lucid dreams, or even telepathy and telekinesis. After all you are building up your psychic powers, and these abilities are some of the goals for a lot of people. Venturing into the psychic and spiritual realm, even though most want to go further when they really start getting into it, is a glorious and amazing existence and it is waiting for you to discover - if you let it! 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Marriage of Heaven & Earth Meditation This is a meditation I created with the purpose of bringing you in deeper contact with all aspects of yourself, through bringing down the divine and spiritual and merging it with the earthly and physical. It will balance you and bring you in harmony with the material world and the spiritual world and the powers, laws and principles that governs these existences. During this meditation you will become the channel that merges the Divine with the Material through your being and thus aligns your own being with these two levels of Existence. Go out somewhere in nature where you will be free and undisturbed. You can do this meditation either alone or in a group. If you do not have the ability to get out into the real nature, you may simply close your eyes and imagine yourself in a beautiful field, on top of a mountain, in the woods, or whatever landscape of nature you find attractive. Sit down on the g round or imagine you do this if you are indoors. When sitting down your root chakra should touch and be in contact with the ground. Try sitting with your back straight and your legs gently crossed, enough to keep you balanced and comfortable. Should you find it difficult or have problems with the blood circulation in your legs in this position, try to find a slope, stone, knoll, tree trunk or something similar that you can sit on and thus put your legs in a more relaxed downwards position. If doing this inside, simply place a pillow under your buttocks. Once you are properly seated take some deep breaths, close your eyes, and relax your body and mind.

Now as you have exhaled completely while chanting \"OHM\" take another breath slowly. As you inhale imagine and notice how the pink energy ball in the top of your head is spreading down a beam of its pink light flowing down into your Third Eye Chakra between your eyebrows. Repeat the former exhalation process where you loudly and proudly again chant \"OHM\" through your complete exhalation, and this time imagine a new ball of pink energy is filling your head. Once again when the \"OHM\" is fully exhaled, take another slow deep breath while you focus and feel the energy balls created inside you so far while a new beam of light emits from the pink energy ball in your third eye chakra and flows down into your throat. Again as you exhale by vibrating out the sound of \"OHM\" imagine and notice now how a new energy ball of pink brilliant light forms in your throat. Then repeat this process of chanting \"OHM\" and inhaling for the other six chakras (energy centers). On the next inhalation following the \"OHM\" exhalation that created the ball of energy in your throat another beam of pink energy flows down from it and into your Heart Chakra in the middle of your chest. Exhale \"OHM\" and let the energy ball grow in your chest this time. Inhale and a beam flows from the chest to your Solar Plexus Chakra located in the abdomen area above your belly button. Exhale \"OHM\" and create another pink energy ball in this Solar Plexus Chakra.

At this moment you have a pink beam of light flowing in through the top of your head and 7 energy balls of pink brilliant light glowing within you in each of the above mentioned chakras, with a beam of pink light connecting each one of them. Sit for a moment and visualize this, feel, see and sense all the energy balls and the connecting pink beam of light within you. After having enjoyed and observed this for a couple of minutes move on to the next stage of the meditation as follows. Take a deep breath. Feel and sense the energy flowing into you from the top of your head and through all of your chakras even stronger. Chant \"OHM\" as before and sense and feel how your chakras are vibrating and expanding within you.

Sit like this for a moment feeling the pink energy flowing through every part of you and your chakras vibrating as the pink energy of Love, Joy, Peace and the Holy Spirit is filling you up while at the same time also flowing out through your root chakra as a powerful beam of pink light flowing straight into the Heart of the Earth. Now when you feel ready it is time to reverse the process, and receive thankful energies from the Earth, and further sending them up to the Heavens.

From the stomach chakra to the solar plexus chakra, heart chakra, throat chakra, third eye chakra and finally the crown chakra. As you reach the Crown Chakra, when exhaling the \"OHM\" imagine that the Crown Chakra opens up and out flows the wonderful green energy, through all of your body and chakras, and out the top of your head into the heavens and all the way back up to the Source of All Existence. Sit for a while feeling the two energies flowing through you and your chakras, one pink beam of light from above and through you into the center of the Earth, and one green beam of light from below you and through you up into the Heavens. This is balancing you and you are bringing down the Divine to Earth, and connecting the Earth with the Divine, thus merging two aspects of yourself and becoming more aware of them. With yourself in the center as the channeller you are attuning yourself to be a master perfectly balanced between the Material world and the Spiritual world and thus you will be in great harmony with yourself, nature, the divine and whole of Existence.

Then you can also imagine a special strong stem growing out from the top of your head into infinity, to the end of the void of the universe, connecting with the Source itself, the brilliant white God Light which is the All - above everything else, that contains all Knowledge, Life, Love, Light, Spirituality, Powers and Existence within it, and thus gives you full access to the unlimited powers of the Mind of the Universe itself. Imagine the Energy of the Source flowing back through the stem and into the top of your head filling your complete being up with its greatness, glory and power, transforming you, enlightening you, bringing you new experiences, visions, illumination, healing, success and luck - whatever you desire, it is all available for you. You can also send your g oals up through the same Stem from the top of your head into the Source that it is connected with, and thus the Source will manifest the goals for you through changing your reality as you directly affect the Universe with your Mind through this connection.

The important thing to keep in mind when doing such an exercise, is to imagine you HAVE what it is you are searching for ALREADY. Do not simply \"wish\" it, or \"want\" it, but truly try feel and imagine that you have it already, that you are the way you want to be already, because indeed you already DO have it, you already ARE what you want to be - and you need to realize that and send that energy to the core of Yourself as well as the Source of the Universe and it WILL manifest itself for you.

The file is available as mp3 and CD from my website www.AscendingTimes.com – you can also find it on my YouTube channel at the following link where it is titled “Guided Healing & Cleansing Meditation”: http://www.youtube.com/user/pleiadiantalk - 1. I recommend you do the following meditation on a daily basis for maximum effect and benefits. At least I do recommend you to perform it at times you feel you need that extra \"boost\" and healing/spiritual/psychic energy to reach you for the purpose you have chosen. 2. The procedure itself is fairly simple. All you have to do is a very basic relaxation meditation, be open minded, and accept to receive the energy from the Source. 3. This is done as follows - Find a comfortable position at any time you prefer, either sitting or lying down. Doing it before going to sleep is a good time as you are more open to receiving external energy and input in a sleep mode. As you sit or lay down, relax your body, and visualize yourself open up to receive the energy and say to yourself that you accept the energy the great Source sends out to you and help you with your desired goals. You may also ask your Spirit Guides and Guardian Angel to oversee the process and protect you and assist you in receiving the energy. Then take 13 deep inhalations through your nose, and hold your breath as long you can each time before slowly exhaling through your mouth. As you do this, feel your body and muscles getting more and more relaxed for each breath and exhalation - your body will soften and become heavy yet comfortable. Feel how you become more peaceful and at rest both physically and mentally from this simple breathing exercise. 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Once you finish the cycle of 13 inhalations, send your awareness to your body, and feel how relaxed it is, how at peace you are. Imagine at this point a brilliant pink light in the shape of a ball above your head. Make it grow stronger, try feel and visualize it above your head, and feel yourself becoming even more relaxed from this comfortable, peaceful light that is filled with love and serenity. As the ball of brilliant pink light fills up, imagine it open up and sending a beam of light down trough your head, and this is the energy the Source is sending you, filled within that ball sent there for you – along with peace, love, relaxation, protection, cleansing and guidance in addition to the goals you have for yourself with this energy. Imagine this great light filling your entire head and feel my energy flowing through you and manifesting within you the goal you have set for this energy. Imagine it spreading down from your head, down your throat, filling you up more and more with great powerful energy that will make you able to reach all of your goals. It moves down further from your throat, through your chest, filling up your chest with great pink light, and then proceeds down through your belly and all the way down to the tip of your toes. Now you are completely filled with this great pink energy, filling you all up with your intended purpose for what you are seeking from this exercise, and as it does so you feel yourself becoming more relaxed, more filled with love, and see the energy start radiating out of your body so it now also surrounds your body and makes your whole body surrounded by a great glowing sphere of brilliant pink light and this powerful energy, your whole body vibrating and radiating this energy, as it is growing stronger and stronger, knowing that this power will make you reach your goals and that you are in deep contact with the spiritual energy of the great divine energy of the endless source of all that is. Stay in this state for a while and just enjoy it, know that you are being filled with the powers and great energies to help and assist you and attune you towards your goals.

Stay with the feeling of love and joy in your being for a while, before you either go to sleep if you did it at night, or take a nice good deep breath, blow it slowly out, get up and go about your day knowing that the energy is now within you and that each time you perform this meditation the effects will increase and the powers will be more strong and effective. The more often you perform this exercise, the better results - as said daily basis is recommended, and it is not something that demands a lot of time, once you get into this meditation you can easily perform it all within 5 minutes or so, though I recommend at least spending 15 minutes to half an hour on it for best effects as long as you have the time on your hands.

For the best results it ́s highly recommended you do this alone and undisturbed, in a dark room with an altar and a mirror set up that you can see yourself in when both sitting and standing in front of it, as well as two lit candles on each side of the altar by the edges of the mirror and some incense of your choice. Try to FEEL, and SEE, and IMAGINE everything you do in this ritual. It may seem long and complicated, but once you learn it is pretty easy and doesn't take too much time to do (30min or so). You can start by learning one Step at a time until you know it by memory before moving on to the next step until you are able to do it all by memory and can perform it easily on a daily basis. Regarding vibrating the various words, it means you should chant them out, inhaling completely, and chant it with a vibrational tone all the way to end of your exhalation. You should start to notice effects within the first few days to a couple weeks after starting doing this ritual as long you keep to it as described and on daily basis, once in the morning when you wake up, and once in the night before bed.

Remain as relaxed as possible and keep your eyes closed. Starting with the top of the head, deliberately tense the muscles of the forehead for a moment. Then let go of the tension. Relax the forehead totally. After a brief period of time, tense the muscles of the face and neck. Then let the tension go fully away. Relax completely. Continue down the rest of the body in the same manner, first tensing, then releasing the muscles: shoulders, arms, chest and back, stomach, buttocks, thighs, calves, and feet. Tense, and then relax. Tense the entire body as much as possible then relax fully and deeply. Do this at least three times after which remain totally relaxed. Notice how much more relaxed your body is after the balancing effects of tensing and releasing, compared to the calm state your thought you had attained at the beginning of this exercise. Breathe deeply, but without strain. Visualize yourself enveloped in a sphere of brilliant white light. Imagine your body bathed in this light and feel its warmth on your skin. As you inhale, feel the divine light filling your lungs and spreading throughout your body to the tips of your toes and fingers, giving you a sense of ultimate peace and relaxation. As you exhale, you breathe out a portion of this endless light, giving its tranquil effects back to the one source in a cycle of flux and reflux. Yet the more light you breathe out, the more light is breathed back within you, till your whole being is created out of divine light. Visualize a golden sphere of healing light in the center of your body, around the area of your heart. Feel its smooth warmth. See this sphere travelling to areas of your body where some tension remains. Whatever part of your body the sphere touches becomes fully relaxed and regenerated. Let the sphere traverse every part of your body, and when this is done, place it back in its original position, centered about the heart. 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Continue to relax in this state for a few more moments.

Once you can feel and/or visualize this, slowly let the sphere flow up through your feet and legs, and know it is a cleansing energy, ridding you of all negativities, and is also with healing powers. Let it move up from the legs and further up your body, through your stomach and chest and up to your neck and finally up to the top of your head. While you do this, imagine the sphere of light cleansing you, removing all tension in all of your body, healing you. When it is at the top of your head, let it stay for a brief moment and try to increase its intensity before letting it flow back down to your feet again.

Touch the forehead and vibrate, \"ATAH,\" (Ah-tah - meaning \"Thou art\"). Touch the breast and bring the dagger blade or index finger down till it covers the heart or abdominal area, pointing down to the ground. Imagine the light descending from the forehead to the feet. Vibrate \"MALKUTH,\" (Mahl-kooth, meaning \"The Kingdom\"). Touch the right shoulder and visualize a point of light there. Vibrate \"VE- GEBURAH,\" (v'ge-boo-rah - meaning \"and the Power\"). Touch the left shoulder and visualize a point of light there. See the horizontal shaft of light extending from the opposite shoulder to join this point of light. Vibrate \"VE-GEDULAH,\" (v'ge-doo-lah - meaning \"and the Glory\"). Imagine a completed cross of Light running from head to feet and shoulder to shoulder. Bring the hands outward, away from the body, and finally bring them together again, clasped on the breast as if praying. Vibrate \"LE-OLAHM, AMEN,\" (lay-ohlahm, ah-men - meaning \"Forever, unto the ages\"). The Qabalisic Cross Note in Kraig's version of the QC given here, one touches the groin area when vibrating \"Malkuth\". This is reportedly from Crowley, it changes the QC so that rather than suggesting the Kingdom of Heaven is within the heart (Tiphareth), one is suggesting the Kingdom of Heaven is within the groin (Yesod). Visualize yourself getting larger and larger, taller and taller until you tower above the room you are in. Continue this growing visualization until the city 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"you are in is small beneath your feet. See the continent as tiny compared to your majestic body. Now even the Earth is small beneath your feet. However, no matter how small the Earth is, it is still firm and solid, anchoring you to the ground. You will not float away. Next visualize yourself growing so large the planets of our solar system are like tiny toy rubber balls spinning near your feet. Soon they are too small to see as even the Milky Way becomes a small dot of light at your feet. Now visualize a dot of light coming from somewhere far above your head. Know that this is only a tiny bit of the light from this source, and if you saw the full brightness of this light you would immediately be blinded and quite possibly go insane. This tiny bit of the endless, limitless light forms a brilliant white sphere above your head. It is nine inches in diameter, about the size of a dinner plate. It is brighter than ten thousands suns, but still only a tiny portion of the source of the divine, spiritual white light. Point to that sphere above your head with your index finger and \"bring it down\" (by pointing) to your forehead just above and between your eyes. Next, visualize this brilliance filling your head with divine light. While pointing to your forehead vibrate: Atah Bring your finger firmly down your body until you are pointing towards the ground. Your hand should be covering your groin. As you do this, visualize the light in your head coming down along with your finger, down through your body and beyond your feet down to eternity. Vibrate: Malkuth Now bring your finger up to your right shoulder. As you do this, visualize the beam of white light running down the center of your body forming a beam out from the heart area to your right, past your finger at your right shoulder. See this beam of light extend to the end of the universe and beyond. Focus on this beam and vibrate: ve-Geburah Move your finger horizontally to your left shoulder. As you do, visualize the beam of white light now extending through infinite space to your left. As you focus on this beam of light vibrate: ve-Gedulah Clasp your hands to your chest as if praying.

Draw a large flaming blue pentagram, see the flame follow the tip of your finger as you trace it before you in the manner indicated in the following diagram: Inhale through the nose. As you do, feel energy flow from the ends of the universe through your nose and body, and down and out of the bottoms of your feet to the center of the Earth.

At the same time thrust your hands forward so that they point at the exact middle of the glowing blue pentagram in front of you. As you do this you should exhale and feel the energy come back up your body, out your arms and hands, through the pentagram and to the ends of the universe. You should use the entire exhalation to vibrate the God Name: YHVH (Yud-heh-vav-heh) Bring your hands back to your ears while bringing your left foot back to its original position. Put your left hand down by your side and point to the center of the pentagram with your right. Now trace a line in the air at the height of the center of the pentagram as you move in a clockwise direction around the edge of your circle's space. You should go 90 degrees so that you end up in the south, facing south. As you trace the line in the air you should visualise a brilliant white light emanating from the tip of your finger. At the south, repeat the previous process of drawing the pentagram but vibrate the God Name: Adonai Repeat as above, but move to the west and vibrate: Eheieh Repeat as above, but move to the north and vibrate: AGLA Complete the circle by connecting a white line from the north to the east where you began. Then moving in the same clockwise direction move back to the center of your area as when you started the ritual. You should once again be facing east. Now visualize a brilliant white circle expanding up and down to form a sphere above, below and all around you. What you have done is create a sphere in brilliant white all around you with electric blue pentagrams at the quarters which have been charged and sealed with names of God.

The figure is dressed in yellow robes which have some purplish highlights. The figure carries a caduceus wand (a wand entwined by serpents, which represents life-force) and the figure's robes wave in the wind. You should \"feel\" a breeze coming from behind the figure. Say, Before me, Raphael. Vibrate the name of the Archangel. Visualize a figure behind you, dressed in blue with some orange highlights. The figure holds a cup and is surrounded by waterfalls. Try to feel the moisture in the air. Say, Behind me, Gabriel. Again, vibrate the name of the Archangel. On your right visualize a figure dressed in scarlet with green highlights. The figure holds a flaming sword and you should feel heat coming from this direction. Say, On my right hand, Michael. (vibrate the name) To your left visualize a figure dressed in greens and browns on a fertile landscape. The figure holds some sheaves of wheat. Say, and on my left hand Uriel (vibrate the name). Move your left foot out and visualize another beautiful flaming blue pentagram all around you, outlining your body. Say, For about me flames the pentagram... Visualize a golden hexagram within you, right where your heart is. Say, And within me shines the six-rayed star. (Six-rayed star being a Hexagram, often called “Star of David”) Part Four: Repeat The Qabalistic Cross from part one above. This ends the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

Focus your attention just above the top of your head. As a result of the LBRP there should be a sphere of white brilliance at this point. If not, visualize it. Take your time. Regard this white brilliance with a sort of awe: it is the spatial equivalent to the vital core of your being, your higher self, your link with the Divine. The result of this contemplation should be that the brilliance becomes even brighter. Now vibrate the God name, Eh-heh-yeh three of four times. The sphere should get brighter still. Now visualize a slender beam of light descending from the brilliance through the center of your head, and stopping at the nape of your neck. Here the beam widens into a ball of light, although not as big as the one above. At this point you should be visualizing simultaneously the brilliant sphere above your head, the small ball of light at the base of your neck, and the beam of light connecting the two. Understand that this is the link between your conscious and your higher self, and the ball of light at your neck should grow in size and intensity. Vibrate the God name, Yud-heh-vavh-heh El-oh-heem, three of four times. Keeping the above in mind, cause a beam of light to descend from the ball of light at your neck, go down your torso, and light up the solar plexus in the form of a sphere. Understand that this represents your consciousness, and the ball should increase in brightness and intensity. You may feel as if you are being warmed by an internal sun. Vibrate the God name Yud-heh-vavh- heh El-oh-ah V'dah-aht three or four times. In the same manner, see the light descend to the area of the genitals and form a sphere. Here, regard yourself as master of your \"lower\" self. The God name to be vibrated three of four times is Shah-dai El Chai. Again the light should descend, here to form a sphere which encompasses both feet and the ground; that is, the sphere should be half above the ground, 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"covering the foot, and half below the ground, under the feet. The God name to be vibrated three or four times is Ah-doh-nye Ha-ahr-etz. At this point there should be large spheres of light above the head, at the throat, at the solar plexus, at the groin and at the feet. Each sphere of light should be connected with the sphere above and below by a beam of light. Stay in this state for as long as you desire. Then, take a deep breath, and as you exhale, visualize the images fading and becoming invisible. They are still there, but they cannot now be seen. This completes the Middle Pillar Ritual. Remember the instructions on vibrating words. Each vibrated word should be done so that you can feel the appropriate area of the body vibrating. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Step 4: The Circulation of the Body of Light Rather than visualizing the Middle Pillar fading away as described in the last step, instead focus your attention upon Kether, the sphere of white brilliance above your head. You will circulate light from Kether around your body, in synchronization with your breathing. There are three parts to this circulation. As you exhale bring the light down the left side of your body from Kether to Malkuth, as you inhale bring the light back up the right side of your body, from Malkuth to Kether. Repeat this cycle a number of times. Repeat the step above, but this time bring the light down the front of your body as you exhale and bring the light up the back of your body as you inhale. Again repeat this cycle a number of times. For the final part do one of the following: - Bring the light from Malkuth directly up the Middle Pillar into Kether as you inhale. When the light reaches Kether visualize it spraying out like a fountain and cascading down and all around your body back to Malkuth. Repeat this cycle for a time. or Visualise the light from Malkuth rising up your body in a tight anti-clockwise spiral, wrapping you in a spiral of energy, bring the light all the way up to Kether. As you exhale visualize the light spraying out like a fountain and cascading down and all around your body back to Malkuth. Repeat this cycle for a time. To end the ritual you may either take a deep breath or visualize the light fading away, or perhaps prior to letting the light fade away you would prefer to focus some energy back to Tiphareth and visualize your aura, oval, clear and pulsating, balanced.

This includes STEP 1 and STEP 2 above. Perform these two rituals (The relaxation exercise and the LBRP itself) for at least a couple weeks before moving on to STEP 3 - The Middle Pillar Ritual. This is due to the fact you are building up your psychic/magickal energy and activating your energy body and the chakras, and this has to be done gradually so your body, mind & soul gets familiar with it and adapted to it. Then, once you've become familiar with the LBRP and start (hopefully) to feel and sense some effects from it, you may move over to STEP 3 - The Middle Pillar Ritual, and include that as part of your daily rituals, for yet another couple weeks. Always perform LBRP before The Middle Pillar Ritual. The Middle Pillar Ritual \"opens\" your psychic and magickal centers even further, and gets you in even deeper connection with the Divine. It also centers and cleanses you, and develops your chakras and energy body on a deeper level. After having practiced the Middle Pillar Ritual as well together with the relaxation exercise and LBRP daily for a couple weeks, you may add STEP 4 - Circulation of the Body of Light. At this point you should already be feeling sensations and energies and perhaps even deeper spiritual experiences as well when practicing these rituals. You should also start to feel more balanced, relaxed, more at peace and in harmony with yourself and the world. AT THE END of the ritual(s), when you've completed it, you should perform a LICENSE TO DEPART: A License to Depart is a simple banishing you perform to rid the area of any astral entities and spirits that might have been attracted to you from the energies you are creating during these rituals. This you can perfo rm as follows: 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"When you've finished your ritual(s), and before you blow out the lights of the candles, say out loud and with feelings \"All spirits, beings and astral entities of all kinds whom have been summoned and gathered here today are now free to leave. May you travel with peace and love to where you came from and to where you belong. I grant you the license to depart, so now go home with the protection of God on your way. AMEN!\" - vibrate AMEN while visualizing all the entities departing and leaving, flying far away to wherever they came from, just like moths fly away from the light when it's turned off. I recommend you to always perform the LBRP before any other magikcal or spiritual/psychic work of any kind, and it can also be a good idea to end the work by performing the LBRP again before the License to Depart. The above rituals, when practised correctly and properly for a while, should help you gain better and quicker results in other spiritual/psychic/magickal work. They also protect you from unwanted negative energies and entities. Keep a magickal diary where you write down the rituals you perform and the results of them, including any feelings, thoughts, emotions, sensations or other experiences that you might encounter while doing them. Also add information such as the weather, time and date, phase of the moon, your physical and mental/emotional status before and after the rituals, and other details you may find suitable to add. This will be a valuable journal for you to look through and review as you gradually progress on your spiritual path, and you might find it a good companion. Of course you should also include any other work you do in addition to the magickal rituals presented here above, examples can be various psychic experiments such as telekinesis, telepathy, energy work, meditation, astral projection, remote viewing, dowsing, scrying and whatever it is you might be practising. As someone asked me elsewhere to explain the LBRP for them, I gave a little more information and created a couple illustrations that can be helpful when learning this ritual. Of course you can create similar illustrations for yourself for the other rituals mentioned above as well.

The grey words are godnames to be said at each of the different directions as you turn that way to form the pentagrams. The pink text is the names of the archangels located at their correct directions as well as the color they represent. I forgot to include the elements they represent, but that's easy enough by just remembering the colors: yellow is air, red is fire, blue is water and green/brownish is earth. When it comes to vibrating the words it simply means that you do a full inhalation and vibrate out the word through a full exhalation in a way like chanting out the word, powerful and loud. In the same way the very common \"OHM\" is vibrated during meditations. So just rehearse and practice for yourself with notes similar to the images with the illustrations above to remember the different names etc and what direction they are placed. And practice one step at a time, like first practice the Qabalistic Cross until you understand it, then move on to the formation of the pentagrams, and once you know that one move on to evocation of the archangels.

The Invocation of God ritual serves the purpose of getting in contact with the divine source itself, the true Creator, and make sure you are not lured by any false entities pretending to be someone else, and to give you greater power and protection etc. If you are not familiar with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (LBRP) you must read the previous chapter: LBRP, Middle Pillar Ritual & Circulation of Body of Light. The testing of the angels serve the purpose of testing if you actually managed to evoke the real true angels, or if you've got some sneaky false entities pretending to be the angels lurking around. A banishing ritual is also included in case you encounter false angels and other entities. The last one is a ritual intended to help you cleanse your house of any negative energies and entities, and fill it with harmony, love and balance, and create it as a channel for these good energies to make sure it constantly is protected and shielded against negative energy and always have the good energies flowing through it.

You can do this invocation of God as follows: The Invocation of God - Say out loud: \"Dear God, Lord of the Universe, Creator of All and Source of All Existence! I now summon you and invoke you! Fill me with your glorious powers and Holy Spirit! I call upon you to be within me, around me, above me and below me for the purpose of protection, cleansing, guidance and love so you can lead me to the path to the divine and towards knowledge and conversation with my Holy Guardian Angel - so that I shall find my true purpose and Will and be filled with your love, harmony, balance and ability to distinguish the true from the false! May you lead me to success and great fortune in everything I do! I open myself for you, highest Master, let it happen! With love and blessings, thank you and Amen!\" Do it out loud and with power and affection, engulf yourself in prayer, with pure intentions on reaching the goal, as you visualize the power of god coming down from above and entering the top of your head as a pure brilliant god-light in the form of a beam. Imagine it streaming through your head and all your chakras; crown chakra, third eye chakra, throat chakra, solar plexus chakra, belly chakra, genitals chakra, and imagine and feel all chakras being filled and expanded by this powerful great god-light and then let it explode within you and flow out of all your chakras and completely fill your entire being. Then stay in this state for some minutes and feel its powers, before you let the energy flow out of your heart center with love and completely surround your body as well with the god-light, the pure and true spirit of God. You then have the power, you are protected, and you will see the true from the false! 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Testing of the Angels (and other entities): The testing of the angels then can be as simple as saying out loud \"May only the true angels of the God of Love be here in their true form, and anyone else reveal their true self, in the name of the highest Creator, let it happen! Amen!\" Ask any entity then \"Do you love the Holy Spirit?\" as a ny negative entity or demon cannot say yes to this. If you discover any false entities, you can ask them what their purpose is and why they are there. Or you can banish them and send them back to wherever they came from, for example by saying \"By the power of the True God, the Lord of Love, I now banish you and send you back to where you belong, with the protection and love of God on your way. May you now be gone, vanish, in the Name of the Lord, AMEN!\" at the same time you may imagine a great powerful god-light emitting out of your third eye and heart chakra towards the being you want to banish and \"shoot\" him away with these great powerful beams of love and light. The License to Depart: A license to Depart should be done as follows at the end of any spiritual work. When you've finished your ritual(s), and before you blow out the lights of the candles, say out loud and with feelings: \"May the true Angels of Love and the powers of the Highest God still be with me. All other spirits, astral entities and other beings of all kinds whom have been summoned and gathered here today are now free to leave. May you travel with peace and love to where you came from and to where you belong. I grant you the license to depart, so now be gone with the protection of God, the highest Creator, on your way. AMEN!\" – 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Vibrate AMEN while visualizing all the entities departing and leaving, flying far away to wherever they came from, just like moths fly away from the light when it's turned off. Then blow out the lights of the candles and the work is finished. I recommend you to always perform the LBRP before any other magikcal or spiritual/psychic work of any kind, and it can also be a good idea to end the work by performing the LBRP again before the License to Depart. Imagine, visualize and FEEL everything you do and say with all of your powers and being! You may of course add or remove some elements in the above evocations and rituals, such as in the Invocation of God you may ask for other things than what I mentioned, for example for success, happiness, good health, and whatever else you may want as long as it is for a good purpose and not doing any harm towards anyone. If asking for healing for others, please ask them for their permission to be heale d first as there are people who are sick because they want to be so, and there are people who wish to stay in their condition for many different reasons. 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Creating an Astral Sanctum to Unveil all Mysteries The following part is my explanation on how to create a World of your own in the Astral Realms where you can find the Answer to virtually anything - as you will be connected with the Source of All. Here is a method I use to get in contact with the source in order to find answers to the questions I have, and to generally explore the vast regions of Existence. I have created an astral world of my own, where I can go to whenever I want when meditating. In this World, I have a mountain, and one of my Spirit Guides are present there to guard the place and make sure it is always kept free from other entities except those who I permit to enter. He also guards a portal which leads to my Astral Sanctum, which is basically a room I have created, where I have various objects and things placed that I can use to gain various information. For example, in this room I have a big screen covering the whole of one wall, and in front of the screen I have two chairs with various controls on them. These chairs are for me and my Guardian Angel or any Spirit Guide or other entity I want to communicate with. The chairs themselves function to activate the screen, so that I can ask a question, for example about a past life, and it will be shown on the screen visually. Then I can simply fly into the screen, and I will BE in that previous life and experience and see it just as if I am there. I can do the same thing with other entities, for example if I want to call on an ascended master, I ask him to appear on my screen if he is available and wants to be in contact with me, and then when he appears I can either just communicate with him on the screen, or make him come out of the screen and manifest in the room I am in, or I can go into the screen on various journeys with him. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"This place is extremely useful to say the least as I can get the answer to virtually any question I may have, and find out anything I need. The way it works is that the place itself is directly connected with the Superconscious, and through what is called the Akashic Records to the Source of All Existence itself, and thus it has access to everything that has ever happened, is happening, or will happen. Things that will happen are always only possible outcomes, and can of course be changed, so the future is not something set in stone and when trying to view the future you have to have that in mind, and also be aware of the fact that many different future timelines exist. You can even create your own future timelines, where you for example have the exact life you want, a great and positive future, and then \"grab\" this future timeline with you back to your present and implant it in yourself as a seed that will grow to make your future become the way you want it to be, as long you follow and do the things that needs to be done for that specific future to properly unfold for you. The place I have described above is something I have created for myself and you can do the same. And now I will tell you how you can create your own world and how to go there during meditation. First of all, when doing a meditation you need to be able to enter an altered state and visualize yourself in a place of your choice - this will be the world you are creating. Personally I visualized a nice valley surrounded by mountains and nature, with great fields around, rivers and lakes. Then I envisioned a portal on top of one of the mountains, and asked my spirit guide to come there and guard it, and thus visualized him there as well. Then I did this meditation several times to properly manifest this reality in the astral planes, meaning that I would go daily to visit this place in my meditations, and just fly around, explore the scenery and landscapes, and design everything to the way I wanted it. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Then I moved on to the next step, which is to go through the portal, and visualize yourself entering a room or other place of some sort, for example like I described above. I have created a room that has various things that are of sentimental value to me. These help with familiarity and spiritual strength. Among other things I have placed my altar in there which I use in real life for various rituals, and all items that I have on this altar. I also have a couple of plants by a window, and the window has a great view looking out over the valleys and mountains of the previously mentioned world that I entered this room from. You decide yourself how you want to decorate the room and what to put there, I do however recommend the screen and chairs for making contact with other entities and getting answers to things you wonder about. So, basically do this meditation and these visualizations for some time until you have properly created it as a place you can easily enter in your mind whenever you want, and you can use your pendulum to ask your guides and guardian angel etc to help you make the place strong and protected and in assisting with maintaining it and helping you use it for the purposes you want to use it for. Then, all you have to do is to move on to the next step which is to enter your World at any time you want, either to explore or if you need to find answers to something. Simply enter your Portal to your own special Astral Sanctum, sit down in a chair. It is advisable to always have your guardian angel with you in order to make sure all contacts and experiences you have are truthful and real and that you are protected against false prophets and deceivers. Then just turn on the screen in whatever way you have chosen and ask the questions you want and let the answer appear on the screen. I guess that should be enough to get you started on such a work, which I personally have found tremendously useful and it ́s great to just enter this world to relax and renew oneself whenever needed. For example in my 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"World all the lakes and rivers have Holy Water that cleanses me and charges me with the Holy Spirit if I pour it over me or take a bath in it. It is your world and you can make it however you like. I hope these examples will be of some interest and use. Every thought manifests itself on some level of existence, and the astral realms / planes are as real, and more real, than this physical realm we find ourselves in now. You may be able to perceive this Astral realm as vividly and clearly as this physical one, perhaps even more clear and real, especially if you are able to fully astral project. However, this is not necessary for the above method, as it is in its essence an \"all in the mind\" exercise where you do not need to actually astral project but simply perceive the mentioned places and receive the answers in your mind, in your way - this can be visual, or as thoughts, ideas, sudden knowledge, audible and other ways of perception. The important thing to remember is to trust your intuition and what you feel, and listen to yourself, to your inner guide, and try to sense and feel what is your \"own\" creations, and what is \"external input\" - in other words, find the difference between your own thoughts and outside communication. With some practice this will become more and more easy until it is as clear as the difference from speaking yourself to listening to someone else talking to you. 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Meet Your Inner Guide – And Manifest P erfection Lately I have been experimenting with a somewhat different approach in my meditations on how to get in contact with my inner guide. Before I get on to the technique itself, I would just like to say a few related things. Remember, w e are the creators of our own World. What we see around us and experience in our lives are the results of what we ourselves project out into the world and everyone and everything there. In a sense, every person is his own walking Universe where everything is structured according to His or Her \"Inner Self.\" Thus, as I have mentioned before, making changes Within Oneself will make changes in what you perceive as the \"Outer World.\" The more balanced and in harmony you are with your True Self within, the more harmony and balance you will experience in the \"outside world\" and your life in the physical world. This can easily be seen in the w orld itself by looking at other people and their lives. For example, you may find something extremely negative and completely dislike it, while another person really enjoys the same thing and loves it with all his heart. So the question then is not if the \"object/thing/event\" in question itself is \"good\" or \"bad\", \"negative\" or \"positive\" - it is why you perceive it as you do and why someone else can perceive it differently. The answer goes back to \"We create our own World\" - what we encounter that we dislike or find bad, negative and so on, is our own responsibility. It is the same principle for anything we find likeable, good and positive. We have within ourselves, deep in our unconscious level, energies working that are projecting these \"experiences\" into the material world in which we live. 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"One example is the person who always fails at everything he tries, never manages to get a job, is constantly poor and may even live on the street. Most others will look at him as a \"failure\" and categorize him as that, thinking negative things about him, even if they are thinking compassionate feelings they are often more destructive than helpful, as those who care may think \"Oh poor old man who has to live on the street. Hopefully he will get himself together some day.\" Such a thought will only continue to manifest that current reality both for you and the man in question - of him being a poor beggar on the street – as your image of this person is of one of poverty and hopelessness living on the street- Thus this is the energy you are sending out to the Universe you live within and maintain this creation through your own unlimited powers of your Mind. Of course many people will just pass the person and barely even notice him or give him a thought, while once in a while there is a person that is somewhat different, and gets the person back \"Up and going\" so to speak. You could be that person - you could be a person getting YOURSELF \"up and going\" properly, and thus in turn get others \"up and going\" in a positive way by influencing everything and everyone around you in a proper and positive manner. When YOU are properly in balance, harmony, at peace and at One with yourself, so will the World around you will be, and the experiences in your life will flow freely and smoothly in your favor, making things better not only for yourself but for everyone around you and anyone you meet as well. There is a depth to ourselves that few are aware of, a self deception so grand it is hard to believe and comprehend, but it is possible for us all to understand our true being, and each other, by gradually working with our INNER selves. Hardly one living person on this planet is their \"True Self.\" In the man, humans are a mixed up mash of various other people, influenced by opinions and beliefs of other people and energies existing within that in turn CREATE 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"those other people who affect us and make us do certain things in life and have certain experiences. Existence is thus in a way \"inside out\" from the point of view most of us have, thinking that what we see \"out there\" is reality, and that we are Individual Selves making our own decisions, and to some degree many believe themselves to have a soul deeper within that basically is \"Themselves\" just as they are now but in spirit form. Experimentation, testing and experience have shown things to be differently though - it seems that creation is in fact going \"backwards.\" We are not simply a soul that gets put into a body and then pops out in an already predetermined world. Instead it seems from my experience that we are the Creators of the World we find ourselves in, thus we are responsible for everything happening there to some degree, BUT we ourselves are the creation of Inner Energies, our Ego, which is being maintained and manipulated by other forces and energies, so we do not experience our True Self. And that is where the Inner Guide can be of great assistance, your Inner Guide is the deepest truest part of yourself, so different from yourself that you will experience Him/Her as some external (or in this case, \"internal\" being). Your Inner Guide is what has been termed the Holy Guardian Angel and many other things throughout the ages, and its work is to keep your inner Center balanced and in Harmony - as long as you approve it and ask for it. Once in contact with your Inner Guide, you can change yourself and your experience of the world dramatically - people have been healed from diseases, gone from poor to rich, been getting the gifts to heal others, having all negative influences in their life disappear and much more. 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Even within yourself there are many forms of Life and Conscious Beings - for lack of better terms. I will call them energies, and these are the ones popularly called Archetypes, which channel different feelings and emotions, resulting in Causes and Effects both in your Inner World and your Outer World. These Archetyptical energies we all share, they are part of the Human Collective Unconsciousness, which in turn explain how these energies can affect the world as you perceive it, through the Collective Unconsciousness. They are a natural part of us, just like our Soul is, our Mind, our Physical body, they are there within us all engulfing all of our existence at all times, just like other things within and without us that we usually do not perceive yet still is there, such as the living cells in our body, the air we breath etc. Now the good thing is that once you get Consciously Aware of this, you can start working with and exploring these energies to create Inner Changes which in turn will manifest changes in the \"Outer World\", or your Perceived Reality. Regarding your Inner Guide, this one is unique to every living person and not \"shared\" in the way the Archetypes are. Your inner Guide will help you get to know these archetypes, and protect you on your inner journeys, and will be able to assist you in figuring out what archetypes or other energies are affecting a situation in your life, and how you can work with that Inner Energy form to project your situation in a new and better way. You also have a Shadow Self, deep in your unconscious mind, which consists of your ego with your suppressed and repressed feelings, ideas, emotions, beliefs etc. Your Shadow continuously projects itself upon everyone in your life, and in turn what you experience back from these other people in your life is an effect of the Shadow you have projected upon them in the first place. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"So getting to know your Shadow self, and bring it towards harmony with yourself, along with harmonizing with the Archetypes and other energies within, will result in profound changes both in yourself, as the person you are - going beyond your Ego, discovering your True Self, and help you manifest a new outer projection of Reality. Within yourself you also have your Center, your inner \"Sun\", that force which is always there giving life and love, and finding your Center, the Inner Sun, and working with it with your Inner Guide is of great value. No further introduction is needed for the moment, so I will now describe the method itself, how you can get in touch with your OWN inner Guide and work with these different energies. First of all find yourself in a comfortable position either in a nice chair with both feet on the ground, separated not crossed, and your arms by your sides - or simply lie down in bed or on your coach to relax there. During this meditation it is important that you do not \"drift away\" or get into a \"trance state\", you have to be conscious throughout the whole procedure and be aware of everything you do and experience. Thus you should try to do this when you are fresh and awake and not when tired or sleepy. Once in your position, mentally imagine yourself somewhere else, such as in a cave. Feel and sense yourself there, and experience yourself as being INSIDE your body looking out from your own eyes - this is also crucial for this meditation, you need to experience yourself as \"being there\" and NOT as if you are watching yourself on a film screen. To \"anchor\" yourself more within yourself it can be good to touch your surroundings, feel your feet on the ground, notice the details - is the ground flat or bumpy, rocky and solid or sandy, how does it smell in there, do you hear any sounds, how do the 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"walls feel when you touch them, look at your hands and see what they look like, look down at your body and see what your body and legs look like - how are you dressed? Make this as vivid and clear as you can in your mind, really sensing yourself being there and able to have a solid image of the place you are experiencing. But always go back into \"your body\" in any place you go during the meditation, should you suddenly see yourself from the outside in the cave, simply slip back inside yourself and make sure you look out through your eyes and see the surroundings as you would in real life, and as clear as you can. Work on this first part for a while so you really get it as strong as you can visually and in your imagination, sensing it as clear and powerful as possible. If you for some reason do not like caves, you can imagine yourself somewhere else, such as in a room, or in a garden etc, just make sure to keep to the same procedure described above. Now once in your cave, look around and see a door in front of you. This can also simply be a passage, a open portal, or any other sort of opening leading forwards from where you are at, and with an exit behind you from where you came into this cave - similarly imagine such things if you imagine yourself anywhere else than in a cave. Walk forward, while walking notice the feet stomping on the ground, let your hands touch the surroundings, the rocks, when by the portal touch it, look at it, study it for a while. Then continue forward and through it. Once you have either gone through it, or if you are walking in a passage, immediately turn to your left and now find yourself in a new landscape, as if you have found your way out of the cave and are now outside the mountain 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the cave is in. Or out of the house, garden, or whatever else place you may have preferred to imagine yourself. In either case, after moving forward, and then turning left, notice the landscape you are in now. In the whole process let the images come to you, don ́t try to force it or create it with your mind, just be open like a blank piece of film where the image is slowly becoming clearer and manifesting itself. Study these new surroundings. W here are you? Inside or outside? Is it hot or cold? Dry or wet? Is the ground hard or soft? What can you smell, touch, hear. Examine your surroundings with your hands and have a good look around. Then ask for an animal to appear - your power animal - this one can come in any form but it should not be a fantasy animal or any animal you know personally such as your pet. It could be anything from a great eagle, to a frog, to a kangaroo, to a snake, and so on. As soon as your animal arrives look at it, and ask it to lead you towards your Right and True Inner Guide. Follow your power animal. If you have problems keeping up with it just let yourself have the ability to move faster, or simply fly above the ground after it. Soon you should be with your Inner Guide that your power animal has led you to. Examine him, or her. Start by looking at their feet, what are they wearing? What kind of footwear, what does he have on his legs, if anything, and continue up through his body noticing every detail of how he looks and what he wears. When you come to the face it may be hard to see the features clearly, this is something that is usual for the true Inner Guide, while false guides usually are crystal clear and have faces that are easy to see. 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"In either case, whether you see his face or not, greet him, and grab both his hands in yours and check how his hands feel, are they soft or rough, cold or warm? Give him permission to let YOU feel how HE feels about YOU. The feelings from a true Guide should be that of deepest love, acceptance, goodness and kindness in any way. Do you not feel this, call on your True Inner Guide and ask him to appear before you and test again. Once you have found your Inner Guide, ask him so if he truly is your Inner Guide, and if he can protect you in your Inner World. If he doesn't answer anything but yes to this do the process over again, calling upon your True Inner Guide to be there with you. The next thing and last test is to ask your guide to point in the direction of your Inner Sun. A false guide will not be able to do this, or will delay and try to come up with something else. Once he has pointed at your Inner Sun, look at it, and ask it to come down in a human-like form for you to interact with. Once the Sun is down, notice the appearance, is it male or female, what does he/she wear, old or young, etc. Take both of the hands of the Sun and ask to be sent as much Light and Love as you can physically handle. At this point most people will feel themselves overwhelmed with amazing love and sensations that can even result in tears of joy, and blockages and energies are cleansed. Should you not feel much, ask the sun to clear any blockages you have so that the energy can flow freely. After you have done this, ask the Sun what you need to do for him or in your life to be more in harmony and friends with him. He will usually tell you something which will be beneficial in your general life or the inner work. Then ask him what he has to give to you. He might tell you something, or give you an object with a specific purpose, ask him if unsure what the purpose of 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the object is and where in your body it will be placed. If the function of the gift is uncertain to you, ask your Inner Guide for clarification. Then you may ask your inner Guide about the two same things. Then ask him for his name. At this point I recommend that you return to where you came from, enter the cave, and get out of the meditation bringing with you everything you have learned and write down the whole experience in some sort of log book, which you always should have by your side when doing your meditations. If you have problems in your life, go and meet your Inner Guide and ask him to explain to you what is causing the problem, or if he can symbolically bring up an image with the solution to the problem. If you are working on issues with other people, then ask the Inner Guide to bring the person you have a problem with to you in your meditation, and then ask him to transform the person to the true form the energy represents in you, this could turn out in many ways such as your angry husband turning into a barking dog etc. Then ask the energy form which you now see in its true form what you can do with it and in your life to be friends with it and harmonize things - ask your Guide if he agrees. You may also ask this energy form if it has a gift for you that you can use similarly to how you asked the Sun and your Guide the same. Always ask your Guide if the information you receive from other energies/entities are truthful and if advice should be followed or not. Your Guide knows everything about you and what is best for you, always consult him lastly before making any choices. The energy form mentioned above is one of the inner energies you project outwards to the person that makes him behave the way he does with you. Or if in the case of a specific situation, it is the energy projected out on to the situation itself that makes the situation be the way it is for you etc. 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"These energies do NOT represent the persons or situations themselves, they represent INNER energies that YOU project outwards and cause behaviours and effects in people. In turn it causes their attitude towards you. Thus always work with the energy form and never with a person themselves, and NEVER perform healing or anything else on other people unless you have asked them for their permission to do so first. There are so many more things you can learn to do with this type of meditation that it really has no limits. This is just the tip of the iceberg so to speak. If you get to know, meet and befriend the various archetypes (usually represented by the 22 cards of the Major Arcana in the Tarot, also called the \"22 Faces of God\" and 22 paths of the Kabbalah etc) you will experience your outer world and your inner self changing and transforming greatly towards the better and deeper understandings of Existence and Creation and Life. I highly recommend anyone interested in this meditation who want to learn more and explore it further, to get the book \"The Inner Guide Meditation\" by Edwin Steinbrecher. It contains a wealth of information on this topic, goes into details about the 22 Archetypes, Tarot and the Horoscope, and how you can find out your relation to anyone in your world, and how to solve basically any problem you have and get closer to the Inner Guide, Yourself and God. 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Astral Projection: The Most Important in Life As mentioned earlier, I am strongly of the opinion that everyone should learn, practice, understand and experience astral projection to familiarize themselves with what is to come - the After-Life. Otherwise it will come suddenly and hit you in the face without any preparation or knowledge of what to do when you get there. Thus I will add some information on astral projection with some useful tips and tricks on how to achieve it and practice it. But before I start, I must strongly recommend you to read the book Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce, as it is the most complete work on astral projection I have ever come across, and is a MUST read. His website is www.AstralDynamics.com Increasing your astral projection skills: To get to the basics first: Don't try to astral project at night or when you are very tired, as this most certainly will lead you to black out / fall asleep instead of having a successful projection. Are you doing it in the night? If so this is probably the reason. The best time of day to astral project is in the morning just when you've woken up, or in the middle of day or afternoon / evening. The night is usually the worst time to try as your body and mind is too tired. Morning is usually the best of them all, as your mind and body is rested, and already in a close state to astral projection from just having slept, so if you just lay still and try to project then this can be successful. Here are a couple methods for you to try out: 1. The Morning Method Wake up, Get up, and go back to bed . You should set your alarm clock to wake you a bit earlier than normal, lets say 6 hours of sleep and then make your alarm clock wake you up. Then, get up from bed, and do something for 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"30 min to 1 hour to get yourself awake - it is STRONGLY helpful if you spend this time reading about astral projection as this will affect your subconscious mind to make it easier for you to astral project. In any case, after 30min to 1 hour, go back to bed, and do any astral projection method and you may find that it is much easier to get into the state of mind needed and then project from there. 2. The \"Stay awake\" method Here you simply go to bed when you are tired and have your eyes open. You may blink of course now and then so your eyes doesn't dry up. The point is to just lie in your bed with your eyes open just like if you are awake and just look around in the room and notice everything in the room, take care of looking at all details and making it imprinted into your mind, just lie there in bed with your eyes open until you pass out / fall asleep from being too tired. At this point you may find yourself in your astral body, or in the astral state ready to project, because your body is asleep but your mind/astral body should still be awake as you forced yourself to stay awake - it was your body falling asleep. To enhance this method you can repeat over and over some times like a mantra or self-suggestion in your mind \"When my body falls asleep, I will be awake in my astral body and project\" - this can increase the effect and program your mind to automatically become aware inside your astral body when you fall asleep. 3. Self suggestions This is basically like the last part of the above mentioned method, but instead you do any astral projection method of your choice, and you simply say to yourself over and over \"When my body falls asleep, I will be awake in my astral body and project\" or something similar, for example \"I will now enter my astral body and project out of my physical\" etc. You get the Idea. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"4. Imagine yourself where you want to g o In this method, you simply go to bed, and you think of the place you want to project to - it can be as simple as the city you live in. The point is to try and visualize the place as clearly as possible, so to practice let ́s make it easy as use your bedroom. In this example, since you are imagining that you are in your bedroom, you should focus your attention and awareness on a specific place in that is not within reach of your physical body. This can be for example the ceiling. The point of astral projection is to imagine yourself floating right under your ceiling, try to really FEEL yourself being up there and how it would feel to float suspended in midair. At some point you may feel yourself starting to vibrate or float. When you do try to increase this sensation and make it stronger, until you separate and find yourself floating under the ceiling. This method is especially useful if you already are able to get into the astral projection state without any trouble. When in this state just do as I described. It also helps to use self suggestion here too like in the examples mentioned above. You can of course also use any other \"target\" of your choice, but when you are first starting out experiencing astral projection it ́s best to use a place you are familiar with, such as the place of family or friends. Visualize their room and try feel yourself there, as in the example above with the ceiling. 5. Lucid dreams If you are able to have lucid dreams (dreams where you know you are dreaming and you are very aware) you can project astrally from these dreams very eas ily by focusing your attention and \"willing\" yourself out of your body. Just imagine yourself flying out of the dream and out of your 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"physical body and you are free and out flying. If you don't know about lucid dreams or how to achieve them, do a search on Google. There is tons of info on it there and for some people this method is more effective than any of the others. 6. Body awareness In this method you try send your awareness out of your body and move it around in different ways etc.. For example, you lie in your bed, and imagine and feel yourself floating out to the right all the way to the wall, then bounce back into your body, through your body, and out to your the left side and to the wall to left of you. Then repeat the action and send awareness back again through your body to the right wall etc, and continue doing this for a while, sending your awareness back and forth from right to left, trying to really feel yourself being at those places and feeling yourself floating through your body and out on the other side. After having done this for several minutes, move on to trying to imagine and feel yourself bouncing up and down instead, like sending your awareness up from your body and up to the ceiling, then back down through your body and down to the ground. Repeat this too for a while, and move on to another part: Back and Forth, this means try to feel yourself floating out of your feet and feel your awareness outside your body moving down to the wall by the end of your feet, then move back up through your body and out of your head to the wall nearest your head (if your head, or any other side of your body, is placed directly next to a wall, just imagine yourself floating through that wall for a bit.) Then try to imagine yourself on gentle ocean waves, floating up and down, rocking your body softly up and down, from side to side, back and forth etc. Try to really feel how it would be to lie floating on ocean waves and moved around. You should start feeling your body moving up and down etc just like 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"you actually were on waves. At any point you feel like it you may try to project out of your body. This method alone can be enough to get you out, but it is also a \"loosening\" method that makes you aware of your astral body, and makes it more loose and disconnected from your physical body, so actually this method can be something you do to start with to loosen yourself up from your physical, and then you can do any other astral projection method after it to increase the effects and be more sure to have an astral projection. 7. Ask for help Yes, you can ask your guides (spirit guides, and guardian angels) to help you out. This has shown to be a very useful method for me. As you are in the state of astral projection, trying to project, simply say out loud in your mind \"I ask for help to get out!\" or \"Please help me get out of my body my dear spirit guides!\" or \"I would be really grateful for any help I can get to fly out of my body!\" and so on. And, you may then suddenly feel like somebody is grabbing your hands and pulling you out, or even like someone is lifting your body up in the air etc. Your spirit guides are always there ready to assist and help you - even when you are out of your body you may ask them to come to help you with different t hings or to teach you things (a spirit guide actually taught me a method of astral projection). You may of course try to alter these methods and mix them in a way you prefer and that feels more comfortable or easier for you, as every person is different and some things that work for some might not work for others - but at least now you got several different methods to try out here. Once you are actually able to leave your body and experience an astral projection , you may find it useful to say out loud \"AWARENESS NOW!\" if you find yourself a bit sluggish and not so aware, and also \"CONTROL NOW!\" if 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"you find difficulties in moving around properly as you want, and even \"CLARITY NOW!\" if you find you don ́t see well etc. THE IMPORTANCE OF DIARIES When you experience an astral projection, you want to be able to remember it, but they have a similar problem as dreams in that often we just remember vague parts of them. This is due to what is called the mind-split effect. When you leav your body, you are aware of your astral body, and your mind is focused in the astral body. At the same time, your physical body and physical brain is sleeping, and the physical brain is recording whatever the physical body experiences (which is just sleeping). So, when you get back, you have to \"overwrite\" this physical body's memory with your astral body's memory. The best way to do this is to start slowly, by just keeping out some seconds at a time, like 10 seconds, then return to your body while thinking \"I will remember this!\" and immediately get up from bed and write down your whole experience. Then you can try to keep out longer and longer for each time you project. Every time you are about to go back to your body, say out loud \"I will remember this!\" You may also make an affirmation while performing your astral projection method of choice too, where you say to yourself \"I will now go out of body and be completely aware in my astral body and remember everything that happens when I return to my physical body.\" Every time after projecting, or even trying to projecting and thinking you have failed, write down in a special diary that you have just for this purpose everything you can remember about the experience, all details, from the very beginning of the projection (such as what method you used, sensations you felt before projection, sensations at the moment of separation, sensations and feelings after, things you saw, experienced and so on while out, sensations on moment of re-entering your body, etc) - Write it all down, and 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"read through it after you wrote it down to see if you remember more you can add. Then just let go of the diary or the rest of the day, and later in the evening or night, read through the experience again and maybe you'll notice you remember more details, more things starting to come into your mind. This diary, if done every time as I just told, will greatly improve your astral projection skills - even just reading it before trying to project will help a lot! Place it under your pillow or near to where you usually attempt astral project to further improve the results. In addition to your Astral Projection Diary, you should keep a Dream Diary. This is a separate diary, where you write down all dreams you have EVERY morning when you wake up - just as with the astral diary, write down everything you can remember from the dreams you had the night before you just woke up. Then read through it once and see if more details can be added, and as with the astral diary, read through it another time later in the evening or day, to see if you perhaps remember even more. The purpose of this is to increase your dream memory as well as your astral abilities - in total it will make you better at both remembering your dreams, recalling your astral adventures, and becoming more skilled at astral projector. In addition, it will start making your dreams more spiritual in nature, you will start to have spontaneous projections at night while sleeping without even trying, that you will either remember in the morning, or you will wake up in the night and remember it after getting back to your body (remember to write down these experiences too!). It is very important and of great help and assistance for yourself and your spiritual development to do this. I can't stress that enough, you really should get both an Astral Diary, and a Dream Diary, and write down in both of them every day (or at least every morning in the Dream Diary, and every time you try to project, or have a spontaneous projection in the Astral Diary). 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"It will also be a good reference for you to check your improvement later on, and to go back and review specific episodes and experiences. And it will be great to have it all logged so you can go back and re-read any experience or interesting dream you've had at any time you want to. And as said, reading these diaries both before astral projecting or going to sleep will greatly improve both your astral skills as well as your dreams. Reading astral projection related books and literature on the internet etc will also help, as your subconscious mind will absorb it and put it into work and help you in the background to develop your astral abilities and make you have them more easily. With all my best wishes for success, I trust you'll have some new interesting astral adventures. -THE END - 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Afterwords: I hope this book has shed some light on how the world works and how you are capable of enjoying advanced experiences in this life and others.
