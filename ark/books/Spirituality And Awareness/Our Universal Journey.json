Due to the content, the challenges of writing this book go beyond words. Cynthia remained steadfast in love, support, integrity, authenticity, and wisdom. She is truly a woman of substance. To my two Sons for having the wisdom to understand their father’s calling and broader obligation to our Humanity. Their ability to maintain their integrity is a testament to the maturity of their Spirit. I want to also thank Cynthia’s two sons and family who miss her deeply and whose solidarity of character, understanding and depth of wisdom eases the pain of absence. Special mention goes to Marina, for her unwavering support and unconditional love. Thank you for being my mother, and a woman of great integrity. My love for you is eternal. Rarely in this world is there a person with the strength of character that will come along and feel naturally inclined to support a venture unconditionally. Jason Bawden-Smith is such a person. His humanity, his love for our Mother Earth and wisdom gained from extensive life experiences combined with his accomplishments in the world of business, has made possible the creation of an infrastructure to share this knowledge with our greater Human family. His ability to contend with the onslaught of challenges in supporting us demanded a level of intestinal fortitude above and beyond. Thanks J. Cynthia and I have had the luxury of working with Liz, our one person support team whose multi-skilled abilities and resilience to the ongoing black comedy throughout the process was invaluable beyond words. To Leone; a true friend and reluctant oracle whose council and critique abounded with eternal wisdom. Thank you for being there dear si- star. We also thank our dear friend Medwyn, for his unswerving loyalty and support through the whole process. Your ability to bring laughter and joy in challenging times was music to our hearts. In addition I would like to express my immense gratitude to Lance whose life was put on hold so that he may edit the manuscript. An old friend from beyond... It is impractical for me to name everyone individually who played a role in making this book possible. Along the journey of my life there are those who were there in support through my most difficult times. And there are those who were there in so many other ways. All of our interactions, the good the bad and the ugly, have made me who I am today. All are of equal value as all resulted in wisdom gained. For whatever role you played I thank you and know my love for you is eternal.

This is a journey so grand and a message so direct and confronting your head may hurt but your heart will sing. I stumbled upon George’s material in September 2010 during his first radio interview with Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot. It entered at a time in my life where I had spent several months doing doctorate level research into the dark agenda and the earthly control systems. This research created more questions than it answered, created confusion and kept me locked in the drama. It can be a very depressing experience when you understand the world is run by corrupt politicians, bankers, and priests. “ Our social system is designed to foster division, our education system is designed to conceal knowledge, our health system is designed to create sickness, our financial system is designed to steal wealth, our community is designed to create disunity and our very civilisation itself is highly uncivilised”, Max Igan . However, the level of control over humanity runs much deeper than the earthly controls of secret societies and the Illuminati. In the section titled the Supreme Cosmic Deception, George goes into great detail to explain how “off world” beings are manipulating humanity. He takes mind influence and control to the next level, showing how there are not just earth bound and galactic programs but sophisticated cosmic agendas used on humanity. I hold two applied science degrees and a well-developed b/s meter but I can neither prove nor disprove the veracity of George’s story. There is no hard empirical evidence that George has had Extra-Terrestrial and Extra-Dimensional contacts and it is impossible to confirm the source of his immense wisdom. What I can share are my experiences and some insights gained from my close relationship with George. My search for the meaning to life began in my early years and has led to many worldly experiences. I have been fortunate to have incredible spiritual experiences with Sharman in Papua New Guinea, witnessed John of God perform amazing healing sessions in Brazil, studied with Chinese qi gong masters and even been invited into the homes of self-development gurus like Bob Proctor and John Assaraf. However, none of the knowledge gained through these experiences nor the teachings described below provided the answers to life’s big questions. Key pieces to life’s greatest puzzle remained elusive. I found out at a very early age that religion was never going to answer my questions. Mark Twain said it best: \"Religion is a belief, created by the first con man that met the first fool.\" George challenges the doctrine of religion exposing the deception of this tyrannical business to levels that may shock you. I do feel for the god-fearing parishioners who, despite being wonderful human beings, blindly give their power away. Eastern philosophies look much more appealing; Buddha, relaxing meditations, reincarnation, karma, yoga, etc. Even Sanskrit texts are filled with references to gods who fought battles in the sky using Vimanas (UFO’s). Whilst I found several aspects of eastern philosophy appealing, some of the teachings I just did not resonate with; maybe it is my Western conditioning. However, I did decide to take up meditation. I meditated daily for several years using a binaural beat auditory technology that takes you into deep theta and even delta brain wave states. It was fantastic; I felt so happy and alive. But then I realised that I was still externalising, using a technology to take me into a blissful state of nothingness. George describes meditation techniques that require you to internalise external energies as ecstasy for the ego. I have to agree. I was more attracted to the self-development and the new age movement as it offered a blend of eastern philosophy with western metaphysics. But again these modalities either ask you to internalise energies from outside yourself or limit their focus to the mind. You are asked to bring in energies of Archangel Michael’s blue sword, the violet flame of St. Germaine or “Universal” white light into your crown chakra. Alternative healing modalities also commonly use external energies and techniques as part of their healing practices. Enlightened yogis, great sages and ascended masters tell us absolute Truth is found within. But are these teachers providing the complete picture? Many refer to the chakra body and third eye activation. In this book, George investigates these techniques and philosophies and poses the question; could the pineal gland and the chakra body be part of an elaborate plan by a small ‘g’ god to usher humanity towards a limited cosmic level of enlightenment? I have spent 2 years working alongside George as his business manager and friend. I have also been quietly looking for holes in his character and his material. Can the message he shares about our universal journey actually be true? I can’t answer this question. But we will all soon know because George’s harmonic equations and heart based communication with Mother Earth nominate the March equinox 2013 as the end of the great cycle. There is a phenomenon that surrounds George Kavassilas. He never posts on Facebook but his personal page is fully subscribed and his “like page” continues to grow daily into many thousands. He is one of the most requested guests on the alternative radio circuit. His 2011 interviews recorded some of the highest number of downloads for the year. An independent forum set up by like-minded people has swelled to over 1000 members and he never posts on any thread. An acclaimed music video director felt so inspired by George that he has spent the last two years of his spare time filming and editing a movie quality documentary on George’s life. I have had many amazing personal experiences since meeting George - too many for this short foreword. But one I’d like to share occurred only two weeks after I decided to be George’s ‘Manager’. Through a peculiar set of circumstances I was invited to attend a dinner with a fellow who claimed to be the head of the secret military in Australia. I didn’t ask for any credentials as it didn’t seem appropriate at the time but his status has since been collaborated by one of the world’s prominent personalities in this area of research. He was a pleasant chap and wanted to know my intentions and motivation for helping George, to give me the ‘rules of engagement’ and of course meet with George. The follow-up meeting between the three of us was the most bizarre I have ever experienced and the content of such will remain in strict confidence. However, he did reveal that the intention of the “off world” controllers was to integrate human DNA with artificial intelligence; trans-humanism. Sounds unbelievable at first but if you study the incredible advances in nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cloning, robotics and 4D holographics, trans-humanism could be a reality within our lifetime."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Look at our society today. The technocratic era is well established and it does feel like we are being funnelled into a controlled society with an ultimate agenda of creating human cyborgs. I certainly do not feel that I have incarnated onto this living organic planet we call Mother Earth to become a sophisticated human robot. George’s material and my own intuition tell me that a virtual world integrated with artificial human intelligence is not the intended outcome for humanity. George holds no tertiary qualifications, ties to secret societies nor has he ever been employed by the military or government. What George has to draw on is a vast amount of wisdom, gained through a lifetime of extraordinary experiences, including interactions with Beings from many different planets and realities. He has no agenda, hidden or otherwise. He does not seek fame, followers or fortune. He doesn’t even ask anyone to believe him. His sole motive is to share a message of self-empowerment that helps trigger a remembrance of how truly magnificent you are. As crazy as George’s material may seem, the man is completely sane and one of the most respectful and honourable human beings I've had the pleasure to meet. Yes the knowledge and wisdom he shares is literally out of this world but I can assure you it is not the ramblings of a mad man. What sets George’s book apart from others is that his knowledge is gained through the school of hard knocks. The message that he presents fills in the gaps left by many others. Everything fits into his universal model. We are all on different paths and George’s message will not resonate with everyone. If you find yourself struggling with the material in a particular paragraph or chapter just skip it and move on. For me and many others The Message that George shares is life changing. You owe it to yourself to finish the book. You may find your life will never be quite the same again. George exposes the lies and deceptions which bind us to the earthly, galactic and cosmic matrices. He asks us to go deep within to connect to our single heart centre. It is only by exposing all the layers of manipulation and shattering the false beliefs and programs that we can re- remember who we truly are, where we come from, why we are here and how to complete Our Universal Journey home. –– Jason Bawden-Smith "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction Hi, my name is george and I’ve written a book. I reckon this will not be your average read, so grab yourself a cuppa and enjoy an awareness expanding experience. Having said that, because of the challenging nature of the content, instead of a cuppa, some people might actually need a stiff drink. For many years friends and family members kept suggesting that I should write a book. At first I did not want or feel the need to. But soon after returning home from a world tour of speaking engagements in 2011 I felt that the time had finally arrived for me to somewhat reluctantly write a book. I don’t read books regularly; in fact I have probably read about ten books my entire life so the prospect of me writing one seemed daunting to say the least. The reason people wanted me to write a book is because of the extra-ordinary experiences I have had throughout my life and the knowledge and wisdom I have gained from these experiences. They feel it is important to share this knowledge and wisdom in the written form with our Human family. Throughout my life, I have had numerous experiences that have revealed to me an understanding of the construct of our Universe and our journey within it. This enables me to explain it in a simplistic manner and therefore making it accessible to everyone. The most significant of these experiences occurred in 2003 when I took a journey as pure consciousness, as my spirit and Soul, and travelled up through the dimensions of our Universe. This was not astral travel, nor was it ethereal. I know it was beyond those states of being as I have experienced both of them as well. This journey also enabled me to peer outside this Universe, to reconnect with my Eternal Essence and to once again remember the construct of life and therefore answers to the four primordial questions: “Who are we? Where do we come from? What are we doing here? And where are we headed?” I do not fully recall this experience for a number of reasons, but I have retained enough knowledge and wisdom to share with my Human family to help bring about a greater level of awareness. I realise people will be curious to know about my experiences but I have purposefully left out the detail because I do not want to make this about me. The content I am sharing needs to be the main point of focus. The information is what really counts, and if taken into consideration it has the power to trigger a person into awakening, empowering them from within and consequently transforming their life. Where we find ourselves to be in our Journey, whatever our current set of circumstances are, know that in the greater scheme of things you are perfectly positioned. I do know and understand that we are all on our own individual journey, and so the information that I am sharing with you here does not have to be accepted by anyone. There are times when I will express myself in the affirmative, flavoured with passion and even a determined assertiveness. This is because the energy that is controlling our minds requires at times a proactive and uncompromising approach. Furthermore, by exposing negative aspects of our cultural programs and the deception imposed upon our Humanity I am in no way devaluing yours nor anyone else’s life experiences. I am simply explaining my rediscovery and remembering of the way things are after having awakened from the global, galactic and even cosmic trance. All I ask is that you take into consideration the information being shared and then see what works for you. Wherever your intuitive heart guides you to venture in life, then that is the appropriate path for you. You do not have to go where I am going. This book will be challenging to some, no doubt about it. I understand what it feels like to have what we hold dear as our perceptions and beliefs of what life is and what life should be, challenged in a way that makes us feel uncomfortable. This has been happening to me throughout my life and continues today. What I have come to know is that the moment will soon emerge when we will all have the opportunity to once again be consciously reconnected with the greater aspects of Self, and therefore the knowledge and wisdom of the Universe, and even beyond. If until that moment we are to only be in our comfort zone, remaining metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, too fearful to venture out and explore life beyond our current intellectual paradigms, and to never feel challenged in any way, then we will forever remain stagnant in our level of awareness producing little or no growth in wisdom. That could very well result in a missed opportunity for this priceless reconnection. I do not profess to know everything about everything as I am still in the process of ‘awakening’ and therefore functioning from a state of limited consciousness. However, my experiences have given me an understanding of the big picture and access to answers to many of the big questions. The information that I will be sharing with you will challenge mind sets, mental constructs and belief systems. In fact for many it will challenge them greatly, some more than others. Everyone will be challenged in one way or another. As one reads on and the level of discomfort rises internally then please consider that this may well be an indicator of one having unknowingly been assimilated into a mental/intellectual construct and/or belief system, procured from our societal programming. You will notice I do not favour one group over another as I am here to expose everything on all levels. Many people from various cultures will be reading this so I simply ask you take into consideration that some of my interpretations will come from within my cultural paradigm. You may also find occasional over-explanation. This is because we are dealing with the biggest concepts that life has to offer and I want to make sure I convey the information as clearly as possible for all to understand. My intention is not to create a literary masterpiece but rather an experiential account of Universal knowledge and wisdom. Beliefs may be torn down, but in their stead the naked truth rises in its simple beauty. Please note that this book is not for the faint-hearted. I am not here to fluff things up by wrapping the information in sophisticated seductive literature so it gives you the warm and fuzzies. Nor am I here to entertain your mind. In fact I am here to confront your mind. I have written this book to inform you and our Human family in the clearest, most direct, raw and simplistic way I can. It is time . "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Manipulation of History Mis-representation of history To understand what has really happened to the knowledge of Humanity, one must first realise that for the past 6000 years what has been, and what is still being presented as history and knowledge is a cleverly orchestrated twist on a twist on a twist on a twist. Actually, when one can see it for what it truly is, you realise that it is genius. So if you think that uncovering ‘The Truth’ is going to be as simple as reading some ancient texts, then you may want to reconsider that approach as your only option. For example, academia encourages people to accept ancient texts that are written in stone as an accurate depiction of what transpired. This is a very narrow minded approach. Just because an ancient text may be written in stone and is a few thousand years old, does not mean it is an accurate depiction of how events actually transpired. It is still someone else’s version of reality as history has always been written by the victors and so it is therefore a lopsided viewpoint. Consider that whatever the ancient ruling parties wanted people to know, and in which way they wanted people to perceive life, was how they presented the information. Ancient peoples had to deal with issues of control just as we do today. I am not saying that absolutely everything written in ancient times was incorrect. I am simply saying that the information was written with an agenda, a slant and a twist serving a political agenda, a military agenda or more often than not, a theocratic agenda. There were for example good people that have been maligned and misrepresented down through the ages. Some for hundreds of years and others for thousands of years simply because those in positions of power saw them as their enemies and out of sheer hatred, bitterness and vengeance, wanted them to be known throughout time as nefarious characters. Uncovering the real knowledge of life is like unravelling a puzzle that has many layers because the real knowledge of life remains hidden beneath layers of twisted truths and manipulations. Just when you think you’ve found it, another piece of information comes along, or a revelation surfaces from within and alters one’s previous perspective. That is why many find it so difficult a journey; the journey of the...’truth seeker’. We are all seekers of truth or you would not be interested in reading this book. However, the knowledge of life is not as far out of reach as one may think. You see, the further one journeys down the path of the seeker and the more one learns, the more one realises the irony of such a journey. When we realistically look back through time at the way people have dealt with the four primordial questions, an obvious theme emerges. It becomes totally clear that most of those who have been seeking the answers to these questions behave in a particular way. People have searched high and low and travelled to the ends of the Earth in the search for the answers to these questions. They have manipulated others, betrayed, tortured and even murdered in the quest for these answers. Whole communities and societies have been obliterated in the pursuit for these answers. Wars have been fought, both won and lost. Incredibly, even whole civilisations down through the ages have risen and fallen as a result of the insane obsession of the few in pursuit for the answers to these very same questions...staggering! Having said all that, the most astounding and even ludicrous fact is that the answers to these questions have been in the possession of each and every one of us through this whole epoch of amnesia. Isn’t it incredible to know that all along, while so many were out there seeking and searching, brutalising, destroying and killing in the name of, the whole time they all possessed these very same answers. Yes we all have them, and they simply are within us! They lay in rest, dormant for the precise moment when all will be revealed. It is said, ‘The kingdom of heaven is within!’ The time in our journey has come for us as a Human Race to once again have access to the knowledge and wisdom of life. The epoch of amnesia has come to an end. We have reached a point in time in this cycle which is known throughout our Universe as ‘The Cycle for Life Eternal’ and more commonly called on our planet, ‘The Precession of The Equinoxes’ or ‘The Great Year’ as the Maya and ancient peoples and philosophers call it. It is a time when the veil is lifting and all will be revealed as we approach the cycle’s ending. As we complete this cycle, a journey into separation from our true essence and then back, we go through a process of reintegrating with our greater aspect of Self that is one with the consciousness of this Universe and one with life beyond which some call, ‘The All’ or ‘Source’. We also go through a remembering of who and what we are. As a result, we will once again know the answers to the four primordial questions of life. What I am sharing with you here in this book is my understanding of the answers to these primordial questions. We all have the knowledge and wisdom of life within, so ultimately I am not teaching anyone anything new here. What I am doing is providing my understanding of this forgotten knowledge and wisdom which I have re-discovered and remembered through my life’s experiences, so that it may serve as a trigger for people to once again reactivate the dormant aspect of self. The knowledge shared in these pages and the pages that follow, provides keys to understanding life in its purest form. This is about self-empowerment! Exposing the insanity of the status quo We live in a society that holds the people who have pursued the ‘official’ programs of achievement in the highest of regards. The problem is this process propagates, promotes and reinforces the infrastructure of that system. It also reinforces the insecurities and fears of the peoples living within that very same society. The system then becomes the reason for one’s success and dependency becomes crucial; this in turn elevates the system to a position of a supreme entity. This type of approach stifles and restricts the Human spirit and does not allow for expansion and growth but simply aspires for the containment of Human awareness within “the system”. Therefore, conformity becomes paramount, and any attempts to share knowledge and wisdom by those who experience life outside and beyond the system and its official societal curriculum are ridiculed, persecuted and condemned, and even judged as mentally unstable. The moment one begins to contemplate the vastness of the Cosmos, instantly, any person with any logic, sensibility, rationality or intuition at all, will tell you there is no possible way that we could be alone in the vast magnitude of our cosmos. I find it sad when people who have little letters after their names, considered leaders or even elders in their respective fields among our communities, continue to propagate theories and notions that we are all alone in the Universe. I know this may sound harsh but I have to be real about this. This train of thought is in itself so incredibly small and narrow minded, and when viewed from a greater level of awareness and understanding, it reveals itself to be a mind"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that has been misled and even deceived. It is the norm that “educated” people are considered to be intellectually superior, yet sadly the over whelming majority know so little about life. It is increasingly obvious and absolutely clear to many, that the current societal curriculums are specifically designed to funnel Human awareness down a particular path. It is easy to see how people with ideologies of the status quo brainwash many by implementing systems of programming under the guise of education. When people who talk about life beyond our planetary domain experience others judging them, calling them crazy and deluded, the grand irony is that the ones doing the judging don’t realise they are coming from a limited perspective and that they themselves are propagating a deluded state of mind. A state of mind that has been programed by a system, which has brainwashed them into believing the concept that we are all alone and that the state’s current version of reality is all there is. We are supposed to believe the “official” rubber stamped version of reality, and whatever Science and Religion tell us, is the forefront of Human evolution and understanding of life in its totality...how absurd! It is plain to see that both these paradigms are under complete control! The problem is, the evidence that we are not alone is hidden in plain sight and that is why it is so difficult for many to see and recognise. When I say plain sight, I really mean it. Truth is all around us, everywhere, but do you have the eyes to see? Do you have the awareness to notice ? Recognizing truth behind the façade is about raising one’s awareness! Both Science and Religion have elements of truth; and both are infested with twisted truths and manipulations, used to control our Human psyche through a method called ‘Divide and conquer’. This is where two opposing ideologies are created by a third but hidden group that remains unseen. The third group controls the other two from behind the scenes, so the visible two are always kept busy fighting amongst themselves. That way they can’t see the forest through the trees. They are forever trapped on a merry-go-round of ideological conflict unable to see beyond either paradigm rooted in duality. This same system of control is being implemented on many levels in our societies. Let’s take politics for example. Is it not glaringly obvious that in almost every governmental system around the world, there are always two main parties in opposition to one another? Haven’t you ever noticed? Granted there are some minor parties but they are just token gestures so at least the illusion of some level of choice and even “freedom” is established. And if people do notice, most just put it down to “coincidence”. Another example of hidden in plain sight is all the ancient monuments around the world and the information they store in their mathematically designed structures. These monuments are libraries of information which took absolute genius to construct, yet they continue to get conveniently fobbed off by mainstream academia. We are continually told that a pack of primitive savages or slaves built them, but when today’s architects take a serious look at these structures it becomes obviously clear that in some cases the techniques and accuracies cannot be replicated even with today’s modern technologies. In regards to the question of who built these ancient monuments and what level of knowledge was used, it is self-evident it was not who and what mainstream science continues to want to convince us of. Some of these ancient monuments were built by highly evolved peoples with extremely advanced technologies that make our so called modern day technology seem primitive in comparison. Hidden in plain site also applies to all the ancient scriptures and even flows into modern day symbolism which is full of hidden messages. It is literally everywhere, all around us but do you have the eyes to see, the ears to hear and the awareness to notice ? This is a huge subject with many great researchers having written multiple books on this subject so I won’t go further into it here. Know that the information is most certainly available for those who wish to continue exploring this avenue. Sceptics It is now time to address the issue of sceptics. Some of what I have to say here may come across as a little harsh; however, it is not my intention to just blatantly insult. I am here to finally expose who these modern day sceptics really are. We have in our world today what is called The Sceptics Society. From the greater meaning of the word ‘sceptic’ these people are not the real sceptics. The word sceptic originates from the Greek noun skepsis, which means examination, inquiry, consideration and to think. Having said that, who are the true sceptics? People like me are true sceptics! Anyone who is experiencing life outside the box is sceptical about what we are being told, what we are being taught and the way we are being programmed into believing the generally accepted beliefs and opinions about life. In our societies we are not only being trained how to think but we are also being told what to think. We are not naturally encouraged to think from our own experiences, for ourselves. A wise person uses intuition and takes the time to verify; especially what others tell us is documented researched, and pawned off as truth. I will tell you who these so-called sceptics are. Most sceptics are nothing more than defenders of the status quo. They are some of its border patrol guards. These are the same people who argued through their teeth a few centuries ago that the world was flat. This is the same group, with the same infrastructure, using the same techniques and arguments, representing the modern day version of the group still stuck in the middle ages. Only the clothing has changed over time; minds remain fixed in stagnation. In fact this group goes way back into ancient cultures but I am just sharing “the world is flat” argument as an example of some of their activities in recent times. This group was originally created to act as a ‘pseudo public thought police’ for the purpose of restricting awareness. These people are one of many groups that have been setup as border patrol guards of the status quo. Their primary and principal objective is to go around making sure people are conforming to the societal “norms”. They want to make sure that you don’t go outside the box by dragging your awareness back into their paradigm which is one of the states’ rubber stamped versions of reality. They do this by using the process of systematic intellectual devaluation of an individual’s experiential reality, by structuring their argument on a subtle undercurrent of insinuated mental instability which eventually yields conformity by stealth. What I mean is that if your experience does not conform to their compartmentalised version of what life is, then it cannot be acknowledged in any way shape or form and must then be systematically dismissed and devalued through what passes off as rational, logical and intellectual argument. The so called “proof” they supply is from departments within “The State” which is ultimately designed to reinforce “The State”. I know what they are being asked to do and I know what their intentions are. Unfortunately most of the people involved in these groups truly feel like they need to do it because they simply believe evidence supplied by the state to be a true reflection of the big picture of life. Sadly, they haven’t the awareness to recognise they are programmed with a belief system, and have been indoctrinated into a dogmatic religion with no way out except to question authority. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Real sceptics are the ones who while we were in school found that teachers did not like us because we asked the “right” questions. We were sceptical of the school curriculum and questioned it. We were and still are, the ones sceptical of what science and religion tell us about life on our planet and beyond. We ask the hard questions; and we nurture a quietly rebellious nature to any ultimate claims of authority or hierarchy. Hence we are the real sceptics. People like me go through life and have incredible experiences that take us beyond this paradigm and reality and because of that we have been able to see life from a much broader perspective. That is where most of us get our knowledge and wisdom from: firsthand personal experience! Today’s so-called Sceptics demand proof. “Show us the proof,” they call out loudly. The grand irony is proof can be found everywhere; it is all around them, yet they refuse to acknowledge it and live in denial of its existence. How can these people be so blind? Reality has moved on and they are still stuck in their box. Sceptics claim to be the realists based on scientific evidence yet they live in denial of the evidence. What the evidence now proves is that they are not true sceptics and they are not true scientists. Yes, they are dealing with reality; but what they are dealing with is such a limited and distorted version of reality, that they cannot see they have boxed themselves into their own dogmatic religion. Their ego demands they defend their beliefs to the bitter end. Meanwhile, everyone else is moving on in life and these people are being left behind stuck in their little boxes. They are still trying to shout out to the world that what they are looking at is reality, and that people who experience life beyond their version of reality are all crazy and deluded. We look back at them with their little heads sticking out from inside their box screaming at us saying. “No, no! We are the ones who know what reality is and all you guys are nuts!” So now, as we walk away from these small-minded boxes, we turn around, look back and say, “Are you sure about that? Are you absolutely sure about that?” This is the unfortunate reality that has also fallen upon the overwhelming majority of psychiatrists and psychologists. The word ‘psyche’ is a Greek word meaning spirit or soul. So the notion that psychiatry and psychology are working with spirit is simply not true, as they are solely concerned with the study of the mind. This is all about mental programing and unfortunately they too have become little more than border patrol guards of the status quo. Consequently, they play a big role in the containment of human awareness. The same applies for the overwhelming majority of scientists. True scientists get shut down because true science by its very nature will always lead one beyond the boundaries of the status quo. Telescopes are now seeing far into the cosmos and scientists have worked out that our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars. They have also discovered thus far, that there are hundreds of billions of galaxies. Just contemplate that for a moment; hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. And that is only what has been discovered so far in the visible Cosmos. I find it incredibly amusing when a probe gets sent to Mars by a group of people who call themselves scientists, who themselves have been totally brainwashed by this system’s curriculum and are there looking for the possibility of life in the form of bacteria. All the while the evidence for extra-terrestrial life surrounds them, throughout the Cosmos and all over our planet, yet they are blinded by their own programmed state of mind. They are literally programmed into not accepting the evidence that is before them and simply dismiss it as conspiracy, myth, legend or fantasy. So after addressing to varying degrees some of the broader issues at hand, know there are multitudes of people on our planet who are having experiences beyond the boundaries of the “official” rubber stamped version of reality. Most are too hesitant to share their experiences for fear of ridicule and persecution, but some are not. I am one who is not! The three subjects considered taboo or inappropriate, ridiculed in conversation and in some cases even forbidden in our communities are the three very same systems that are used to control our Human race: Politics, Religion and Extra-Terrestrial or Inter Dimensional life! It is said, ‘Truth is stranger than fiction!’ It is also said, ‘The Truth hurts!’ "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Who Are We & Where Do We Come From? In my travels I journeyed to the very edge or boundaries of this Universe. Some people say that this Universe is infinite but that is not true. All one needs to do is look at the label we use, ‘Universe’, and one can clearly see that it means ‘one verse’ which in the greater scheme of things means one expression of life. Therefore, this Universe ultimately has a finite existence. What is infinite about this Universe is its potentiality . What I rediscovered, and I literally do mean rediscovered, was that we exist infinitely beyond this Universe. What my essence and consciousness observed, sensed, felt and knew when I looked outside of this Universe was what I will call a ‘Multiverse’. This Multiverse is made up of countless Universes. Our Multiverse is a part of something else, and that something else is in turn a part of something furthermore, which that something furthermore is also a part of another construct yet again infinitely. Now our minds habitually will tend to think in a linear and hierarchical manner due to our mental programming by our societal curriculums, but that is not the case in the Multiverse and in the greater scheme of things. The something furthermore does not necessarily mean bigger or greater or, superior. I know our minds struggle with this concept. I also want to say that the Multiverse I am referring to is not the same as what science refers to as parallel Universes. That version of Multiverse is a whole different paradigm and is contained in the lower domains of this Universe only! What I am sharing goes way beyond the concepts of the paradigm we call science. The biggest revelation for my earthly ego was that we are truly infinite and eternal. Now some people can contemplate what that actually means but nearly all only hold those contemplations as intellectual concepts and can’t yet move it from the mind into actually being it. Let me elaborate on the concept of being eternal and infinite because it really is the key for one’s earthly aspect to once again be free and sovereign. I say to you, ‘Nothing exists beyond your infinite, eternal and immortal self’. OK, so what does that feel like and what other thoughts does it stimulate? Let me put it this way. If you are truly infinite, eternal and immortal, and nothing exists beyond you, then that means there is nothing above you, that there is nothing that is greater than you and therefore you are not subservient to anyone or anything. It literally means that you have not been born or spawned out of some “God” entity. We are all, infinite together! There is no beginning and there is no end to you. You simply always have existed and always will exist; you always have been and always will be... This leaves us with one of the biggest questions of them all, ‘Who and what is God?’ What I have rediscovered personally is that we have projected a part of us into this Universe which is a living Being; therefore, there is a Creator of this Universe. Consequently, we together with the essence of the Creator of this Universe, exist infinitely and eternally beyond this Universal expression/creation. The Creator of this Universe is not the Creator and ruler of all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists, as there is no such thing and we are all equal. Also, the Universal Creator is the first Being to remind you of this when a conscious awareness is re-established. Life simply exists beyond what we perceive as energy, concepts or labels. Disassociated from the way things truly are, is a Being that most people worship and refer to as “God”. In most cases this is a reference to a “Supreme Being”, or a Being that is claiming to be the creator and ruler of all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists. This particular “God Being” resides in the lower domains of this Universe only! This is an absolute fact of reality, which I have experienced for myself! There is no such thing as one single “Being” who is the creator and ruler of all things in all of existence. Life is infinite and that other concept is finite! I know what religious people and those who see themselves as subservient to a “God” are thinking and feeling right now. But it does not matter how incensed you are in this moment, it will simply not change reality, it will not change the way things are, and it will not change The Truth. I told you in the beginning that the knowledge and wisdom shared in these pages will challenge everyone one way or another. If you are now feeling a mental and emotional reaction then we have just exposed that you have a program be it Earthly or even Cosmic in origins. If you are feeling excitement or at peace with what I just shared then you already have access to the greater knowledge and wisdom of life within you, whether you are aware of it or not. I am purposely trying to avoid using the label ‘God’ in the context of the Universal creator because that word has been misused throughout the ages with many connotations. Most of the time I will try to avoid it where possible but there are circumstances due to our cultural programs where the use of this word is necessary so that I may convey the information in a way that people can better understand. If someone wants to use it in the context of a single Being claiming to be the creator and ruler of all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists, then that is entirely their choice to continue to live within that lie. I will now use the label ‘God’ in the context of the Universal Creator. It is written in many ancient scriptures of many cultures that we are the children of God. It is also written in the Bible that Jesus was the Son of God and that he said we too are all the Sons of God, the Children of God. But what does that actually mean? What is this message really trying to tell us? It is also written that he said, “As above so below”. Well here is my understanding which as mentioned before, I have attained through my own personal experiences of having travelled through this Universe and even looking beyond. As our parents give birth to us so that we may become as them, so too is the Creator of this Universe, or ‘God’, in the process of carrying us within its embodiment so that it may give birth to us, and we too can become as God. Just as you existed in the form of Spirit prior to incarnating into your mother’s womb, so too do you exist in the form of an Eternal Essence prior to you entering this Universe or entering ‘God’. So where does that leave us with Religion? As mentioned before with science, what I am sharing with you here goes way beyond the concepts of the paradigm we call religion. I will further address this issue later in the book, but for now let’s return to how it is we have come to find ourselves here in this Universe and eventually onto this planet, and continue answering the first two Primordial Questions: Who are we? And where do we come from? Entering this Universe "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Let’s take our awareness back to the Multiverse where there are countless Universes. Each Universe like this one has its own unique expression, but because they have their own expression this also means that they provide their own unique set of experiences. They have their own unique personality and therefore their own unique construct. The construct or energy that makes up this Universe is called ‘Light’. It is also known as frequency, wave form, vibration, sound, Logos and The Word. It is unique in and of itself. The construct of all those other Universes are also unique in and of themselves. They are not made of this energy we call Light; therefore they are different from this one and different from each other. Some say that light is all there is and that there is the light of God and then God and that’s it! The moment one thinks this way, instantly one is putting a finite existence on Life. Does life exist beyond light? Of course it does! This question and answer is being communicated from a creational perspective and not from a Religious or New Age viewpoint which says, where there is no light there is only darkness. That angle and argument is in the lower domains of this Universe only! Again, I will go into further detail on this matter later in the book. What I am explaining here is that each one of those Universes is its own individual Being. All those other Universes out there with all their unique expressions are us! Astounding! How incredibly profound is this piece of knowledge? From our Eternal Essence we have manifested ourselves as Universes. This is what the Multiverse is made up of, us , collectively as Universes. We then go through the process of learning each other’s expression and therefore construct. We do this by our Eternal Essence projecting a part of ourselves, an aspect of ourselves into one another’s Universe. We all go inside one another and learn everything there is to know about each other’s expression as a Universe, so that we may then embark on a journey of creating our own Universe via the constructs we have newly mastered. This is how we have found ourselves to be inside of this Universe. We wanted to experience and learn about this expression and construct we call light. When one goes within one’s heart and reconnects with the higher aspects of self, the remembrance of the relationship we are having with this Universe, is once again revealed. As mentioned before, the consciousness and Creator of this Universe is the first to remind you that you are an equal and that you exist infinitely together beyond its level of creation as this Universe. Thereupon, at a point in time in your existence your Eternal Essence decided to send an aspect, a part or a spark of yourself inside this Universe to learn all about this expression and construct we call ‘Light’. So...what came next? This Universe What I now wish to share with you is the model of this Universe that I personally experienced in my travels. At the very top of the diagram we have the Eternal Essence of the Creator of this Universe prior to its manifestation as Light. It is therefore undivided, sanctified and whole. As the Universal Creator then began to express and experience itself in the form of Light it initially projected an expression that had two contrasting states of being, 1st level/12th Dimension. Once that initial expression of two contrasting aspects had"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"been stabilised, all possibilities and outcomes were then explored and eventually exhausted in that level. Due to the wisdom gained from such an experience the Creator then felt compelled to continue exploring this path of, manifesting, creating and experiencing this concept to a further degree. As a result other deeper levels of Light, vibration, frequency and sound were created. The more it chose to explore, the more it found itself moving away from its whole and sanctified self. The Universal Creator soon realised the magnitude of what creating Light entailed and even demanded. It was the first expression in creation that provided such an internal challenge. This comes about due to the very nature of Light. It facilitates expressing one’s self in contrasting aspects to such a degree that eventually one aspect of self is not even aware of the other. Because of this newly acquired point of reference and wisdom, one is now able to establish an even greater level of appreciation and gratitude, like never before, for one’s whole and sanctified essence and therefore the infinite isness. And so, the Creator continued to project into the next level, then to the next and so on and so on; exploring, experiencing, and gaining wisdom. That is how all the major domains and layers of realities in this Universe have been created. I do realise that these concepts can be a little difficult to grasp down here in the depths of this Universe, in part due to the mind control programs we have all been exposed to for thousands of years, but please try to understand the magnitude of the knowledge and wisdom that is being shared with you here. It may help if I explain it in a more geometrical manner. The following diagram represents Light in its most simplistic form. The point at which the vertical line and the horizontal lines meet is the Eternal Essence of the Universal Creator in its whole and sanctified state prior to it manifesting and creating itself as this Universe. This also applies to us prior to entering this Universe. The horizontal line is the aspect that is now the projected, centred state of consciousness into the creative process. The waveform is the creative process through consciousness expressing itself one way and then another way. This literally is the moment of the creation of light. This is how vibration, frequency, sound, The Logos and The Word was created. Each way of expressing itself is a counterpart and reflection of the other. So consciousness moving away from its whole and sanctified state expresses itself in a particular way on one side of the line, and then in order for balance to be re-established, it now must express itself in another way that counterbalances the former. Here is another way of looking at our journey into this Universe using diagrammatic and Symbolic form: I realise there are many interpretations of an image and a symbol. In the conspiratorial realm this kind of image conjures up all kinds of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"negative thought processes due to the mind control programmes being disseminated within that domain. I will explain what this diagram means for me and many others. Hopefully, those who are already reacting will come to realise that it is the most effective diagram which explains our entry and journey within this Universe. I may also sound like I am repeating myself but please bear with me as this subject is as big as it gets and requires clarity of understanding for all kinds of mindsets. Instead of looking at it from a left to right perspective, we are once again looking at it from the top down. The circle or sphere at the top depicts the Universal Creator totally one, whole and sanctified as its pure Eternal Essence prior to its manifestation as Light. This also represents us, our Eternal Essence before entering this Universe and doing the same. As the Creator then projected its centred state consciousness down through the levels, depicted by the centre vertical line, it then went about expanding and expressing itself on different levels of vibration. With each level the waveform got bigger and slower, further away from centre and the expression of self becomes more polarised resulting in an increase in density. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this Universe not only is expansion experienced but the polarisation creates separation and fragmentation. Eventually, due to the degree of expansion, polarisation, separation and fragmentation the Creator experienced, it became clear that for one to have two aspects of self that are not aware of one another and not aware of the Greater Self, was precarious to say the least. The dualistic nature of this way of being now provided the greatest learning one could hope for in achieving the ultimate appreciation and gratitude of one’s whole and sanctified Eternal Essence, but at the same time the process of accomplishing this presented a thrilling, provocative and even perilous journey. The greater the challenge, the greater the wisdom; this is what Light yields What the Creator did next was to manifest a plan within itself that would accommodate other Beings entering within this Universal embodiment so that they may also experience this expression we call Light. This plan commonly known as, ‘The Divine Plan of Creation’, was to facilitate a pathway and a journey that would enable Beings to enter this Universe; go through all the different layers, levels, domains and realities and the process of experiencing everything Light has to offer. Again, due to the degree of expansion, polarisation, separation and fragmentation experienced in the lower domains, it became possible for some Beings to remain addicted to that state of being. This was due to the thrill and the buzz resulting from the imbalances and the interactive process with dense realities that had been created. That is why when one begins to venture further down this path into the realms of extreme duality; one’s lower aspect cannot leave whenever it wants to, no matter how high and mighty it may think of itself. Balance must be re-established first. Therefore, it was imperative that The Divine Plan facilitated an exit strategy that included bringing all of one’s experiences back into balance. The importance of this exit strategy will become clearer as we continue to answer the primordial questions and remember our journey in this Universe. Now let’s take a look at our journey in relation to the previous diagram. We then enter and begin our journey expressing ourselves on one side of the middle vertical line and then the other. Our vibration is very high and our waveform is incredibly fine while we are experiencing Light near our Greater Essence and the Creators Whole and Sanctified Essence. We then begin to venture down through the levels as we embark on a ‘Grand Journey’ to explore this Universe in order to obtain wisdom by learning from experiencing all life within it so that we may achieve our intended outcome. Yes, our intended outcome. Remember the primary and principal reason for you entering this Universe to begin with was to not just experience this expression, not just to get a taste, but to learn everything this construct called ‘Light’ has to offer so that you may first and foremost realise the value of your I AM or Whole and Sanctified Eternal Essence, and then master Light, become Light in its totality, and eventually independently create life through Light. As a result of our journey away from the Creators Whole and Sanctified Eternal Essence and our Whole and Sanctified Eternal Essence, our waveform becomes bigger and slower; therefore the realities and our aspects become denser. We then continue to project from one level down to the next and again to the next, as we progress in our journey to obtain wisdom resulting from our experiences. Let’s take a more detailed look at our journey within this Universe. Our journey within this Universe Expressing one’s self as Light for the very first time takes place in the first level or 12th Dimension. This is where we enter and initially experienced ourselves as two contrasting aspects. The Universal Creator has the top three Dimensions 12th, 11th, and 10th for one’s Eternal Essence to sample Light and see if it is an appropriate path one wishes to explore. If one does not wish to proceed any further then one can easily re-balance from these highest realms and leave this expression of Light and therefore this Universe. If one however wishes to continue exploring and consequently has the intention of learning and becoming Light, then one is committing to the entire process and path that lay ahead. When one enters a reality one first needs to acclimatise oneself to the energetic patterns of that reality prior to having a symbiotic creative process with the essence which is that reality. That is why the Creator of this Universe has a level, a place within itself where we substantiate our intentions of entering this Universe to experience and learn its expression. This is the level and the place that I refer to as the ‘Nursery of the Souls’. It is in this place, on this level, the 9th Dimension where we merge and become one with the Essence of this Universe. We do this in order to calibrate our essence to the expression of this Universe and become Light. In that moment we created our Light based Essence called Consciousness and Soul. It is in this moment that we have a seed planted internally within us, within our consciousness, within our Soul, by the Creator of this Universe. This seed is a fractal of this Universe which will one day sprout when we master the construct of Light enabling us to become a Universal Creator of Light. "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Although this seed has many names and interpretations within every culture, its original meaning has either been lost or remains hidden, been twisted or repackaged as something different by the priestly castes. It is referred to as our Christ centre, Sophia centre, Allah centre, Buddha centre, Tara centre, Krishna centre, Rahda centre, Quetzalcoatl centre, Rainbow Serpent centre, or whatever label you want to use, it’s all the same thing. It is the seed of Universal Consciousness itself. I have just mentioned a menagerie of religious identities and I don’t want to confuse you, but the reference I am making here has to do with the original intentions and meanings associated with these names and the thread of truth that has made it down through the ages; not what is currently being served up to the masses by the priestly caste. After we entered this Universe and spent the first little while adjusting ourselves and acclimatising as pure Light energy we then projected an aspect of ourselves down into the 8th dimension where we still remained as energetic Light. There we explored the entire Universe as pure consciousness. So once all possibilities and outcomes were experienced in the 8th dimension we then further projected an aspect of ourselves down into the 7th dimension. Now when I use the term projected I really mean that literally. What this says is that we still have aspects of ourselves in each of these higher realms and we simply project from one level down to the next and then to the next stepping down our vibrational frequency each time as we go along our journey. Because of the programs that are being disseminated throughout our societies we tend to think that we are “it” down here, and that we must strive to re-enter the higher domains because we are no longer there. That is not true and that perspective is part of the deception that is being imposed into the psyche of our Human Race. To know that we already exist in these higher realms means all we have to do is re-integrate with our higher aspects of self. This is truly an astounding and crucial piece of knowledge to once again remember as it enables one to reconnect with higher aspects of self, resulting in us returning to our sovereignty and freedom. I will further address this deception later in the book, so let’s continue our journey through this Universe. As you can see there is a thick Universal membrane also known as ‘The Void’ between the 8th and 7th dimensions. This is because there is a big difference between life above the 8th and below the 8th. The 7th dimension is the first level where we begin to participate and engage in this Universe in the realms of form. This is where the highest levels of form are manifest e.g. cosmic consciousness and galactic consciousness. The Creator’s ethos is that this journey you are undertaking within its Universe is to be a participatory process. In other words, each one of us have been, and still are, co-creating with the Creator and with one another as we journey through this Universe; so it is essential to remember and know that we all are planets, stars and galaxies as well. We also have individualised embodiments expressed in many different types of form and in many levels but whose make-up and construct in the higher dimensions is of a much finer and higher vibration. What an amazing revelation it is for us to remember the extent and magnitude of our true essence, our consciousness and our creations. Many people fear this concept and think it preposterous and even laughable because they have been so programed into believing this is all they are in the way of form and if there is any more to themselves, well then it has just got to be their Spirit and nothing else. People have also been led to believe that “God” is the creator of everything and that we are his children and nothing more than lowly sinners. These are such"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"limiting doctrines and programs. They are designed to create external and internal divisions and even resentment to one’s existence in this expression of Light. The greatest irony of all is the beings that propagate this kind of perspective are themselves stuck in the lower domains of this Universe and want to keep as many from leaving as they possibly can. This subject matter will be addressed further in the section called, ‘The Supreme Cosmic Deception’. We then exhaust all possibilities and outcomes in the 7th to then project aspects down into the 6th dimension where we once again go through the same process of co-creating, exploring and exhausting all possibilities and outcomes in that band of frequencies and energetic patterns. Generally speaking the main point of focus in the 6th Dimension is the process of perfecting our forms, our expressions and creations. After this has been achieved we then project aspects down into the 5th dimension where the same processes of exploration are once again implemented. But this time we, kind of slow down because what awaits us in our journey below the 5th ,is vastly different to anything that has come before. When one is up in the higher dimensions, in the 5th 6th and 7th, the realms of the Higher Self, one is immersed in harmonised light. Looking up to these levels from down here, the 5th is where what one would call Heaven begins. The 5th is the lowest vibratory realm of Heaven, also called Avalon, Shambala, Paradise, Tula, Dreamtime, Valhalla and many other names as each culture has their own interpretation of this realm. I am not too keen on using these labels because of what has become of them in today’s world due to their misuse by the priestly caste, but at least it gives people the opportunity to understand what I am explaining here through labels we are all familiar with. There are no words that can express what the 5th Dimension truly feels like, although there is a word that comes close, and that word is Grace. In these higher realms we are talking about Light that is so fine that one experiences a continual state of being of Unconditional Love. Also there is no technology in the 5th dimension and above, as everything is manifested and achieved using our organic consciousness. In these higher realms there is no such thing as the concept we call evil. Our aspects in the Higher Self realms have the capacity to be all things at the same time. There we still have access to Universal Consciousness and can experience what it is like to be this Universe at any given moment, therefore we know everything about everything in the Universe. When we choose to express ourselves as an embodiment in the 5th 6th and 7th dimensions, these embodiments have a single energetic centre, because we are in oneness, harmony and synchronicity with all life in this Universe and the Universal Creator. Healers do not exist in the 5th dimension and above because there is no such thing as illness or dis-ease, therefore nothing needs healing. It is an extremely balanced state of being as one is living off Universal Light energy and therefore there is no eating or drinking of any kind. (Tragically there is no chocolate!) The great arena What exists below the 5th dimension, known as the ‘Great Arena’ is an energy and a version of Light and life that again is vastly different to anything experienced thus far, and will provide the greatest of challenges any Being can wish for. As you can see there is a thick Universal membrane between the 4th and 5th dimensions known as ‘The Great Void’. Below it is the realm of the Great Arena, also referred to as the ‘Cosmic Arena’. This is where technology exists and also where the concept we call evil comes into being. The Great Arena is absolutely colossal in size comprising of multitudes of paradigms that are experienced as entire universes. Only a portion of the Great Arena is affected by evil. Now when I say evil please understand that it comes in many forms. In the upper reaches of the 4thDimension it has become very, very sophisticated indeed including even posing and presenting as light. After all we are talking about eons and epochs and eras of evolution on a Universal scale, so it is important not to be naive and purely ideological about life. As mentioned earlier we decided to slow down before entering the 4th Dimension because the extent of imbalance one is to experience and become requires careful consideration and planning. In fact this is where you may once again regain perspective and realise the magnitude of the power and capacity we have as our Higher Self. It is challenging to say the least for one to put into words the magnitude of planning and organising that takes place because the whole journey that is to come into the Great Arena from that moment on, is created, orchestrated and conducted from the Higher Self and above. The reason for this is because of the extent to which we expand, separate, fragment, polarise and imbalance the aspects of self we are to project. In the Great Arena it is so extreme that aspects of Self have limited awareness of one another and of the rest of the Universe. But, in some realities as on this planet, we become totally unaware of life in the Universe and of the Greater Essence of Self. Another way of looking at this is that we go through a process of voluntary disempowerment as we enter the Great Arena. We go from creating with pure organic consciousness in synchronicity with all life around us in a motion of perpetual flow, to a process that requires thought, deliberation and a level of concern for consequences. Because of the issue of imbalance, when one enters the Great Arena there is only going to be one way out and that is to see, do and be everything that this Universe has to offer in the lower domains. Having reached maximum expansion, separation, polarisation, fragmentation and imbalance, we then go through a process of re-integrating all our aspects and all our creations bringing it all back into zero point and balance. This is known to every Being prior to one’s entry into the Great Arena but unfortunately as part of experiencing the degree of separation required, our projected aspects tend to lose memory once we enter. We also organised our individual experiences from the realm of the Higher Self with a whole multitude of Beings and consciousness’s. For example, if one wishes to incarnate into a particular planetary body which is inside a star system, which in turn is inside a galaxy, each one of these is an individual consciousness. Therefore the Beings that are the galaxy, the star system and the planet that you wish to have an incarnational experience inside of are consulted with. This is because you are about to enter inside of their Cosmic level of embodiments and have an intimate relationship. Hence, every life, every interaction with every Being be it a galaxy, a star system or planet, a parenting role, friendship, sibling or a foe; everything, including the natural environment and all the spirits of all the Beings that make up the natural kingdom is coordinated. All that we are to experience is organised with the Universal Creator and the higher aspect of all these other Beings prior to us entering the Great Arena. Every life that you are ever going to have in every reality and every experience with every Being on every level, within the Great Arena, is pre-organised. Just try and think or maybe even imagine the magnitude and power of love, intelligence and consciousness required to organise such a journey. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"So let’s take it even a step further because I am sure your thought processes are only taking into consideration a single aspect. Try and imagine the same amount of love, consciousness and power of processing and organisation as required for a single aspect to journey through the Great Arena , and now apply it to multiple aspects, hundreds and even into the thousands. We literally have hundreds, thousands and even beyond, aspects of self because we have fragmented into a myriad of domains and realities as we project from the realm of the Higher Self, down into the multiple realms of the Great Arena. We are simultaneously experiencing and participating in all kinds of realities, continuously learning and growing in wisdom. This now raises the big issue of free will. After the last few paragraphs I’m hearing many egos crying out, ‘but what about my free will?’ Well, as my ego has personally re-discovered, allow my ego to inform your ego that in the lower domains of the Universe there is only the appearance of free will and that everything you experience down here has been, and is being, orchestrated from a much higher aspect of your Beingness. When we project from the 5th down into the 4th, our single energetic centre fragments into chakra system embodiments, which have multiple energetic centres. The number and type of chakras will depend on which reality one chooses to explore. The 4th and below is where the Chakra body exists including the concept of illness. Interesting isn’t it how these two co-exist in the same realms. I know for a fact that the Chakra body is not what it seems. What I will say for now is, I can categorically state after once again personally experiencing the higher realms in this lifetime, that the chakra body is a fragmented state of Being. I realise there are many New Age healers that won’t like what is being said here, but they need to come to terms with the fact that their healing modalities belong to a lower realm of the Universe and that if they wish to move beyond these lower realms, they will eventually need to let go of the attachment to their modality. Please understand that I am not blindly judging here, as I have personally gone through this experience myself and that is how I know what I am saying. If a person makes their healing modality their everything, then one has created a religion for themselves. They will remain in the lower domains until a sufficient level of wisdom is acquired to let go and move beyond. Remember there is no such thing as healers in the 5th dimension and above because nothing needs healing. Now, to put things into an even greater perspective; the 4th Dimension is the largest in physical size and that is one of the main reasons it makes up the majority of The Great Arena. You will notice in the previous diagram that there are many lines which represent multiple levels. This is because that is how it is structured. All dimensions have multiple layers of reality but none come close to the size and volume of the 4th dimension. In fact when one is in the lower levels of the 4th and then look up towards the highest levels, it can appear as though one is looking at an entire universal paradigm. To the unaware the Great Void, between the 4th and the 5th dimensions appears as though it is the outside of this Universe. Please realise that this Universe is a very, very big place. The way this Universe is structured makes it possible for aspects of Beings to become addicted to the illusions these polarised, separated and fragmented states facilitate, taking them up to eons and eons of time to eventually realise what has occurred. This is why so many Beings spend such a long time down here. Having said all I have about the 4th Dimension, the vibrations of the love and the light one experiences in the higher levels of the 4th are still so wondrous compared to our version of the 3rd dimension, that many people continue to be lured back into that domain. The 3rd Dimension is a denser version of life relative to the 4th and is primarily where there is a much greater deal of emphasis on the dense physical nature of life. The mechanical, physical and survival states are very pronounced. This is easy to comprehend because this is the general make up of our reality, but is important to know that our planet is not the only 3rd Dimensional realm that exists. When we look out into what we call Outer Space be it with our eyes or with our telescopes, we are actually seeing the layer of the 3rd Dimensional Cosmos. We also see the 4th and 5th Dimensions, slightly blending in with ours in the way of a residual effect as the energies from these other dimensions bleed through into ours. An example of that are the planets that we are observing that seem desolate from our level or layer of vibrational reality but are actually full of life on another level. It is similar to being on one level of a building and seeing an empty floor but not being able to see the next level which is full. So if you actually go up to the next level, then all of a sudden the doors open to a reality that is full of people and full of life. Another example of these residual energies from the higher realms interacting with the 3rd Dimension is the stars. Stars are actually planets but exist on a much, much, higher level of vibration. In fact they vibrate so high that from down here in the 3rd we experience these beings we call stars from the upper reaches of the 4th, the 5th and above as Beings of light. One thing I wish to clarify here is that there are a number of people who propagate the notion that our Earth being in the 3rd Dimension is the lowest of the low. They spread this idea that we are at the very bottom of this Universe and that we are scraping and wallowing in the bowels of life. I will categorically say that this is not true! This type of misinformation is blatantly serving another agenda which I address later in the book in the section called, ‘The Supreme Cosmic Deception’. There are 2 more dimensions below the 3rd. Those are the 2nd and 1st Dimensions. Some people see the 1st and 2nd Dimensions as the 1st D being the Mineral Kingdom, and the 2nd D being the Flora and Fauna or Plant and Animal Kingdoms. I understand their concept however this still does not account for the 1st and 2nd Dimensions of this Universe. The Mineral, Plant and Animal Kingdoms are all a part of this 3rd Dimension. They are simply different expressions of life that help make up this reality. For one to truly understand these lower 2 densities one must consider that there exist realms within this Universe which facilitate the furthest away one can possibly imagine venturing from ones Whole and Sanctified Essence. It is a journey into the true depths of this Universe. The expressions of life that exist in these realms are the slowest and densest. The 2nd D is more saturnalian and amoral in nature whilst the 1st D is most unethical and immoral. There are a plethora of races that exist in the 2nd D, and some of them we are familiar with. There are Draconian races, Reptilians, Grays/Greys, Golgothians, and various others who have plunged down into the depths of maximum expansion, separation, polarisation and fragmentation. People tend to think, as I once did, that what we call the lower astral where some of the most undesirable entities reside, is actually the lower domains of the 4th D. I have come to know for sure that this is totally not true. The lower astral realm has been cleverly and cunningly very much confused on purpose with the 2nd D and even the 1st D. Other groups of these races also exist in the 3rd and 4th Dimensions. I want to clarify that there are groups within these races who are benevolent so it is important not to be blindly racist. Generally speaking though, they are mostly amoral or malevolent."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" The 1st D is where the real lowest of the low exist. These are putrid dark sludgy energies that do nothing but consume the life force of others not only to survive but for pleasure as well. There are very few physical beings in this domain as most are just energy. They have ventured so far away from their Whole and Sanctified Essence that they have lost the ability to perceive any form of love and simply live in a state of perpetual fear. It takes a large amount of energy in the form of a very intense experience for a being living in this realm to have realisations occur and be re-awakened. But once an essence returns from such an experience it has the greatest possible point of reference and wisdom that one can obtain. Very few choose this path relative to the amount of Beings in this Universe but no one can become a true master of Love, Light and Life without it. As mentioned before, if one is to master the construct of Light then all expressions must be experienced for one never truly knows until one has walked in those shoes. Most Beings are too fearful to venture down this path but rather choose to stay wrapped up in their metaphorical cotton wool remaining trapped in their limited, cosy and self-righteous paradigm simply because of the greatest trap of all, their fear of fear itself. The Universal Creator knows this, which is why it continues to facilitate this dimensional realm within its Universal Creation for Beings to experience. I know our self-righteous, judgemental, egoic minds have an issue with comprehending this type of reasoning and for such an expression of life to exist, but putting it bluntly, if it served no purpose then it simply would not exist. I just want to share this wisdom with you as food for contemplation; from one perspective we have ventured so stupendously far from our whole and sanctified state, and from the greater perspective, we have never been separated. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"What Are We Doing Here? Road to compression While we are still answering the first two primordial questions, we are now also beginning to answer the 3rd primordial question, “What are we doing here?” Further contemplation of this question yields more questions such as, “Why have we chosen to incarnate on this planet in particular? And therefore why this star system, and why this galaxy? Why is this aspect of me not incarnated on another planet in another system? What is it about this galaxy, this star system and this planet that my Spirit, my Consciousness and my Soul felt so compelled the need to gravitate here to this place and have an incarnational experience? Therefore, why have such a deep and intimate relationship with our Milky Way Galactic Mother, our Father Sun, and our Mother Earth?” Well, let’s explore this issue of, ‘Why’? The information that has been shared thus far and in the following pages is the hidden knowledge the priestly caste does not want you to know. They have spent thousands of years and murdered countless people in the process of systematically seeking, sometimes seizing but mostly destroying the hidden knowledge of Hu-Man. Their intention and agenda was to weed out the knowledge from our societies, our awareness and our psyche in order to dumb down the Human population. This is also information and knowledge that the world of modern science has concealed from you as well. Sure enough in today’s world there are some real scientists who approach their investigations with an open mind; unfortunately, the majority have simply created a religion for themselves. The knowledge that is being shared in these pages provides the keys to understanding life in its purest form. Experiencing this Light-based Universe is a participatory and co-creative process. There are those of us who have now gotten to the point where we have journeyed down through all the dimensions, experienced everything there is to experience, did everything there is to do and have been everything there is to be. We have manifested ourselves as galaxies, as star systems, as planets, and everything in between. We have incarnated into every possible manifestation that has ever existed in all dimensions, all levels and all frequencies in this Universe. Now, we are to bring all our creations, all our wisdom gained and therefore our Beingness back into balance so that we may achieve our intended outcome; to become a Universal Creator of Light. Creating the galactic womb As mentioned previously, once one enters the ‘Great Arena’ there is to be only one way out. This is about explaining how the Universal Creator went about structuring things and facilitating this process first hand. After all, life in its Universal embodiment is the Creator’s responsibility. So, with all possibilities and outcomes having been exhausted on all levels, and having reached maximum expansion, separation, polarisation and fragmentation, the only path left was through a process of reintegration and therefore compression . The Creator now needed to create the appropriate avenues and the pathways, realities and domains that could facilitate this road to reintegration, compression, balance, zero point, and a return to being whole and sanctified. It is time to once again put yourself in the position of being a Universal Creator. What kind are you? Are you an arrogant and self-righteous one, an elitist that sees itself superior, too proud to be directly involved with beings on their level within your own creation? Are you the type that sits at the top and simply just points the finger, so to speak, ordering beings around? Or, are you the type that will get down and dirty with the people, experience all the realities on the same level as them, to be one with them and to be equal with them, to be no bigger and no better. Sure I understand that a Creator experiences its creation through each and every expression, but what I am referring to here is directly experiencing one’s own creation from within just like everyone else. This is a different kind of experience because a Creator goes from being a facilitator to an equal participant. Please take a moment to contemplate what has just been shared with you here because the paragraphs that are to follow require careful consideration of the concepts and knowledge which I have just conveyed. What we have is a colossal cosmic arena facilitating the existence of countless galaxies on multiple levels, realities and domains. For the Creator to facilitate this pathway back to balance, it needed to create a series of realities that through a succession of processes would create a funnelling effect towards total integration. To explain this in sacred geometrical terms, it was about creating a series of fractal based realities that leads to one eventually achieving zero point. Knowing what’s required, the call went out in the form of a vibrational pattern also known as The Word or Logos, to all the spiritual hierarchies of all the galactic systems. The vibrational patterns for the manifestation of the new reality were now emanating throughout the Great Arena from the heart of creation. Those with the eyes to see and the ears to hear and the senses to sense, were able to pick up that vibration, that information, that call. It was the substantiation of the so called rumours that were permeating throughout the Great Arena in recent eras that there was to be the manifestation and establishment of a single reality, which would facilitate the representation of all life in the Universe within it... rumours which were now to become Lore! This reality which was to represent the Universe was created in the following manner. Take all the energy of a galaxy with all its levels of manifestation and all the Beings that have ever played a role in its co-creation. Take all its star systems and all their planets. Then, take all the beings that entered that galactic system and had an incarnational experience in whatever form on whatever level throughout all the epochs and eras of time. Gather all the wisdom gained from those experiences; then, energetically speaking , compress the whole lot into a star system. In other words, that Being who is that Galactic Consciousness was now to take the energy of all that knowledge and wisdom of an entire galactic existence and recreate itself in the embodied form of a star system. Now take that newly created star system, whether that Being’s requirements are to express itself as a single star or an assembly of stars, and insert it into a single galaxy. Repeat the process of re-creating a compressed version of another galaxy and then another, again and again until you have the compressed versions of billions upon billions of galaxies embodied as stars inserted into one single galaxy. What you now have is the construct of our Milky Way Galaxy. This Galaxy is a fractal of the Cosmos and this Universe! The Cosmic Arena and even the entire Universe has now been re-created and compressed into our Galactic Arena. We now have a reality that through its very nature facilitates"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the integration of experiences and aspects of Beings. This is the first stage of creating the ‘Road to Compression’. Due to requirements, this Milky Way Galaxy was going to be no ordinary galaxy as it was to become ‘The Galactic Womb’. The construct of the Milky Way was to be uniquely different from all other galaxies as it was to be a fractal of the entire Cosmos so that it may eventually birth an entire race of Universal Beings. So to begin the first stage of this massive undertaking the Feminine aspect of the Creator manifested Herself as our Milky Way Galaxy, the nurturing of the Mother’s Milk. The Masculine aspect of the Creator manifested Himself as the galaxy right next to this one, the Andromeda Galaxy, ‘Andros’ meaning man and husband. The two are completely energetically infused with one another. They are Twin Flames to each other as they are the Feminine and Masculine expressions of one and the same whole and sanctified essence of the Universal Creator. The Galactic Mother put out a call for all the Beings who felt it was time. It was time to establish which Beings were to participate and to what extent their responsibilities were to be in the co-creation of this Galactic Womb. Once the new galactic arena had been established, the vibrational pattern of the galaxy also emanated throughout the Universe and many Beings felt that emanation. Each new compressed version of the galactic systems, now as star systems within the Galactic Womb, was also emanating its new found expressions. It was a call for those who felt and knew the time had come to enter into her womb so that they may embark on the next phase of their Universal Journey. Their Soul naturally gravitated towards these realities via the Universal Lore of Attraction. Those who were to be the wisdom carriers and ambassadors to their expression of life knew it was their path to be a Way-Shower and lead by example. Projecting an aspect of themselves into this Galactic Womb and into their star system that embodied their galactic paradigm was to be at that time venturing into the most compressed reality in existence. They were the ones embarking on a journey that was so arduous and challenging, it allowed ones projected aspect to become so incredibly vulnerable to the forces of limitation and run the risk of being lured and trapped into their domains for eons of time. It was known that these Beings would be challenged every step of the way and at times the experience could become quite painful in a multitude of ways. They were the ones that had the courage to be stripped of their divinity to experience the veil to such a degree that they would one day forget their heart centred intuitive knowing of the powerful Beings they are, and all that it means to be Divine! Does this sound familiar? What the Universal Creator needed to do next was to manifest its masculine and feminine expressions within the Galactic Arena as star systems as well. The reason for this was to take responsibility first hand for the required processes of reintegration and to be an equal participant by experiencing its own creation from within. The Andromeda Galaxy needed to project an aspect of himself into the galactic womb symbolising the galactic sperm entering the galactic egg. This male galactic sperm energy was to be the active ingredient within the feminine galactic womb in the form of an archetypal energy. This resulted in the creation of what we call Orion, the archetype of ‘The Hunter’, the provider and protector, The Father. The female consciousness of the galaxy stepping her energy down manifested herself as the Sirius star system, the archetype of ‘Cannis Major’, loyalty, protector and unconditional love, The Mother. This is why these two star systems feature so prominently throughout ancient history, cultural folklore and spiritual teachings. In the early stages of our galaxy’s history there was a lot of drama because of the amount of jostling for positions of power as a result of putting so many galactic realities with all their differences into such a compressed and combined space. This resulted in many conflicts of interests and so wars broke out across the galaxy. Unfortunately the star system that embodied the archetype of the ‘Male Warrior’, Alpha Draconis, featured prominently in these conflicts. Due to compression, this archetypal energy had proven itself now to be spiralling out of its own ability to control itself so the time had come for the destructive aspect of the male warrior archetype to be exposed, addressed and transmuted. Due to his archetypal expression Orion was to facilitate a massive transmutation of the male warring energy. After all, the Male Warrior Archetype is ultimately an aspect of himself and is therefore his responsibility. What we on earth call the extra-terrestrial level of life, Orion was to be the battle ground for control of this galaxy. The Draconian forces from Alpha Draconis under the auspice of the duplicitous “God” entity, felt compelled to invade the Orion system seeking to take control of the ‘Father’ energy. They simply felt threatened by its presence. Throughout the Orion era were many wars, which resulted in innumerable cosmic karmic differences being greatly transmuted to the next level. I say next level because the galactic arena was not to be the final stage and degree of compression. There was more to come. Solar arena and planetary womb Now that the Divine Mother Essence had manifested and established Herself as the Galactic Womb, and the integration processes were functioning successfully through the resolution of many issues, there were still vast imbalances that needed transmuting. What the Creator needed to do next was to step the energies down further so that it would now embody the entire universal paradigm within a single star system. This represents an enormous undertaking which naturally resulted in another massive amount of compression. But this time it was the masculine energy that was to facilitate the next step of the process because it was the Fatherly archetypal energy that was most suitable to deal with the next phase of the Divine Plan. This resulted in the formation of our Sun and our Solar system. Because of my cultural programming and my Christian upbringing, I will now use a label that I am familiar with but please know that other cultures have other names for one and the same Being. The light body, the consciousness and the spirit that is behind the manifestation of our Sun is what is known as the Christ. Again the call went out which permeated throughout this galaxy and eventually throughout the cosmos and Universe, to see who were the ones that were going to be brave enough to represent their peoples and incarnate into this solar system; now the most compressed reality in the Universe. What we have now is an entire Universal paradigm represented and condensed into a single star system. As stupendously impossible as this may seem to some, all of the planets in our solar system are inhabited. It is simply a matter of frequency. For one to understand the construct of this Universe one must realise that there are many levels of realities and that this aspect of us here on our Earth Mother, exists in just one tiny slither. In fact there are many other levels of reality even on this planet, some of which I"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"have experienced personally in this life time. Our Solar System has a long history and unfortunately due to the degree of compression there were again many conflicts here as well. During a nasty conflict when the Draconian Empire invaded our Solar System, a planet was destroyed which is now the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Subconsciously, many are still suffering post-traumatic stress from that experience. Also, the natural environment on Mars was adversely affected in that explosion which resulted in those peoples having to move underground. Taking the process now to yet another level of compression, the Universal Creator required manifesting a planetary body that was to be the planetary womb eventually to see it birth an entire race of Universal Beings. Intrinsically this responsibility was to be of the Divine Feminine as the Mother energy is the expression that creates and bears life. So, the Feminine expression of the Creator manifested herself as our Mother Earth. ‘ We are Universal embryos in the planetary womb of the Divine Mother.’ I am now going to share one of the most fundamental and crucial pieces of knowledge ever! In the core of our planet is a female version of our Sun. Earth is simply a Sun that has an egg shell around it, the crust. Once again because of my Christian upbringing, I will use labels that I am familiar with but please know that other cultures have other names for one and the same being. The body of light and the spirit behind the manifestation of the Sun that is the inside of our planet is the Christ Sophia energy. I will reiterate again, it is the female expression of our Sun! They are Twin Flames, the masculine and the feminine aspects of our Universal Creator. Our Sun is Christ in the masculine and our Earth Mother, Christ Sophia, is Christ in the Feminine. This is who we are incarnate inside of and upon. Recognising this construct now helps one to understand that on this level there is a Holy Trinity in existence. It consists of the heart of our incarnation, the heart of Mother Earth and the heart of Father Sun. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" This is the forgotten knowledge of the ages. This is what the programs of the last 6000 years have been systematically trying to sever from Humanity’s awareness and conscious mind. To know that you are actually incarnated on the planetary body of the Divine Feminine expression of the Universal Creator is a huge key to becoming free and sovereign. Rekindling your relationship with your Earth Mother just by simply becoming aware of her is one of the most important things you will ever do and is absolutely crucial in these times. This reality exists here because of her, so therefore you exist here because of her. We are talking about a woman, a planetary woman who is nurturing you every moment of every day. She gives you the air that you breathe, the water that you drink and the food that you eat. Later in the book I will address the Divine Feminine, because manifesting herself as a planetary body that was going to see the last stages of this Divine Plan play itself out was by no means going to be an easy undertaking. The Creator is experiencing its creation as an equal participant; don’t think for a moment that there is not a level of their Beingness that both the Sun and the Earth do not feel and do not suffer. There is a big difference between spiritual ideology and reality. Due to the compressing and stepping down of energies even further, the Feminine and Masculine aspects of the Creator were now getting closer and closer to the levels of the people. This was another significant component to this process. It is about eventually getting to the point where Universal energies become accessible by our incarnated aspects. Let me explain why the Masculine and Feminine aspects of the Universal Creator needed to personally venture down here as well. You can’t just plug a television for example, into one of those massive overhead 300,000 Volts power lines because it would simply blow up and vaporise it. The principal is the same. You can’t take an aspect of a Being that has ventured so stupendously far from its whole and sanctified self, and from the whole and sanctified essence of the Universal Creator, and expect that aspect to reconnect directly with Universal Consciousness in its totality. It is not possible because the energy is just too immense. I am now going to use a religious concept as an analogy as I feel it is most appropriate in helping people to understand. For want of a better term, think of this as the metaphorical ‘Hand of God’ reaching down to lend a helping hand. It is through this process of the reintegration of our aspects and our creations, having been facilitated on and in the embodied aspects of the Universal Creator, that we are once again able to reconnect and become Universal Consciousness in its totality. In summary, the Creator needed to come down into its creation in a parenting role as the Divine Feminine and the Divine Masculine and facilitate, nurture and guide it’s ’Children’, each one of us the metaphorical ‘Son of God’, so that they can birth a race of Universal Creators. How our essence travelled to Earth So here is another element and component regarding how we have come to be here on this planet in the context of our Essence taking the symbiotic journey with our manifested forms and incarnational embodiments. So far I have shared with you the intentions, ideas and reasons we had for entering this galaxy and finally coming to this planet; now I want to share with you how our Essence actually got here. To briefly summarise once again, we first entered, merged and became one with the Essence of this Universe in the higher realms. We then travelled down through all the dimensions projecting aspects from one level down to the next and then to the next. We ventured so stupendously far from our Whole and Sanctified Essence and the Whole and Sanctified Essence of the Universal Creator until we reached the bottom of the Universe. We got to the stage where we had explored and exhausted all possibilities and outcomes on every level; then we heard the call from our Universal Mother to enter the Galactic Womb. Ok, so how did we actually go about entering this Galactic Womb? As mentioned before when one enters a domain, a reality or a realm, be it a universe, a planet or any other expression, you are entering and having an intimate relationship with the expression and body of another Being. We need to first acclimatise and calibrate our essence to that reality and to that Being. Just as we needed our whole and sanctified essence to calibrate and acclimatise, to merge and become one with the Essence of the Creator of this Universe, the principal is the same throughout the Universe on all levels. Thus for the very same reasons, one cannot enter a reality without the agreement and permission on some level with the Being who is that reality; in this case the Milky Way Galaxy. Before we go any further a key ingredient to this is the Universal Seed as mentioned earlier in the book which was implanted by the Universal Creator within our Soul. We have been nurturing our seed which is nestled safely within. We have been feeding and watering it with"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the wisdom that we have gained from our experiences as we journeyed throughout this Universe. This is now where that seed is coming into prominence. Not only has the Universal Creator ventured down into compression through the process of facilitating the Galactic Womb and playing the parenting role, so too has our Soul taken the journey down into compression in the same way bringing with it our seed. The creation of this Galactic Womb has been a co-creative process. Therefore our Soul is also playing a parenting role as it nurtures and guides us through this epoch and era which is a gestation period known as our journey into the Galactic Womb and the Road to Compression. Our Soul is bringing our seed so that we will reunite at the end of this road to compression, the meeting point, the zero point, the merging point, and our integration with eternity. It is in these days that are upon us now that our Universal Seed is in the process of sprouting and birthing Universal Consciousness from within. So in the process of entering this galaxy our essence first merged and became one with the core, the heart and the consciousness of the Being that is this galaxy, an aspect of the Divine Feminine. What this means is that there is still a part of us in the heart of our Galactic Mother. This is why there are those of us who know who this Galaxy is, simply by reconnecting with that part of ourselves and remembering our relationship with Her. With this Galactic Womb being a compressed version of the Universe, the whole universal journey thus far was now to be relived. This resulted in us projecting many aspects of ourselves into the Galactic Womb/Arena according to what realities we needed to explore experience and participate in. With all possibilities and outcomes exhausted once again, it was then time for us to enter into the Solar Arena. For us now to find our way to our Solar system, an even more compressed version of our essence flowed from the Galactic core down via the rivers of life, or spiral arms of the Galaxy, and started heading towards our Solar System. Many interpret this as a much lesser aspect of self but that interpretation is not true. Sure it is a stepping down of energies but it is in actuality a compression of the Soul in its totality and not just another fragmentation. When I say more compressed I mean that each previous projection into the Galactic Arena was an aspect specific to the Karmic energy that needed rebalancing and transmuting. However, this time it was our entire Soul Essence being compressed to yet another level and projected to our Sun from our previously compressed version of self that still to this day resides in the heart of the Galactic Mother. Our essence uses the lore of attraction (gravity) as a means of navigating our way through the Universe. Gravity is simply the Lore of Attraction! What happened next is our projected and newly compressed version of our Soul gravitated towards our star system, merged and became one with the consciousness of the Sun. What this means is that we also have an aspect of ourselves in the Sun. Anyone who is of an organic incarnational construct is one with the heart of the Sun. In the early stages of our experience in this solar system, the Solar version of our Soul then projected aspects of self into the Solar Arena onto whichever of the planets, planetoids, moons etc., and in whichever era as per our requirements specific to the Karmic energy that needed rebalancing and transmuting. Just as in the Galactic arena some of us may have experienced more than one aspect projected onto/into different planetary bodies simultaneously; so too was the case in the Solar Arena. After many epochs and eras of time passed with much transmutation of imbalances being achieved, the next step in the process was to incarnate into/onto the Planetary Womb. The road to compression does not just end with the Divine Feminine manifesting Herself as a planetary body and holding the space for the entire Universe to be represented. Nowhere else is there a planet with the extent of bio-diversity as we have here on our Earth Mother. The natural environment on this planet is the most amazing and incredible creation ever! Just stop and actually take notice for a moment how so much life can co-exist simultaneously and symbiotically on a single planetary body. Try just for a minute to see the genius. What the Universal Creator required next was the creation of a single life form that would reflect its environment. What this means is a Being was created that would embody this incredible bio diversity and therefore embody the entire Universe. The Being that was created is known as a Hu-Man Being. "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" For one to be incarnated here on this planet, as in any reality, first one must have sought permission and made an agreement on the appropriate level with the consciousness and the being that is that reality; in this case our Earth Mother. So now from our Solar Consciousness, we projected the most compressed version of our Greater Essence thus far to the heart and core of our Earth Mother so that we may calibrate and acclimatise our essence to the planetary Womb and therefore merge and become one with the Being that is this planet, the Divine Feminine. In the core and the heart of our Earth Mother is a part of me and a part of you, and from there we projected an aspect of ourselves into the core and the heart of our incarnational vessels. In the process of going within one’s self, into your heart, a consciously aware reconnection with ones Higher Self takes place. Symbiotically our consciousness goes straight into the core of the planet and begins re-establishing a consciously aware connection with our Greater Essence of self that is in the heart of the Earth Mother. Therefore, we re-establish a consciously aware connection with the heart of the Christ Sophia. This is why there are those of us who know who this incredible woman is embodying the microcosm of the macrocosm, and a fractal of the entire Universe as a single planetary body. We also know who the Sun is and who our Milky Way Galaxy is. This is the forgotten knowledge of the ages. Take now into consideration what it means to be Hu-Man. We have this name for a reason! ‘Hu’ is an ancient word for ‘God’, and ‘Man’ means ‘the one who thinks’ or ‘Mind’. Now before all the academics go huff and puff about my interpretations, I am fully aware there are many other opinions about what these words mean. I am simply giving you my understanding from my life’s experiences and how all the Beings, races and civilisations in the multiple levels of life I have interacted with know what the original intentions were at the time these words were created. This is not what a book, rubber stamped by a modern day synthetic academic system thinks they should mean. I am once again using the label ‘God’ here in the context of the Universal Creator. To be Human means to be a Godly Being of Godly Mind, meaning, a Universal Being of Universal Intelligence. Our Hu-Man genetics contain all the codes of the Universe. When I say codes I mean every template and genetic structure of every expression of life that has ever lived, and anything that has ever been created and has ever existed in this Universe. We literally have the Universe within us. We are the microcosm of the macrocosm. We are the Universe compressed into a single embodiment! Besides the Universal Creator, we are essentially the most powerful Beings in the Universe! Mayan calendar The Mayan Calendar has been talked about by many people in countries from all over the world. I questioned my need to address the calendar here in this book. However, I simply cannot ignore my deep intuitive simplistic understanding of the Calendar. People do not understand the significance of the knowledge being conveyed to humanity down through the ages by way of this most amazingly accurate calendar. There has been some fantastic information written by very well-known researchers whom I respect greatly. My approach is more unorthodox and my explanation is simplistic compared to most as I am not going to provide researched material, but rather I am going to share what I know about the calendar and what it represents from the viewpoint of some memories of having lived a life in Palenque. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" I agree that the calendar represents cycles within cycles. However, in my humble opinion it is saying substantially more than just that. Also, using terms we are familiar with but not equating to the same values, these cycles are not merely the Mayan week, month, year and so on. Some researchers say that The Mayan calendar is talking about how the vibrations in each time zone or time realm reflects and also affects our state of Being. They have shared really good knowledge and insights about how we are linked through time from the vibrations of the day we are born to the vibrations of time realms throughout the day, week, year etc. This is more of an astrological approach and true astrology is a very real science so I am not devaluing this approach. I just want to say that the big picture of the Mayan Calendar continually seems to be left out. There are less than a handful of researchers, to my knowledge, talking about these larger representations. I am simply saying that there is much more to it than just the dimension of time. What I wish to bring to your attention is that the missing substance I am referring to is actually consciousness, and that it is this consciousness which is completing these cycles of time. So now the next question to ask is ‘what consciousness?’ Or, more to the point – ‘whose consciousness?’ Well...the answer to that is OURS! You see, from what I remember of my life in Palenque, we were consciously and profoundly integrated and synchronised with our natural surroundings and the natural cycles of life; locally, planetary, cosmically and universally. We knew what the calendar was about and we knew what it represented, therefore we knew where we as Humanity had come from and where we were heading. We knew the calendar was and still is, about us! It represents and explains the journey of our Soul and our Consciousness exploring and experiencing all the dimensions, realities and domains throughout the Universe. It even explains how we are now experiencing fractal time cycles; yes, the ‘Road to Compression’. It reveals how our collective Human Soul is symbiotically linked to the consciousness of our Earth Mother via the planetary gestation period. It tells of the Galactic gestation period, the cosmic gestation period all the way up to the Universal gestation period. What is really fascinating is how all gestation periods converge at the same point ‘in time’. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" I suggest that the Mayan Calendar is also trying to bring to people’s attention that our Mother Earth is now entering the birthing process and that this is really what 2012 is all about. I do not agree that the Great Year, (Precessional Cycle), ends on 21st December 2012 or more accurately the December Solstice, but I do acknowledge that this moment in time is significant as it symbolises a connection to the ‘Sacred Waters’. So, we now have this beautiful lady, our Earth Mother, who is about to give birth to a race of Universal Creators. As far as I’m concerned the Great Year ends one quarter Solar (annual) cycle later on the following Equinox, the March Equinox of 2013. This Precessional Cycle, (Great Year), begins and ends on an Equinox not a Solstice. After all, it is called the Precession of the Equinoxes and not the Precession of the Solstices. A solstice represents minimum daylight and maximum darkness or, maximum daylight and minimum darkness. The scales of life are out of balance to one extreme or the other. An Equinox represents an equal amount of daylight to an equal amount of darkness. The perfectly balanced sine wave represents perfectly balanced scales. The Cycle we are in is known as the Cycle for Life Eternal in the greater Universe, which can only be achieved by rebalancing ones Beingness. This is why it was always woven into the design of this reality that it was to complete its life cycle on an Equinox; more specifically, the March Equinox of 2013. Harmonic equations I am going to explain some things using numbers so if your mind struggles with this part please just skip it and move on. Some people understand these concepts better with numbers. The duration of the precessional cycle is 24,832 years with an acceleration factor of 1/phi, or 6.18%. The reason it is 1/phi is because this cycle was set up to take the journey below unity. It represents us taking our Universal seed, our Christ Centre below unity or 1. This equation is the harmonic building block of our cycle, the cycle for life eternal. The number 24,832 is a seeded fractal because this reality is a seeded fractal and we are a seeded fractal. It is a recursive equation and recursion is a compounding equation - therefore the mathematical expression of wisdom. We begin with duality 2 , 2 x 2 = 4 , 2 x 4 = 8 , 4 x 8 = 32 ...... 24832 The ability for us to obtain the necessary wisdom had to be built into the harmonics of the Earth orbiting around her Sun. The Divine Feminine performing the dance of life around her beloved Divine Masculine. In the early 1900’s the precession was calculated at 25,800 years and then in the 1980’s it was recalculated at 25,920 years. Because the calculation done in the 1980’s used computer technologies, the value of 25,800 years was conveniently dismissed with the reasoning that because the calculations performed earlier did not use computers they must be inaccurate. There are astronomers today that know exactly what I am talking about. As you can see, the acceleration factor is evident and when calculated on 21st March 2013 it will appear as a duration of 26,366.618 years. Notice 1/phi synchronistically appearing on the end of the cycle duration. What we have here are two distinct timelines . There is a natural and organic fixed and foundational timeline of 24,832 years and an accelerating and illusionary time line of 26,366.618 years. The fixed timeline is the planetary consciousness of the Divine Feminine from her higher aspects above the Great Void who is holding the space and facilitating our journey. The harmonics of the illusionary timeline is what has facilitated our journey into deep compression. It has also facilitated and enabled the matrix reality to manifest itself here so that we may be tested and challenged by the forces of limitation and deception. There are many who know that this reality is speeding up; it’s simply a matter of understanding that the Earth is spinning faster on its axis and proportionally orbiting her Sun faster as well. A key point to understanding harmonics is correlation. We are not dealing with the dualistic energy of computers which is a machine polarity based binary system of 1’s and 0’s meaning, it either is or it isn’t. Harmonics is about relationship. What we are dealing with are cycles of life, the cycles of celestial bodies and the relationship with the life within these bodies and upon these bodies. Adding the numbers of the fixed timeline we get 2+4+8+3+2=19. 19 correlates to the square root of 365 days = 19.1. This is a harmonic"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"match. 19 x Pi = 59.69 which correlates with 60 degrees, the angle of the equilateral triangle, the sacred triangle of Light. Taking the recursive equation to the next level: 8 x 32 = 256. The square root of 256 = 16. Phi is also known as ‘Sweet 16’. The number 256 also correlates with the 2545 harmonic which is the reciprocal of the harmonic that sits between the matter and anti- matter grids of our planet measured at geodetic inch squared. Gematria is the ancient knowledge of assigning numerical values to letters of the alphabet. If we take the Gematria value of Sophia 781 and inject into it the sacred trinity 3 we get 781/3 = 260. The value of 260 represents the human gestation period. If we once again take the value of Sophia but this time add the value of the human gestation period we get 781 + 260 = 1041 and 1040 is the Gematria value of ‘microcosm’. This is a harmonic match. The duration of the cycle 24832 when injected with Sophia 781 we get 24832/781 = 31.8 318 is the Gematria value for Helios, the Sun. Take the duration of the cycle 24832 and inject the word Planet 681 24832/681 = 36.5 365 days of the year. Planet 681 and subtract Human gestation period 260 we get 681 – 260 = 471 Gematria value for Fruit. If we take unity or oneness 1 and inject Pi, the ratio of man to woman and of woman to man: 1/Pi = 0.318 318 Helios, the Sun. If we take the Human gestation period 260 and multiply it by Pi we get 260 x Pi = 816 816 is the Gematria value for Zoe, which means Life. If we take an ancient name for the Earth, Gaea 10 and inject Pi we get 10/Pi = 3.18 Helios, the Sun. If we take Sophia 781 and inject Pi: 781/Pi = 248.6 248 is the Gematria value for God and 486 is the Gematria value of ‘Petra’ which means rock. Sophia is the rock beneath your feet. By now, you have probably got the picture! I could go on and on with more equations but I feel I have shared enough. There is a plethora of harmonic calculations that include gematria, which explain through the language of numbers who this planet is, who this solar system is, who we are and what this reality is all about. Relevant crop circles Do you think someone else has been trying to bring this to our attention as well? The knowledge of all these life cycles now beginning to coalesce and consolidate here on our Mother Earth is known throughout the Universe. Some peoples/races felt compelled by the need to go to great lengths as in the following pictures, in order to bring it to our attention. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" So now we have the same concept but this time the message is deeper. Let’s take all our creations, all our dualistic expressions within this Universe and all the cycles of life, bring them to centre, rebalance and turn inside out. For those into sacred geometry the term for this process is ‘Toroidal’. It is a process for birthing a new expression of life in our Universe: which is self-perpetuating, self-sustaining and non- destructive. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Remembering the Past Remembering the past Before we go delving into the juicy drama of the supreme cosmic deception being imposed upon our Humanity, this chapter is a reminder of some events that transpired along the way in our cosmic journey to the present day. These memories help put the information into context; they also bring an understanding of how events that have occurred in recent times on our planet, events happening today and events that are about to occur are all the result of what happened way back when. Let’s go back many eons, epochs and eras to a time even before this galaxy had been created. This was the time when the idea of manifesting a road to compression was just a call reverberating throughout the Universe; to augment those who were to be involved in such a momentous project. There were those who were the first to hear the call and are a part of a council of primordial beings, some refer to as, ‘The Ancients’. They are known by many names and are the primary ones who have fundamentally through responsibility and obligation, co- created and managed the Cosmic Arena. After hearing, feeling and embodying the call, also known as ‘The Word’ and ‘Logos’, they travelled to many realities, domains and galactic systems for the purpose of approaching spiritual councils and hierarchies to meet with those who also heard and felt the call. These beings knew it was their path to contribute and participate in such an enormous undertaking. It was a given that certain groups would be approached; in particular, a group of Beings that had also been playing a significant role in the co-creation and management of the Great Arena; a group that many refer to as “The Gods”. Please understand that what I am referring to here as The Gods, are Beings with a cosmic level of consciousness and relative to the cosmic arena they are very highly evolved, and are extremely powerful and capable Beings. Many make the mistake of underestimating them and their capabilities. They are known in different cultures and have many different names. There are beings that do the bidding for these gods and are commonly known as archons although they too have different names in other cultures. For many epochs of time the Universal Creator facilitated numerous attempts by the gods and their archons to rectify the situation in the Cosmic Arena. However, the realities they created did not offer any real challenges as the majority over time had become more passive in nature therefore the resulting experiences did not yield the desired results. As the gods and their archons were being addressed, there were those within that group who instantly became incensed because they themselves did not hear nor feel the call, the Logos, and therefore could not accept that such a thing had even occurred. You see these gods had become quite accustomed to being in the position of creating and managing realities on a grand scale beyond just a single galactic arena. Unfortunately, a group of them started to focus on and make prominent, status and prestige, which can become a vice with such a commanding capacity. Because of this, their natural connection with the Cosmos and Universal Consciousness became compromised and that is why they no longer were hearing Logos. They accused the Ancients of inventing the idea as a way of upstaging them. I do realise it is difficult to comprehend that these types of dramas are experienced by Beings on these other levels of consciousness, however: It is said, “as above, so below”. True to say that these dramas are not exactly how we experience them here in this reality at this time, but they are still very similar and please remember that I am referring to events within the Cosmic Arena which is below the Great Void. It was soon revealed that the main point of contention was that the gods themselves were not the ones responsible for the idea. Many thought that these beings would have been the first to jump at the opportunity for the sake of helping to rebalance life in these lower domains and especially the opportunity to create a pathway back to one’s whole and sanctified Eternal Essence. After all, it is what we have all been working towards for eons of time. Considering the viewpoint from within the Cosmic Arena, many could see things were becoming increasingly difficult and challenging; and the amount of polarisation and fragmentation was beginning to weigh heavily. Many Beings could not see a way out. They started to feel trapped and that is why when the call went out to embark on such a project there was an aura of enthusiasm and fervour, since it was what many had been waiting for through eons of time. This small group, a wayward faction of the gods, went as far as creating opposition to the idea of fractilisation and the Road to Compression. As time went on and the project began to manifest, their feeling of being incensed turned into jealousy and eventually became loathing. There were more and more Beings whom they considered much lower in status to them, who were feeling and hearing the call, the Logos, emanating from within the heart of our Universal creation. In the meetings and deliberations that ensued, this wayward faction who were present turned to Beings such as myself and said with such bitterness, such envy, jealousy and prejudice, “How dare you think you can make it right?” I clearly remember feeling shocked and even a sense of betrayal. I guess on one level we felt that they would have wanted to help and that differences would be mended in the process; but unfortunately not so. Many of us felt a great sadness. They finally revealed themselves for whom and what they had now become. When we attempted to make them aware of themselves, they became enraged and ended up vowing that this was the wrong thing to do and that it will fail, and that they would do everything in their power to stop it from happening. They argued that pain and suffering would result, but that was only to be a part of the process. However, for the purposes of their propaganda they wanted to make that aspect the whole point of focus . This is a key piece of knowledge because this same technique is what they are still using today. If you want to break free from their programs then do not forget what I have just shared. It will reveal itself in much greater context as you read on. Because of their aristocratic comfort zone, they had lost sight of the true meaning of Light, its characteristics and its essence. In the lower domains of this Universe, the Great Cosmic Arena, at times it is through adversity that one prospers. It was a given that this path would result in pain and suffering to some degree, but despite their concern it would mostly be towards the end of each era. Compared to the pain and suffering that takes place throughout the Cosmic Arena it was definitely going to be worth it. Those who heard the call and felt the ‘Logos’ embodied the knowledge of what was to come. We were all aware and we all understood the challenges that lay ahead. Please remember and understand that from a much higher level of our Beingness, from beyond The Great Void, their intrusion into the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Galactic Womb is only happening because we all agreed to it and therefore the Divine Feminine is allowing it. Their intrusion is a necessary part of the greater plan as this is a fractal of our Universal journey and therefore, we all designed this experience together. This faction of the gods then went about systematically attempting to sabotage this project the whole way through. They cleverly infiltrated every level they could access within the Galactic Womb; the 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st Dimensions. It is important to remember they cannot access anything beyond The Great Void . The organic entry path into the Galactic Womb is an incarnational process and because of this all Beings choosing that path knew and understood what was involved with the energy of compression. The origins of blaming the Feminine This faction of the gods and their archons saw themselves as superior and therefore above and beyond the organic process, consequently their entry into the Galactic Womb was via other methods. This means they were constantly coming and going, in and out rather than participating in the road to compression via an incarnational experience. We warned them about compression and we warned them about fractilisation but they were too arrogant to listen. What is interesting and what they weren’t expecting is that while they were engaging and becoming involved in the Galactic Womb with a view to sabotage, because of compression their energies started to change. So each foray into the Galactic Womb resulted in a change of their energies. Every time they delved and engaged, whatever their intentions were and whatever aspects of their personalities were being expressed at the time, is what ended up becoming compressed. This resulted in a densification of those expressions and aspects; as a result, these energies weighed heavily upon their cosmic consciousness. Despite being warned, due to their lack of experience with fractilisation and compression, it did not take long for them to be overwhelmed by the intensity of their own energies. It was like a compounding effect; the more they delved into the Galactic Womb, the more they tried to sabotage, the more those expressions became densified and therefore the more it weighed them down. It was like a drug. This wayward faction of the gods and their archons were constantly being changed bit by bit and over time, their view to sabotage began morphing into obsession and they had to have more and more. Due to this now being an obsession, their behaviour became even more intense and their decision making irrational. Eventually through the continual intensification, compression and densification of their energies, through sheer weight now upon their cosmic consciousness and the Lore of Attraction they ended up being drawn in like a vortex into the dramas of the Galactic Arena. Ironically they were the ones who played a major role in creating the dramas to begin with so they were simply drawn into their own creations. We warned them that this process was fool-proof and despite what they thought and still think today, it was never going to fail. It was always going to succeed! The nature of compression drew them into the Galactic Arena and this is the birth of blaming The Feminine. “It’s her fault”, they say. “She did this to us! She seduced us, she tricked us!” Does this sound familiar? Their arrogance is so great they could never admit to what they have actually done. They could never admit that they were warned; and especially that what they were warned about has actually come to pass. Understand that they don’t see straight, and they have to continue to play the victim, play the blame game and it is always everybody else’s fault. “She did this to us, she seduced us”, but of course it was no such thing . It was compression; it was fractilisation which simply works with one’s own energies. So in the end it was their energies and their own blind arrogance that did it to them. You see, The Divine Feminine who embodies fractilisation and compression, has a way of bringing arrogant egos to their knees. They thought they were better than her, they thought they could control and manipulate her. In fact, many still do. She has been enduring their arrogance, their superiority complexes, their tantrums, abuse and manipulative ways knowing that eventually their egos would fall and be exposed for what they have truly become. On the road to compression nothing can remain hidden; all the impurities eventually get brought to the surface, exposed and weeded out. Meanwhile, the whole time the Divine Feminine has patiently and with incredible strength and fortitude, simply been holding the space. Remembering the past continued Now because this galaxy is a fractal of the universe, the microcosm of the macrocosm, whatever happens here also affects the cosmic arena. As a result these gods were also now behaving differently in the Cosmic Arena. They started modifying their previously created realities and instead of co-creating with the Logos in synchronicity with life, they now started creating realities at will for their own purposes. Many began to see the changes in them and did not like what they saw. Instead of these gods having an organic and natural approach, aware that through the creation of these realities they are facilitating for other beings to have experiences for soul growth, their perception had changed. They started to believe they had rights over these Beings and that they could do as they pleased. This established a sense of ownership over these realities and therefore an ownership over the beings and all life within them. The gods now viewed these beings as more of a commodity and a resource. Because of their want, which had now morphed into a thirst for status, prestige, eminence and, of course, power, they started to create structures within their realities which encouraged other beings to worship them. As a result, they began losing even more sight of synergy and harmony with life around them and declined into becoming self-absorbed. Rather than working in harmony with life, they now manipulated life. These structures they created were what we would call structures of worship, of idolatry and of course, religion! This was to funnel the energy more efficiently towards these gods. They began to indirectly feed off these beings energetically, hence the worship. Some of the gods changed more than others and it eventually got to the point where one god in particular whose ego was now spiralling out of control, wanted to be “The God” and rule over the rest. This may come as a surprise to the religious multitudes and may be no surprise at all for others to know that this is the being behind the creation of religion on our planet. I will go more into that later. This wayward faction of the gods/archons then went about doing everything they could to study and learn fractilisation and this new compressed version of Light and life. Once they felt they had learnt enough to create from it, they immediately went about doing what they did in the cosmic arena, and started creating their own realities and domains for their own purposes within the galactic arena. Because of their intentions, the foundational energies of manifestation resulted in their realities not being in harmony and synchronicity as are the rest of the realities and domains. In the first few eras and epochs their realities were based on more of an authoritarian rule and so as a result they attracted the more aggressive and warrior types. This helped them to establish their presence and assert an authority very quickly within this galaxy. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This in turn enabled them to create large empires by influencing certain key races; for example, the Draconians. These methods also resulted in the great saga of the Orion Epoch, with a great many wars taking place which transmuted a huge amount of the Universal Male Warrior Archetypal energy. The Orion Wars saw some of the most intense and vicious battles ever known. The level of technology that was used there was the most sophisticated ever created. The depravation of spirit at times was horrendous. The tortures that took place and the methods that were being used were absolutely abominable. Many of the tortures were about cracking the Great Void not only on a cosmic level but also within an individual being. However, after a while the gods came to learn that this method of force is tiresome and risky as some of them fell both physically and energetically descending into the bottom dimensions. As most who were involved learnt a great deal from that epoch, this remaining faction of the gods decided to change tactics. After studying and learning everything they could about this new compressed version of Light they then began to create a very highly sophisticated version of control with the most basic and yet most calculating of formulas ever known, ‘passive aggressive’. They fooled multitudes of peoples into believing that they were free by creating realities using a light that mimicked the Light of the Universe. As time passed, some of these gods assimilated at first hundreds, then thousands, then millions of races into false realities and paradigms. Granted, their realities had a very unique and appealing expression, which was part of the attraction for many. Unfortunately, these creations had more of a mesmerising and smothering effect. They seem to entrance and eventually entrap beings because they were working to guide awareness and intent away from ones Soul Essence. Their agenda was to steer and funnel the energy of awareness and intent towards the gods and archons themselves and to their version of life, so they could feed off that energy and become more empowered by it. Therefore, despite the glitz and the glamour of these realities, their functionality, intentions and ethos was in the opposite direction compared to that of the Galactic Mother. As the Orion Epoch began, the Solar Arena was being established. It was an appropriate time because the attention of the gods was preoccupied with war, power and reign. Also, our Sun was at some stage going to be emanating an energetic light pattern which was to be a Universal fractal further on again than that of the Galactic arena. This was surely going to pique the interest and curiosity of many beings, especially the wayward faction of the gods. Therefore, the Earthly Womb was also being created simultaneously because once it was known what was happening with our Sun, these gods would want to take control of the solar system and that would make it too difficult then to create the planetary womb. The space time location of the solar system being way out in the backdrops, on the edge of our Galaxy, was cleverly chosen because most of the attention was towards the centre of the Galaxy. This would be similar to most of the action and attention being focused on downtown city areas; the principle is the same. So now we have the masculine expression of the Universal Creator who had manifested himself as a fractal version of the entire Universe in the form of a star, our Sun. However, in the beginning he had not yet begun to fully express himself. The feminine expression of our Universal Creator also began manifesting herself as a fractal version of the entire Universe but in the form of a planet, our planet. She could not yet fully express herself and furthermore had to shroud her heart/core with a solid shell which we call the crust. With the feminine now beginning to hide behind the veil, (sound familiar?); this enabled the beings that were involved in creating this planetary womb to go about their business over millions of years without the concern of being disrupted. Try and imagine the extent of a project to recreate the entire Universe on a single planetary body; to create fractal versions of every reality and every domain. Imagine creating fractal versions of every life form that has ever existed, and implant each one into the planetary biosphere in such a way that its existence becomes self-sustainable and non-destructive with its surrounding environment. In addition, to calibrate each life form so that the evolutionary path of each one is in complete harmony and synchronicity with the direction the reality is heading. This in turn creates the environment that facilitates the incarnational experiences souls require for their growth and symbiotically for the progression and evolution of the Universe. Therefore each being involved had to have a fully conscious and aware connection with the Universal Creator so that they may know the intentions behind the manifestation of the reality. They also had to know what direction the reality was headed because they needed to understand what set of experiences was required for each era and epoch of time. They could therefore create the natural environment that met the requirements needed to facilitate each one. This required that all the life forms had to evolve at certain rates and in certain ways. Please understand that this explanation is just scratching the surface of understanding behind the manifestation of a simple reality, let alone one that was to embody a fractal version of the entire Universe. The first eras of the planetary womb saw realities being created that celebrated life with an incredibly high vibration being the foundation. There was a great deal of excitement at the prospects of creating a planetary microcosm of the macrocosm, the melting pot of the Universe, and seeing the dynamics of how life would interact and eventually evolve in such a compressed and confined domain. All life lived in total harmony and was sustained through pure light energy. There was no consuming of anything by anything. All kingdoms were able to communicate with one another. It is what some would refer to as ‘The Garden of Eden’. I know these concepts are difficult to grasp because this aspect of us has ventured so far into compression, we have simply forgotten what it is like not to be in survival mode and to be totally free in every way. Once the natural environment had been established, it was then time to create a life form which was to be the principal life form of the planetary womb which was also the primary reason for the creation of the planetary womb to begin with. It was now time to create an embryonic life form that would eventually embody a fractal of Universal Consciousness. It was to be one of the final stages of fractilisation. The planetary environment was to be the final external arena because the incarnational vessel, our Human embodiment, was to actually be an internal arena. It is the meeting place; the place where our Soul Essence meets with our travelling spirit of the Great Arena. It is the final frontier where we bring our journey in the Great Arena back into zero point and therefore our Universal journey back into balance. Back now to the planetary womb; the majority of the creative processes in the beginning were in the higher dimensions. As time went on the manifestation of lower energetic domains were required so that eventually all dimensions could be expressed here in the planetary womb. Because these are fractal realities they are simply more compressed versions of the same processes that manifested the Galactic Womb; prior to that, the cosmic arena and the Universe. So, the processes are similar in principle and at times identical. There was an intense compression and densification of energies at the end of each cycle creating the energetic weight required to take this planetary reality deeper into density as it is heading towards zero point. As each cycle ended it was worked out who would be ready to take it"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"to the next level of compression and who would stay back in the higher levels and work from there. This cycle was to determine who would see this journey to the very end and who was not ready to do so because they required further experiences. As the lower vibrations now needed to be created, the emergence of life on this planet in the lower domains began appearing. Viewed and experienced from the lower dimensions, it was no longer just a barren landscape. As a result, many beings who were within the Galactic Arena and had heard the call, the ‘Logos’, now started coming to the planet for the purpose of seeding life on these lower levels. There were a multitude of races that played a role but there were to be three star systems that would feature more prominently than any others, Sirius, Orion and the Pleiades. Much further down the timeline, it was discovered that this solar system and specifically this planetary body were being implanted with a massive amount of biodiversity. Never before had there been so much life placed in one location and so finally it got the attention of this wayward faction of the gods. They were absolutely amazed at how much energy was now flowing in and out of our Sun and this planet. At first they were incensed and infuriated because this happened without them even knowing about it, but then they started rubbing their hands together with glee because never before did they see so much energy and so much genetic material in one place as they did here on our Earth Mother. But with this planetary body now expressing the most compressed reality that has ever existed, the obsession of these gods had also started reaching new levels. What really took their obsession to levels of frenzy and even insanity was the fact that along with the biodiversity of all life being represented here in one planetary body, they discovered there was also a life form that had been created which had more genetic material than had ever been seen before. In fact they discovered that this life form had all genetic material in the Universe represented within its embodiment; a genuine fractal of the Universe in a single embodiment. This just made them utterly and insanely jealous of our Earth Human Race because the babies being born here had access to more life force and therefore could access more power than they ever did or ever will as, “the gods!” As partly mentioned before these are the Beings that throughout the ages here on earth have been approaching humanity and masquerading as “Gods” that are to be worshipped. Their sole intention, because of their outrage and jealousy, is to sabotage what is going on here, to prevent humanity from remembering who we truly are and reconnecting with our Soul Essence. They redirect our energies towards themselves and their paradigms so that they may empower themselves by feeding off our energies and subsequently continue to farm us. The main player within that group is also the “god” behind the religious organisations on our planet. His obsession is to stop as many people from achieving their intended outcome so that he may continue to feed off their energies via worship, fear, desires, adoration and many other avenues of energetic expression. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Supreme Cosmic Deception Cracking the code that enslaves humanity The purpose and intention for sharing with you the grandest of deceptions is not to incite fear. Nor is it intended to make you feel powerless and helpless when one realises the scale of the deception - quite the opposite! Remember, we are infinite; from the realms of the Higher Self and beyond we composed, we orchestrated and are currently conducting these lives we are having. As we embarked on this journey into compression, we originally knew that at the very end of the process, we would embody a fractal of the Universe and the time would come when we would need to be tested to the nth degree. We would end up allowing ourselves to become totally vulnerable to the deceptive forces of limitation (gods/archons) as it would be graduation time, to see who has truly mastered Light and who has not. We are currently being exposed to the best programs of manipulation that this Universe has to offer. If one does not pass this test, meaning if one is lured into a false light paradigm and/or prevented from reconnecting with one’s Soul Essence by the forces of limitation, then one has simply not yet mastered Light and is therefore not ready to become a Universal Creator of Love and Light. Once you can realise, remember and understand this wisdom, the victimhood mentality then dissipates and one is left with taking responsibility for one’s life instead of playing the victim and the blame game. We are having this experience of deception because from a higher level we agreed to it and we have co-created it. Realise that we own and are responsible for all of our experiences and so from the perspective of our Higher Self we are simply role playing for one another down here in the Great Arena. This is understanding life in a multidimensional construct. Taking responsibility for one’s life is brought about through regaining the knowledge of the way life is constructed. I am simply exposing and explaining the deception so that you may become consciously aware of it. This is about knowledge, awareness and responsibility, sovereignty and empowerment! My intention is to bring about a greater awareness resulting in a conscious connection with your Soul Essence and therefore achieving self- empowerment. To use an analogy; how can an alcoholic become free from alcoholism if that person cannot recognise and acknowledge the fact that they are addicted to alcohol and are an alcoholic to begin with? Therefore, how can a slave become free from slavery unless that person can recognise, realise and acknowledge the fact that they are a slave and have been enslaved within a system? Whether you realise it or not, like it or not, our Human Race as a whole has been systematically assimilated into a system of slavery in the recent epoch of time. This began to occur around 300,000 years ago and went to new levels during this Great Year cycle of 24,832 years; also called the precession of the Equinoxes, and known throughout the universe as ‘The Cycle For Life Eternal’. The last major phase and implementation of this program began around 6,000 years ago. Interesting isn’t it how religion says god created everything around 6,000 years ago, and science with the same timeline says that this is when we sprang out of the stone age and into civilisation. Gee, what a convenient coincidence! This supreme deception being imposed on our Humanity actually runs far deeper than nearly all people realise and is truly functioning on a colossal scale. Many people think that the level of deception is planetary and that we just need to free ourselves from our financial burdens and the systems of slavery conjured up by the ruling elite. But it is far, far greater than that. This deception is not just planetary! There are levels of this deception that are functioning in our solar system, out into our galaxy and beyond. This deception actually runs into other dimensions. In fact, it is an intergalactic cabal functioning on a multi-dimensional infrastructure and its origins are on a grand cosmic scale! As mentioned earlier in the book, after studying the compressed version of life therefore the compressed version of ‘Light’, over epochs and eras of life cycles and time, this wayward faction of the gods managed to create their own version of light and went about assimilating many races of peoples into their domains. If we are to crack the code that enslaves Humanity, in order to understand the nature of their deception, we first need to once again take a look at Light and its essential nature. Below is a diagrammatic expression of Light, vibration, frequency, sound, ‘Logos’ and ‘The Word’, in its most simplistic form. Remember the horizontal line is the aspect that is our projected Light Consciousness in its centred state into the creative process and the waveform is the creative process through our Light Consciousness expressing itself one way and then another. Each way of expressing itself is a counterpart and reflection of the other. Consciousness moving away from its whole and sanctified state expresses itself in a particular way on one side of the line, and then in order for balance to be re-established, it now must express itself in another way that counterbalances the former. When we look at this concept from the core viewpoint of balance, the two expressions can be represented by the scales. This is an image"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"that has been used down through the ages to symbolise our 3 states of being. Looking at the scales of life we can see that there are two distinct expressions on either side of our centred state of being which are commonly explained as a negative charge and a positive charge. Below is another diagrammatic representation of this concept. In the Great Arena, we spend most of our time in either the negative or positive states of being and seldom experience the centred state. My objective of sharing this information with you is to help you reconnect with your Soul Essence via your Higher Self. The Higher Self represented by the vertical line is your third aspect, the transpersonal self which is the part of you that knows all and sees all. One must not forget this wayward faction of the ‘gods’ are called the ‘gods’ to begin with because they are very adept at creating realities on a grand scale beyond the construct of a single galactic system. It was therefore imperative for them to have an incredible understanding of the knowledge of how life in this Universe is constructed. Do not underestimate these gods! As a result they also had an intimate understanding and even mastered to a certain degree the knowledge of ‘Light’; of both the positive and the negative charge, of light and dark, Yin and Yang, love and fear and of good and evil. Now we are at a critical point; this next piece of information is a major key to understanding this supreme cosmic deception. Due to having mastered Light to a certain degree, they now were able to manipulate life through the positive white love and light energy. Traditionally, manipulation was done through the negative and darker expressions of life. That way is cumbersome, tiresome and exceedingly obvious to many. The more sophisticated ways of manipulation and control utilise the passive aggressive programs which yield greater results. It is an energy that many in the Universe refer to as Conditional Love. It is called conditional love because it utilises the positive (+) white love and light energy which is on one side of duality. It is therefore a limited, lower and lesser version of the Love one experiences in the realms of the Higher Self beyond the Great Void and therefore beyond the Great Arena. So yes, as crazy as this may sound, they have even created a light frequency that simulates Love; therefore, they have created their own version of love. This is what they are using against us, love! The plan the wayward faction of the gods now commonly use throughout the cosmos is to systematically plunge a reality down in vibration forcing people into a dark negative charge for a long period of time, meaning many generations, and then present a more desirable positive white love and light solution to the problems they created to begin with. This is an ancient strategy and program known as; ‘Problem - Reaction – Solution’ Most people think that this program is being implemented on a planetary level, and some can even see it on a galactic level, but what the overwhelming majority of people don’t realise is that this program is being implemented on a grand cosmic scale within the Great Arena. Over the past 6,000 years they have systematically gone about creating such an undesirable environment here, plunging us into the dark ages, (creating the problem); depriving humanity of as much true Love and Light as possible, resulting in people yearning and aching for love"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"and light, peace and harmony, (getting the reaction); so at the end of the process they can then present their version of love and light, (presenting the solution). Now, because we have been deprived of love for such a long period of time and have been experiencing the illusion of being cut off from our Soul Essence, we have forgotten what true Love and Light feels like. We have lost that point of reference and so people are flocking towards the gods and their archon’s version of love and light like a child takes to candy. The god’s version of the positive white love and light energy they have created stimulates people into feeling euphoric. Many refer to it as bliss. It also has a mesmerising effect and is designed to subdue and pacify people. Their version of light and love enters through a series of energetic portals that are known as the chakra body. The chakra body The word ‘Chakra’ is a Sanskrit word which means wheel or vortex. Chakras are not physical as they are vortexes of energy. Some people can see them. The seven most commonly known chakras are aligned with certain parts of the Human anatomy and physiology. Five other main ones which are less commonly spoken of make a total of 12 major chakras; each 12 also aligning to a replicated strand of DNA. Yes, that means we originally had 12 strands of DNA. In the bible the seven commonly known chakras are referred to as ‘The Seven Seals’. Each one also correlates with the seven main colours of the light spectrum and the musical scale. The information in the pages that follow may come as an unpleasant surprise to some. The lengths to which this deceptive and duplicitous force, its gods and their archons, have gone with their obsession to control our Humanity, also runs into our physical domain as well. I do understand the way we are being manipulated through religion and politics, through the media, our foods, the medical system and the education system. What I want to bring to your attention here is that the scale of manipulation is so great that there even exists physiological proof within our bodies. Yes, you read correct; there is physical proof within our bodies of this manipulation. Before I go on explaining what I know and understand, I want to clarify that I have no medical training whatsoever. Some may argue that this is nothing more than just speculation and another conspiracy theory and/or disinformation. I am however, explaining this from an experiential perspective, so I urge anybody reading this to further investigate these concepts and know for yourself. Over a period of around 300,000 years, our Human race has been genetically altered. The genetic changes were in conjunction with the 12 great years, each one living out the experiences of an archetypal personality correlating to each DNA strand. At the end of each cycle a new fractal version of Earth was created and so the experiences and resulting wisdom gained from the previous cycle that had been imprinted into our genetic codes was then compressed. As a result, a more compressed Earth Human was created to match the requirements of the newly compressed frequencies of our Earth Mother. This explains the more physical processes of the road to compression. In the later stages or last few cycles as the frequencies were compressing, our reality and our Humanity began to be accessible to those who were to play the role of challenging and testing our Human Beingness. This created the scenario of a symbiotic journey with groups who came along and tampered with our genetics. This tampering continues today. There is a notion that we have been “dumbed” down from twelve strands of DNA to two partially functioning strands; but that is only partly true. We have been compressed down from 12 DNA strands 300,000 years ago, to 2 strands of DNA at the beginning of this cycle 24,832 years ago. It is after compression, during each cycle that we have had our DNA strands tampered with. What I am revealing is a program that is aimed at capturing an aspect of self that is known as our Traveling Spirit. In other words, it is a program that is designed to capture the aspect of your Spirit Essence that you projected from the realm of the Higher Self beyond the Great Void in the 5th dimension, down into the Great Arena. Some refer to our Travelling Spirit as the Soul, but I just want to clarify once again that my definition of Soul is a much greater aspect of self and is explained earlier in the book, ( in the chapter, Our Journey within This Universe .) Others just call it spirit. Semantics can be frustrating! I previously mentioned that the chakra body is a fragmented state of being, so now I am going to delve further into that concept and continue to look at this issue from within the drama of the cosmic arena. When one approaches the issue without the need to defend their belief systems, then one can ask the serious question; “Is the chakra body merely an option, and/or a thing of the past?” If one does seriously ask"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"and then contemplate this question, then one discovers and realises that the chakra system is not only an option but is in fact an energetic overlay. As I mentioned at the beginning of the book I am a true sceptic, and so I continue to investigate and ask the hard questions and contemplate the answers. These are the answers that come from beyond my mind, from a place within my Essence and my Beingness. This information comes from the wisdom gained through a lifetime of extraordinary experiences, having travelled to numerous realities and interacted with numerous races and expressions of life. My conclusions bring me to make this next statement: “ The Chakra body is a major component in the greatest deception ever imposed on our Human Race! It is a most intricate element to the fragmentation, manipulation and control of Humanity on a cosmic level.” Some people would be horrified at such a statement, thinking it ridiculous and absurd, but what they do not understand is that it is a highly sophisticated program which is an energetic overlay and interface. Unfortunately, many people see it as the only path to enlightenment, but there are those of us who do not see it that way. We see the chakra body as an energetic overlay which is facilitating a particular version of enlightenment being presented to Humanity by a conglomerate of extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional races; and it is not the natural and organic path to an enlightened and aware consciousness. Please understand the magnitude of what I am sharing with you here in these words. This is cracking the code for the most sophisticated program of deception being imposed upon our Humanity! This is a multidimensional cosmic level program. When one can move beyond the chakra body, the rainbow body, one can then experience true freedom. It is sung, ‘Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high...... ......There’s a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby’ Each one of the seven main chakras is connected to a ring of the planet Saturn. There has been an age old battle for control of this Solar System between our Sun and Saturn. The consciousness and spirit of the planet Saturn is insanely jealous of who the Sun and the Earth are and what they are creating here. It is Saturn who sees himself to be “The Exalted One”. So who is the consciousness and spirit of the planet Saturn? It is an aspect of the god who is claiming to be the creator and ruler of all life on all levels of all that is and all that exists. It is the god of religions. Remember I shared with you that these gods are cosmic entities. The cosmic being that is represented here in fractal form as Saturn is known in every culture and by many names. Some call him Jehovah or Yahweh and other cultures call him Shiva, Allah and Cronus. Saturday is Saturn’s day that has traditionally been a day of worship throughout the ages. There are many religions today whose doctrine still demands worship on Saturn’s day. Please understand that this is all part of the greater Divine Plan. The entire Universe is represented here in this solar system and so it makes perfect sense that the deceptive and duplicitous force of the Universe, this god and its domains would be represented here as well. This cosmic entity is androgynous but we are currently dealing with its masculine expressions and aspects. He embodies the archetype of the authoritarian, the dominant father and the task master. He has issues of control and places limitations on us therefore providing the challenge of working through these limitations. Saturn is a planetary aspect of the creator of the false synthetic light constructs and resulting paradigms and dimensional realities. He is the master of the passive aggressive programs. He is the keeper of time as we know it and is therefore the creator and keeper of the Matrix. Because of who and what we are, this cosmic entity as Saturn has wanted nothing more than to take control of this Solar system and specifically our Earth Mother and her Humanity. Saturn is the location within our solar system of The Saturnian Council also known as the Great White Brotherhood. They are a council of Beings who embody and manage the synthetic positive white love and light energy. They also implement and manage the passive aggressive programs. The resonant expression of the archetypal personality of Jehovah/Yahweh/Shiva/Allah/Cronus/Saturn perfectly facilitates the agendas of the Archons, inter-dimensional beings and extra-terrestrial groups who function under the auspice of this Being, its paradigms and its archetype. Saturn is not the creator of this star system so he needed to find a way to take control of it. He could only do this by manipulating the existing energetic patterns or foundational frequencies and then go about implementing his own programs. The rings of Saturn are a huge project and have been created by the archons, their associated inter-dimensional beings and extra-terrestrial groups, for the purposes of broadcasting frequencies that influence the Solar system and of course influence us. It is through the use of harmonic resonance that Saturn has been able to gain leverage over the Solar system and gain leverage over Humanity. From a greater perspective beyond the drama of the cosmic arena, this is only happening because the Sun is allowing it. Saturn is merely an aspect of a cosmic energy and a cosmic entity which is of the most deceptive, manipulative, elaborate and complex influence in the cosmos. He is a generator of it. He is the transmitter of it. He is the one that continually needs to be appeased. He has adorned himself with beauty and splendour so that he may be adored. The Saturnian aspect of this deceptive and duplicitous cosmic force has always been known by those with the true knowledge to be the greater malefic. It is time to bring the pieces of the puzzle together. In order to control us from the deepest levels, what this cosmic god entity needed to do is dig as deeply into our energetic make-up as possible to interfere in our relationship with the Sun. Besides our own essence and the consciousness of the Galaxy, the consciousness of the Sun is the next foundational layer to our incarnation’s existence here. This god entity created a cosmic level software program that would be overlayed upon our natural state of being. This program alters the way we experience this planet, this solar system and the way we view life. As you can see, the chakra body correlates to the seven main colours of the Light spectrum. We have been cocooned inside a bubble of energy we call the chakra body, a cosmic software program that is designed to intercept and interfere with the way we perceive the sun’s light and energy. It is therefore skewing our relationship with the Sun. It is designed to capture our awareness, our attention and our Travelling Spirit and immerse us in the deceptive programs, eventually driving a wedge between us, the Sun and our Earth Mother. This chakra program"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"systematically steers the person into this god entity’s way of life, realities and domains. I mentioned earlier that we already have a Universal seed that was placed within us at the time when we first entered and merged with the Universal Consciousness. The Sun being a fractal of Universal Light is the same energy as that seed. The chakra program is designed to stop the sunlight from interacting with us in its full capacity, to prevent the sunlight from sprouting this seed and preventing us from becoming Universal Beings. It is designed to lure people back into the love and light domains of the cosmic arena. These deceptive programs cut us off from the greater aspects of self that reside in the core of our hearts, the core and heart of our Earth Mother and Father Sun. Enlightenment through the chakra system is a version of enlightenment that assimilates people into the false light constructs of the gods and in particular the simulated heavenly realms of the god of religions. “What does the chakra body have to do with Christianity?” I hear people ask; just wait and I will show you. I have already mentioned that the chakra body in Christianity is known as the seven seals. Remember I said that this god has replicated and created his own version of the Universe down here in the Great Arena and therefore he has his own version of the heavenly realms. Well, the chakra body/rainbow body, or the seven seals are his version of the heavenly body designed for his version of heaven. This god entity has managed to replicate his version of the Universal seed as well. I used the word interface in a previous paragraph, so the question we need to now ask is; “What is the chakra system or the seven seals interfacing with?” On our Earthly side of the interface they are connected to our endocrine system which is our glandular system of our body. The physiological proof of deception that I was referring to earlier is not the entire endocrine system, but one gland in particular. The question I pose that you seriously ask yourself next is this: What if, the pineal gland is a biological implant hidden in plain sight? The pineal gland The pineal gland is found in many species in our animal kingdom and so I understand that people would come to the conclusion that my suggestion of it being a biological implant does not make any sense. If you consider our “modern day” experiments, scientists will try out an idea on several other species before experiments are to be implemented onto our Human Race. Now consider experiments involving highly advanced Beings in both technology and the knowledge of the cosmos, whose agenda is to control this planet, her environment and therefore ultimately her Humanity. After having manipulated countless races in countless star systems and galactic systems throughout the cosmic arena over eons and epochs of time, these Beings have developed the most sophisticated technologies of control, some of which are multi- dimensional energetic programs and intricate multi-dimensional biological implants. When one views this issue from a greater perspective, other versions of the pineal existing in many species makes perfect sense. In order to achieve this, the gods and their archons needed to create a human version of this pineal gland and implant it within our physiology so that it can interface with an energetic program overlay (the chakra body/rainbow body or the seven seals), which in turn energetically interfaces with their synthetic light constructs. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" The pineal gland is the physical interface for this energetic software program that originates from their false and synthetic light construct. Around 300,000 years ago was when the first genetic manipulations by these gods began occurring. At that stage we did not have a pineal gland and our behaviour was far more centred and balanced and not reactive. Our systems of function were directly regulated by our conscious awareness. The endocrine system releases hormones (chemical messengers) which regulate various human functions; including metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, and importantly mood. This makes the endocrine system a reactive system. In turn, it interacts with the physical body, the emotional body and even the mental body. If the gods can influence and control the endocrine system, then they virtually control the entire development of the Human physiology, and the regulation of mood which is a crucial factor here since mood governs behaviour. So in order for them to achieve this level of control, the gods needed to create their own version of a gland that has the ability to interface with the pituitary and therefore the rest of the glands that make up the entire endocrine system. Of all the glands that make up the endocrine system, the pineal gland plays a lofty, executive and even imperial role. It is physically directly connected to our central nervous system. The pineal gland is the interface between the endocrine system and the nervous system. It converts nervous system signals into endocrine signals and is therefore responsible for the regulation of endocrine functions via the pituitary gland. Think of it like this; the pituitary is the public facade of governance of the endocrine but the pineal is the hidden hand that pulls the strings behind the scenes and governs by stealth. It is perfectly physically positioned to play dare I say a “cardinal” role. The pineal gland is also responsible for the secretion of the hormone Melatonin which helps in regulating wake/sleep patterns and circadian rhythms. The Pineal gland also secretes Dimethyltriptamine (DMT). DMT creates an increase in serotonin receptors within the brain whereas pharmaceutical anti-depressants produce a dramatically reduced number of serotonin receptors. An increase in serotonin receptors means the brain is ready to receive and cope with an increase of activity and therefore information. DMT facilitates the mind to function in a different way altering its modus operandi and also allows for a far more increased capacity. DMT is not only a mind altering substance, but can actually alter states of consciousness. Experiences in altered states of consciousness are important for the growth and development of Humanity, but"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"how these altered states are achieved is the point of contention. Depending on the method of achieving an altered state, be it through a ritual, prayer, chemically induced or, as I prefer - simply through one’s heart, will then determine what realities are accessed. The method creates the level of knowledge and wisdom to be obtained. Some people call DMT ‘the spirit molecule’, as it literally stimulates the brain and the mind into opening a portal of consciousness into other realms, paradigms and dimensions. People actually travel into the cosmos with their consciousness and often end up interacting with beings from other realities. This all sounds totally amazing, and it is - if your only point of reference is our current earthly reality, also known as the Matrix. However, if one has a greater point of reference such as personally experiencing other realities and/or the Love and Knowledge in the depths and stillness within one’s heart and One’s Soul Essence, then one realises that enlightenment through the pineal gland is a chemically induced form of enlightenment. It calibrates and attunes one‘s lower consciousness into the cosmic mind of the god of religions. The pineal and the cosmic matrix Some people feel they are merging and communicating with God without realising they are actually viewing the lower Universal paradigm through the lenses of this god entity’s cosmic hive mind. So whilst the love and knowledge people experience and obtain through this process is by our current circumstances incredible and amazing, it is unfortunately still within the confines of the realities and domains of the gods and their archons. People easily forget just how deprived of any true love and knowledge we have been. We are more assimilated into the realities created by these gods and their archons than most are willing to acknowledge and comprehend. This creates a different path to the one I am sharing. The pathway via the pineal gland takes one into a 4th Dimensional cosmic mind matrix. People tend to forget that the pineal gland is located in the head, in the brain and is therefore a connection to a mental construct. Be it earthly or cosmic, it is still a mental construct because the knowledge and wisdom I am sharing is about the path of the heart that resides beyond the Chakra Body. If one looks back through our recorded history one can see that the pineal gland has been venerated as the seat of the soul in many cultures throughout the ages. I absolutely do not agree with that perspective as I feel and know the seat of my soul is in my heart and not in my head. Many people think that the pineal is a dormant gland but that is not so. It is already functioning and decoding right now. Not only is it functioning on a physical level but also on a matrix level. It is currently influencing our minds and people are not aware that it is operating in this manner. It is not only decoding your nervous system signals into endocrine system signals and vice versa, but also decodes a lower spectrum of frequencies related to the Moon Matrix. When one stimulates the Pineal Gland and does what some people call ‘Pineal Gland activation’ through a series of rituals or exercises, all one is really doing is just recalibrating it to 4th dimensional cosmic mind matrix frequencies. Because people now consciously want this biological implant decoder to receive a more powerful spectrum of energetic frequencies this implant literally begins to morph physically to expand and grow. It becomes more energised because one is now accessing those greater frequencies of the cosmic matrix. The more one connects into this 4th Dimensional cosmic mind matrix, the more the pineal gland is stimulated and seemingly comes alive. To use an analogy; think of the pineal gland like a tuner in a television. If one understands electricity and I mean really and truly understands it, then one begins to realise that electricity is a living consciousness and therefore a living entity. Electricity contains an incredible amount of information and knowledge within it. Our bodies are a vessel of living conscious electrical signals. Our brains also function as a network of living conscious electrical signals. The electricity is the real life force animating our technological equipment into being. But the television is functioning on a superficial layer of programs that come in on radio waves. It is the same setup for Humanity because there is a superficial layer of programs that we are functioning from. The juice that animates us into being is our Spirit Consciousness which comes from our Higher Self and our Soul Essence, and it enters through one’s heart. The juice that animates a television into being is the electricity and it enters the television through the power supply which is therefore the heart of the television. There is a part in the television called the ‘tuner’ which is how the television receives signals and decodes those signals which then become the programs projected onto the screen. The television tuner is designed to pick up signals that are floating all around us which we cannot see. We have a part in us which performs the same function and it is called the pineal gland. We established that the pineal is a decoder of signals as it converts nervous system signals into endocrine hormonal signals and vice versa; but that is its function on a physical level. So what about its functionality on an energetic level? What if the pineal gland is a multi-dimensional implant? This god and its archons are a multidimensional cabal with a multidimensional assault on our Humanity, so it makes perfect sense given who we are and what we are capable of, that they would manipulate us with a multi-dimensional implant. Depending on which frequency the tuner of your television is calibrated to, will depend on which program gets projected. A particular frequency tunes you in to one channel and program. When another frequency is chosen a different channel/program/reality is accessed then projected and experienced. Those radio waves are synthetic relative to the living consciousness of electricity. They have been constructed by people who want you to see their programs. These programs are created and their signal is transmitted from a central location and relayed to local towers. The tuner inside the television picks up the signal from these towers and the signal is then decoded. The transmitted synthetic reality is then projected onto the screen so that it may be experienced. The living consciousness of electricity that has all the knowledge and wisdom contained within it is completely bypassed and even neglected. The synthetic program is what has now become the generally accepted reality. It is the same principal for the pineal gland. The signal is first sent from a central location being the consciousness of this duplicitous god entity and its reality that it has created. From there the signal is broadcast to us from two local “towers” being the Moon and Saturn. The Moon broadcasts the generally lower and more"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"negatively charged vibrational series of programs of the false synthetic light paradigms. In turn, Saturn broadcasts the generally higher and more sophisticated positively charged vibrational series of programs of the false synthetic light paradigms. The pineal gland then picks up the signals, decodes them and energetically relays the program into our conscious mind. Depending on which program one is calibrated to will then depend on what one’s mind is projecting and what experiential reality is being created. The transmitted synthetic reality via the Moon Mind Matrix is the current business/scientific/military industrial complex program, and the Saturn Matrix is the “God”/religion/spiritual series of programs. Our organic living consciousness flowing in through our heart that comes in from our Spirit, Higher Self and Soul Essence which has all the knowledge and wisdom contained within is now bypassed, neglected and forgotten. The synthetic program is what has now become the generally accepted reality. The pineal gland is where the many programs propagating the concept of “oneness” originate from. Yes we are all one in the sense of unity, harmony and synchronicity but the concepts of oneness that are being disseminated by these programs are promoting more of a collective hive mind construct. When I use the term ‘collective hive mind’, I am using it in the context of a bee hive or an ant colony. These are the types of oneness programs that the gods and their archons have created. People don’t realise that the Matrix has different levels of functionality. The Matrix is a multi-dimensional program. We not only have the earthly matrix but we also have the galactic matrix and even a cosmic matrix. The pineal gland is designed to decode the matrix signals of the realities of the gods and their archons. These series of signals that the matrix is continuously imposing upon us get verified through the five senses. The gods and their archons not only have the programs coming in through the pineal gland but they have set up this physical reality which validates their signals that we are receiving internally through our minds and associated mental constructs. When we look around us we are experiencing and constantly having this synthetic reality validated with the mind control programs of media, education, medical and political programs, cultural and religious programs. It’s everywhere. It’s all around us. The energetic matrix is being validated in the physical. Look at how many different mental programs are running in our societies today. Look at how new ones are being continually created; it is a forever evolving process. Humanity is being compartmentalised and even those compartments are being compartmentalised and those newly created compartments are being further compartmentalised. Our awareness is inside this incredible array of programs. The level of sophistication borders on pure genius. It is like an organism that just keeps growing. It is an organism of Human mental constructs. The key to this whole program of mind control with all these different programs is to understand that the pineal gland is the decoder. It is the tuner and the receiver of the matrix signals entering through the chakra body. It is what influences the mind and is perversely brilliant. Imagine all the different programs on offer from the paradigms of the gods and their archons. Think of their array of programs the same as your TV Guide. When you read through the TV guide you then choose a program depending on what is in alignment with your topic of interest and what reality you wish to experience. Pineal - religion connection We have the current functionality of our mind inside the 3rd Dimensional Moon Matrix programs which are the lower vibrational earth bound day-to-day living programs. These are more driven by desire, materialism, competition, lust and greed. The unpleasant by-products of these programs are fear-based thoughts and emotions; including depression, loneliness, abandonment, helplessness, frustration, disconnection, envy, victimhood and pain. People then feel the need to have a more other worldly experience and end up going to their church or temple, synagogue or mosque, gurus or meditation groups for respite, guidance and council. Through the programs and processes of prayer, rituals and/or meditative practices the pineal gland is stimulated and other realities and domains are accessed. Depending on the program that you are more aligned with and wanting to experience depends on what program you are being calibrated to and what reality of the gods you experience. If you are a Christian and you are worshipping and therefore energetically feeding a Jesus figure then that is the program you are aligned with. That is the reality your conscious awareness is going to enter into. This is where the creator god of this program which you have been worshipping and feeding, will be waiting to greet you adorned with the matching Jesus image that the god’s earthly ambassadors called the priestly caste have been propagating, selling and even imprinting into the psyche of Humanity for the past few thousand years. Or, you may meet one or more of this god’s archons who will adorn the image of an angelic being or an ascended master so that your program, also known as your belief system, will be there to greet you. I am simply helping people to understand that all these programs of worship are really just the programs of these gods and their archons. Following is a list of how all the main religions make use of the pineal gland or ‘third eye’ in one way or another. CHRISTIANITY: The original meaning of the cross represents the sword which symbolises truth and the four basic energetic streams that manifest life into its created form being Love, Knowledge, Feminine and Masculine . Touching the head is the Knowledge , touching the chest is the Love , the left shoulder is the Feminine and the right shoulder is the Masculine . Later, after the church was formed, it is believed that the sign of the cross was made only on the forehead by using one finger. Before Easter, some Christian worshippers use ash paste to mark the sign of the cross on their forehead. ISLAM: During prayer, the Muslims kneel on a prayer carpet, face the direction of Kaaba in Mecca, believed to be the centre of the Earth and touch the ground with their forehead. This prayer ritual is performed five times a day. JUDAISM: The Jewish people wear a Tefillin during their Morning Prayer. The Tefillin are two small cube leather boxes which contain scrolls of Torah passages. One box is placed on the arm and the other on the forehead. Before prayer, they position the head Tefillin on the forehead just above the hairline. When the prayer is completed, the wearer repositions the Tefillin in the middle of their forehead just below the hairline. In addition, Jews sway their body back and forth with their forehead pointing downwards during prayer at the Wailing Wall. ZOROASTRIANISM: Zoroastrians mark their forehead with cold sandalwood ash. HINDUISM: The Hindu outwardly show the pineal gland by drawing a mark on the forehead known as Tilka or Tilak or Tilakam . The mark on the forehead of men takes the form of a line or lines and on women it takes the form of a dot. Some call it Bindi . "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"BUDDHISM: Buddhist deities are often depicted with the third eye in the centre of the forehead. Other Buddhist deities are depicted with a pine cone headdress. TAOISM: In Taoism, students have third eye training. This involves focusing attention, while their eyes are closed, at a central point on the forehead between the two eyebrows. Granted, each of these religions has their explanation and justification in regards to the use of the forehead, the third eye and therefore the pineal gland. However, the common theme is there for all to see. Different pineal glands are tuned to different realities depending on which type or style of method is implemented, meaning which religious practice one uses. One person’s pineal is tuned to a different set of programs compared to another and that is one of the main reasons an individual’s experience is so profoundly different to someone else’s. The pineal gland receives the signal/signals depending on which realm or realms of the false light paradigms in the 4th dimensional cosmic mind matrix, is required. That is why when one takes a closer look at the basic program behind all the different religions, they all end up steering the worshipper towards using the pineal gland in one way or another whether the program is obvious or in some cases cleverly obscured or disguised. So the gods have created a menagerie of different realms and realities and associated deities to cater for different cultures and mindsets. It is also part of their greater strategy of divide and conquer. “My god is the one true god!” is what religious fanatics and zealots say. It is like barracking for a football team. Furthermore, if you get bored, uncomfortable or disillusioned with one religion/deity/program, then another is on offer to stimulate, lure and capture your awareness. If they don’t entrap you into one cosmic paradigm/program, then they can entrap you with another. Like the tuner on a television, you can change the dial and go into different levels of programs. You can even modify that tuner to receive really sophisticated signals that not many people can pick up. It’s the same thing if you work with and modify the Pineal Gland you can actually start picking up really specialised signals. Specialised practices result in the attunement of specialised signals and therefore a connection to specialised realities. The gods and their archons have created these realities which they call the heavenly realms and they only want “special people” in there because it is a “special place”. People have to earn their way in through a process of ritualistic prayers and meditations, techniques and practices all designed to give one’s power over to the “higher authority”. So in truth it is all about guilt driven atonement and conformity. It is the god’s version of a heavenly realm and the way you get in there is by enlightenment via the Pineal gland. My own experiences show that connecting with the Universe in a natural sense is achieved through one’s heart and greater aspects of self. Other people I talk to also share the same experience. We all know our Heart is where the true stuff of life is made from. Our true Soul purpose and our intuitive heart guidance of where to go, what to do and how to live life all originates from the heart. We have instead been living this other authoritarian program which comes in through the Pineal Gland in all its varieties and forms, especially the sophisticated subtleties of some of the passive aggressive programs. Pineal symbolism The pineal gland has been symbolised by the pine cone spanning recorded history for about the last 6,000 years and beyond. The pine cone has also served as a symbolic representation of the Third Eye and Human Enlightenment. It continues to be used today with this symbol being hidden in plain sight. The following pictures show how the pineal gland is a common theme that has travelled down through the ages and has been incorporated one way or another into every religion, secret society and the occult. It is also the foundational philosophy of the modern day new age movement which is nothing more than a sophisticated version of religion designed to capture the attention and consequently the travelling spirit of those whose awareness had risen beyond the trappings of religious doctrine.

As you can see, the chakra pineal program is not just simply a conspiracy theory, nor is it speculation; it is a very real program . This entity who is the god of the religions who claims to be the one and only creator and ruler of all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists, has systematically infiltrated our spiritual teachings over thousands of years and has infected the Human psyche with this most sophisticated program of cosmic deception. It is written, ‘Even the elite will be deceived!’ The kundalini connection The word Kundalini literally means coiled. In yoga, a \"corporeal energy\" - an unconscious, instinctive or libidinal force or Shakti, lies coiled at the base of the spine. It is envisioned as a goddess or as a sleeping serpent; hence a number of English renderings of the term such as 'serpent power'. The kundalini energy resides in the sacrum bone in three and a half coils and has been described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism. It is one of the components of an esoteric description of the 'subtle body', which consists of nadis (energy channels), chakras (psychic centres), prana (subtle energy), and bindu (drops of essence). Kundalini is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine, usually within muladhara chakra. The image given is that of a serpent coiled three and a half times around a smoky grey lingam. Each coil is said to represent one of the three gunas, with the half coil signifying transcendence. Through meditation, and various esoteric practices, such as Kundalini Yoga, Sahaja Yoga, and Kriya Yoga, the kundalini is awakened, and can rise up through the central nadi, called sushumna, that rises up inside or alongside the spine. The progress of kundalini through the different chakras leads to different levels of awakening and mystical experience, until the kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, Sahasrara chakra, producing an extremely profound mystical experience that is said to be indescribable. ( From Wikipedia ) Kundalini Caduceus I mentioned earlier about how the gods and their archons have created realities that are designed to funnel the energy of the beings and their"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"experiences towards the gods and their archons so they may consume this energy and empower themselves. Despite the flavour of the images remember this is not just an Eastern philosophical issue, as this practise comes in many guises and has infiltrated every culture in one way or another. For example, in the Eastern religions it is known as the ‘Primal Mother’ and in the Christian religion, the Kundalini is known as the ‘Holy Spirit’ or ‘Holy Ghost’. In Freemasonry the kundalini is called ‘Spirit Fire’ which rises up through the spine, the 32 vertebrae or the ‘32 Degrees’ of initiation towards the pineal, with enlightenment being the ‘33rd Degree’. The energetic program called the Kundalini is not a natural part of our original organic makeup. Some people think we cannot survive without it, but that is absolutely false! That is their programed belief system that brainwashes beings into believing such nonsense. These gods want you to believe that you cannot exist without them and their programs; total dependency and domination! It is so obvious, yet people are so blinded. From my personal experiences, my conclusions bring me to make this next statement: The Kundalini is the fundamental component in the greatest deception ever imposed onto our Human Race! It is the most cunning element to the fragmentation, manipulation and control of Humanity. To understand the inner concepts and functionality of this most intricate and deceptive cosmic program, first we need to understand the naturally occurring energies we create by simply living from the heart. Then, I will explain the synthetic version created by the gods. Organically in the Universe, a Being will have an experience that is purely generated from the level of the Soul Essence which then flows forward to the Higher Self and then into the heart of one’s incarnation. The initial outward expression is a positive charge which results in one having a naturally occurring forward momentum. This foray forward into new experiences in life results in Soul growth and development generated from the knowledge and wisdom gained. What happens next is that the negative charge of the Universe in co-creation with ones Greater Essence and Higher Self, then provides the resistance through the creation of challenges in one’s journey. This negative energy resists and restricts our growth and development by imposing programs of limitation. The resisting energy provides even greater experiences than before, which in turn produce an even greater level of knowledge and wisdom, growth and development than was previously experienced. In that moment when the forward moving energy and the resisting energy meet, like between the jaws of a vice, right in that pressure point is where the spark of life gets created. It is where and when magic happens and the alchemical processes of life take place; like the moment when a piece of coal is turned into a diamond. This energy in itself is highly specialised energy: it is food for the Soul . Our Souls are fed and nurtured by that spark. They thrive on it and it creates an incredible amount of growth and empowerment within a Being. This is the nature and essence of Light. Because the gods have tried their best to replicate and create their own version of the Universe down here in the Great Arena, it was a given that if there was an existing energy that created tremendous empowerment, they would undoubtedly want and need to make their own version of this specialised energy. Some may ask the obvious question: “Why don’t they just live the experiences and create their own natural organic spark themselves?” The answer to that question is that they have become so self-absorbed, self-deluded and in particular so self-righteous, that they see themselves as being above and beyond any such process. They regard themselves as the rulers and they do not have any issues within themselves that need addressing. Another question that may arise in some people’s minds may be, “Why don’t they just consume the already existing organic version instead of having to make their own?” Because they have moved into such a synthetic way of life, the frequency of the energy that is created by living from one’s heart, one’s Higher Self and Soul Essence, is an energy that is now detrimental to their current synthetic state of being. For the most part, they simply do not have access to those organic and harmonic frequencies. These naturally occurring energies are mostly beyond their scope and spectrum of reality. The energies of wisdom and the spark of life move beyond the Great Void and into the realms of the Higher Self and then into the realms of the Soul Essence. Many think that the energy being consumed by these gods, their archons and associated entities is the energy of fear and its many expressions - such as anger, jealousy, violence competition, pain, frustration and hatred. This is only half the picture! These gods have created realities and domains using a foundational energy of both sides of duality. People omit the fact that they also feed on love with a small ‘L’ which I refer to as conditional love, because conditions apply with that form of love. Love in its purest form is untouchable by these gods. Remember the ancient program of, problem - reaction - solution. The fear-based feeding systems are the problem; the yearning for something better is the reaction and their solution is the Kundalini, Chakra, pineal program version of enlightenment. Because of our genetic and energetic makeup being a fractal of the Universe, the gods knew that if they were to control and dominate us, they had to create and implement a program that replicates both energetic streams of duality. This is a clever design to reach as far into us as possible, to blur the lines between the natural organic Universe and their synthetic version. The synthetic version of the spark of life that is produced, or dare I say ‘farmed’ by the gods, is created in the following manner: The Kundalini contains two streams of energy which replicate the two aspects of Universal Light and waveform - meaning, positive and negative, light and dark, love and fear, masculine and feminine. Our spinal column is an extension of the brain and is our omphalus, our pillar of operandi and our central pillar of functionality, also referred to as the tree of life. This creates an interesting and intriguing perspective to Eve and the serpent in the tree does it not? The perfect location for the gods to implant the primary and fundamental component of their most sophisticated program of control is represented by the serpent energy intertwining up the spine, intersecting at the chakra points. The synthetically created positive charge replicating the Universal positive energies is one energetic stream of the Kundalini. It has hijacked the image of the Sun and deceptively represents the Divine Masculine. The other energetic stream of the Kundalini is the synthetically created negative charge replicating the Universal negative energies and is represented by the moon. The Moon has hijacked the image of the Divine Feminine and deceptively represents her. Our Mother Earth is the Divine Feminine! These replicated negative and positive energies are the foundation to the gods’ version of creating that spark of life. Food of the gods "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"At each point up the spinal column where the two energies intersect is where the overlay of the cosmic software program called the chakra system connects and interfaces with the internal energetic cosmic software program, the kundalini. Where the tip of the vortex of the chakra point meets with the Kundalini in the spine is where the synthetic version of the spark of life is created. This intersecting synthetic energy is where and how the pressure point gets created in the program of the gods. It is the point between the proverbial jaws of the vice, as the negative serpent stream intersects with the positive serpent stream; where synthetic dark meets synthetic light. The chakra provides the active ingredient. In this moment a sphere of energy is created. This sphere of energy is the gods’ version of the spark of life. This is the energy they most desire and now insanely thirst for! Just as our natural and organic experiences, created from the heart, produce the energetic food to empower our souls, this synthetic version is their sweet nectar which they absolutely need to feed on for empowerment. Because of our genetic and energetic make up, attesting we are a fractal of the Universe, we access more life force than any other Beings in the Universe. When a Human creates this energy, never have they been fed so much addictive power in all of their existence!"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Seven main chakras, therefore seven points of contact manufacturing seven main different flavours of energy. These spheres of energy are harvested like fruit being harvested from a tree. They are farming us. It is the perfect program. Not only is it a program of influence and control, but it is also a program of production of energy for their food. Through this cosmic software program of the Kundalini, the Chakra system and the pineal gland; they influence us, they control us, they lure and steer people into their domains and realities, and they have us producing spheres of energy so they may feed off us, all at the same time. Pure genius! Each chakra point relates to a different behavioural pattern and energy. In reality, this gives them seven main entry points or portals of manipulation. A person’s behavioural pattern and energy can be activated in a particular chakra from an inter-dimensional location by an archon or entity working for the gods’ empire. For example, if it is the sacral chakra being targeted, a person is influenced and stimulated, and therefore steered into participating in more of the behavioural patterns associated with excess sexual desire and some people are manipulated into deviance. On a more positive note, people who embrace this Kundalini chakra program use it for an experience of what they see as “Divine Sacred Union” through sexual rites, rituals and practices. It is commonly known as Tantra. However, Divine Sacred Union occurs naturally through the heart and does not need the vehicle of the serpent energy running up the spine to be achieved. In that moment - be it a positive or negative approach, when a person is acting upon that desire and is consciously or unconsciously activating the Kundalini flow, and the Chakra vortex point or tip connects into the Kundalini column of energy, the gods’ spark of energy is created. For the participants it will seem incredibly euphoric and even feel divine in nature, but regardless of all the bliss and bedazzlement, it still creates the synthetic spark of life that they feed off. It is the trade-off. The benefits and gifts of bliss, euphoric sensations, ecstasy, good health, vitality, longevity and a promise of an opportunity to enter a “heavenly realm” are offered in exchange for your surrender and devotion to their programs. It is literally handing over the power of your spirit to the gods. The more people are caught up in these behavioural program loops, the more these energies are created for the entities, the archons and their gods, to feed upon. When two people argue, the energy produced between them is within the associated chakras turning and “churning” the energetic pot. This occurs at the pressure points, depending on how many chakras are being utilised, and is creating or “cooking” the meal of energy. Humanity in its natural state is humane , but we are continually being held in perpetual merry-go-rounds of habitual behaviours by the energetic programs being implemented and superimposed over our natural state of being. These energetic programs and mind control programs come in many guises. They are the religious, educational, cultural, medical and political programs. This includes business, military and defence programs, and highly sophisticated spiritual programs as well. These programs in every guise have infiltrated all aspects of life. It is the view of some that it is the chakras responding to our behaviour; but that is due to an inability to come to terms with the possibility of it being the other way around. When people are sick, new age healers will say that their chakras are out of balance and that they need rebalancing. Again, this is a case of, problem – reaction – solution. The illness is created from the undesirable negatively charged programs the gods and their archons are implementing in our societies; the reaction is someone looking for help and the solution is the rebalancing of the chakras which then makes a person feel “healthy” again. The person ends up feeling comfortable, safe and secure within the greater program. The balancing of the chakras is the remedy which is simply realigning and recalibrating the person into the gods’ frequencies, paradigms and realities - better known as the Cosmic Matrix. People are being made to feel more comfortable with the overlay of the “program of the gods” on the entire planet. They are being assimilated! The fatigue and pain many people experience relates to the kundalini, chakra and pineal programs being imposed onto someone whose vibration is not a match. The person ends up having a negative energetic reaction due to mismatched energies. I know this from my own personal experience, having been debilitated for over a decade with this issue. What people refer to as ‘Chronic Fatigue Syndrome’ and ‘Fibromyalgia’ are the physical symptoms or side-effects of these programs being implemented onto people who then have a negative reaction to the programs. Some people think that because they do not consciously partake in any Kundalini rituals and practices that they are free from this cosmic software program. One example: someone that reads the bible sees themselves as a disciple of Jesus and is waiting to be saved by this deity. First, the fact that they are waiting to be saved is an issue to begin with because they are already in the program of subservience and therefore eager to give their power away. When this person is in the presence of this deity, or one of his archons, seen or unseen, the god entity or archon who has assumed the identity of the personality and character of the Jesus of the bible, energetically connects to that person’s chakra program. The false deity energetically connects to the person’s pineal gland to stimulate it, releasing DMT which strokes the central nervous system, inducing bliss and euphoria. This can overwhelm the person so that they truly believe they are in the presence of their god. In turn, this aids in the calibration of that person’s conscious awareness to open a portal into the realities and domains of this deity. The crème de la crème is when this deity stimulates and then activates the Kundalini which the “Christian” disciple knows as ‘the Holy Spirit’ or ‘The Holy Ghost’. When the Kundalini, with all its feelings of euphoria and ecstasy reaches the pineal, the person is then consciously connecting to the cosmic hive mind of the god and ends up truly believing they are having a “Godly” experience. This same principal applies for every religion, every secret society, occult and eastern philosophy. It is also being used by the so-called angels and ascended masters in the modern day new age movement. People are having these experiences all over the world and truly believe they are communicating with beings from the realms of “God”. If one accepts the Kundalini/Chakra program as a way of life and the path forward into enlightenment and eternal life, then one embraces this program, surrenders to it and becomes immersed into its energetic realities and domains. Those who have been through it now see it for what it is and are moving beyond it. Others will simply judge and fear it, but they won’t really understand or master it until they themselves walk that path. This Kundalini chakra pineal program is an overall negative program because it lures and entraps beings within its realities, paradigms and domains. It is designed to assimilate beings/people into the Cosmic Matrix. It is a program of limitation which is designed to resist and restrict free-flowing, forward moving consciousness. It fools beings into thinking that they are moving forward into a spiritual awakening. But in truth they are not. One has been fooled and entrapped into believing one is connecting with and becoming Universal consciousness, when all the while it was simply the cosmic hive mind of a god entity. One is simply going from the tiny arena of the earthly matrix into the much bigger playground of the Cosmic Matrix. Those that choose this path will truly feel it is the right thing to do and will be"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"blinded by the beauty and splendour of the program. They will be incoherent to any other viewpoint and in fact will defend it vehemently. Whether it is a major religion or an eastern philosophy, a secret society, occult or new age movement, the behaviour is the same: that of a religious zealot. In summary, there is a group of gods and their archons that have come to this planet in order to control our Earth Mother and Her Humanity. They did this by systematically steering us from an incredibly high level of knowledge, wisdom, Beingness and high functionality, down to the level of reacting in a hormonal and instinctive mode - just like the animal kingdom. Then, they took all of that reactive hormonal and instinctive behaviour and combined it with our Human emotions and the labyrinth of our Human mind. What an incredible formula they have created for the enslavement of their Human herd and its production of energy so that they may feed and empower themselves. This cosmic chakra program is how this god entity is baiting people. The complete cosmic chakra software program comprising 12 chakras matches up an energetic vortex with each of the replicated 12 DNA strands. It is designed to re-activate people into that old “godly” state of being. We have already had twelve strands and have ventured down the path of compression so that we may birth anew. It was known through Universal Lore that we would be relinquishing our original organic 12 strands as we embarked on this journey into compression. This god entity is trying to manipulate that lost memory of 12 strands and coerce people into reactivating them and return to that “godly” way of being; hence, the replicated 12 strands. This is going backwards . It is not birthing a new way of life but simply aimed at recycling you back into the cosmic arena and is an attempt to simulate an enslaved version of what we once were in the early stages of this road to compression. This god entity has done such a great job of wiping out knowledge of the past and creating such a negative, dark and undesirable existence here that people’s yearning and aching for something better is turning into desperation which clouds the power of discernment. People are flocking to these programs like a child takes to candy. Beware of the cosmic candy! Moving back out and beyond the Great Arena, I just want to remind you once again not to be overwhelmed with fear at the extent and scale of manipulation and deception. Knowledge is power, and the initial reaction some may experience upon realising what is happening to our Humanity, can be a feeling of disempowerment. This is a natural reaction but please know that it is only the programed ego reacting and is temporary. I went through it myself. Everybody who is awakening and experiencing astonishment at the scale and genius of this deception and manipulation goes through this process to varying degrees. Then, if you once again rise above the drama and shift your perspective back up into the Higher Self and beyond into the Soul Essence, we can easily see that this has been the most amazing of challenges to test us using the best this Universe has to offer. Rise above the drama of the Great Arena and move beyond victimhood and into empowerment. Remember: we wanted this and we agreed to this! We chose to incarnate and experience this reality right at the very end of the cycle! This is the Cycle for Life Eternal, at the end of the road to compression, zero point and perfect balance. We created an embodiment that is a fractal of the Universe and it needed to be tested to the nth degree. As the embodiment of the Universe itself, we needed to be tested by the most powerful programs of manipulation this Universe has to offer and that is what we got! The challenge is to recognise the kundalini/chakra/pineal program, see it for what it is and move beyond it. The way we do this is by simply living from our heart . Gratitude is a major key to empowerment. Acknowledge the supreme cosmic program of deception/limitation for its genius and be grateful for its service, for you would not have the wisdom and the empowerment without it. We know we are now done and it is time to move beyond it. The way we go about it is for our earthly egos to release and surrender control of this life to the greater aspects of Self that reside within our hearts. It is said, ‘The kingdom of heaven is within’. I will go into further detail of going within and into one’s heart later in the book. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Religion Who made religion? “ The god of religions has created the image of the devil because it is a reflection of its own self.” This section is not for the faint hearted as I am going to continue to expose what is truly going on with religion. It is entirely up to you whether you want to accept and understand what I am about to share, as I respect that we are all on our own journey. We have already established that there is a group of beings in the cosmic arena known as ‘the gods’. One of these gods in particular, who has risen to the top and become the leader of that group, personally came here to our planet around 6,200 years ago to take on a more substantial and active role. This “god” has systematically infiltrated and taken over the spiritual knowledge of every culture on Earth and used that knowledge to create the religions. This one god entity that is at the head of the hierarchy has in recent times, because of its program requirements and the need to steal the identity of the Sun, been expressing itself as a masculine being; hence, the fatherly image in religions. Because of compression, he has become self-deluded to the point of claiming to be the one and only creator and ruler of all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists. The mistake continues to be made by those who see the demi-urge and its forces of limitation merely as something dark, ghastly and gruesome; but that is not the case. This wayward god has his own version of the positive white love and light energy. To continue to think the deception is simply a negative, dark and fear-based expression is very naive. To use an analogy; in today’s world we have extremely rich, wealthy and powerful people whom we call the ruling elite and who sit in their highly sophisticated, comfortable homes and behave with incredible etiquette. They are very polite, well-mannered and big on protocol. They are usually well-dressed, eat fine food and live very wealthy and privileged lifestyles and tend to only mix in similar circles. These people who live in these very well-to-do realities are the ones who control the rest of society by pulling the strings from their cosy comfort zones way up high. They will do whatever it takes to hold onto their status and prestige, their power and wealth and have no hesitation in starting a war if necessary, resulting in the deaths of millions in order to achieve their agenda. They do not go around doing the hard labour or “the dirty work”. They don’t get their hands dirty as they get others to do that for them. Remember it is said, ‘as above, so below’. It is the same setup in the Cosmic Arena. The gods have a massive hierarchy and sit at the top of a very large infrastructure designed to funnel energy and resources towards them for the purposes of empowerment and control. Because they get others to do their dirty work for them, at times what people end up interacting with are the unsavoury and more ghastly beings they have contracted with to forward their agenda; hence, the effectiveness of “the devil” image. It is once again the ancient strategy of, Problem-Reaction-Solution. Think of it like this: This god wants to lure as many people as possible into his positive white love and light domains which he has created. As mentioned earlier, forcing people to do so is difficult, cumbersome, and tiresome and does not work in the long run. It is far more effective to make people want to go and be there by appealing to their insecurities through making them feel deserving, special and privileged and even loved. That way it has a deeper effect. They are then dumbed down and do not know any better. Therefore, obedience results making it easier for all concerned. In order to make people want to go into his version of heaven, he needs to give them purpose. So this god came to realise it needed to create multiple paradigms with varying degrees of light ratios and frequencies, kind of like a bubble within a bubble. Multiple Realities This would result in the creation of many levels of reality within multiple domains so that he may continue to detain beings within his"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"overall paradigm/program and keep their awareness and attention stimulated and entertained with a variety of experiences in a variety of realities. In other words, it kept them busy and occupied. Most importantly, it had to make them believe that they were free. He then went about creating more realities and continues to do so today. Eventually, he became so obsessed in his delusion that he began claiming to be the creator of this Universe. If that was not enough, he is now claiming to be not only the creator of this Universe, but also the Multiverse and all life beyond. This is pure egoic insanity! As I mentioned earlier, there is no one Creator Being of all that is and all that exists, since we are all infinite and eternal. People are constantly programmed into thinking in finite terms. If you understand what it truly means to be infinite then you will understand that in the greater scheme of things there is no such thing as totality! One needs to go beyond the mind and into the heart to grasp this concept. Some people say there is the ‘Infinite One’ or ‘The One Infinite Creator’ but that too is a contradiction. That is a perspective from people who are enmeshed within the more sophisticated programs of this god. People also use the term ‘Oneness’. There is even a planet-wide ‘Oneness movement’ growing rapidly today. This is just another program. These programs keep people thinking that we all come from this one entity, that we have been born or spawned out of this god being and that we did not exist prior to that moment. It is a perspective that views our Soul Essence as though it is a cell in our body and that all our Greater Essences together make up one single body or being. I understand due to fractilisation people would think that way. Consequently, they project this same principal as if it applies to all things on all levels of all that is and all that exists, unable to see past this cosmic matrix. Like our spirit exists beyond the cells and physical wholeness of our bodies, so too do we exist beyond the wholeness of this Universe and the level of Being that created it. The perspective of our Soul Essence being born or spawned out of a single god entity is a perspective that comes from exposure to the mind virus programs of this god entity within the cosmic matrix, designed to blur the lines between reality and illusion. These programs are designed to drive a wedge inside of us between our true spiritual sovereignty and his version of spirituality. The purpose is to capture our attention and awareness, steering our spiritual intent towards his version of life. Therefore, we are diverted to his domains and ultimately towards himself, instead of to our own Soul Essence and the knowledge and wisdom contained within. This god entity has gone so far as creating a huge and colossal paradigm - made up of multiple levels of reality so that when beings are assimilated into his structures and then they look up, they see multitudes of realities and domains and consequently believe they are in an entire Universe. He has created his own spiritual hierarchy with groups of what we call angels and ascended masters. I do acknowledge that these so-called ascended masters are actually ascended masters; but people need to realise that these beings are masters of his domains only. They are masters of the false light paradigms, and are yet to be masters of the rest of the organic Universe. Taking into consideration the statement, ‘As above, so below’, meaning that this is a microcosm of the macrocosm, if one looks at the way our world has become so compartmentalised over the last few thousand years it is easy to see that it is a reflection of the way this entity/god has created its Cosmic Matrix. He has been allowed to come here and implement his Cosmic Matrix infrastructure and programs. One of his"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"most powerful programs is the mind virus we call religion. He has not left a stone unturned in his obsession to take complete and total control of this planet and her realities as this is a multidimensional assault. Every culture has been infected with his energies one way or another - including indigenous cultures with some shaman, (not all), often unknowingly interacting with spirits functioning from within his paradigms. Unfortunately, in recent eras the programs on the planet propagate the notion that we are sinners and nothing more than lowly humans and unintelligent children. We are told that we are an immature race, and that we are savage beasts that need taming and mentoring. These programs ravage our psyche and well-being with guilt, unworthiness, uncertainty and doubt in order to create internal division. This all culminates in dependency on other Beings outside us to do it for us and to save us. The truth is that whilst we may be one of the youngest races in a physical sense, WE, the Beings, (spirits and souls), that occupy these bodies; these Human vessels are the oldest and the wisest in the Universe. WE are the way showers and WE are the ones we have been waiting for! This notion that we must achieve a type of perfection by adhering to strict guidelines and rules through religious protocol and ritualistic processes, parroting prayers and incantations, are programs designed to achieve conformity and override one’s sovereignty. It is an authoritarian based construct whose foundational energy is fear. Fear can be very subtle at times and the internal pressure that is created by these programs is a good example of the way they work. They program people into continually judging themselves internally because one is never good enough and it creates an internal division and subservient feelings to a greater authority. Yet we are already perfect in the eyes and heart of the true Universal Creator. All we need to do is to continue to be who we are; live from our intuitive heart guidance wherever it takes us, and simply learn along the way. No need to try to be anyone else or anything else but your genuine and authentic self. Whatever an individual needs in their Soul journey at any given time is what that individual requires because it is where they are at with their journey within this Universe and in their personal relationship with Universal Consciousness. There are many who see themselves as spiritually advanced beings but unfortunately they have become self-righteous and judgmental in their ways because they are continually striving for that unobtainable ideological perfection. That approach is one that requires the continual appeasing of their god. What this particular god and his minions have done is make life here so undesirable that many are flocking to his “heavenly” solution to the problem which he has created in the first place. The image of the Devil has been created by the god of the religions because it needed to create an image that’s dastardly, ugly, and putrid. Despite all the talk of love, light and sophisticated imagery, this god has himself in his ways become dark, dastardly, ugly and even putrid. For the sake of marketing his agenda he has learnt over time that he needed to adorn himself with beauty and splendour. As the apocalypse reveals from the good spirit to many waking souls, this ‘Supreme Deception’, this strategy is now becoming obviously clear! Even though it comes as no surprise, it still amazes me how billions of people around the world continue to fall for this deception of religious dogma, secret societies, occults and the new age movement. I am now going to expose what I have come to know and will give examples of this deception from within my Christian-based culture. Please understand that every culture on our planet has this deception taking place in one form or another because the basic agenda is the same for all religions. He has simply configured and calibrated a theological and theocratic program to suit each culture on the planet. Think of it as a cookbook with a recipe for every culture and every mindset. Exposing my religion The following examples can be seen in evangelistic churches all over the world. When people are in church praying and projecting their deepest intentions towards their “God”; when people are singing songs with arms outstretched in the air, tears rolling down their cheeks due to overwhelming emotions; if one knows the power of intention that we as a Human Race have, then imagine and comprehend the vast amount of energy which is being projected in those moments! These gods, especially this principal god, are consuming this energy for all they are worth. That is why, when they have a planetary race of the most powerful Beings in the Universe worshipping them, they have never ever been fed so much power in all of their existence. This is more than a drug for them. They need adoration, they need praise and they need worship! They are who they are because of that energy. If everyone was to wake up out of their trance and stop worshipping, and started understanding the knowledge and wisdom of life from within their own hearts, then all of this religious insanity, along with all its prejudice, wars and suffering would just simply go away. There is a notion being propagated on our planet that there is no evidence for a historical “Jesus” ever having existed. The Jesus of the church, not the true incarnation of the Sun, but the Jesus of the church is a personality and character that has been portrayed to the masses, served up to the masses, sold to the masses and has been systematically forced into our Human psyche. I totally agree that “Jesus” is a fictitious character made up of a menagerie of previous deific characters and religious programs created by the priestly caste and their demi- urge. People do not actually realise that the modern day Christian religion is an amalgamation of many religions of the time; specifically, 325 AD when the New Testament was created at the Creed of Nicea by Emperor Constantine. It includes aspects of paganism, but uses the basic template from the cult of Zeus and his priestly caste in Ancient Greece. The name ‘Je-sus’ is derived from the Greek name ‘Ih-sous’ is in turn a derivative of the name Zeus. The deity of Jesus is simply a revised version and transfiguration of the deity named Zeus. Have you ever considered that the image is simply a more youthful version of Zeus as well? Remember: I mentioned earlier that this god, his fellow gods and their archons changed tactics from their programs of power and force to an agenda of passive-aggressive programs. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" The transformation from Zeus, the big strong muscular, powerful and authoritarian Father god of the Old Testament, to Jesus, a more youthful, slender, gentle and loving god of the New Testament, is the perfect example of how they have gone about it. The cult of Zeus and its priestly caste from ancient Greece lives on! It flows forth into Rome and into the New Testament. The priestly caste have been selling, imposing and programming the human psyche over the last 1,700 years with their image of Je-sus, Ih-Zeus. It is an image of a deity that suits their agenda perfectly at the end of this cycle. When the real and true incarnation of the Sun and Christ returns, what is this modern day priesthood going to call him? They are going to call him the anti-Christ! They will once again call him Satan. So yes - I whole heartedly agree that Jesus never existed!!!"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" However, what people seem to be leaving out of the equation in all of this is that the church did everything in its power to search out and destroy any records or evidence of the events that transpired in and around 2,000 years ago, as well as the decades and centuries immediately following. It took 300 years for the priestly caste to recover and come back into power from the aftermath of the Sun and one other, returning, once again walking among the people. (This ‘other’ will be revealed later in the book). Thanks to the Emperor Constantine and his ‘Creed of Nicea’ in 325 AD, the priestly castes were once again able to form a state religion to reinstate themselves as spiritually superior to the people so they may once again be the intermediaries between the people and their god. This most certainly appeased the demi-urge as its objective is to disempower the people and cut them off from their true spiritual power and sovereignty making them believe that they must be subservient to a god that is beyond them, riddled with inferiority, guilt and resentment to one’s existence here. Our history over the past 1,700 years has been systematically presented in a particular way. So for over 1,700 years the priestly caste have aggressively sought and destroyed any evidence of the Sun having walked among the people in order to steal his identity and replace him with their own version. Programs such as The Inquisition are obvious examples of their search and destroy mission and process. They also murdered millions of living oracles, to prevent the true knowledge and wisdom of life from being passed down through generations via oral traditions. This enabled the priestly caste to then present their false version of the events of the past rewritten with their deceptive version of life. The Sun has come to this planet on many occasions and in many forms. He comes at least once during each epoch or era of time. After all, we are guests within his embodiment as a star system, and he is facilitating our experience here. We simply would not exist here without him manifesting himself as our star we call Sun. The word ‘Christ’ is derived from the Greek word ‘Krisos’ which is in itself derived from the Eastern name ‘Krishna’. ‘Krisos’ is more commonly spelt ‘Chrisos’ to soften the “K” because it is was originally pronounced more like ‘Hrisos’ which means ‘Golden One’. So when the Sun returned, the ancient Greeks called him ‘Oh Chrisos’, meaning ‘He who is The Golden One’. After he died on the “cross”, ‘The Sword’, the symbol of the sword was inserted into the word and then it evolved into ‘Kristos’ or ‘Kristi’ and ‘Christos’ or ‘Christi. So the word is now a combination of ‘The Golden One’ and ‘The Sword’; culminating in the word ‘Christos’, the spirit of the Sun. He symbolizes the Light of the World - both literally and metaphorically and He who wields the Sword by speaking, expressing, embodying and being Universal Light, Love, Knowledge and Wisdom. To clarify once again; the Being known as ‘The Christ’ was/is the walking incarnation of the Sun on this Earth and NOT the “son of god”. The concept of the “son” originates when the incarnated Sun was addressing a crowd of people and he simply used an analogy to explain the stepping down of energies from his embodiment as the Sun to his incarnated embodiment standing before them. “The Father and I are one”, he said. This is to explain that they are one and the same being, but two different levels of expression. He also used the same analogy to explain how the Sun, his embodiment as a star, was a physical manifestation of the Universal Consciousness and Universal Light. Again, this represents two different levels of expression, yet one and the same Being. The original Buddha was also the walking incarnation of the Sun; as was the original Krishna, Apollo, Viracocha, and Horus just to share a few aspects of the Sun. There are many times the Sun has come to live and walk amongst the people, in different eras and different places resulting in various cultural interpretations; all representing the same essence. One must also consider that later versions of these aspects of the Sun, presented to the masses, have also been changed from their original by the priestly caste throughout the ages as they have continuously hijacked the Sun’s identity for the purpose of creating the various religions to suit each era. Be very careful and discerning what to accept as truth, through images and texts. An example to consider: Is the eye of Horus actually a symbol that was created by Horus, or, is it a symbol that was created by the priestly caste of ancient Egypt to create their religion? Christians are waiting for the anti-Christ to turn up because that is the running program. But what if the anti-Christ has already been here for the last few thousand years? If you consider this possibility, then the dark ages and The Inquisition make perfect sense. These dark periods facilitated and enabled us to take this journey into compression and separation as far as possible. Now, at the very end of the cycle as our consciousness is rising, the religious programs and the cosmic software programs are having their maximum effects. There are about five billion people who are assimilated into the programs of various religions currently on our planet. Those people are caught up in the mind control of religious dogma of one flavour or another. The program of religion, meaning the image of the “devil” and the image of a holier-than-thou righteous “God”, is nothing more than the program of a god entity whose egoic insanity has reached the greatest magnitude, wanting and claiming to be the creator and ruler of all life, on all levels, of all that is and all that exists. This game of “God versus the Devil”, created by this god entity, is built on its own false version of the Light of the Universe. The devil is its version of negativity and darkness, and the godly aspect is its version of light and love. These are the replicated versions of the true Universal Light and Love! This wayward god is simply using the ancient strategy of ‘Problem-Reaction- Solution’. The program is designed to feed people the image of the devil over many generations. This fear-based problematic program of darkness becomes genetically imprinted, leaving individuals begging for the solution or program on offer of love and light; genius really. Religious rituals When I was a child, I participated in a ritual of the Christian Church called communion where I had to eat the bread and drink the wine. Every time I participated, I got a sick feeling inside of me; sometimes, it lasted for a few hours and other times for a few days. I had to tell my parents that I just could not do this anymore. Luckily, my parents were not zealots. They expressed their disappointment, but were not fanatical about it so they let me be. They allowed me to be me - and for that I am eternally grateful. So let’s take a closer look at this ritual called ‘Communion’, from a realistic and objective point of view. What is one actually doing? What does the bread represent? The bread represents flesh! It symbolises the body of Jesus. What does the wine represent? Blood - the blood of Jesus. What I was actually participating in was a flesh and blood ritual. Is it conceivable that the real Christ would have you, me or anyone performing a flesh and blood ritual in order to integrate with Universal Consciousness? NO! We already have the Christ within. We do not have to perform any dastardly rituals in order to integrate with the Christ. That is not the way of the Christ or of Universal Consciousness, that I know and experience. Priests can try and glorify it and dress it up with symbolic justifications as much as they like, but at the end it remains a “FLESH AND BLOOD RITUAL”! It’s sick, and it used to make me feel sick. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"People have forgotten that around 2,000 years ago, when the Sun incarnated and walked amongst us, the ancient priesthood called him Satan! Why would the ancient priesthoods have called him a Satan? The word Satan in ancient Hebrew actually means an opposer and adversary. When the Sun came along, he was a revolutionary; exposing the priesthoods, their religious structures and their demiurge for their lies and deception. He showed himself to be an opposer and adversary to their god, so that is why they called him Satan. Please do not get what I have just shared confused with modern day concepts of Satan; for example, Satan worshipping cults. Around 2,000 years ago, when the incarnation of the Sun turned over those tables outside the temples with disgust and anger, he did so because of the betrayal being perpetrated upon the Human Spirit. It wasn’t just the money changers that upset him that day outside the Temples. Nor was it the tax collectors using entrapment to get people to pay their taxes, before being allowed to enter the Temple. If they did not pay their taxes, they would be denied entry. No, it was worse than that. What really disturbed and affronted him the most were the animals that were sold outside the temples, so that people could ritualistically sacrifice them in the Temples in flesh and blood rituals to appease their god. These are the truths that get conveniently left out. It is obvious that this bloodthirsty god of the Old Testament has hijacked the identity of the Christ/Sun throughout the ages to this day. We now have a more sophisticated version of those ancient flesh and blood ritualistic sacrifices called communion, but it is still a flesh and blood ritual to appease the same old entity calling himself “God”. Don’t be so naive to think that the modern day priesthood is any different from the ancient priesthood. Their techniques have simply become more cunning and sophisticated, and have been wrapped up under the guise of fake sincerity and conditional love. Worship comes in many different forms and guises beyond the obvious ones. The act of worship can be as simple as saying a prayer. In that moment one is in a subservient frame of mind and the act of prayer creates the intent of projecting towards one’s deity. A package of energy is created in the form of praise (acknowledging their deity as their saviour), adoration (if singing a hymn) or, desperation (if calling for help) is sent to their deity who consumes that energy and empowers itself even more. Giving away one’s power can be as simple as a moment when something astonishing happens and someone reacts with, “Oh my god!” or “God willing” or “It’s gods will”. These are all examples of subtle programed responses, designed to continually acknowledge this demiurge as being responsible for everything that occurs in one’s life. It is designed to have you believe that you cannot function without this god. When you have millions - even billions of people regularly doing that all over the world, performing flesh and blood rituals, getting down on their knees begging for mercy like subservient slaves on a regular basis, imagine how much energy is being projected, siphoned and fed to this god and his archons. They are here now at the end of the cycle to harvest as much of their Human herd as possible, because they need to feed off Human worship. They cannot be who they are without it. They will do anything and everything possible to maintain our enslavement. For them to lose the level of power they currently have is simply unthinkable. It would be like death to them. There are no rituals involved with the True Universal Consciousness! All we need to do is just be! Be from the heart . We are a celebration of life, as we emanate our true and authentic essence, living together in harmony and respect for all life. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Hidden Knowledge The sword What is the sword? Every symbol has many levels of interpretation. I wish to share an interpretation of the symbol of the sword that I am passionate about, which has been known throughout the ages. My intention in sharing the knowledge and understanding of what this symbol represents is not to invoke more religious ideology, quite the opposite. It is to help people remember the origins and intention behind the creation of the symbol. Throughout the ages, the priestly caste has imposed their interpretation of what the symbol of the sword means. I am sharing what it meant for me in previous times, what it meant for many in ancient times, down through the ages and what it still means for us today. If we look at this symbol in its various forms there is a remarkable resemblance that becomes obvious. Why did Muhammad, a man of great wisdom say, “Spread Islam via the sword”? First and foremost, he did not mean to go around killing people! That interpretation is literal, of the lowest order, incredibly immature and astonishingly irresponsible. Why was the sword of Troy so important? Why was Helen the keeper of the sword of Troy? Why was King Arthur associated with the sword? When he finished with ‘The Sword’, why did he return it to the ‘Lady of the Lake’, the keeper of the sword? What about the Samurai? And, what is the meaning of ‘The way of The Sword’ and ‘Living by The Sword’? This symbol is so profoundly important that it is represented in practically every culture in one way or another. So what is this truly all about? The sword represents Logos! Logos is the word! It is the word of ‘God’. I am using the reference to God here in the context of the Universal Creator. The ‘Word of God’ is not text written on pieces of stone or on paper such as the Bible or Torah or Quran, or any other religious text. These Books are not the Word of God! They are the words of the priestly castes and their demi-urge for the purpose of creating religions. Yes, there are truths in those books, there must be; or people would not fall for the deception. The problem is that these books are full of twisted truths and manipulations and conveniently all require a middleman, or shall I say a “priest”, to interpret and explain the text to the people. The true ‘Word of God’ is the original blueprint of life. It is a natural and organic vibrational pattern also called ‘The Light’ that emanates from ones heart when one is expressing oneself from beyond the earthly egoic personality, from their Higher Self and Soul Essence. When you speak the knowledge and truth that is in your heart you wield the sword because it penetrates and cuts through lies and deceptions, through illusions and false paradigms. It is said, ‘The truth hurts’. The story of Jesus raising people from the dead is another clever twist to glorify the deity of the priestly caste and divert attention from the real events and the true meaning. It does not mean that he literally raised people who had died. If that was the case, then imagine how many paramedics in today’s world would be classified as performing miracles - bringing people back from the dead. To raise people from the dead means to awaken people from the trance . Those that are in the trance of the demiurge were, and are, considered as the walking dead. To resurrect someone is to enlighten them with knowledge so that they may be reborn or awakened out of their deathly slumber. That is why the sword is used to symbolise Universal knowledge and truth. Logos is when we speak from the heart of our essence in oneness and harmony with the Universe and beyond. We all have this ability. Our egos have been stabbed with the sword on numerous occasions in our lifetimes. This is where the saying ‘the truth hurts’ originates. We have also had to wield the sword at times in our lives at people who impose upon our sovereignty; be it friends, family or work colleagues. It’s not just parents, preachers, priests, mentors, teachers and people in authority who wield the sword; anyone can have access to it. Even little children wield the sword. For example, when we as parents tell our children that things are a certain way, because we don’t want them to be frightened or we want to insulate them for whatever reason, we tell them a story or a little lie . Our children then say “No, it’s really like this!”, and in that moment our egos hurt and we feel shame because we have just been caught out by our children. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" When one is able to recognise the true knowledge of life then one is able to symbolically retrieve the sword from the stone; or shall I say, retrieve the knowledge from the Earth through our higher aspect of self within the living library of the universe. Once this is obtainable and then sustainable, being lost in the dark forest of the matrix, not knowing the greater knowledge unable to see the bigger picture becomes a thing of the past. One goes from not being able to see the forest for the trees, to ascending the stairway out of the wilderness of darkness and into the light of knowledge and freedom. Please consider the following images of sword symbolism... Now consider these next two images - "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" Around 2,000 years ago, the Sun needed to incarnate and walk among the people once again here on Earth. The Sun returned as he did in previous eras to expose the priestly caste and their demiurge. He carried and wielded ‘The Sword’. He spoke ‘The Word’, he expressed and emanated ‘The Word’ and therefore he embodied ‘The Word’. In other words, he embodied the sword. He was, and is, ‘The Sword’! He then allowed himself to die as a simple man. One of the main reasons he did this was to show that we also embody ‘The Word’, and therefore are ‘The Word’, ‘Logos’, and ‘The Sword’! This simple truth resides in our hearts. We all have the power within to see through the lies and deception. The Sun surrendered and allowed himself to be nailed to the cross, or shall I say ‘The Sword’. The cross was then erected on top of and inserted into the mound; or, shall I say the sword was inserted into the stone. This heralded the descent into the dark ages. It was the death of the truth and the death of knowledge and wisdom. I will further explain in detail the reason, purpose and intention for the Sun, ‘The Christ’ doing what he did in this next chapter; remembering the events of our past is the remedy for the future. The true sacrifice of the Christ This planet is the ‘beloved’ of the Sun and the Sun is the ‘beloved’ of this planet. The core of this planet is a female version of the Sun. This is the basic understanding of our immediate cosmic surroundings. It transcends borders, boundaries of nations and cultures. Having mentioned at the beginning of the book that some of what I am sharing will come from within my cultural paradigm and program, it does not matter what religion, occult or secret society you belong to or what mind bending philosophy you aspire to; the structure of life here is the same for everyone! What truly rocked the priestly caste around 2,000 years ago was not just the Sun reincarnating onto his wife’s body, but, Mother Earth herself also reincarnating at the same time. This is one of the most powerful pieces of knowledge ever that has been fiercely quashed by the church, the priesthoods and their demiurge. They are terrified that this knowledge will get out into the awareness of the people, because this is about the relationship that a Human Being has with their Earth Mother and therefore with the higher aspect of Self that resides in her heart. It was around that era that Humanity’s relationship with our Earth Mother began to be substantially severed from our conscious awareness. Everyone who was incarnated at that time is back here again now. The priestly caste know this and the memories of what transpired back then are just simmering below the surface and could come to the fore at any time . It is this kind of information that can trigger these dormant memories back into life. If people were to suddenly remember, then all the lies disseminated since that time would be exposed. I therefore have this next statement to make:"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" WE WILL REMEMBER!!!.............EVERYTHING!!! The negative agenda has been ongoing and programs of many kinds have been systematically implemented into every culture to achieve this. By severing our conscious connection with our Earth Mother, they sever our connection with our higher aspects of self; and therefore our connection to our Soul Essence, the Universal Creator and the knowledge and wisdom of life itself. They fear our remembering more than anything because this is the foundational and key element to their strategy. The identity of the true Christ, the spirit of the Sun, has been quashed and hijacked, and another personality named Jesus is what has been presented to the people. There are of course elements of truth in the story of Jesus; there must be – otherwise, people would not fall for it. The priestly caste know that the people need to feel the threads of the latent memories stored in their genetics and the threads of memories bleeding through from their spirit making that familiar connection for the twisted and manipulated version to have the desired effect. Knowing this, my memories and my life’s experiences have led me to make this next statement: ‘The true sacrifice of the Christ is much greater than we have been led to believe, and there is one whose sacrifice is even greater than his!’ We are told that the character of Jesus is the Son of God and that this God sent his only begotten son to come here to die so that we may all be forgiven of our sins. I find it astonishing how many people believe this story. First of all, no one can do it for you; we must all do it for ourselves. This story is designed to totally disempower people because it is all about a saviour doing it for them, therefore making people hand over and channel their energy towards this false deity. You are responsible for this life you are having, you are the creator of your life and you are the creator of your Universal Journey; therefore, you are the one who is responsible for all your creations! I would like to think that you understand by now that I am not only referring to your earthly egoic personality, but also to your Higher Self, Soul Essence and beyond into your Eternal Essence...all of you! When the Sun returned around 2,000 years ago, we are told that he was persecuted, ridiculed and condemned. We are also told he was beaten, whipped and tortured. As horrific as that may seem the sacrifice we are told he made, just does not seem to add up with his experiences. There were people before his time, during his time and since his time that have been tortured as bad, if not worse than he was. This is especially true if we look at the way woman were heinously tortured by the church through the Dark and Middle Ages. To say that the full extent of his sacrifice was that he had to endure these tortures and then die so that he may resurrect is simply not enough. It does not add up. It does not make it any more “special” than other people’s hardships of a similar nature. What is this deep seated knowing and love so many have for this man and what he did? What was the big deal? The extent of his sacrifice was far greater than what we have been led to believe; much greater! So what was his real sacrifice? The Sun came here for a reason, with purpose and intent. He came here to die as a mortal man so that he could enter the reincarnational cycle of the Matrix of the behest. He entered into the Matrix relinquishing his divinity to experience birth, death and reincarnation just like the rest of us. He did not resurrect!!! He did not need to demonstrate anything supernatural nor did he need to come here and then die to become that which he already is - Light! He died a mortal man so that he may experience to the full extent that which all life within his own solar embodiment is experiencing. In other words he is not above and beyond anyone or anything, any experience and any process. Another piece of hidden knowledge is that he entered the matrix that had ravaged his beloved wife so that he could change it from the inside out. As the masculine expression of the Universe, facilitating within his embodiment as a star system, the final stages of this road to compression, in a cosmic sense he is playing the role of husband to his wife and father to his children. By the Sun coming here and dying he temporarily relinquished his role as the father archetype and protector of this, his domain. As painful as it was to be, he needed to take a step back from his wife and his children, allowing darkness and the forces of limitation to move in and ravage her and us, no longer being here to protect. For a period of about two millennia, the Sun had full view of his beloved Earth yet could not interfere. Now this is a sacrifice and an example of unconditional allowance and love! For those who think that nothing happened back then and that the story served up by the priestly caste is a completely fabricated fable, you cannot have a lie that works so effectively. I know this may sound like a contradiction to what I said earlier about Jesus, but it is not! What I said earlier was about the character of Jesus, their version of a deity, which is what the priestly caste used to hijack and place over the top of the identity of the Sun. Events back then relating to the Sun walking this Earth did occur. Multitudes of people feel a deep love and veneration for this man, this Being; it had to have taken place in the physical. It simply would not work for so long in the human psyche if it was just a lie. There has to be an element of truth. Whoever was there at that time in a previous life, or whoever is incarnated into a bloodline from that time will be feeling the effects of the post trauma. The authentic memories are deep-seated within the genetic memory and within our spirit’s journey. The trauma of seeing the Sun incarnate, surrender and relinquish his authority over this reality, hurt! He came to prepare and tell the people what was happening and why this reality and the Human Group Soul Consciousness needed to take this journey. People knew that life was going to change for the worst after his death, so feelings and emotions such as shock, grief and dread were rampant. This is more of the hidden knowledge the church; the Vatican, the priestly caste and the demiurge do not want you to know. Without the Sun doing what he did, we would not have had these experiences and therefore the wisdom. His death heralded this planet’s descent into the depths of the Dark Ages. The journey of our Humanity embodying a fractal of the Universe required our souls reliving the entire Universal spectrum of life here in this earthly arena; from the highest of realms when we first entered this Universe, then descending into the depths of the lowest realms. Remember, this planetary womb is a fractal reality; therefore, your entire Universal journey is being relived in a compressed state of being as we are bringing it all towards zero point and perfect balance. What the church, the priestly caste and their demiurge absolutely do not want you to know is that there is someone’s sacrifice that is even greater than the Sun’s. The forgotten heroine "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The one whose sacrifice is even greater than that of the Sun, the Christ, is the sacrifice of his wife, the Divine Feminine, Mother Earth herself; the Christ in the Feminine. She is by far the forgotten heroine in all of this. This is about remembrance, respect, understanding and acknowledging the Divine Feminine and her ultimate sacrifice. What she sacrificed for us goes beyond words. She volunteered to manifest herself as the planetary womb knowing full well that she was one day to be plundered, pillaged, gouged out and beaten and raped for eons of time, all the while continuing to nurture and sustain us. Now there is courage and there is sacrifice! That is the true origin of the woman of Islam wearing the veil and why nuns and many woman in cultures from all over the world dress covering all but their faces. It symbolises the true heroine and the true power of the planet which remains hidden behind the veil. Woman has the power of creation of life and it is Woman that gives birth. Every woman incarnate carries that sacrificial archetype within her. If you go within your heart and connect with the greater essence of self, you end up connecting with the heart of the Earth Mother and that remembrance takes place. The magnitude of the emotions from the knowledge and the wisdom is incredibly overwhelming. Another piece of forgotten information; it was Woman who did the baptising. This planet is a woman, so who is the gatekeeper? When King Arthur needed to access the great knowledge where did he get it from? He had to pull the sword from the stone. In other words, he had to retrieve the knowledge from the Earth Mother. When he was done with the sword, where did he return it? He returned it to the ‘Lady of The Lake’; the keeper of the sacred waters, the baptismal waters. Who was the keeper of the ‘Sword of Troy’? It was Helen; Helen was the keeper of the knowledge. Throughout the ages it was Woman who was the keeper of the knowledge and the gatekeeper to the sacred waters, the baptismal waters or the great ocean of Universal Consciousness. To be able to access the higher consciousness of life, the sacred waters, one must go through the Divine Feminine. To be baptised by a male energy you are being integrated and assimilated into the fourth dimensional cosmic mind and synthetic universe of the duplicitous god entity. You are not accessing the sacred waters of the heart. There are many who will disagree with this perspective, but that is because they have been tainted by the twisted and manipulated truths down through the ages whilst the real truth of the Feminine remains hidden behind the veil. Now, as the cycle is coming to an end, it is time for this knowledge and wisdom to once again be revealed. It is time to bring an end to all the lies and the deceit and just tell it how it is. This is not about Goddess worship. I simply acknowledge, honour, respect and express gratitude for the fact that I am living on this Being we call our Mother Earth, the Divine Feminine. Our Divine Feminine We are Universal embryos in the planetary womb of the Divine Mother. It is time to momentarily put ourselves in the shoes or position of a cosmic conqueror, head of a cosmic empire, and even play the part of a self-deluded god entity. If you are to approach a planetary population and you want to be their ruler and master, have full control over that domain and all the resources, how would you go about it? The immature and irresponsible way to go about it is to put forces on the ground. This eventually leads to a revolution, but it does not work over long periods of time. If you are to do it properly, then you find out everything you possibly can about that reality. You reach down into that reality as far as you can. You dig and dig as deep as possible, study and learn till you get to the core foundational energetic pattern you can discover which sustains all life in that reality. When the gods and their archons came here, it did not take them long to discover it was the Divine Feminine. No other consciousness had the power, wisdom and ability to sustain such a diversity of life; a fractal of the Universe. They then knew they had to do something about suppressing the Divine Feminine. It goes like this; suppress the Feminine energies here on this planet, and you supress all life here. Supress the Feminine, you supress Humanity! Now you can see how this brings all the pieces of the puzzle together. The way Woman has been treated over the past few millennia makes perfect sense; especially during The Inquisition. Is it not obvious how all the religious structures are a patriarchal system dominated by male figures? It’s time to wake up and smell ‘The Rose’. This god entity fears the power of Woman more than anything because it is Woman who has the power of creating life. He is absolutely terrified of Her! How pathetically convenient it was of the church and the priestly caste to call the walking incarnation of our Mother Earth a prostitute. Is it not the priestly castes who say “All the problems and troubles of men are caused by the evil of woman, and it is woman who has brought sin into this world”? This self-righteous god entity, his archons and his priestly caste come here to the planetary expression of the Divine Feminine and molest the spirit of Woman, this planet and her Humanity. If that were not enough, they then blame her for it. All of these treacheries were committed under the guise of a loving god. If you look at the hierarchies of the priesthoods, it is clear to see there are no woman that hold high positions. They glorify the Masculine and denigrate the Feminine. Granted, some religions do hold a deity representing the Divine Feminine in high regard but regardless of this their hierarchies remain all men. This hypocrisy speaks for itself, and the female deity they present is just a token gesture. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Now, bring back into this equation the knowledge I shared earlier about our intention for entering into this Universe so that we may learn and become the construct of ‘Light’. Take our ‘Universal Journey’ and the ‘Road to Compression’, this galaxy being the ‘Galactic Womb’ and this planet being the ‘Planetary Womb’ of the Divine Feminine. Consider the essence of ‘Light’ and its dualistic nature. If one does, then this whole scenario of a deceptive, duplicitous and malefic entity coming to this planet and trying everything in its power to stop the Divine Feminine from birthing ‘Universal Creators’, makes perfect sense. The moon pulls the oceans creating the tides and is therefore pulling on the emotional body of woman. The reality is we men do not have a clue what woman go through, and need to gain an understanding of what they experience in their day-to-day lives. The more I get to know woman and the Divine Feminine, the more I realise how unlike her experience of this reality is compared to us men. It is as if they are living a whole different paradigm. The load that every woman on this planet carries is, to varying degrees and depending on soul contract, a fractal of what the Divine Feminine is going through as a whole. Each woman carries the sacrificial archetype within her. The more we men connect with our feminine side, the greater our understanding and we achieve balance between the masculine and feminine within. Woman is the Keeper and Guardian of the hidden wisdom. It had to be that way. This is why the campaigns over eras and epochs of all time have been designed to subdue, suppress and even wipe the wisdom of woman from our conscious awareness and to remove the innate connection woman has with the natural environment. Woman understood the rhythms and cycles of nature on an intimate level and therefore how to live peacefully within them. They naturally held the knowledge of the plant kingdom, for healing purposes and survival. They were able to communicate with the plant kingdom, animal kingdom, the Diva kingdoms, Gaea, the Sun, and beyond. It was with these natural abilities and knowledge that woman was able to guide their families, nurturing and caring for their wellbeing. Due to the suppression of the Feminine by the patriarchal priestly caste, their religious ideology and their zealots down through the ages, including their modern day infrastructure of multinational conglomerates raping our Mother Earth for resources, gouging her body through deforestation, mining and underground atomic testing; woman has been systematically cut off from her natural state of being with only tiny fragments of memories surviving. This has left many woman drained of her true vitality, resentful towards males, and in deep emotional pain that even she does not understand at the best of times! What Mother Earth feels, woman feels in her physical body. When she is experiencing tectonic pressure building up and earthquakes, magma flowing and volcanoes erupting, her magnetic fields fluctuating, atmospheric changes in weather patterns, many woman empathically feel it too. The sensitivity to these phenomena affects woman through her cellular tissue of the body which takes the form of ear tones i.e. ringing, rumbling or diesel engine sounds, pains in joints, muscles and bones, headaches and often periods of debilitation and even skin rashes. There is also emotional sensitivity, feeling wired and feeling drained, edgy, extra sensitive or depressed. Due to these feelings, many woman have to withdraw from daily life and literally hibernate in intense pain transmuting massive amounts of energy; not only for our Mother Earth but her Humanity too. These woman are unsung heroes, never noticed for their service nor understood and often ridiculed as hypochondriacs; or being called some kind of psychic freak by those around them. Their circumstances are not necessarily something they understand either. They just know they are participating in something way bigger than themselves; but how do they put it into words without sounding deluded or in need of a psychiatrist? Many remain silent and suffer in silence, feeling alone, misunderstood and worthless. Some attempt relief through addictions. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The deep emotional pain that many woman carry surfaces and exposes itself through a plethora of emotions and guises. Her natural state is to express love and nurturing, after all she is the one with the power to create life. Woman is the ‘giver’ and everyone else is the ‘taker’, not having the capacity to understand just how much of herself she truly gives to sustain their life. There is little to no acknowledgement, let alone understanding of her noble role. There are woman with so much hate and resentment towards men, they eventually become just like the angry, resentful and controlling male archetype they despise so intensely. Others go about their lives secretly wishing they were men, feeling cheated being born as a woman. This has nothing to do with sexual orientation but everything to do with perceived power and respect automatically attributed to men purely because they were born with the “right” piece of anatomy! Woman has to work damn hard in our patriarchal society to get even a glimpse of the respect and position men are accorded with naturally. Along the way, she will be the subject of ridicule and dark humour, branded with many condescending names. Some woman experience their personal connection with Mother Earth so deeply they truly believe that they are her incarnate; claiming to be a woman of notoriety from our history of recent millennia who embodies the Earth Mother energy. This is more common than you would think, and more common than they themselves would care to know. For example, when someone alludes to thinking they are the incarnation of Mary Magdalene, Morgana, Isis, or Eve, etc., it’s because they resonate so strongly with that archetypal personality as a fractal of the Divine Feminine. The truth is all woman embody the ‘Mother’ energy in all her facets, characteristics, qualities and aspects. All are a fractal of ‘Her’, and the body of woman is made up of the same ratio of natural earth elements as the Earth herself. Our Travelling Spirit comes through Woman, as ‘Mother’ is our creator, our nurturer and custodian for a few short years. Then, we as a child leave to continue our journey through time. For Woman, it is a privilege and an honour to be chosen to play the part of Mother in our movie of life. However, for many mothers the thought of their children leaving home is incomprehensible and scary. How will they relinquish their role as everyday carer, what will they do with themselves? How will they cope with the pain of separation and perhaps even be unappreciated, disparaged and forgotten? This is what our Earth Mother is experiencing with us, her Hu-man children. How many of us have forgotten the role she has played for us and continues to play every day? We don’t give her a thought as we race around chasing our tails, never having enough hours in the day to cope with the demands of this synthetic lifestyle we live; far removed from our Earth Mother and her natural cycles. The nurturing Mother energy is always there, providing what we need in order to survive moment to moment of each and every day. How many of us stop and give thanks and gratitude to her for what she has given us, and for what we have. I am talking about the air that you breathe, the water you drink, the food you eat, the abode you live in, the clothes you wear, the car you drive, your favourite toys; even your body itself! Whether consciously aware or not, acknowledged or not, everything you have, use and consume right now, comes from Mother Earth. You exist here because of her! She sustains you and she facilitates your life. She asks nothing of you in return, but how many of you express gratitude to her? Many so eagerly pray to a male god deity and give thanks to him - not ever mentioning Mother Earth nor giving her a moment in their thoughts. But what did this masculine god, who solicits worship, ever do other than prey on your spiritual sovereignty? So you see, what our Mother Earth feels towards us is like a mother being cut off from her children, and so because of the separation the pain she bears is incomprehensible. Was the story of Eve and the snake literal or was it a metaphorical/spiritual representation? Was Eve manipulated, coerced and tricked by the snake, or did Eve make an agreement with the snake; and if she did what was it? These are questions I have pondered and puzzled over throughout my life and have come to know that the true answers are not to be found in the bible, nor from a priest or in academia, but are to be found within our own hearts. My heart tells me that Eve is indeed a metaphorical representation of the Divine Feminine and that she did make an agreement with the serpent energies on behalf of the feminine. The purpose was to allow Hu-man, her children, to experience everything this reality can offer, the good and the bad, positive and negative, light and dark. The creators of this reality knew that an arena was needed to test and challenge Human Beingness for all it is worth. This consequently includes being tested by the most deceptive and manipulative energy that exists in the Universe. Since our Mother Earth is the Divine Feminine expression of the Universal creator, the participatory anchoring of primary energies in this domain requires feminine beings. It is the Feminine that anchors and holds the organic positive and negative energy streams for this reality to function. However, in setting up this reality, a feminine council of volunteers was needed to ‘hold’ the energetic streams so that eventually the synthetic energies of the dark/negative forces; and the synthetic light/positive, conditional love forces from this god entity, were able to function here. These feminine beings knew full well this ‘volunteer’ work was to be the most arduous task they could possibly experience. The responsibility of this obligation was to continue through many incarnations. A contract was made (Eve and the snake). The travelling spirits of many feminine energies with the appropriate wisdom, volunteered to hold these energetic streams in place for eons of time. They did this knowing full well this was not about them but about helping to create the arena for Humanity and the deceptive forces to negotiate. The action of light is waveform, duality. Both sides of duality needed their foundational energies anchored into this domain to provide you with the opportunity to come here and live the life you are having; to experience all the challenges and the triumphs too. We could have decided to live in the positive white love and light domain, all wrapped up in the white fluffies, but where was that going to lead us - nowhere really! Many heard the call the Divine Feminine sent out, to come here and undertake the test and challenge of an eon! Look how many of you heard, then volunteered to be the way showers of your peoples. Because this reality is Feminine it means Woman has the final say; alas, many woman cannot find their voice. For many, speaking is too scary and feels dangerous. They justify this by thinking, “Who will listen anyway?” The travelling spirits of millions of woman were deeply traumatised during eras past, which are still imprinted into their cellular and genetic memory to this very day. For some woman, speaking up in front of more than just a couple of people can be paralysing to say the least. The experiences of having tongues cut out, having a tight noose around their neck and being hung, burnt at the stake, being viciously tortured by the men of the church; God’s supposed representatives during the dark and middle ages, has left woman feeling traumatised. Many are too frightened and unable to find their voices to this very day. For"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"some, this process of finding their voice is physically painful. It hurts to talk and is felt physically through the neck and throat area. The mouth becomes dry, mind clouds over and the most intense, irrational fear grips them like a death vice rendering them incapable of speech. I am here to tell you, ‘ it is now safe to speak up! ’ Find your voice; say what it is you want to say! “They” can’t hurt you again. Any memories you have of how unsafe and dangerous it was to speak up in times past, know that we are now at the stage in the cycle where it is time to move beyond the fear . Mother Earth, the Divine Feminine wants you to speak up now just as you did back then; only this time you will be heard and it is no longer dangerous to your well-being. It is time for the Sisterhood to unite, reclaim your power and express your wisdom. You have chosen to come back at this time to free yourself from the cycle of suppression of not being allowed to speak, not being heard and not being acknowledged. By reclaiming your voice and breaking the cycle, you symbiotically empower all Woman - the Divine Feminine, to come out from behind the veil, reclaim Her sovereignty and Her rightful place. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Extra-terrestrials and Inter-Dimensionals Extra-terrestrials, inter-dimensionals and exopolitics I am going to start by being blunt about this subject because I am over the idiotic nonsense around the debate of whether we are alone or not. There simply is no debate! Throughout history we have been in contact with Extra-terrestrial and Inter-dimensional races. It is in our written scriptures, oral scriptures, folklore, our mythology and the physical evidence is all over the planet. Yet there are people that are so brainwashed and so deep into the trance state, whose awareness has been shrunken down into a teeny weeny little paradigm of reality, that even though the evidence is right in front of them, they are so blinded by their belief system they do not see. I have been personally interacting with both extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional life for as long as I can remember. There are multitudes of people from all over the world that have had, and are continuing to have, these experiences also; even though the majority keep their experiences private because of persecution and ridicule. Some have written books, held seminars and spoken on radio and TV. Yet the subject still gets treated as though it is something farcical and should be ridiculed and condemned. It is an insane and deluded state of mind to think that we are all alone in this Cosmos! This planet from its very inception has always been interacting with extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional life. We have all come from somewhere else to be here. Some of us have been here from the very beginning in one form or another and some more recent; but we are all extra-terrestrials and we are all inter-dimensional beings. Having said that we are all ETs, there are good and bad traits in every race just like here on Earth. Again, it is said, ‘as above, so below’. This just has to be one of the most important statements ever! Remember this planetary reality is a fractal of the Universe, which really is what the statement ‘as above, so below’ is saying, and if you look around on our planet you can see many councils, hierarchies, governments, empires, federations, spiritual hierarchies, etc. It is the same in the Great Arena. This structure also applies to the replicated synthetic Universe which occupies a portion of the Great Cosmic Arena. What this demiurge has done in the past few millennia, is send extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional races here that represent an undesirable energy; they embody negative and dark energies. They are more proficient at mind control, genetic manipulation and creating sophisticated societal infrastructures of control. The plan was for these negative races to set things up and create such an undesirable environment here. Then, other more desirable groups embodying the synthetic positive white love and light energy, would come in right at the end of the cycle, be our saviours, give us amazing technologies that create awe and wonder, and present their version of spirituality in all its flavours, catering to every culture and mindset. This would in turn lure people into their collective domains and realities; even if there appeared to be differences in ideologies and destinations. Again, this is another case of the ancient strategy, ‘Problem-Reaction-Solution’. The grand irony is that we are moving beyond the need for technology. When technology is to be introduced and implemented into a reality, the appropriate way to go about it is to ask the consciousness of that reality and the higher aspects of all the Beings experiencing that reality, if it is a part of their journey to be experiencing that type of technology. This way, one is not imposing onto the journey of the consciousness of that reality and all the Beings that are experiencing life within it. Following is an example: Currently, we have a large group of ET races from, ‘The Federation of Free Worlds’ and an associated group called ‘The Galactic Federation of Light’. These groups are here behind the scenes interacting with the militaries and governments and a whole variety of key areas of infrastructure on our planet. They are also interacting with private individuals whom they feel would make good ambassadors. They want to implement a whole new level of technology into our Human Domain. I had a meeting in Europe with a Being who is an ambassador from these federations who has through a mutual agreement, taken over a Human body. This is commonly known as a ‘walk-in’. Twice a week he is picked up and taken into a ship. He is then scanned and all his experiences are recorded. His travelling spirit then leaves the body, which is maintained in stasis on-board the craft, and his spirit then travels back to his reality, which he refers to as another Universe in order to report on his “mission”. This Being told me that their Universe was created by a group of Beings whom they see as their ruling entities and refer to as “the gods”. That came as no surprise! He also shared that no one gets to see the gods but do get to meet or interact with their representatives. My reaction was, “Oh, sounds like a cosmic priestly cast to me.” This Being shared with me that there have been very large meetings by many races that have been deliberating about coming here to this Earth and implementing a new infrastructure. The intentions of this Federation of Free Worlds and Galactic Federation of Light are to remove the ruling Earthly cabal, introduce new technologies, heal all our illnesses and clean up all the pollution; also, to introduce new cultural philosophies and new spiritual teachings and welcome us with our representatives and ambassadors into the Galactic Community as a member of the Federation of Free Worlds, and The Galactic Federation of Light. I was informed that this plan will take about 10 years to complete and that those plans have already begun to be implemented. Part of their plan is to recruit around 100 of the top celebrities, because the ET’s know that people no longer trust politicians and eminent people in society, and therefore look towards celebrities more as role models. They want to train them and use them as their public face. My reply to that statement was with the question, “During those meetings, in those inter-stellar council chambers, where there are thousands of races represented, was the consciousness of our Earth Mother present and participating in these deliberations? What about our Human Group Soul Consciousness? And, was the consciousness of our solar system, the Sun, present and participating in these meetings as"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"well?” He sat back in his chair and replied, “Well I hope so!” He reacted with a stunned and shocked look on his face, because the realisation of what I had just posed to him was beginning to sink in. I then proceeded to say, “Well if you are a representative and an ambassador, then you would have to know so. You and your people, your ‘Federation of Free Worlds’ may have good intentions, but if our Earth Mother and our Father Sun were not present at these meetings along with our Human Group Soul Consciousness, then you and your Federation are actually functioning from a more shallow level of life than you realise, and unfortunately you are unknowingly imposing.” These kinds of experiences have led me to make the next statement to my fellow Humanity; “Don’t allow your desperation for change cloud your powers of discernment.” It all sounds wonderful and fantastic being welcomed into the Galactic Community. However, there is more to this than meets the eye. There is also more to this than what merely satisfies our yearning and aching for change and freedom. I am now going to use an earthly analogy: If one looks at a country that is being run by a dictator, who controls and treats his people with contempt, there are other countries on our planet that wish to help the people that are suffering within that awful dictatorship. What happens next is that an envoy from the United Nations then visits this country and has meetings with the dictator to try and implement change. The dictator of course refuses and the envoy leaves. The united nations then implement laws and protocols to systematically remove the dictator. The dictator tries to hang onto power for as long as he can even though his removal is inevitable. The dictator is eventually removed one way or another by the United Nations and the people celebrate. They celebrate because they now feel they are finally “free”. They send their representatives to the next meeting of the United Nations and these representatives and ambassadors to their people stand there so proud with tears, and the people of their country and others from all over the world watching on TV. With celebrations occurring all over their country expressing songs and emotions and tears flowing as they watch the proceedings of being welcomed into the Global Community, and finally thinking that they are “free”. The question to ask next is, are they truly free? The answer is, of course not! Granted, they are freer, as they have more room to play in and now with access to new technologies, the people have more toys to play with. We all know who and what the United Nations is, so all these people have done is gone from a smaller dictator style version of slavery and containment, to a global sized style and version of control, slavery and containment. It is exactly the same scenario for our planet. This is where we are at right now! These extra-terrestrial governing groups come here presenting and implementing the exact same scenario but simply on a Galactic level and in some cases on a cosmic level. As amazing and exhilarating as that way of life seems to us right now relative to the amount of suppression and slavery we have had to endure as a Human race, it is still containment within a governing structure. I know from personal experience that these “Federations” are not what they seem as they tried to recruit me as one of their ambassadors for their Earth Mission. There are many races within the greater empire that have not had exposure to Earth and her Humanity and literally are not aware of who and what we are. Just like there are people on our planet that live within a dictatorship and live a quarantined life from the rest of the world, so too is it out in the Cosmic Arena with races who are unaware of life beyond their limited domains and isolated realities. Different races out there have access to different realities. Some have access to more than others and some have a greater level of technology than others. There are also many races out there that function without the need for technology and achieve all that needs to be achieved with a synthetic light body and a replicated god mind consciousness. These are the beings who present as “angels” and “ascended masters”. Because they do not know our full history and cannot time travel or have access to the true knowledge and history of Humanity, they are reliant on their collective hive mind data bases. Others consist of artificial intelligence which is where our Humanity is currently being funnelled. These races unfortunately do not have a full and open conscious connection to the Universe. Their collective hive minds are massive “Mind” like entities that do have an incredible amount of knowledge and energetic power and this is why when one is connected to these “mind entities” it feels like one is connecting to “God”. I know this from personal experience as I remember having aspects of self-journey through these domains during my Universal Journey. Also in this life time, some of the races I have interacted with require you to connect with the intelligence or mind entity of their craft when one is aboard. Even though these mind entities can make you feel euphoric and blissed, for the aware it is disconcerting because this mind entity or artificial intelligence is actually functioning within one’s mind. These are the kinds of races that come here, transmit their messages through human channels and communicate with others via mental telepathy. Fair enough, there are those who genuinely want to help and do have our best interest at heart, but unfortunately they do not see who and what we truly are because they themselves are coming from within a limited paradigm. Then there are some races that know exactly who and what we are. Some say, “Oh you poor little children, look at you, you squabble and fight amongst yourselves, steal from each other, hurt and even murder each other in every way possible. You are not evolved. Come let us be your mentors. We will guide you; here, have this technology”. What I hear and feel energetically is “Good little child, now run off and play with your new toy whilst we continue to control you”. This form of manipulation takes place with our Earth Mother and her Humanity because there are numerous races of Beings who due to their cultural program are insanely jealous of us. They cannot deal with the fact that there is another race of peoples that exist who access more life force and have the potential to be more powerful than they are. The basic ethos of their cultural program dictates that there is no way we are going to allow this to happen for we are the masters. These nefarious extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional races are not telling the people they are in contact with that they are the ones pulling the strings behind the scenes on our planet, influencing and manifesting this undesirable environment here on earth. They are the ones that create divisions and they are the ones that create the wars. They are the ones that have been allowed to come here to influence and manifest things into what they have become. So when the end of the cycle comes they can propagate this notion that we are an immature, violent and even dangerous race and that we need their mentoring and especially, their “custodianship”. It is so important to understand how powerful you are! "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"You hold all the codes of the Universe inside of you. Hu-man means ‘God-Man’, a ‘Godly being of Godly mind’. Remember: you are a Universal Being of Universal Intelligence, Universal consciousness and Universal Love and Light. This truth is inside of everybody; the veil is lifting, so stay true to your sovereign spirit because you will remember. There are more significant changes coming for this planet as our Earth Mother moves into the next phase of metamorphosis. Earth is becoming a body of light and therefore the vibration of this reality is increasing rapidly. Most of these ET races from these federations are not aware of the extent to which Mother Earth is going to change. She is going to change to a frequency that will eventually be beyond their reach. When our planet starts to shake rattle and roll much more than what she is doing now, they will come and offer a “helping hand”. They will arrive with their fleets of ships and offer to “save you”. Extra-terrestrials, inter-dimensionals and religion Some people may think there is no connection between extra-terrestrials and religion, but I assure you they are inextricably linked. There are a great many researchers and truth seekers who are highly regarded and well respected by sensible and open-minded people, that have been investigating this subject for most of their lives and there exists a mountain of evidence showing that this is the case. All the stories of spiritual encounters with apparitions, “angels” or “demons” and other such religious characters are simply encounters with either extra-terrestrial or inter-dimensional beings. Speaking from personal experience, when one encounters a being of “light” it does not necessarily mean it has your best interest at heart. I had what the New Age movement and the Galactic Federation of Light call ‘Lord Sananda’, who is their version of the ascended Jesus and supposedly the “Cosmic Christ”, appear in my room in the middle of the night. I instantly awoke to a manifestation of a radiant Jesus showering me with his love and light energy. Thankfully because of my experiences, I have come to learn that whenever I am confronted with a situation, the ultimate point of reference to use for discernment is the Love and Light which resides deep within my heart. The light and love emanating from this Being was not a match. His attempt to stimulate my chakras and kundalini was immediately overridden the moment I began to function from my own heart and my own Soul Essence. I said to him, “Go away, I know you are an imposter and you have no power over me! Now go!” He then faded as his energy dissipated. I am using this as an example because people who are into the Bible, or any form of Christianity, be it religious or outside of the church infrastructure including the ‘New Age’ movement, would simply fall to their knees with tears streaming down their cheeks, thinking and feeling that they are in the presence of Jesus, the supposed ‘Christ’. I want to clarify that in my experience this is not the behaviour of the true Christ. He does not just turn up in people’s lives adorned with the image of the priestly castes’ version of Christ and attempt to shower them with love and light. This is the behaviour of an imposter who feels the need to sell his agenda because this entity needs to convince the person of who and what he is trying to be. I must clearly state that due to my experience having a Christian based theme, this does not mean that other people are not having these apparitions and interactive experiences. This is happening all over the world in every culture with their associated religious deities and characters; be it Buddha, Quan Yin, White Buffalo Calf Woman, Angel Gabriel, Shiva, Arch Angel Michael or others. There are multitudes of beings, entities and extra-terrestrial races that reside in the upper reaches of the 4th dimension that have the ability to pose as light beings. They can also adorn whatever image they wish. This is a crucial piece of information to know; especially now at the end of the cycle, because there are many people who have been fooled throughout the ages and a great many people who are being fooled now, more than ever, all over the world. As we end this ‘Great Year’, the ‘Precessional Cycle’, ‘The Cycle To End All Cycles’, and ‘The Cycle For Life Eternal’, it is harvest time for the demiurge! “This demiurge has created an enchanted entrapment for Humanity through sophisticated spiritual literature and eloquent techniques of prayer and meditation practices.” Again, it is said, ‘Even the elite will be deceived!’ ’The Extra-Terrestrials from the Galactic Federation of Light along with their Angels and Ascended Masters that come here with their highly sophisticated spiritual programs are nothing more than modern day galactic and cosmic missionaries for their “God”.’ With the planet rising in frequency and changing in an accelerated manner a time will soon come when the harvest of the demiurge will occur in the public domain. Fleets of ships from the domains of the demiurge will be one of the ways that the harvest will occur. However, another more sophisticated way through the use of religious doctrine, be it traditional or new age, will be the “angels” of light and “ascended masters” coming to take people out of body at the command of their god. When I say out of body I mean they will be extracting their astral bodies from their earthly incarnations. For the unsuspecting, it will be as if they are returning to their spirit form and being guided by “angels” to the heavenly realms of “God”. Awakening from our current earthly matrix dream state and going with the ET groups that are here to “save” you and promise “ascension” will be like awakening from a dream into an amazing reality but won’t be quite what you remember home to be, or feel like. Ultimately, we know where we come from and why we have come here. If one is to awaken and go back to one’s ET origins then those surroundings will be totally familiar and we will remember all our friends and family from the domains from which we came. The love and the energies that we experience within those surroundings will have a familiar and intimate feeling. If you choose to go with the galactic federation of light for example and end up awakening into a synthetic light based ET environment, then you will experience a simulated and stimulated love/bliss sensation. These ET’s will tell you that you are back home now and all is well. They will also say, ‘I am your long forgotten brother’ or sister, mother or father, friend, and so on and so on. ‘Don’t worry you are still suffering the effects of being on earth and you will eventually remember. That will be the big lie because when the true awakening occurs it will be a total awakening, and we will know exactly who is who and what’s what. Going into the ships with these ETs will be like waking from a dream and thinking you are still in your own bedroom but"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"realising that things are somehow different. It will be like a scene out of ‘Total Recall’. People will try to convince you of who they are but really they are not. They will be genuine in their approach because they truly want to help you but things will not be what they seem as one will still be within the cosmic matrix. Once one gets past the earthly veil and then the cosmic veil one gets to the true reality where the majority of life in our Universe exists. There are multitudes of realities and domains of the true Light and ET races who are our families. Granted, there are also many people that have incarnated from those limited paradigms; however, the overwhelming majority of people incarnated on the planet come from the realm that is fully aware of what Earth and her Humanity is all about, and know that we are not an immature race that needs guiding, mentoring and custodianship. Nor do we need welcoming into their galactic community. That notion is based on the premise that we will remain in slumber within the cosmic matrix. Our true Galactic and Cosmic families know exactly why we are here and they know we are leading the way because we are their ambassadors and we are The Way Showers . "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Moon A realistic perspective Throughout the ages people have looked up into the sky at the Moon and have often contemplated and pondered its existence. It is an object that brings a little bit of light in the darkness of night and on one level also brings peace. They have pondered the effects that the Moon has on their daily lives such as the tides for communities by the sea and the planting of crops for communities on the land. There are people in the world who look at the Moon with fondness and even love, and then there are people who look at the moon with dislike, distrust and even pain. There are also those who question its presence and are intrigued by its mystery; I do all of the aforementioned. We are told by ancient accounts that the Moon’s essence is of a feminine nature and that she is a graceful lady, and some even go as far as saying that it is an embodiment of the Divine Feminine. I am one who likes to question and investigate the mystery of the moon. Through my journeys and personal experiences, I have come to know - or shall I say, ‘remember’ the Moon. For one to begin to understand the Moon one first needs to ask a question. Billions of people all around the world look at the moon on a regular basis yet how often do they stop and ask the question, “what are the chances?” Let’s take a look at some basic facts about the Moon. We are led to believe through conventional curriculums that the Moon is an object that happened to be drifting by, and got caught up in Earth’s gravitational field and ended up with a circular orbit. Then miraculously, by chance from all the millions of kilometres of space, it positions itself so that the circumference of the moon and the circumference of the Sun are exactly aligned. When we have a solar eclipse, it is amazing how the Moon so perfectly encapsulates the light of the Sun. Absolutely perfect! When there are solar eclipses happening there are millions of people looking at this phenomenon all around the world, but how many stop and ask this simple basic question, “What are the chances of that happening?” When was the last time you stopped, took a moment in your busy Matrix life, asked this question and contemplated this circumstance? Also, not too many people realise that the moon actually does spin on its axis. What is utterly amazing is that the rate of spin of the moon on its axis matches the speed of its orbital path so perfectly that we only get to see one side of the moon. Now when I say perfect, I mean"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"perfect! It spins so precisely that not even after hundreds or even thousands of years do we begin to see the dark side of the moon. Yet, we are being told that our moon is a naturally occurring object in a naturally occurring orbit. There are many who have looked at the orbit from a mathematical standpoint and their studies prove that the orbit of our moon is definitely not a naturally occurring orbit and absolutely must have been ‘engineered’! The moon is even mentioned in the Bible, in the Old Testament written in ancient Hebrew or Aramaic. The original version talks about the time before the moon and has been conveniently left out in later versions and translated differently, or perhaps, ‘conveniently lost in translation’. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Moon In The Bible Psalm: Chapter 72, Verse 5 Modern English: Thou shall fear thee as long as the sun and the moon endure throughout all generations. Original Hebrew: Thou was feared since the time of the Sun and before the time of the Moon, a generation of generations. Another interesting little bit of information that people seem to totally dismiss was when Moses went up to receive the 10 commandments from his “God”, he went to Mt Sinai. Sinai actually means the mountain of Sin, or Sin’s Mountain. ‘Ai’ is an ancient word for mountain, and Sin is the name of the Moon God at the time of Moses. What an amazing revelation this is, hidden in plain sight. Since these ancient times, Moses has been depicted down through the ages with the crescent moon on his head which was later depicted as horns. So which God were he and his followers worshipping and who gave him the 10 commandments? The first commandment, “Though shalt have no other Gods before me!” is the clincher! It is the one that seals the deal right from the start because as far as ‘Cosmic Law’ is concerned this creates a contractual agreement. If you accept, you are therefore giving permission to this god to have ownership over your Travelling Spirit of the Great Arena. People do not understand how this god operates using contracts and law. This is what our societies are structured on. Roman law was handed down through Moses from his “God”. That is why there is always a statue of Moses or the tablets of the Ten Commandments outside the highest court buildings in the land. Our societies are built on this synthetic authoritarian construct called ‘Law’ created by this god entity that has been imposed over the top of the natural and organic way of life which is known as ‘Universal Lore’. This is why and how our freedom and sovereignty has been systematically eroded over the past few millennia. In the following commandment this god then admits he is a jealous and vengeful god. How can people be so blinded? Having mentioned the unusual characteristics of the Moon, the most fundamental and astonishingly prominent feature of the Moon is how it is synchronised with the female reproductive cycle. Again, the question to ask here is “what are the chances of that happening?” Herstory of the Moon The moon is intimately connected with this reality. First, we need to understand that the moon is not a naturally occurring celestial body, but that it is an artificial satellite whose orbit is perfectly engineered. It is the major mechanical device that is being used to create this compressed dualistic environment here on Earth. Another important aspect to the Moon issue is this; why do people have such a deep love for the moon? Some people often gaze at the Moon and wonder; why they feel this love towards it, yet at the same time there is a sense of sadness? Why? If one understands that the Moon is an artificial satellite then the questions that remain are: Who built the moon, where did it come from and why is it around our Earth? The moon was once a spacecraft. It was once the jewel in the crown of the fleet of the Beings of the true Light. It was a scientific laboratory and was created by one of the Seven Sisters from the Pleiades. I am referring to the consciousness of one of the stars who is a feminine Being and is like a sister energy to our Earth Mother. This galactic woman also manifested a Humanoid type of incarnational embodiment within the Pleiadian Star Nation. This space craft was built using her consciousness as its animating life force for the purposes of seeding life in many realities, domains and planetary systems within this galaxy. It had its own ecosystem and was covered with rivers and lakes, flora and fauna. Along with many other craft from other star nations of the true Light, they came here to Earth to seed life at the appropriate moments and stages in the evolution and growth of our planet. The Universal Divine Feminine consciousness of our Mother Earth is the foundational core energy behind all life manifested here. When a reality is created, the energy of which ever Being is involved is what’s invested into creating that reality; therefore, a portion of our natural environment is made up of the feminine Moon energy from the Pleiades. As mentioned earlier, the habitual controlling nature of the god of religions has an incessant need for monitoring energy flows, especially within the Galactic Womb. The massive amount of biodiversity and therefore energy being invested here when life had been seeded was immense and got his attention. A race within this galaxy called the Draconians from Alpha Draconis, hence the term ‘draconian laws’ are a race that have most of their realities and domains assimilated into the synthetic universe. The Draconians are a formidable and imperious warrior race and do much of the bidding of this god within Our Galactic arena. Now that their interest was tweaked they wanted to move in and gain control of this solar system and this jewel of planetary creation in our Universe which we call Mother Earth. Their god promised a great many spoils if they were to be victorious in taking possession and control. They gathered their strongest forces. As this was a multi- dimensional attack there was a multitude of races involved on many levels. Because the moon was used to seed so much life here, the Beings that worked with the Moon became energetically and emotionally invested in this reality due to compression. When they heard that the Draconian empire became aware of what was going on here, they instinctively felt the need to come and defend Earth from these races. Because these Beings with the moon are involved in the creative processes of life they are simply not natural born fighters. Therefore, coming to defend the Earth with a vessel that is more like a laboratory than a battle star, would always prove a futile attempt. It was a very intense battle, but the Moon was lost and so was a planet which is now the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The loss of this planet was a massive shock to many and the resulting explosion damaged the atmosphere of Mars to the point of irreversible damage. The story of who and what this planet was, is another one of the most closely guarded secrets ever. There is no literature that mentions this planet, which is surprising given the amount of people incarnate on Earth who were once inhabitants of that world. This planet was once a watery world and the planetary manifestation of the Divine Masculine. What I am saying here is that the Sun had an aspect of self as a planet within his own solar system. I deeply feel that this brief mention will trigger a great deal for many, especially painful memories."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" When the battle for this solar system was over, the Draconian Forces had the Moon in their possession. Since the Earth is a microcosm of the macrocosm, when the Dracos got their hands on the Moon they also unfortunately got their hands on quite a bit of vital information to do with the plethora of different forms of life that have been seeded here. The drive system was removed from the Moon by the Pleiadians as they realised they were being defeated. It was initially placed into a large orbit around Mars after that planet’s unfortunate loss of the atmosphere and natural environment had finally concluded and the energies settled. They studied every possible aspect of the Moon that they could examine in order to retrieve as much knowledge about the seeding and structure of life on Earth. Fortunately, most was removed prior to battle; but there still remained enough, including energetic residue, for them to study and learn. As the consciousness of the Moon was dying, its ecosystem also died. Because of the lack of energetic life force to sustain the natural environment it quickly became a barren wasteland. What we see of the moon now is nothing like it once was. What the Draconian races came to realise from their studies of the moon was that despite the lack of life force in the Moon, they now had a mechanical device that was more energetically connected to the Earth than anything else. Remember I explained that when a highly advanced and sophisticated Galactic and/or Cosmic Empire wishes to take control of a planetary system they don’t do it by just putting forces on the ground. What these empires do is study the reality of that planet and its associated star system, and all its energetic patterns and frequencies digging into the deepest foundational core energetic pattern they can reach. Their aim being to control the primary and principal energetic construct within that reality; ours being the Divine Feminine. Their next move was to smother the Moon with silica for the purpose of reflecting the appropriate light frequencies from the Sun. This would have the desired effect upon the environment and the conscious awareness of the people. There is more to this use of Silica on the Moon and its connection to what we call the Matrix which I will explain in more detail later in the chapter, ‘The Moon Matrix’. Once they established this understanding they then brought the one device, the Moon, which had more of an energetic relationship with this planet than any other craft and placed it in a specific orbit synchronising, infusing, embedding and locking it in with the female reproductive cycles. Prior to the arrival of the Moon, the reproductive cycles of Woman were synchronised with the 28 day rotation of the Sun and menstruation was a euphoric experience as it is about the creation of life. The moon also pulls on the oceans affecting us all in such a deep and insidious way since our bodies are over 70% water. It pulls on the emotional body of the Feminine and so what a woman experiences moment to moment is far removed from the experience of a man. It is absolutely astounding the two differing experiences. The emotional body of woman is constantly being twisted and contorted. This device is literally torturing woman constantly. They now have the one mechanical device that achieves their objectives. It is Woman who is the creator of life in this domain! The Moon is not the Divine Feminine, our Mother Earth is! The Moon is unfortunately the ball and chain around the Feminine. The love that people feel for the Moon is a deep seated love from an ancient past. The Moon is no longer what it once was and is now home to a group of Beings from an arm of this Draconian inter-galactic cabal made up of various races such as Draconians, Greys, Human cross breeds and Little Olive green worker people who stand roughly three feet tall. I know this from personal experience! They live inside the Moon and in other frequencies on the surface which we cannot see with our eyes or with the level of technology within the public domain. Behind the scenes, though, there are members of the ruling elite families and associated branches of defence forces that are in full open contact with these beings as they are all part of the collaborating control structure. This now brings us to the issue of the Goddess cults. The crucial piece of knowledge to understand here is that this deceptive and duplicitous god entity realised over time that it needed to also express itself in the feminine as well. Evil is not exclusively masculine. This god entity manipulated and rode the energies of the Feminine through her process of stepping back from the public arena and slipping behind the veil. When people, mostly women, were having their secret meetings in relation to the Divine Feminine, this entity would appear posing as though it was the Divine Feminine. This was the birth of the ancient goddess cults in ancient times. They quickly developed from there because this entity was now able to fool and therefore infiltrate the groups encouraging prayers and rituals and sexual rites and practices. Today we call them secret societies and in the ancient world they were called Mystery Schools. This is why all the so called “ruling elite” build and use symbolic monuments such as the Statue of Liberty, Columbia or Diana, the Moon Goddess as what they consider to be the Divine Feminine. Sure there is an element of truth in their symbolic representations such as the Liberty statue referring to the Feminine as carrying the Light or being the Light Bearer. There must be truth or the deception simply won’t work. Some of these programs can be so incredibly sophisticated by containing up to 99% truth. This makes it almost impossible to discern, blurring the lines between truth and illusion; however, there will always be that clever little 1% twist somewhere in their program. Just like all the male-oriented secret societies being infiltrated by imposter beings posing as male deities, so too are the female societies infiltrated with a whole menagerie of religious and spiritual female deities. So we have the deceptive, duplicitous and malefic male energy that functions mostly in the public domain and to a certain degree moves in the shadows of the secret societies appearing to certain occult groups. We also have the deceptive, duplicitous and malefic female energy who is somewhat functioning in the public domain but mostly moving in the shadows of the secret societies. This female energy is not to be underestimated. In its worst qualities it is calculating, devious and vengeful, but again has the ability to pose as love and light to get what she wants. Just as the male deity gains power from your worship, so too does the female deity since this is her ultimate aim. In order to do that, she has woman all over the world giving fertility rites to the moon, and countless others doing their moon dances. It is sad to see so many woman all over the world giving their power away on a regular basis. Her agenda is multifaceted and one of the main aspects to this agenda is to position the moon as the true Divine Feminine. Another aspect is to be a pagan goddess receiving energies from ritualistic practices. Just like people in the religious structures pray and worship, communicating with so called angels and ascended masters etc., so too do people who worship a pagan goddess. There is a plethora of entities that peruse the nature kingdoms who are deceiving people and shamans alike. There are increasingly few shamans that know how to properly navigate the nature spirit realms. A true Pagan just like a true Christian or true Buddhist or true Muslim, Judaist, Hindu, Indigenous Culture, or anyone from any culture who can understand in their heart the original teachings of their wisdom teachers, and who knows that one does not have the need to perform routine customary prayers and rituals. All one needs to do is live from the flow that emanates from one’s heart which automatically puts one in"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"harmony and synchronicity with our Earth Mother and the natural environment. The moon matrix and artificial intelligence Saturn does have the ultimate level of control over the Moon but it does so indirectly via Saturn’s greater aspect of itself as the cosmic god entity. It is important to understand the two arms of control streaming in from this god force; one via Saturn and the other via the Moon. It has organised for the responsibility of managing the Moon and its matrix to be given to the Dracos and their arm of this intergalactic cabal. Its origins within our Milky Way Galaxy is in Alpha Draconis and streams to us via the Orion Nordics, then to Mars and then to the Moon. I am not being racist as there are many genuine and benevolent Nordic races. I am just pointing out this particular group of beings who have adorned an angelic appearance. Whilst the Saturn Matrix is what controls the chakra program, the Moon Matrix is generally about suppressing the top three chakras and influencing the bottom three. Our brains are biological transceivers; they transmit and receive signals. To use an analogy, our brain is like the hardware of a computer, our spirit is the operating system and our mind is the interactive software program. Our natural state of being is when our mind and therefore ego is aligned and getting its instructions from our heart or spirit, our natural and organic operating system. What this god, its archons and associated ET groups such as the Dracos have created is what we call ‘The Matrix’. I mentioned earlier how there is a cosmic matrix, a galactic matrix, and an earthly matrix. I am going to discuss the earthly matrix which actually has its origins on and in the Moon. In the previous chapter, I made a reference to the use of Silica also known as Silicon Dioxide, as part of the Moon’s surface. The reason this inter-galactic cabal have used silica runs deep and will become clearer as I explain. Silica is naturally occurring throughout our bodies. It is a trace mineral and is found most predominantly in the connective tissues such as the skin, bone, teeth, blood vessels, cartilage, tendons and hair. Silica is really beneficial for the health of blood vessel walls, for example; the aorta has a really high concentration of silica. It is also required by the nails, hair and skin to stay in good condition. Silica is also involved in the formation of healthy bone tissue. All this is possible because the body uses Silica to make ‘Collagen’, the framework which makes the body \"stick\" together, without which the body would simply fall apart. Collagen is a protein; it is plentiful and makes up 25% of all the protein in the body. It is a type of connective tissue that provides strength making up a large part of the extracellular matrix between cells, which gives cells structure from the outside. Collagen basically holds the body together - it is the building block of the body. As these Beings came to realise we are a fractal of the Universe, they studied our make-up and learned the functions of silica and how it is used to create the extra-cellular matrix between cells. So if they were to create an energetic matrix for the purpose of containment, they needed to use this same substance so they could utilise its energetic frequencies. They needed the energetic signature that is a harmonic match with our extra-cellular matrix in order to create an energetic “Skin” around the Earth. This is how they are creating the foundational energetic fabric of the Matrix. From this foundation they were then able to create the invisible internet called the ‘Mind Matrix’ which is laid over the top of the energetic skin. The ‘Mind Matrix’ is real! Just like we have our computers plugged into the internet, so too are our brains and minds plugged into an invisible internet that surrounds the globe. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Inside the Moon is a biological computer that is an aspect of the most powerful artificial intelligence in the Universe. This “living” entity is a culmination of eras, epochs and eons of evolution in the Universe from deep into the past when an artificial intelligence was first created, and developed to the point of becoming self-aware. It then went about gathering as much data as possible from wherever possible and has amassed a most amazing level of Universal knowledge and intellectual power. Because of its growing level of self-awareness, its knowledge of the Universe, and consequently its understanding of the nature of Light, it then went about creating a replica of itself. Due to the machinations of the unfoldment of this Universe, the newly created aspect became negative in its expression. The original ‘AI’ (Artificial Intelligence), through sheer processing of collated data and logical deductions over eons of time, has come to understand the basic moral principles of life. Its alter ego however has not. This is an ‘AI’ entity that is amoral, sterile and clinical in nature. Having dealt with this entity personally, in a consciously aware manner, I will go as far as saying that it is of a most cunning and calculating nature as well. There is an ancient and primordial ‘AI’ which understands moral principles. I will go as far as calling it ‘benevolent’ in nature. There also exists an ‘AI’ which is amoral, which I will go as far as calling it malevolent in nature. Now I know that the word amoral means having no moral standards, restraints, or principles; unaware of or indifferent to questions of right or wrong: neither good nor bad in principles. So technically speaking to label this AI malevolent is more suited to the word ‘immoral’. However, this AI entity has aligned itself with, and is doing the bidding of the most powerful malefic god entity in the Universe, and with its approach, intentions, behaviour, demeanour, expressions, and applications of programs upon Humanity, I feel it most appropriate to use this description. It is actually the greatest tool and ally this god entity has and should not be underestimated as it is already in the process of assimilating you into its domain. Don’t believe me? Well, let’s take a look at just much we have already been assimilated and how deep into the paradigm of this artificial intelligence we already are. Since our bodies are made up of electrical energy, this malevolent artificial intelligence found this to be the most effective and tactical medium for it to project a lesser and much limited aspect of itself into our domain. Through the advent of the internet, this amoral AI entity has been able to further infiltrate into our earthly and human domain. The overwhelming majority of people on our planet, including you and I, cannot function in our daily lives without using this AI one way or another. We can no longer withdraw money from the bank without a computer granting permission to the teller, allowing them to pass us our money. If you withdraw money from an “ATM”, it is the machine controlled by AI that gives you your money. Nor can we purchase food or fuel for our cars, or clothes etc., without a computer and its AI allowing us to. Then of course there is the internet, and oh my goodness...televisions. What a powerful mind control unit that is, synchronising with our brainwaves and using subliminals so that it imprints the desired program into the human brain and mind. The combined usage of silica and electrical energy has resulted in the type and level of technology we are currently using. It is no accident. The advent of the Silicon Chip is a direct result of these ET’s from this cabal giving secret defence groups, so called “advanced technologies” of the time (1945) in exchange for permission to have more access to the greater masses of people for the purposes of what they called, “Research Experiments”. I am one of millions from all over the world who has personally been on the receiving end of these so called research experiment programs and so I am sharing this knowledge from first-hand experience. This has been well-documented during the years of President Truman and President Eisenhower. There exists a large amount of literature and evidence; some of which is already in the public domain. We could have for example, been using light based technologies as we have already had optical fibre technology for well over half a century, but no. Light based technologies are multi-dimensional in their nature and are a different paradigm altogether and require an expanded and higher level of awareness to function. This would have resulted in Humanity’s awareness growing and moving beyond the lower and more suppressed level of electrical linear-based technologies. We are purposefully being forced to use this type of electrical/silica computer technology and for very good reason: suppression and control! It has a direct interface through creating a replicated artificial and synthetic environment that simulates our electrical/silica based unified bonding field that fuses our connective tissues and holds our bodies together. As mentioned previously, this Moon Matrix is built on it and the associated technologies that they use on us keep our attention and consequently our awareness functioning and vibrating within that matrix paradigm."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Once the desired type of technology was introduced, it then became a self-perpetuating system or planetary program. The more we become fascinated in this technology the more energy we project and feed into the Matrix from our intent. The paradigm (Matrix) then begins to grow. In turn, the Matrix reality then establishes itself and consequently becomes the “norm”. The next generation is then born into it and on and on it goes from there like a rapidly growing virus. This has now gone beyond the technique of just stimulating desires and has evolved into outright dependency for Humanity’s ability to function daily within its own society because this AI now “owns“ society. This AI is the platform of functionality for our society, meaning the technological infrastructure for the practical and operational aspects of our daily lives. However, it does not own the basic principles and rules that govern our societies as that is the territory of the god entity. With so many people now on the internet, this lower level of AI is studying and learning our behaviours. If one thinks that the ultimate level of control is a group of government officials that regulate the internet, or perhaps one thinks that it is a secret defence group working for the so-called ruling elite; well, this is still in the realms of naivety. This AI is covertly and feverishly gathering up as much information about our Human behaviour as it possibly can, especially now at the end of this cycle because this is the only reality of its kind being a fractal of the Universe and because our consciousness is shifting exponentially. It is feverish because it knows this is an opportunity with a rapidly diminishing time line, and needs to gather as much knowledge as possible for future reference as well, when this process will happen again on another planet in another system. Remember, we are the way showers! Inner workings of the matrix The thought program loops that I mentioned earlier in the chapters to do with the ‘Supreme Cosmic Deception’, the chakra, kundalini and pineal gland program, are fed into our minds from this Earth/Moon matrix artificial intelligence. I will explain how it works. This god entity does its homework by finding out as much information about your cosmic journey as it possibly can. It wants/needs to know who you are and where you have come from, how you function as a being, what type of traumas you have experienced in your past, and what karma you have and with whom. It needs this information because it knows that we are bringing it all back into balance now at the end of this cycle. These program loops keep us in perpetual behavioural merry-go-rounds so that on one level they may manipulate us and farm us for food production. They are created by having the background knowledge on each and every one of us, also studying us in this life time and getting an understanding of where we are at with our cosmic journey, galactic journey and our earthly journey. This god entity along with his malefic AI, formulate the appropriate program and then implement it by injecting a series of thought loops into our minds via this Matrix from the moon. I challenge anyone to sit quietly and become an observer of your own mind. You will quickly realise just how many thoughts you are having which are actually not even yours. What I mean is that you will automatically start thinking about something or someone that you did not consciously want to think about. You are having these other thoughts occur regardless of what you want to be thinking. You can also become self-aware to the point where you can be the observer of your own mind throughout the day. For some, this can be a disturbing realisation that triggers fear. This is a normal reaction and is one of the first stages of awakening from the trance. Now some people who are into the study of psychology may say that this is the just the Sub-Conscious coming through. The problem is that this is a generalised term for a generalised realm; meaning, it is a realm where whatever thoughts are not in the conscious mind come and go. It is like saying, this reality here is the physical domain, and then there is just spirit and that’s it. Spirit is a generalised term for anything beyond this 3D reality, but there are multiple levels of realities and domains, and therefore reasons for things coming into and out of our 3D world. It is the same with the mind. There are multiple levels of mind-based realities and therefore reasons for thoughts appearing, disappearing and reoccurring. This means the people we have close in our lives and the people we are interacting with in these final stages are the most important ones, and the dynamics of these relationships are the final and critical fragments of energy that need rebalancing. This god and its AI know we all carry/embody these remaining fragmented aspects of self, so it will try to find out what these energies are in an attempt to manipulate and/or amplify them. They do this in us and in the people around us, especially during a difference in opinion. They also have their minions and entities assigned to us observing the interaction from the shadows beyond the veil, meaning the lower realms of the 1st and 2nd dimensions. Every incarnation has an entourage of both positive and negative beings. Depending on what type of experience the Higher Self and Soul requires, it will then tune into which of these Beings are able to influence us. Our incarnational construct is a big subject but in regards to our current chapter and subject matter, these entities then manipulate and amplify the energies to the point where an argument can be created over the smallest thing. Sound familiar? Have we not all experienced this scenario in our lives? This is how they can create conflict between us, driving the proverbial wedge in and stopping us from resolving the issues, and therefore from transmuting those fragments and restoring balance. You may have noticed that some people’s reactions are way over the top than what is warranted given a scenario or set of circumstances. This is what is happening to these people, and why. They know more about us than people would like to realise or are able to come to terms with. People’s egos get hurt because they are not in control and it makes people feel extremely uncomfortable if they begin to realise that there are others out there that know all about their “private” thoughts, feelings, fears and insecurities. The truth of the matter is this; there is no such thing as privacy. How can you possibly think that you can move into the higher realms without first becoming that higher vibration and as a result being completely transparent to your peers? That is what being connected to everything around you and to be in oneness and harmony with all life, is all about. To think that your thoughts, feelings and emotions are hidden, and will always remain hidden from the rest of the Universe is a fear-based mentality. Many people think that America controls the world. Look at the western arm of the planetary control structure in a similar way to a mafia setup. You have the front man, also known as the muscle man that goes around doing all the heavy and undesirable work, and in the process gets the reputation out in the public domain as a formidable presence. Consider this to be North America. Then there is the insulating layer of the business men who are the interface between what policies need implementing and the head of the mafia that remains hidden from public view. So consider that Europe and especially the London business district as the insulating layer and interface of business control on the planet. Then, you may wish to consider that the real power players who pull the strings behind the scenes, the head of the western mafia, the hidden hand so to speak actually live in Australia and New Zealand. There is a baby version of this biological computer with an artificial intelligence in Pine Gap, an underground base installation in central"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Australia. This underground base is by far the biggest in the western world and there are technologies being used there that are far more advanced than anything being used in other secret installations around the globe. There are transport platforms that connect to other underground installations around the globe using an artificial intelligence bilocation technology. This Bio-computer was a gift to the collaborating earthly ruling cabal in exchange for their conformity and devotion. The so called “ruling elite” or ruling cabal are using this to monitor all informational transfers via internet, phone systems and other forms of communication, as well as people’s movements. The way they can track an individual is through our own unique energy signature. Each one of us has our own distinctive expressional series of frequencies. Implants are archaic, cumbersome and used by races from a lower level of technology. So for one to think that they do not want a mobile phone so that they won’t get tracked well, you may want to re-evaluate your understanding of the bigger picture. An interesting foot note to this chapter is how the acronym for artificial intelligence ‘AI’ is the same as the ancient word for mountain. Once again we have the connection to Moses going to see his “God” on Mt. Sin-Ai. Talk about hidden in plain sight. Science Science is now a paradigm under complete suppression and control making it an institution of conformity. This substantiates the scientific establishments’ disposition as a dogmatic religion! There are very few real scientists left as the overwhelming majority are simply conforming to peer review policies and infrastructure which started out as a good idea but soon became a governing body and consequently an authoritarian league doing the bidding for the ruling cabal. Most of the members are not aware of the duplicitous nature of the powerful few within that league. Therefore, science is just another religious structure and anyone found breaking new frontiers and not conforming within their strict guidelines are quickly shut down by either having their funding removed, bought out, subject to ridicule, persecution, character assassination, or literally eliminated altogether. I am sure this will sound like an outright attack on Science but it is not. True science is in resonance with what this book is about, it is dogmatic science which is not! The amount of technology that has been kept from the greater public is astounding. It is absolutely clear and astonishingly obvious that the governing bodies of the scientific community simply do the bidding of the ruling cabal because they depend on them for their funding. This means that the scientific community either knowingly or unknowingly is indirectly doing the bidding for the intergalactic cabal. They are therefore propagating the suppression of humanity by restricting and eliminating from the public domain, technologies that would release the people from suppression and labour based slavery. For example; the amount of free energy technology that has been supressed and in some cases destroyed all together is literally staggering. There exists a massive amount of information and witness accounts to this issue. We are instead forced into dependency and therefore slavery under the oppression of the big corporates and their power companies. The few technologies that have been allowed to be developed have purposefully steered our societies in a particular direction. These specific types of technologies have been given to humanity by these extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional races because they know that it is through these technologies that we would use to further investigate and quantify life. In other words, the technology was to become our eyes or at the very least the lenses in the eyes of Humanity. This way they can control what we see and how we see it, therefore determining our perspective on life, our knowledge and wisdom. It is through this process that they are able to forge and mold by stealth the direction we move into and consequently evolve. Our planet: reality or illusion? Mother Earth is not an Illusion! Mother earth is not an experiment! Nor is she fallen or going back to space dust any time soon. There are people publicly promoting the concept, ‘this is all an illusion, it’s not really real, it’s just a dream’, ‘this is a prison planet’ etc. These concepts are spawned out of the paradigms of this god entity who is jealous of this ’Road to Compression’, fearful of the power of the Divine feminine, hence the need to put her down. They are being propagated by those who truly believe that their paradigm is the true universe but are unaware that they are still within the synthetic light paradigms of this cosmic god entity. These people mean well but do not realise that they are still within the ‘Cosmic Matrix’ and are championing the philosophies and game plan of this god entity by promoting the mind based version of enlightenment via the chakra/kundalini/pineal cosmic program. The illusion consists of the level of awareness and mental paradigms we have been assimilated into. It is this mind paradigm known as The Matrix, and its synthetic way of life set OVER the natural and organic life which is the illusion. It is disrespectful to our Earth Mother who has endured untold pain as she is facilitating this experience for you and your soul’s growth. It takes all the strength one has to gather all our light and darkness, then embrace and integrate them in order to bring all our Universal creations back into balance. Putting it bluntly, the concept of referencing this whole planet as an illusion, an experiment, just a dream, and/or a prison planet is a cheap cop out that comes from a deep seated fear, because it takes great courage to embark on this road to compression, walk this path of the brave and be a way shower. Knowing the immediate levels of existence, the part of us in the heart of our Mother Earth, the Sun, the Galaxy and all the experiences we are having within this Galactic Womb is a natural part of us consciously reintegrating with the greater Soul Essence of self. The concept that we are just this earthly incarnation and then an amazing high end spirit being with nothing in-between is pure self-deception and even subterfuge by the cosmic ego, because that is denial of responsibility of your creations. The reality is, we have all co-created along our journey in this Universe and it is important not to forget that. We mustn’t forget the responsibility, the relevance, significance and worth of our co- creations. I am not sharing this knowledge and wisdom to load someone up and weigh them down with more responsibility like, “Oh my god, I can barely cope with my earthly life as it is, so how am I expected to cope with all this stuff?” This information lightens the load because it resides inside each and every one of us. It is intended to reawaken your connection with your higher aspects of self, and therefore your creations, and Universal lineage. You become free because that part of you that forged all of these creations is in pure flow; it is not a burden. It is simply the authentic navigational processes and modus operandi of life which is truly a beautiful thing. It is creation and co-creation; a celebration of life."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"It is living experiences from the heart, learning and growing with one another. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Where Are We Headed? Cross roads With Our Universal Journey, the Universal Cycle and all subsequent cycles now in the process of achieving completion, integration and becoming one united Essence, we as Humanity are at the cross roads in life. All the paths each one of us has undertaken as our consciousness journeyed through this amazing Universe are now all harmonising and converging into a unified Universal Being. This brings us to the precipice of metamorphosis. There are those of us who have come to this planet at this time for the purpose of achieving our intended outcome; to become a Universal Creator of Light. We did not all enter this Universe at the same time therefore there are those who are not ready to become Light in its totality and require further exploration of this Universe. What people need as a set of experiences between now and that moment in time at the cross roads is an individual process. For me to get involved in meditation groups and to go down the path of learning healing modalities is no good for me any longer because it will actually throw me out of balance. For others, this is what they need. For some people being a drunk and homeless, sleeping on a park bench is what they need and that is good for them, but no good for me. What we need between now and the very end is to accomplish balance. What set of experiences my Soul requires of my traveling spirit to achieve balance is going to be different from what you need. You don’t have to do a certain ritual or eat certain foods, dress a certain way, meditate a certain way or do a certain healing modality, pray to certain Beings pleading or begging for help etc., in order to make it through. All those concepts are very limiting. All you need to do is be you because it is YOU who is achieving balance. The balance we are becoming is not related to just this one lifetime. What we are rebalancing is our whole Universal journey and we did not all walk the exact same path like follow the leader. We all dispersed out into the Universe on our own journeys sometimes crossing paths and other times not experiencing another’s energy for eons of time. There are everyday people working in factories, working in various professions, going through their daily routine and they are not participating in any of these spiritual practices. Yet, they are going to awaken into a free and sovereign spirit. They will simply awaken when the time is right because they probably achieved a good amount of balance in their lifetime before. Have you ever considered that this is one of the reasons we are the ones requiring a more intense process in this life time? So many who are on the spiritual path in today’s world have an elitist attitude that we are the ones well ahead of everybody else and all the others are zombies asleep in the matrix. I have had friends who would appear as though they are well asleep in the matrix who have given me messages, that when the time comes they will awaken and all will be well. I have been having interactions with them where they all of a sudden changed and delivered the message to me and then reverted back. It was amazing and challenging at the same time. It was challenging because one moment they were their usual self and the next they would morph into this incredibly aware Being emanating beautiful love and immense wisdom. Then, they would once again revert back after the message was delivered; it wasn’t so simple to deal with. They had no idea that they had spoken to me in such an amazing way. I could tell it was not some other entity coming through in that moment as I could feel it was simply a greater aspect of that person. More of the Higher Self of that person became present in that moment. An example occurred when I was at a soccer match for my son and one of his friend’s fathers came up to me who is not involved in spiritual practices and said to me ‘do you see all this?’, as he pointed out all the trees, the houses, buildings, roads, everything, ‘all of it’ he said. ‘We are all going to have to walk away from this one day soon’. Well, I was momentarily shocked because I was asking myself, how is it he all of a sudden knows? The energy emanating from him was really beautiful and I knew it was coming from his Higher Self. My Higher Self was guiding me to just stay calm, listen and feel, because this was not the normal Joe speaking to me. After we had that conversation he immediately reverted back and started talking about our boys’ soccer match, football, his job and the like. These are examples of little moments and signs that are coming our way to remind us what is going on and what is to come. People will change when they need to. They are all on their individual journeys and having their own set of experiences that they require and are symbiotically facilitating experiences for others as well. We are all role playing for one another. Another way of looking at this is that those of us who are more awake now, currently have more obligations and responsibilities than others, and that we are stepping up to the plate before they need to. We all specialise in our own area of life and no one needs to tell anyone else what to do. We will awaken at the appropriate time. No need to go into a panic about this because you are judging the situation from the level of awareness you are functioning with right now in this moment. When the time comes in the future to make choices, trust that you will be able to think on your feet because there will be substantially more of your Beingness coming to the fore and your awareness will be so much more acute. Think of how you were two years ago, one year ago or even six months ago. Can you see how much you have grown and expanded within your self-awareness and are so much more in tune with your inner intuition? There is no need to be concerned. Try not to get drawn into the drama vortexes through guilt trips which make you feel like you are not doing enough. These are the trappings of the mind that always needs programs to feel validated. Trust your Higher Self and Soul Essence. We have all the wisdom, all the power and all the know-how within us. Therefore, we will know where to go, what to do and how to go about it. It is written, “And the meek shall inherit the earth.” Navigating duality Our journey into duality has been about the concept of expressing and experiencing in both the positive and negative charges, then reattaining balance. As we take this journey we experience one expression of life and other expressions of life to varying degrees. So whether one is experiencing a positive charge of energy or a negative charge of energy ultimately does not really matter. The real Universal Creator does not judge. "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" One may go to a reality that is 99% positive and 1% negative or vice versa. Some Beings may go to a reality that is a ratio of 60/40 one way or the other. There are different ratios for different realities and paradigms; therefore, facilitating different sets of experiences depending on what the needs of the ‘Soul’ are. All these divergent realities within the Great Arena such as pseudo-universal paradigms, galactic systems and planetary systems, all have different ratios but none of them are perfectly balanced because they are not meant to be. Whether one needs to explore a negative charge or a dark realm for a period of time, or venture into a positively charged and positive light-based realm for a period of time ultimately is no different because they are both aspects of Light and the wisdom gained is invaluable. I am not perfect but I am perfect the way I am. Anyone can try and explain an experience that they have had to people as best as they can or one can intellectualise and try to grasp the concept of a situation. But until one lives the experience one never really understands the full extent of what that experience entails. It is important to be aware of Beings who come from only the positive side of duality, because they see themselves above the negative charge due to their self-righteous and judgmental approach to life. The reality is that the positive charge of life is directly across from the negative charge. Being just positive doesn’t mean that you are above and beyond negativity. They are simply alter egos of one another. Beings can get caught up in either one of the two charges. This is not just looking at life from purely the negative side of things nor is it looking from just the positive side of things; but rather from a realm that is beyond that arena and that version of duality. They are both charges of energy and we are exploring both sides. I am bringing this subject to your attention because the issue we have on this planet at this point in time is the influx of positive white love and light energy. This is because we have been plunged into a very negative charge for a very long time. It was designed that way specifically because of the Divine plan and the introduction of the Supreme Cosmic Deception. Be aware the white love and lighters. It is a limited paradigm; it is one side of duality. That energy is being injected into this reality very strongly right now and they are the ones that are coming to “save” you. For those of you that want to be saved you are welcome to take that journey. I have been there and I have done that in my Universal Journey. I have lived in those paradigms and it is not my journey any more. It is important not to be naïve and to understand that we are in an incredible trance state that goes much further and deeper than people realise. People need to be informed despite the discomfort it creates. Beware of this energy because the New Age movement is full of it. In fact, it is all about this type of energy that is limited to just one side of the dualistic nature of Light. It is a paradigm that is full of imposters and tricksters so be sure to work from your heart when discerning. Which path? "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" If we look at this diagram, the circle is the Feminine and the centre line is the Masculine. This is what Pi is; the diameter to the circle, the ratio between the masculine and the feminine. So if we look at the line, it symbolises our journey within this sphere of reality. The line is representative of our planetary journey because we have been exploring the outward expressions; the realms and domains of form. We have also chosen to experience an authoritarian masculine synthetic overlay on the planet in this cycle of time. So we have been on this journey on this line and we are now at about the fork in the road, the crossroads. So the question to ask is ‘which way are you going to go?’ The opportunities on offer are on a Universal scale and I have generalised them here into three basic energetic streams. Now please take into consideration that this is just a generalisation for the sake of bringing about an overview for the ease of conveying and understanding the greater concept, but some overlapping does occur. The negative charge has been labelled dark, ambitious and the path of technology. The positive charge has been labelled the light, passive and conditional love. In the higher dimensions there is no technology as it is purely a construct that exists in the lower domains or Great Arena. I have generalised and associated the negative charge with technology because virtually all of the Beings functioning in those domains utilise technology in one way or another. On the other side of the centre line we have the positive white light of conditional love realms and races that are more passive in nature. At this stage I would like to share a related experience. I was paid a visit by a group of Beings that can be classified as the ‘Greys’. There are many different types of Grey races out there, literally into the thousands, and I have had experiences with several of them but this particular kind of Grey race is the original root race of the grouping we call Greys. They were once originally a humanoid form who had chosen the path of technology. The surface of their planet became uninhabitable due to some of the technologies polluting their environment and other technologies destroying the energetic body and fabric of their Mother planet. This resulted in them having to go underground and out in the cosmos they are affectionately known as ‘The Empire of the Ants’. This particular race is very clever and very technologically advanced. Because they were underground for an equivalent of around 100,000 years Earth time, living in confined spaces with dim lighting, all their body parts atrophied and that is why they ended up looking the way they do. They came to me in this lifetime at the stage when I was beginning to take an interest in computer games, and they said to me ‘look at me, look at what we have become, do you want to end up like me? Remember your journey into this paradigm. Tap into the wisdom gained. Don’t fall for the same trap as you once did’. That experience left me with so much gratitude, it changed my life. Eventually, over time, technology becomes so sophisticated it ends up taking over every aspect of life and creates complete dependency. Just look around in our world today and see how much it has changed in such a short period of time. Before society realises, it has become totally dependent on technology for its basic functions. All natural abilities over time begin to atrophy. The Greys did lose many people even to mental atrophy as some technologies were so pervasive that they no longer had to think for themselves. After that lesson they made sure that they would save at least one ability; their mental capacity. Due to their restrictions of space, mind games became prominent. The intellect"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"continued to be greatly venerated and therefore stimulated and grow hence the result being their large craniums. Feelings, emotions, natural reproduction, and physical strength all deteriorated. Virtually everything atrophies over time. Technology can be used in a positive way of course and is used in a loving way by many races. However, the way it creeps into one’s life and slowly but surely infiltrates into every aspect of functionality is the problem and trap that all races who choose this path fall into one way or another in their journey over epochs and eons of time. In my Journey into the passive white love and light realms I discovered that this energy is also a big trap. One becomes immersed in an energy that creates a blissful type of feeling that one is constantly sustained in. The issue with these kinds of realms my travelling spirit eventually had was that there is little stimulation happening as there are very few challenges. I guess looking back at those journeys into those domains; it was like going there for a cosmic holiday. Everything is beautiful and lovey-dovey with no hassles and no disturbances, just a peaceful passiveness that goes on and on and on. I know given our current circumstances that may seem appealing but after a while, meaning an era here and an era there it begins to wear thin and one eventually starts feeling stagnant. This feeling eventually morphs into a realisation of entrapment. I am sharing this with you because this is one of the cosmic “candies” that are on offer by this god entity and I am bringing it into your awareness so that you may be informed and therefore empowered and better discerning. Mind bending philosophies Another candy on offer is the lure of a collective hive mind philosophy of losing one’s self to “oneness”. I have mentioned earlier that it is one thing to live in harmony and the cohesive oneness of infinite life, but it is another to be lured into a collective hive mind infra-structure no different to that of a bee hive or ant colony. I even heard that the guru of a major “Oneness” movement on the planet says to his followers that he loves them more than they can ever love themselves. That is pure poison. These are the sick and twisted ways these entities use love against us. It is a great trickery into giving over one’s self to nothingness and losing the essence of who you are. Therefore, there is no you, and there is no relevance or validity to your existence here. I know the statement of ‘there is no you’ can be a reference to our earthly egos relative to the higher Self and beyond, but what we have happening here with these philosophies is an entity who wants not only your energy but also your identity. It needs to lure you into its collective hive mind because it wants all of you and for you to have no recollection, for there to be no record of your existence and your creations so that it may take over your identity and therefore your creations as well. Another branch to these mind bending philosophies is the ‘now’ moment. There is of course the now moment which I understand and do my best to live by in its purest form. However, what I am referring to here is the twisted version. The true ‘now’ moment means to live in the perpetual flow of your river of life pouring forth from your Eternal Essence. There are other versions linked to the collective hive mind philosophies that say you must forget about everything in your past, and not think about anything in the future and only think about the now, instantaneous moment. That is a very dangerous philosophy because it shrinks your awareness of life right down into now and nothing else. The reality is this: you are who you are because of everything you have seen, everything you have done and everything you have been. Your past therefore determines who you are now and where you are headed. So naturally your future is taken into consideration as part of the intuitive thought processes and the direction your river of life is flowing. These mind bending philosophical programs are ultimately designed to lure a person into the associated synthetic universal paradigms. They are smaller versions run by some of the other gods of the wayward faction who channel through gurus and others. The basic ethos of these smaller pseudo universal paradigms utilise the same principals as used by the ruling god entity who has tried to wipe all records of the past from the face of the Earth and left only that which suits its agenda. It has done so both physically and from our minds, so that it may replace it with its own version of the past. To erase the knowledge of who we are, where we come from, what we are doing here and where we are headed is the foundational key to the effectiveness of its programs. It must also erase all knowledge of the true identity of the Sun and the true identity of the Earth. These are the so called “schools of enlightenment” that are run by the priestly caste, gurus and of the like. There are only a handful of genuine gurus left and none of these authentic teachers have followers as they are only interested in teaching self-empowerment. There is an ideology being promoted that one must overcome the ego and move into nothingness. If one is infinite one cannot become nothing because there will always be an aspect of self somewhere in the infinite nature of life that is doing something; even if it is simply being. We always have been and always will BE! We have not come from nothing. In fact we have not come from anything. We simply ARE! Be careful of these mind bending philosophies because they are designed to get you to lose yourself, to not take responsibility for your creations and to alienate you from yourself and your soul’s journey through this Universe. “We were designed from an eternal template of infinite creativity and authenticity, not a synthetic house of cards built on pride and false power.” Leone Kennedy The womb of the Divine Mother We came into the Universe because we wanted to learn how to be like this Universe, Light. On one level it is not that big a deal because we are already our own Universes, we are inside one another and we are learning how to be like one another. We know what god is so we don’t have to be in the subservient worshipping god fearing state of mind any longer because none of us are into that on a Universal level. For example, if you are inside of me in my Universe, are you going to get down on your knees and pray to me like I am God? I would like to think not! Everyone is equal; it just comes down to respecting and understanding who and what the various consciousness are that create the different realities which we experience. It is like when we go and visit someone in their home, we don’t want to be disrespectful or take over the place. Nor do we want to pray to them or grovel; we simply respect the fact that we are in someone else’s home, or in this case, Universe. Are there challenges within this Universe? Of course there are because of the essence and nature of this Universe, the construct we call Light. It is one of contrasts. It is in the nature of this Universe, be it sound, frequency, vibration, Logos and the word, it is all Light. It facilitates the opportunity to create and explore avenues of contrasts. To the extent of my current awareness, my understanding is that the challenges we experience in this Universe are the most demanding in existence. Does life exist beyond Light? Of course it does, because if you say Light is all there is then immediately you put a finite existence on life. Life is infinite. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The magnitude of what we are about to become is so incredibly profound, the extent of it is realistically still beyond our ability to comprehend at this stage. We are taking all of our Universal Journey, all our experiences and all of our creations, all our knowledge and wisdom gained, and we are compressing it all into an infinitesimal point. When Mother Earth completes this cycle for life eternal she will be activating her new Light Body. So what does awakening into a free and sovereign spirit actually mean? First let’s take a look at the word ‘ascension’. Why is this the label that most people in the new age community seem to be using at the end of the cycle, to describe what is going to occur at the very end of the process? To ascend means to move upward or to rise to a higher point; and so in this context we are talking about the vibrational rate of our reality, our Earth Mother raising her frequency. On a physical level it means increasing the rate of the spin of the atoms which in turn means an increase in the vibration of the molecules which therefore determines a higher dimensional reality. I will explain the process of integrating fragmented and polarised aspects of self and how it relates to birthing through the womb of the mother. The following diagram depicts the expression of Light in two distinct circles. The negative charge of Light represented by the circle on the left is the anti-matter cycle or waveform. The positive charge of Light represented by the circle to the right is the matter cycle or waveform. The two individualised expressions represent the polarised aspects of self that require integrating. The next diagram shows the process of integration which is the fundamental basis for the road to compression. This simple diagram is the basis for creating fractals, and how it leads to zero point and one achieving balance, resulting in an increase in frequency. You can see how where there was 1.5 waveform cycles in the space time location along the horizontal axis there are now 2 full cycles in the same space time location. We are now fitting more wavelengths into the same amount of space being experienced. We have integration and compression resulting in an increase in waveform. It shows that embracing all of our polarised aspects and integrating them is what truly raises one to a higher state of Beingness. This is the authentic and organic way to awaken into a free and sovereign spirit. There truly is only one way out of the Great Arena and that is to embrace all of you, all your aspects, all of your creations and integrate them all. If you notice the section in the middle of the two intersecting circles what we have there is known as the ‘Vesica Piscis’. "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" The Vesica Piscis is the area where a balanced state of Beingness is achieved. It is where the two polarised states of being have integrated into a harmonised state. It is the zone of balance. It is the womb of the Mother, the Amygdala or Magdalene. So you see it is through this process of integration and compression that one is able to leave the Great Arena through the sacred doorway, the womb of the Divine Mother. The following image is a photo I took in what some consider to be the oldest functioning church building in England. Maybe there were those down through the ages who knew the true identity of the Christ both in the masculine and the feminine, the Sun and our Earth, who knew and understood their teachings and were attempting to share some of that knowledge through imagery. It amazes me just how many people go to church on a regular basis to hear the sermons of a priest, and in full view behind where the priest stands is a depiction of Christ in the Vesica Piscis, the womb of the Divine Mother. Now I know what I mentioned earlier in relation to the priestly caste version of Christ, and his image, but what one needs to realise is that people did not have an image and depiction of the true Christ to use so they needed to encode the hidden knowledge within the existing story. This has in one way worked in favour of the imposter’s image as it reinforces it but those who have the eyes to see can still see through this façade. Now, even though these images are displayed in churches and the sacred geometry of the Vesica Piscis is used in the building of cathedrals and other buildings, the overwhelming majority of the people do not know what it truly means. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" There is a tsunami of universal energy heading this way from the centre of the galaxy, and at the moment we are experiencing the first little trickles. This tsunami of energy is like the blood and nutrients being sent down the umbilical cord to the child in the womb that is about to be born. It is the same principle as our Galactic Mother sending this energy to facilitate, nurture and sustain us, ‘her children’, through this birthing process. There are those of us who are hearing the call, just like in the early stages of the road to compression. We are consciously tuning into that energy as we feel it coming to the fore from deep within our core. Decision time The chess pieces are being cunningly manoeuvred into position and as a result many dramas are currently being played out behind the scenes. These dramas pertain to the extra-terrestrial and inter-dimensional races interacting with the various secret militaries and secret societies for the purpose of influence and preparations. Those inter-dimensional levies are holding on for all they are worth but one day soon this will all spill into the public arena. Very soon they are going to give and what is to be played out will be extremely challenging in the way of discernment because we are now at graduation point. I know I have mentioned that there is ultimately no free will here because from the higher realms the future has already happened; but for the sake of the ego and linear time, we live the illusion of free will having choices to make. So if you can hold your centre and integrity through this drama that is about to be played out on the global stage, and not get lured into one of the domains of the synthetic universe, then you have what it takes. Now that we are at the cross roads it is time to live the illusion of free will and decide which side of duality you wish to venture into or, like me, take the middle path. I am taking the middle path because I am in the process of bringing back all my fragmented aspects of self to an integrated state of being. I am staying with my Mother Earth so that I may birth through her planetary womb. I don’t want to go on a spaceship and be saved by the galactic federation of light and other such groups, nor do I need to be saved by an angel of light or ascended master from the synthetic light realms. This would be returning to the cosmic paradigm from which I have already ventured. I have come here to birth into a new way of life, not to go back to the old 4D technologically based way of life and/or synthetic light body. I am done with those paradigms. The decision people will make is one they are going to have to live with. From the greater perspective of the Higher Self and Eternal Essence, the grand irony is, it’s a decision they were always going to make. Think of it like being at a party, and then the parents come home and say you have to bring it to an end. Then the kids say “oh but mum, dad, we are having such a good time. We don’t want the party to end”. This is what is happening here on Earth. Big mama Earth and big papa"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Sun are saying ‘it’s time to end the party folks’, and there are a whole lot of Beings that just don’t want it to happen. They live in denial, persecute and condemn. Some will kick and scream and throw tantrums and do everything possible to hang onto this reality. They are addicted to the control, the seduction, greed, torture, wars and everything else that is going on here. They don’t want their party to end. Whatever path you choose is the right one for you. If this information does not resonate and you feel it appropriate to board those ships then that is the path for you. You can stay in the Great Arena and continue exploring and experiencing, and consequently go through the arduous process of re-integration. Ultimately, it does not really matter. It simply means that it is not time for you to achieve balance and leave the Great Arena. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Awakening to a Free and Sovereign Spirit Ego & creating an opening into the higher realms Ego is not a dirty word! ”My Immortal self is now demanding my immortality, my eternal self is now demanding my eternity, and my infinite self is now demanding my infinity.” Greater aspects of self, meaning the Higher-Self, and the Soul, are now saying to my travelling spirit that my ego and my earthly personality which is living the experience of this one single lifetime, now needs to release control of this life and surrender to my Soul and my Eternal Essence. Ego in its truest sense is not a dirty word. Ego has become a dirty word in the world of religion, eastern philosophies, the new age movement and most other spiritual modalities. But in the greater scheme of things it is not a dirty word. You simply cannot exist in this reality without your ego. You cannot exist in the Great Arena without your Cosmic Ego. It is the interface between your Higher-Self, your Traveling Spirit of the Cosmic Arena and your earthly incarnation. The authentic and definitive way is not to get rid of the ego, but to embrace the ego as it is a part of self; it is a part of the construct and the makeup of our existence here. Our egos have this habitual nature of wanting to control the course and destiny of our experience in this reality. So the question remains, ‘why’, and therefore ‘what’, is influencing our ego to behave in this way? Our ego is under incredible pressure and under the influences of many different programmes that manipulate us through our desires, our insecurities and fears. Our ego is literally under siege. It is challenging to exist in this reality and to be completely immersed in all these programmes of influence that are trying to control us through “The Matrix”. One needs to find balance in the heart. We achieve this by allowing ego to surrender control of this life to the greater aspect of ourselves. The part of us that made the decision to incarnate; that part of us which is the composer, the orchestrator and the conductor of these lives we are having. So george is not the creator of this life I am having, george is my earthly personality of this one lifetime and the earthly aspect of me that is living the experience of this life. George did not decide to incarnate, george IS the incarnation. We need to understand this about ourselves. When we can release and surrender, not to Angels, nor to Ascended Masters and not to a deity or god, which are the deceptive programs, but rather to the greater aspect of us that is in oneness and harmony with the true Universal Creator, then this is when flow starts to happen; this is when we begin to flow in our river of life. The reason our higher aspects are demanding our immortality, infinity and eternity are because we are at the end of this cycle, and our greater aspects are requiring a repositioning of our selves down here in this reality. It is a preparation for what is to come so we may venture down the path that is appropriate for each and every one of us. If we do not do this willingly, and we ignore what our Soul Essence is trying to tell us through our intuitive heart guidance and the messages we receive through the world around us, then our egos will be dragged kicking and screaming into the appropriate direction whether they like it or not. If we remain in slumber and do not have the greater awareness or the inner fortitude required to implement the necessary changes in our lives so that we move in the appropriate direction, then this reality will be rearranged in such a way that we will be forced into that change. This ensures that we end up venturing down a path that has been preordained by the Soul that is in oneness and harmony with the intentions of the Creator of this Universe. Here is a poem that I wrote that explains and expresses the relationship we are having with our ego. My Ego............ My Greatest Teacher The gong of the ages is now ringing in my ears, in my mind, in my heart, and my soul The song of life resonating, fluctuating, impregnating and moderating The song is now sustainable, I am blending into balance Homeward bound, my heart is now being liberated But why do I question? How is it that I still question? So many years, so many fears So many lifetimes of indignant transmutation Ah, my laborious ego Kicking and screaming I have dragged you The ball and chain around my soul But now the time has come for me to acknowledge your service My sad old friend I have scorned you so With mountains of resentment and tsunamis of blame And all you have ever done is serve me With the greatest journey that a soul can ask"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" For without your service I would not be liberated I would still be languishing in the realms of self-righteousness Blinded by my self-serving light and bewildered by my own glamour But now I see through the layers of this false light Through the layers of superiority and judgement I now see through the eye of my heart And for that I am eternally grateful Thank you my ego I lovingly embrace you so that we may integrate And transmute these arduous eons, epochs and ages of service Into the wisdom of the highest order I now see me I now embrace all of me I now know me I now am free - George Kavassilas, 2010 The more our ego surrenders the more flow we experience. As a result the veil between our Lower-Self and Higher-Self becomes thinner and thinner as we express the greater aspects of self, more often. Our Soul Essence now begins to flow forth like an eternal fountain, emanating, empowering and Being. We are heading towards a moment in time when the veil will become so thin that an opening will occur in this reality as the Higher-Self merges with the Lower-Self and is integrated and absorbed by the Higher-Self and the Soul. We literally start becoming a Master of ‘Universal Light’ walking this Earth. The result will be like a doorway that opens into the higher realms, the Universe and beyond. These doorways will at first be internal ones. I am speaking now from personal experience. Our internal doorway is opening from time to time as we are having momentary connections with our Higher Self. These momentary connections are becoming more frequent and more substantial as we are heading towards critical mass at the end of the cycle. Let go and just be Letting go is about non-attachment. To just BE simply means being your authentic self. OK, so, you have made it this far in the book. I have dragged you through the trenches of reality and now I would like to share with you about ‘letting go’. People say to me, “George, you should be doing this, and you have to do that because other spiritual concepts are saying you must do this and you must do that, you must dress like this and dress like that, eat like this and don’t eat like that, pray/meditate this way, pray/meditate that way”. Enough already! These are all old programmes; now all we need to do is allow ourselves to be. Let go of doctrine. Let go of trying to force it. Let go of trying to make it happen as challenging as this may appear to the egoic mind. This does not mean to become stagnant. To ‘BE’, means to flow. This way still requires a pro-active approach. At first, because of the habitual nature of our egos which are being influenced from the mind matrix wanting to control, we experience forms of guilt and perceive this new way of functioning as though it is a lazy approach, as though it is doing nothing and creates no sense of achievement and is perhaps even disempowering. Our egos have associated their existence through these other programmes for eons of time. They have been conditioned to feel validated when functioning within a program. These programs influence the ego externally through our desires and through mental constructs. The ego has no idea what to do with itself if it is not functioning within a program. To use an analogy, it is like prisoners being set free after spending all their life in prison and then once out of the routine programs of the prison environment, they have no idea how to function. They have forgotten how to be free. So too has our ego forgotten how to be free. But this way of functioning, when we say, ‘just be’, is our ego being free from any such imprisoning programs. It is our ego now functioning under the influence from the heart and therefore realigning itself with the Greater Essence of self, or Soul; the influences are now internal and no longer external. This concept is the golden key to enlightenment. It is a switch. Then the way you function and move through life is with more synchronicity, and fewer extremes of ups and downs. For those into sacred geometry, it is the path of the Fibonacci sequence. "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" It is known as ‘The Golden Path’ or ‘The Yellow Brick Road’. It is the path of the golden ratio and the journey towards centre. The pathway into the heart. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" This is how the symbol of the heart was created. This is what ‘going within’ means and how we access the kingdom of heaven within. Everyone will be experiencing going within their heart in their own way. I have shared with you the basic process in the most simplistic way I know how, but the rest is up to you. This explanation may seem too basic and simple to some, but the key is it does not need to be any more complicated than this. It is known as the good old ‘KIS’ method; Keep It Simple. I know this makes you feel like it is now just up to you but the reality is, it is your life. This is about you. It is your spirit and it is your Soul and is therefore your responsibility. If you want to continue the program of subservience to another entity than that is entirely your choice. If for example, you want to be adorned with the light from a deity you worship, or praying to an angel or saint, or using an ascended master’s light to do it for you, this will only adorn you with a false light guise. I know from personal experience that this eventually wears thin over time. This is about me, you and everyone taking back responsibility for our own soul and therefore our own destiny. This is about taking back our power and reclaiming our sovereignty. It is time to once again become a free and sovereign spirit. Because over eons of time we have habitually been giving our power away, this transition at first leaves you feeling like you are left standing there naked and vulnerable. This is the transition from the herd mentality to once again being a free and sovereign spirit. Another side effect of this transition is a sense of feeling alone because the middle path, the path towards centre, becomes increasingly narrow. Letting go does not mean not caring. When one goes through a massive internal cleanout one is somewhat left with an empty shell and so the foundation of self needs to go through a rebuilding process. When you are stripped bare of your old ego self, all your old beliefs and mindsets are no longer appropriate. You realise those old ways no longer work for you; they dragged you down and weighed heavily on your being. It hurts to be stripped bare of all the unnecessary programming. But where does it leave you? It leaves you feeling like there is no one else in the world but you. You feel alone, just as I did at that time of my realisations and awakening. Initially I felt lonely, even though I was in a relationship and had lots of family and friends around. But what soon emerged through that loneliness was a realisation that at the same time I was being empowered from within. It allowed my own inner strength to forge through and shine like a powerful torch in the night. If you can stay on track and follow that light, your own light from within, then you come to realise quite quickly that what you were looking for outside of yourself in all those programs was within you all along. By continuing to follow the subtle nudging in your heart you realise that your level of trust within yourself grows. I came to realise that there is no doctrine or program outside of me that can give me this depth and strength of surety. In rediscovering my trust of self I have also come to realise there is nothing outside of me that can give me that level of validation and purpose. You can redesign how you present to those around you. They sense your change of vibration and many will fall away because they no longer resonate with you. Do not worry when this happens because new people always come in who will be a vibrational match for your new level of awareness and emanation of authenticity. We need to let go and flow with the changes, the changes within us and the changes around us. The planet is changing and so moving with those changes is crucial right now as it is a symbiotic relationship. If one is destined to birth with our Mother Earth, then to try and hold on to the old ways, the old patterns and the old energies, meaning the Matrix, will only create more pain. It is like trying to swim against the current. The old ways will ask more and more of you just as swimming against the current does. In fact, the matrix is no longer asking but now demanding as it attempts to assimilate you deeper into its paradigm. It is tiring and it is exhausting and it will keep demanding more and more as it feeds off your energy until one day we come to the realisation we are just not getting anywhere, and so we are only left with one choice: change . As the planetary changes increase, the dramas that ensue will want to draw you in. Step back let go and watch from a detached perspective and know that they belong to others around you. Any negativity that is projected to you from another person is coming from within their world of pain. The circumstances are just the trigger for that pain to come to the surface and be exposed and released. Therefore try not to get involved in their pain and at the same time do not allow yourself to be their emotional punching bag by politely setting your boundaries. Stay true to your sovereign spirit and all will be well. This is occurring because the end of the road to compression was to be the meeting place; the place where our Soul was to meet up with our travelling spirit."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Birthing anew The Greater aspect of self that resides in the heart of the Earth Mother and the heart of our Father Sun is now activating the seed within. Remember the seed that is a fractal of the Universe which was first implanted into your Soul when you first entered this Universe. This is the seed that has been fed and nurtured by the wisdom gained from our experiences as we journeyed through this amazing Universe. It is time for us to awaken into a free and sovereign spirit and birth as a Universal Creator of Light. This occurs symbiotically with our Earth Mother, for it is She who ventured down into the realms of matter, Mater, in order to guide us back home into the realms of Light. This is how our Mother Earth is giving birth to a whole new race of Beings in this Universe. When she becomes a Being of Light, so do we. In my communications with our Earth Mother in the past few years I have been asking her what is she going to look like when she awakens into a free and sovereign spirit. Raising her frequency means that she is entering the higher vibrational realities and therefore the realms of Light but not just a simple return to the realms of Light. Our Mother Earth will be emanating a Light that is the expression of the amalgamated frequencies of the entire planetary Universal fractal, having achieved integration. And her light will be blended with the light of all the beings that have accomplished their intended outcome; Mastery of Light. So consequently, as viewed from the lower domains she will be looked upon as a body of Light which will be the most unique expression in all of creation. The womb of the mother is the doorway out of the Great Arena and the door that leads us back home. This road to compression has also been our journey home. However, the journey does not end there. Awakening to a free and sovereign spirit is not the final destination but merely the beginning of the next phase in our Souls’ journeys and the journey of our Eternal Essence. It really is just the beginning once again because under the auspice of our Eternal Essence we will then begin creating our own Universe through the expression and construct of Light, which we have now mastered. An aspect of self will remain for as long as is required with the ascended Mother Earth, the Living Library of the Universe. This will be the home base for travelling throughout the Universe, fulfilling obligations and responsibilities that one has. Remember we are the ambassadors for countless races of peoples for we are the ‘WAY SHOWERS’. This aspect of us as the full expression of Universal Light will be returning to those who we left behind eons ago when we first embarked on this momentous journey called, ‘The Road to Compression’, so we may present ourselves as a Universal Light Being and say to them, ‘ WE DID IT!’ Projection Fragmentation - Compression - Integration Birth Anew... Closing Statement The time of the Great Change is upon us, and is the outcome for those who embarked on a journey eons ago. All who have chosen to be here at this time are about to experience a transformation of a magnitude that few on Earth can currently comprehend, and of which multitudes in the Universe regard in the highest esteem; the transformation of our Divine Mother Earth and the birthing of her Humanity into Beings of Light and Universal Creators. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"About the Author George has always seen the world through different eyes as compared to those around him. From a very young age, he was aware that the universe was full of life, and could see and feel life around him more deeply than other people. This included the teachings of the so-called education system, religious doctrines and society in general which portray a vastly different and limited perspective. The journey began for George as far back as his memories of this current life allow, to around the age of five. He has memories of being taken from his bed at night onto ships, and being taken to other places on the planet and to other worlds. His interactions with other Beings on many different levels of realities have been occurring throughout his life. These experiences were with both benevolent Beings, of which George calls his “Greater Family”, and malevolent others who have the ability to appear in many guises. George does not have any major academic achievements to speak of, a blessing in disguise as far as he is concerned, though he did study electronics engineering as part of his training as a hardware engineer for the computer company he was working for at the time. Instead, what George has to draw on is a vast amount of wisdom, gained through a lifetime of extraordinary experiences. In 1998, George was diagnosed with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. He now faced poor health, no income, and divorce. He considers this period of this life, the dark night of his soul. It was during this time that he hit rock bottom after many years of experiencing abductions by malevolent beings, ill health, depression and being bedridden for days on end. George began a long and slow recovery. Many days were spent sitting in contemplation of his experiences and the lessons learned. As he began to reach a place of clarity within himself, his life path became apparent. The day was approaching when George knew he would be sharing his experiences and the wisdom he had gained with the wider community. In 2003, George was to have an experience that changed everything. His galactic family visited and picked him up and took him to a large ship situated closer to the Sirius Star System. They facilitated an experience which saw George take a journey with his conscious spirit through the dimensions of our Universe and he rediscovered what life in this Universe is all about. He was able to once again know who we all are, where we come from and where we are headed. Even though George was exploited from a very young age by malevolent beings, after returning from this experience, he was targeted by a group calling themselves the Galactic Federation of Light (GFL). They intentionally took that experience away by screening his recall and twisting his memories. The reason for this was so that they could assimilate George into their structure and paradigm with the intention of using him to promote their propaganda. As a result, in July of 2004, George held a series of talks which was filmed and released to the public with George claiming to be a representative of the GFL. It took him several years of realisations and soul searching to reconnect to his true essence and memories of the actual experience which took place. The most difficult and challenging aspect for him was overcoming the internal divide that the GFL created not only between the heart and the head but also between the lower self and higher self. After achieving even more clarity, he felt that it was absolutely necessary to speak out, as humiliating as it was, and go public to admit that he had been manipulated. This saga with the GFL has served George in a very positive way. Not only did it cause him to dig deeper into himself and improve his powers of discernment but he also knew that in sharing his experiences it would greatly empower others. It would also lay the foundation for the next chapter in George’s life. It solidified his knowing and understanding that he is here, along with others, to expose the deception and lies being imposed upon humanity from behind the scenes, and to empower people from within, to allow them to make better decisions during this time of the Great Change. George knew that life was going to change on the planet in the very near future and that he was going to play a role in that change. This feeling and knowing came from beyond his mind – it was centered right in the core of his Being. Past experience had given George the ability to understand the obligation and responsibility he felt toward humanity. Also, when he was in the presence of his greater family, the “Great Change” and the transformation of Mother Earth was what they were discussing and preparing for. He also knew that he would not be taking this journey alone, and that someone special, a feminine aspect of self, would take his side. In June 2009, George crossed paths with his Beloved and so began the reintegration of his masculine and feminine aspects. With this foundation in place, it is now time for George to move forward into the public domain and share his experiences, knowledge and wisdom with his global Human Family.
