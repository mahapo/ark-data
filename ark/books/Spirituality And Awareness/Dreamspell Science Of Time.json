Welc ome to this seventh (teaching) day. We are here on Alpha 19 of the Self-Existing O wl Moon, Alpha Releases. Today we have Application and Transformation. This week we have been covering the Dreamspell Science of Time, the Synchronic Order. Today we will have Dreamspell, the Fourth Dimensional Tool Kit -Learning the Parts, Us ing the Tools. So I have a few words to open. The first is to say that a seminary is a place where we learn personal discipline. As you can tell I have been emphasizing the c oncept of personal discipline. There is actually a very good reason for this: unless your individual mind is clear, the collective action won't function. So for this day we also have \"Patience Transforms Conduct,\" and I would like to honor each and every one of you for being here in this present moment. So again we can sit up with our spine erec t and, in your own time, inhale and exhale into the No-Time, feeling y our self-love and your patience. Today, on this Yellow day, we complete t he Output Harmonic, Harmonic 24: Express Intelligence of Radiance. Today, this new day, we have Kin 96, Yellow Overtone Warrior. I empower in order to question Commanding fearlessness I seal the output of intelligence With the overtone tone of radiance I am guided by the power of flowering I am a galactic activation portal, enter me This Galactic Activation Portal is a gateway to galactic consciousness, so it is a strong day for ripening - the Yellow . Today we also have Tone 5. So let's remember, in terms of the Pulsar codes, that this is the Four th Dimension Pulsar, which is the dimension of Time: the Fourth Dimension Pulsar includes: the 1, the 5, the 9 and the 13 Tones. Tone 5 is also the Overtone Tower: it's t he command position. So today we can take command and gather our resources. Then we may continue in the harmonic reading (from the Telektonon Prophecy). I will read the w hole \"Warrior\" section, because this is the one time that this solar seal - the Wa rrior - will occur during the teaching sessions of the Earth Wizard Seminary. \"The Ecstasy of Deliverance.\" \"Because I repose on Telektonon, the mother of all prophecy, mine is the ecstasy of deliverance. With the mind of Non-Ego clasped to the heart of God, I have sent out my"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 2 of 20 message of the Mayan Apocalypse: by relinquishing the calendar of 12 and leaving the prison of mechanized time, God's mercy will come swiftly to you. \"13 Moons, 20 fingers and toes, 13 joints, four limbs, five senses do you already possess. God's knowing and power of move ment are already in you like a mother pregnant with child. \"Why tarry now? When a house is burning, scurrying for your possessions will only cost you your life. This house that is burning is Babylon, the 12:60 way of life, which is now destroying your biosphere and poisoning ever ything about your life. Do not linger now fondling your machines. This is the Day of Judgement. If you can remember, leave this burning house and know that a better way has already been prepared for you: a holy victory march, my seven years of prophecy, Telektonon, the sacred revelation of time. \"The Cube of the Law is awaiting its construc tion through the collective mind, spirit and will of you, o children of the day of truth. Iblis, Satan, the evil one, is none other than your ego clinging to the fatal lures of B abylon. God knows nonetheless exactly what is in your heart. Why not then become an apostle of the holy victory march? The ecstasy of deliverance is meant to be shared by all.\" And then I will also read from the \"D ynamics of Time,\" section 16.5: \"The unconscious pre-organic order of T (E) = Art (domain of potent iality) resulting in the primary projective structur e of the crystal is completed in the curve of ascent where the subliminal post-organic order of T (E) = Art results in the ultimate self-reflective projective structure of the \"soul boat.\" The \"soul boat\" is a radiosonic crystalline projection of the order of time super consciously self-realized.\" So how are we going to come to this self-r ealization? We have a very high-level fourth- dimensional knowledge base that we are moving toward, but each and every one of us is coming out of the 12:60 world of ego. Each one of us again must practice self-love, and remember from the Dreamspell Genesis, that a wedge was placed within ourselves, which really separated ourselves from the fourth dimension and our understanding of the synchronic order. We have been captur ed in our 12:60 third-dimensional ego. In case you didn't really know why you were her e, I just want to remind you again that we are trying to enter into the Dominion of Time, where we surrender our ego to the synchronic order. Now, to do this is a practice. All along I have been speaking of the balance. Every moment, here and now, we have the opportunity to fall off balance. Then we have the opportunity to come back into balance. The best way to establish balance is to surrender to where you are, here and now. In terms of personal discipline, it's very important that you know wher e you are, every moment of the day - and of the night as well. I'd like now, for us to move into t he Dreamspell, \"Learning the Parts, Using the Tools,\" because if you don't use the fourth -dimensional tool kit, there would be no purpose in having that tool kit. So we'll begi n now with our discovery of the tool kit."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 3 of 20 Valum Votan : Thank you very much, Bolon Ik. I would also like to say a few words in honor of Bolon Ik. People don't understand that it was she who found me, and that she had this particular mission to find me. She fulf illed that particular cosmic role in that regard, which in Tibetan words is call ed the Sakyang Wang Mo, which means \"the mother, or the female energy that accompani es the Earth holder.\" She is very simple and ordinary and very profound and cosmic - like the rest of us. But she had that definite function of needing to find me, and so for that I can have nothing but eternal honor and respect for her. In talking about the Dreamspell, I would like to say a little bit about how the Dreamspell came about. I think most everybody has had some contact with the Dreamspell kit. Everybody needs to have one, and that it doesn't just sit on the bookshelf gathering dust. The Dreamspell is actually the first ma jor manifestation of the New Dispensation of Time. When we talk of the New Dispensation of Time, that's not something vague. We actually have particular dates when we can sa y that this \"Dispensation\" actually began. First of all, the Tzolkin spin, or Galactic Spin, goes back to the date Crystal Moon 25 of the Red Resonant Moon year, which in Gregor ian date is June 23, 1987. This day was the day of the Red Magnetic Dragon, and we ar e now in the 18th spin since that date. On that day, Red Magnetic Dragon, my fa ce appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, along with the front-page story on the Harmonic Convergence. We thought that this was a rather interesting syn chronicity, that of all places for this to begin, it began on the financial newspaper of the world, the Wall Street Journal - but this is how God presents His signs. During that first spin we got next to the ac tual beginning of the year count of the New Dispensation of Time–a date that Annibal likes very much–because it was White Galactic Wizard. That was, of course, t he July 26 synchronization date of the year, 1987. This was the kin 34 of that first spin. Then several weeks later we had kin 55 and 56, Electric Eagle and Self-Existing Warrior (which Coco likes; so we have the Self- Existing Warrior, the second day of the Harmonic Convergence, who is doing the translating, and we have the White Galactic Wizard–which marks the beginning of the first year of the New Dispensation of Time–helpi ng the translator; this is why I love the synchronic order ... And we also have Electric Eagle present here with us ... ) So this was the beginning of what we ca ll the New Dispensation of Time. On the day White Galactic Wizard of 1987, Bolon Ik and myself were making a presentation about the Harmonic Convergence at St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico (USA). We had a very, very large audience that evening, and that was the first time that we actually spoke of \"Galactic Culture.\" These were t he very beginning seeds of the work that we are doing now. In the summer of 1988, following the death of my son, Josh, I completed the book Surfers of the Zuvuya. I then had a dr eam where I was in a fourth-dimensional \"shamans' bar:\" everyone was having a lot of fun, and so I was thinking to step in and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 4 of 20 have some fun with the other fourth-dimens ional shamans. But one of them looked at me and said, \"Not yet! There's something you forgot to finish.\" When I woke up from that dream I knew what that was - that wa s the completing of the investigation of the mathematical codes of the Tzolkin. So I began to deepen my investigations. At that point, I wrote something called \"Day by Day The Mayan Way.\" That was incorrect, so it found its way to the waste basket.Then I continued with the mathematical work until I realized that everything could be reduced to the 0-19 code. From reducing it down to the 0-19 code, then I could begin to expand out. Another key point was going to the cerem ony that Hunbatz Men organized at Palenque in the spring of 1989, which was the first time any ceremony had been held at Palenque, probably in centuries - if not in a millennium. Hunbatz Men asked me to give the opening presentation, which I gave, of cour se, on the steps in front of the Temple of the Inscriptions. I don't remember anything I said, but afterwards we stopped and we had a brief meditation, after which Hunbatz Men came to me and asked,: \"What did Pacal Votan tell you in your meditation?\" And I said, \"Well, Pacal Votan came to me and said that he was going to come back, but in a form that everybody on Earth would be able to embody and understand.\" This was a key point for me spiritually. Then we found ourselves going to the Hawaiian Islands in the middle of 1989. God made much space for me, so that I could live for six months there - which was really like living in Heaven on Earth. During this time I worked out many of the mathematical codes and diagrams or graphics that are now in corporated in the Dreamspell. We set to work on another text, which was called \"The Star Craft Operators Manual\" - we found out that Star Craft was actua lly the name of a camper van. Not exactly for that reason, but \"The Star Craft Operators Manual\" also ended up in the waste basket. On the way to sending it to the waste basket, we found our selves in Geneva, Switzerland, where we made the discovery of the 12:60 and 13:20 frequenc ies, in the Museum of Time, on the 26th day of the Overtone Moon of that year , which was the year of the Planetary Seed. This was a very critical moment, and we knew that we were on a very, very new level of scientific and mathematical understanding. Around this time I also had another dream, in which I was informed that I had to completely engage the assistance of Bolon Ik in the decoding of the rest of the mathematics. When we returned from Switzerland, we found ourselves once again in the island of Maui. We were living in a nice little house, quite isolated on the slopes of Mount Haleakala. Here we worked out the final forms of the mathematical codes, which by late spring of 1990, we put together in the form of what we called the \"Green Book.\" Thanks to the son of Bolon Ik, who was going to Ru ssia that summer, he was able to take the Green Book, the mathematical and scientific explanation, and leave that with the Russian Academy of Sciences. But we knew that there had to be a more personally engaging quality to this work, that a scientific mathematical text was not going to be that exciting to many people."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 5 of 20 We had some very interesting experienc es. I had a near-death experience on the day Cosmic Storm, which was still toward t he end of the Planetary Seed year. After that Bolon Ik's mother, Maya, had a heart attack and Bolon Ik had to go back to North America. Then I went and joined her there, and I had another interesting dream–if it's not in airplanes, when you are up high, then it's in dreams, very often (that things come to me). This dream was in two parts; in the fi rst part of this dream I knew that I was in a moment in time maybe some 13,000 years ago. I was with two or three other people who were very familiar to me, and we were doing something very telepathic in the Dreamtime; then as we were getting to the peak of this telepathic experience in the Dreamtime between the several of us ... BOOM! Something happened, and we were in the year 1990. There were the same people, the same karmic configuration of people, but in the forms that I knew them in the present time. I remember that I had to be doing some type of therapy with these people. I had to help them with some therapy so that they could remember what had happened 13,000 years ago, and they were asking me, \"What was this experience that happened?\" A nd I said, \"That was a Dreamspell; that one Dreamspell broke and now we are in another Dreamspell.\" This is how the word came about: I understood that word \"Dreamspell\" to mean any consensus reality. In other words, when two or more people come together, and they have a psychic-telepathic agreement of their r eality, then they enter into a Dreamspell. When we fall in love we are in a very powerfu l Dreamspell, so that when we are here all together now, and we are all falling in love with each other and by falling in love with each other here we are creati ng a Dreamspell. \"Spell\" in English has two meanings, which are kind of connected: A spell can be an enchantment; and spell also refers to a period of time - you are enchanted for a per iod of time. We are dreaming the same dream together; we are dreaming a common dr eam, and that is why we say, \"we want to dream together the highest dream.\" John Lennon says: \"You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.\" We are here to dream the highest dream together, so that we can begin to realize the Galactic Dreamspell. After I had this dream we returned to Hawaii from the mainland. This was in the beginning of the Spectral Moon year, 1990. A very magic period of time opened up for us: what we call the tools of the Dreamspell ki t came from the realm of intuition to the realm of manifestation. This happened in a per iod of three or four moons: the Galactic Compass, the Journey Board, the Oracle Board, the Harmonic Index and finally the Color Cube. This was all completed by the end of year 1990, again with the help of another one of Bolon Ik's children, her daughter Heidi, who was a computer whiz. She put all the colors into the Dreamspell, and put it all on the computer for us. Then we encountered a young designer in Maui, who said: \"I know where I can get that produced for you,\" so by the middle of 1991, ever ything was ready for production and we made our first connection with Teddy Tsang at Interlink Productions in Hong Kong. At different points during this period of ti me I had a contact with what is called the Galactic Federation, which made two import ant communications to me: They said that from now on we had to live without money - this was the only way to test and show that 13:20 time is real; the second was that the Dreamspell was a gift and is not to be sold."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 6 of 20 When we tried to communicate this to people who used to be our friends, naturally we had crossed to the other side of what we ca ll \"the loony bin.\" So this was the beginning of a very interesting period of time, which we'll talk more about next week. I would like to focus on just going through t he parts of the Dreamspell kit once again. First we will start with what we call the Galact ic Compass slipcover, which actually has the purpose of the placement in time. {G raphic: both sides of Galactic Compass slipcover} On the one side we have, of course, the 13 Moon Perpetual Calendar, in which you see in the 13 Moons represented as the 13 tone Wavespell. In the center of this you have the actual schematic of the Perpetual 28-Day calendar, which, of course, is contained in each one of the positions of the 13 tone Wavespell, plus the Green Day, or Day-Out-of-Time. In the four corners y ou also see the four seals of the Gateway Family. These are the seals that synchr onize the Tzolkin with the 13 Moon Calendar and with the Gregorian Calendar. That (13 M oon Calendar) is the purpose, because it says very clearly in the Dreamspell, that until all the Planetary Kin are following the 13 Moon Calendar, telepathic gifts will not be ava ilable; and until we are all established in the 13 Moon Calendar, the problem s on the Earth will not disappear. This was the key point when we made the 13: 20 discovery: the first step is the 13 Moon Calendar, and then the second step is understandi ng the codes of time, the Dreamspell. On the other side (of the Galactic Compa ss slipcover) we have the \"26-year Countdown of Timeship Earth 2013.\" We have the begi nning right here, with the White Galactic Wizard year, which initiates a clockwise reverse Wavespell, where we start with the Cosmic Gate and we end in the Magnetic Gate. It's clockwise and running backwards because we are winding down the 12:60. It's like we are taking the 12:60 and putting it back into its little Pandora's Box where it came from, then closing the lid very tight and burying it very deeply. So you see, now we are finally here at the White Resonant Wizard,and actually this year we are entering the Magnetic Gate (of the reverse Wavespell). This year we are supposed to put everything (12:60) back into this Pandora's box again, which is also why we are here. It's easy for me to think about this and try to do it myself, but if I have 100 or 200 helpers who really know this, then I think we can succeed. We could take maybe 30 of these helpers to put it in t he box, another 30 helpers to stand on the lid while we tie it up, and another 30 helpers to bury it very deeply in the Earth. That should take care of it. So you see that when we get to that point of completing this year, the Magnetic Gate of the reverse Wavespell and the Magnetic Gate of the proper Wavespell, that is hooked together by this green circle here {pointing at the central green point of union of the two Wavespells}. That shows that this is the cr itical moment to go from clockwise 12:60 time to counter-clockwise 13:20 time. This is where we are having a pole reversal; but this is a pole reversal of mind and of time, which is synchronized to a very precise date: the Day-Out-of-Time of this year."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 7 of 20 The Day-Out-of-Time is precisely the point w here we reverse the flow from clockwise to counter-clockwise. This is the day White Res onant Mirror, which is the last day of the current overtone chromatic, and of course t he last day of the 73rd Overtone Chromatic, the Uayeb. So you can see, this is an extremely precise moment in time for this to occur. The information we were talking about the other day regarding the solar sunspot cycle: when the sunspots cycle itself will experienc e its climax– this is precisely timed to the same time when we must be ready to make this reversal. I had known that the sunspot cycle was going to peak sometime in the summer of the year 2000, but I didn't know exactly when. I had been hoping and counting on the fact that it would occur around the Day-Out-of-Tim e. Thanks to Antonio Giacchetti from Italy - before he came here he found a calendar for t he year 2000 in Italy (actually a Catholic calendar), which for some strange reas on or other had coded for every month information on sunspots. Sure enough I looked for the month of July, and there was the information I needed: Towards the end of t he month of July, 2000, there will be an explosion of great intensity on the Sun. The intensity of this explosion will continue for the next several months, after which the new sets of sunspots will form. So everything is in order for us to conduct our experiment so that we can create a situation of psycho- solar fusion. This is the whole purpose of our needing to have discipline - because to conduct this experiment we need a clear mind, no ego, complete identification with the Earth Families, and a 100% belief in the goal of our mission. Now we get back to the Dreamspell. W hen we open up our Dreamspell we find the Harmonic Index, which is a complete mathemat ical explanation of the Tzolkin.{Graphic: Harmonic Index}The Index emphasizes, among other things, the radial matrix by showing the harmonic numbers so you can s ee how they cross over to create pairs. You can see: the Galactic Activation Portals, which are the black dots; the definition of the five Castles; the five Time Cells; t he colors of the Harmonics that code the Time Cells, and the Polar Kin which create the Cl an Chromatics and the Spectral Fractals. I'd like to go into a few more aspects of the mathematics. We have two basic definitions, the Harmonics and the Chromatics. The Harm onics contain; the Chromatics crossover. Five Time Cells, with the power of 4, create 65 Harmonics; and four Clan Chromatics, which have the power of 5, create 52 Chro matics. So we have the 4 and the 5: the power of 4 makes the 65 and the power of 5 makes the 52. When that is expanded, the larger Harmonic is that four Wavespells, wh ich, by the power of 13, create one Castle of 52 kin (4 x 13). In terms of the whole, this gives you the Castle ratio, which is 1:5 (5 Castles make one Harmonic Index, one whole). For the larger Chromatic ratio, which are also called the Spectral Fractals or t he four Galactic Seasons, we have these four galactic seasons of 65 kin each, which gives you a ratio of 1:4 (4 times 65 is 260). So the Harmonic, which is the number 4, creat es a ratio of 1:5; the Chromatic, which is number 5, operates by the ratio of 1:4. This is a very, very key mathematical point in understanding all the different harmonies that are actually contained within the Tzolkin or the Dreamspell. As we know the Castles operate by four Wavespells of 13 kin, while the Galactic Seasons operate in a slightly different manner: we have three cycles of 20"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 8 of 20 days each, and then one five-day cycle; the first cycle of 20 days establishes; the second cycle of 20 days extends; the third cycle of 20 days converts. Yesterday, the day Self-Existing Eagle, was the beginning of the cycle of the Blue Galactic Season. This was the day for attaining form in order to convert. But we were 20 days ahead of ourselves yesterday, so instead of attaining form we spectralized. The spectral day starts the little five-day cycle. So we were 20 days ahead of ourselves yesterday - maybe 20 days from now, when it becomes 11 Eagle, we will have form. That's a little explanation of the seasons . You see how our experience helps us. It doesn't matter what the experience is, you can find a way for it to help you. Also when we look at the Harmonic Index or the Tzol kin, this draws attention again to the four absolute corners, which est ablish the primary occult quartet. In one set of corners we have 1 and 13, which is the whole number code of the movement of Time. Then in the two other corners, the mystic number 7. Ju st remember that when you lay out the 13 whole numbers, 7 is always exactly in the center. So the whole code of the 13:20 with the occult power of 7 is found in these four corners: the 7 and the 13 (pointing at the right upper and lower corners of the Tzolki n) create the 20 of the 13:20; and the 1 and the 7 here (pointing at the left upper and lowe r corners of the Tzolkin) create the 8– which all together give you the 28. So you have the 7, the 13, the 20 and the 28. This is actually very phenomenal information. I was reading a paper yesterday that represented a very advanced investigation of mathematics. I was very happy I read this paper because I realized something very deep - that modern mathematicians and scientists have a type of Holy Grail, which is called the search for the Unified Field Theory. As I was contemplating this and the definitions of the unified field that were presented in this mathematical paper, I burst out laughing: If the Universe is a unified field, why do you need a theory? Whatever theory you have about this unified field, is not going to add or detract from the fact that is already unified. If the universe is not a unified field, any theory about it is not going to change that matter. So with this realization I came back again to the Harm onic Index and the Tzolkin and I was very thankful that the Tzolkin is already a unified field; the universe already is a unified field. It's just our fractured 12:60 minds which hav e institutionally rejected any possibility of God or Divine Order from being a factor in our investigation of nature, which has created this hallucinatory search for a unified field theory. I had a very strong sensation that all the mathematicians and scientists were like dogs chasing there own tails. In the particular mathematical paper I was reading I was also struck by another fact, the profound prevalenc e of the number 7 throughout every single algebraic equation and every description of a ma thematical number grouping or set. Yet not once did the investigator have any awarene ss of this in his paper. It did not occur to him once to see how often the number 7 occurred. For this reason I had another perception: I felt that if you place a large Tz olkin up here in the sky, that actually is like what we have in the diagram of the Law of Time, then through that come all the frequencies that inform everything down to quantum physics. The mathematicians and physicists are wearing very, very thick lenses that maybe are slightly distorted and are very cloudy. Every so often they look up and they might see just a little glimmering of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 9 of 20 the Tzolkin or the seventh column or the number 7 in there ... They just have that, but they can't see what it is. They are on the bottom of the ocean and this is floating on the top. Sometimes when you need to make a revolution you have to have a thorough housecleaning. We have to understand that everything that the science and the mathematics have put forward, once they had decided that God has nothing to do with this, that all of this is just idle play, sophistry, or misleading conjecture. Where we are going in the Timeship, we really don't need any of it. We must make a very fresh start. That is why I hope that communicating the ma thematical basis of the Law of Time, we can appreciate that we are making a very fres h start. We don't have to refer to a unified field theory or to quantum physics. All we have to do is understand the Law of Time. The Galactic Compass is probably the most marv elous of the intuitive inventions of the Dreamspell.{Graphic: back side of Galactic Compass} On the back you have the rings of the tree trunk of time. The tree of time is so large that it only grows one ring every 52 years. So we see we are dealing here with the last five rings of the tree of time, which again create the fractal Tzolkin - because this is 260 years, from 1754 to 2013. We see that the last of these tree rings began in the year 1961 and ended at the time of the Harmonic Convergence. We are into the last half of that tree ring. When we complete this year, we will only have the last quarter, the last 13 years of this tree ring. These 260 years, or these five rings, are a complete fractal of the 260 kin, and also of the 26,000 years. That's why the beginning of this Time of Transformation corresponds precisely to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and the complete acceleration of the 12:60 time to this very moment in which we are living, in which we have hardly more than 13 years to put on the brakes and make way for the Galactic Culture. We may turn this over now. When we are look ing at this side of the Galactic Compass, the other side is just to find your synchr onization date reference points. (Graphic: front side of Galactic Compass} While we have five rings on the one side, on this side we have seven rings. These seven rings actually contain all the orders of time. The green, outermost ring is coded by the ra tio 1:20. That corresponds to the 18 vinals and the 19th vinal date, which is the five-day Uayeb. You'll also see that on the green ring the dates, which are coded every 20 days, go up to the 13th position; then the 14th position goes back to the beginning. Then you have six more sets of dates. That is because from the first date, which synch ronizes with Magnetic Moon One, you have exactly 260 days of the Tzolkin, then you have the Tzolkin return which recurs on the ninth day of the Planetary M oon. Then the next 105 days the Tzolkin repeats. The first 105 days of the Tzolkin of the year are repeat ed in the last 105 days. So that's how we could have Overtone Chromatic 21 be the same as Overtone Chromatic 73. Then the yellow ring, the second ring, is refe rred to as the solar ring. The green ring is the synchronization ring and then we have the solar ring, which also operates by the ratio 1:20. What you are looking at ther e is that for any day you go across in this manner: 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 10, 4, 11, 5, 12, 6, 13, and 7. So you notice that the yellow ring"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 10 of 20 starts with 1 and ends with 7. The last two numbers are 13 and 7. The green ring measures the cyclic dates, and the yellow ri ng translates the 13 Moon cyclic dates into the Tzolkin synchronic dates. Then the third ri ng is your Wavespell ring: it just repeats the numbers 1 to 13. We can then find the cl osest synchronization date (which occurred two days ago) and that was the day Electric Wizard. Remember that for any year the dates on the green ring will be the date that codes the year. For Wizard years the dates on the green ring will always be Wizard. Next year they will all be Storm dates. In that way, if we find that it was 3 Wizard, we can line up the Wavespell ring, then we go back to num ber 1 and see that we are in the Human Wavespell. That's the time that we can play with what we think is free will. The third ring is a 1:1 ratio and the fourth ring is also a 1:1 ratio. In the green ring each position has a value of 20 days; same in the yellow ring. With the white ring and the 20 Solar Seal rings, each position has a value of 1. This is so that you can line up and see what the Galactic Seal is. Beneath the Solar Seal ring is the fifth, Wavespell ring. The sequence in the Wavespell ring is actually the sequence of the circles you see in the Tzolkin, so that you start with the Dragon and you go to the Wizard, Hand, and so on. Here the ratio of eac h of these positions has a value of 1:13, because the Wavespell has 13 kin. Beneath each four Seals is the Castle color; you see that these first four seals are the Wavespells of the Red Castle, and these four are the White Castle, which we are just completing. Then we will be in the Blue Castle . So the sixth ring, the Castle ring is attached to the Wavespell ring. Each of thes e five color positions has a ratio value of 1:52, because each Castle has 52 kin. You can see this in the Harmonic Index (it makes it easier for you) The Wavespell ring also has the system of the guide kin. The daily kin always have guides that follow the sequence of the Wavespell leaders - or, more precisely, the Magnetic Gates. Finally, the innermost ring, the seventh, has a ratio of 1:65. There are four colors there, which correspond to the value of the Galactic Seasons: 4 goes into 260 65 times, so the value there is 1:65. Whenever you line up the arrows of the central ring, whatever day you have, they always create the Earth Family . On the Solar Seal ring it creates the Destiny Kin Family, on the inner ring (the Magnetic Gate ring), which has also the Guides, it creates the Guide Family. So for example, today we see that the Destiny Kin, Overtone Warrior, Cardinal Family, is guided by the Seed, Gateway Family. Now we are going to speak about the Color Cube. We can see that each side of the Color Cube is divided diagonally into two parts . I remember the morning when I woke up and very clearly in my head there was the whole pattern of the Color Cube. It has four key corners: on the bottom side it has the bl ue and the red corner - that is to say the three blue triangles all meet in one corner . On the opposite corner the three red triangles meet. The same is true of the t op: you have one corner that has the three white triangles and the other corner, which has the three yellow triangles, so that you have the two antipode colors, white and ye llow on top, and the two antipode red and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 11 of 20 blue on the bottom. This actually was a very interesting mathematical problem, where, again, the resolution came in a very, very intuitive manner, so that the different sides also demonstrate all the different re lationships of the four colors. We see that in the Harmonic Index and in t he Tzolkin, we are also dealing with a four color system. All four colors have three basic sets of relations to each other–that's why there are three color triangles of each colo r, and twelve possible relations. The problem in my head was how to put that on the c ube and make it absolutely, mathematically logical. That is a meditation in itself: you c an turn it in certain ways, and through optical illusion you can see a tetrahedron or pyramid. Now you can open up your color cube - hey, look what I found when I opened up my color cube: there it is again! (pulling up the rubber model of the brain). Hmmm, this must mean something. This is the cube of creati on that contains everything - including our brain! We open up the color cube and we have on the inside the description of the Galactic Time Atom, showing the four color relations - the white and the yellow, above and below, and the red and the blue which are across from each other. They form what are called the Natural Antipode Relations - antipode because they are opposite from each other. Then you have two other sets of relations, mo ving from red to white (that creates the analog relation), and blue to yellow (creates the other analog relation). You see that in the Time Atom they move in a counter-c lockwise direction, which is the natural movement of the fourth dimension in time - that's why those are the analog relations. The other direction - going from red to ye llow, and from blue to white–describes the occult color relations: the white comes fr om behind the blue and the yellow from behind the red, so as to create the occult set of relations. Then we have the center, the green, and that represents the Fifth Force, which is always the Chromatic. Then when you look inside the color cube you see that again, the inside back and the inside front are the whit e and yellow, just as you see them here, and the inside right and left sides, are the red and blue, as you see them here. On the bottom then, there is the Fifth Force - green. So that is the basis of the Cube. it's called the Galactic Time Atom because of its form. It creates the primary synchronic pulsation of the fifth force, in which everything is actually in simultaneous relationship. When we designed the Color Cube it was to c ontain the little chips, so that you can keep your own solar chips inside. There are two sets of them. Of course, they correspond to the 20 Solar Seals. On the back of each chip you have the code number of each seal– for example I just happen to pick up the Monkey. So on the back you have the code number, which is 11, and the thr ee key words which is the code spell . This one says, \"Monkey Plays Magic.\" Today's code spell is: 'Warrior Questions Intelligence.\" Those three words on the back of each chip create what is called the code spell - that's like your mini-mantra; that's all you need to do to remember yourself. If you can remember these three words, then you have got your code spell working for you. Those then are kept in the Color Cube, and make part of your daily Dreamspell play."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 12 of 20 The Quick Reference Card is just to give you on-site, out-of-glance, what these Solar Seals are. I know many people have got t hem memorized, but if you don't have them memorized, you should have them memorized. And then of course, on the back, all you need to know about fourth-dimensional mathem atics: the 0-19 number code that, as we showed, is a radial code, and is also a hol onomic or a holistic code. We know that one is one dot, two is two dots, or seven is a bar and two dots, or for instance today's number code, 16, three bars plus one dot - so that belongs to the one-dot family, which we describe as the Cardinal Family (we will show later why it is called the Cardinal Family). Then we get to the two boards. The first board that we will deal with is the Oracle Board, and we will also refer to the Oracle Guide, which is on the back of the Harmonic Index. The boards were also very much fun to design because the form of the boards in themselves is information. On the front of the Oracle Board we have what is known as the Galactic Shield Graphic}, which is bas ed on one of the older symbols of the Hunab Ku: the two yin-yang spirals in the center, creating the four sets of little antennae, and the four rays that extend out. So you have the principle of simultaneous alternation, which is the binary principle, which then expands into the four cardinal directions, which are the little antennae; and then the four inte rmediate directions, which are the rays. The ingeniousness of the original design of t he Hunab Ku, the Galactic Shield, is that it is all done with just one line. When I started to draw that myself, I was very happy that when I finally mastered how to do this with one line, and then color one side dark and leave the other side light. That in itself is a very profound stat ement of the nature and the meaning of this form. When I first finally mastered that design and I made that exact version of it {Graphic: black and white vers ion of Hunab Ku} (that was in 1986) - now I notice that thirteen years later I couldn't c ount the number of T-shirts that have this design - that's Galactic Culture. I'm very happy for that. Actually the Galactic Shield was designed even before the Dreamspe ll was created. I also knew that it was important to include the four colors. Finally one day it came up like that, after four hours of working at the computer. It was a very primitive comput er and a very primitive Mac Draw program - but there it is. I am very happy to see thos e two versions everywhere in the world now, because this is the seal of what we call the Galactic Fifth Force or the Galactic Federation. That's the cover of the Oracle Board, and some idea of the history and the meaning of that symbol. Then on the other side we hav e the Planet Holon {Graphic}, which, of course, is the main assignment we have here at the Earth Wizards Seminary: to realize ourselves as the five Earth Families, each Fa mily according to its own group, as well as all the Families interacting to create the Planet Holon. Once we have created the Planet Holon, we actually have to arrive at a point of having complete identification with it, so that in this way we can carry out our ex periment. We were thinking that it might be possible to actually lay out this Planet Hol on, maybe in the field here, not where the spiral is but maybe nearby the healing tepees, in a very large form, possibly with small"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 13 of 20 rocks. Then you can participate in it and study it better. For instance, today we know that we are in the Warrior position. When we first started working with this form of the Planet Holon–when we were working on the Dreamspell in Hawaii–we had a very large platform right behind the house. We painted the design of the Planet Holon on t he platform, and then everyday we had a large crystal which we would move according to the kin position. So today it would be in the Warrior position, then tomorrow in t he Earth position. Then you can follow the pulsations of the Wavespell as it goes along the Planet Holon. But in any case, if you make it a good size, you can see how it is and take your position in it, as you need to. Then when we open up the Oracle Board, on the inside we have a whole geometry of the Pulsar Codes that we talked about {Gr aphic:Wavespell Pulsar Codes}. You can see the fourth-dimensional Pulsar that connects t he first, fifth, ninth and thirteenth positions. Then notice that when you graph this out you are also drawing a tetrahedron. The tetrahedron structure is a very primary geomet rical structure. It's actually the most primary. Then you have the thr ee triangular Pulsars: the first dimension Pulsar, which goes from the second to the sixth to the t enth; that is the Life pulsar; the second dimension Pulsar which goes from the third, to the seventh to the eleventh positions: it is the sense pulsar. Then you have the th ird dimension Pulsar, which connects the fourth, the eigth and the twelfth positions - which is the third-dimensional mind or form Pulsar. So these are the main Pulsars. You can see that the fourth-dimensional Pulsar has its tetrahedral form, and that the other three Pu lsars, that create three dimensions, each have a perfect triangular form. But they a ll interact together, because we are dealing with the synchronic order of time. So they create the pattern that you are seeing there. Now what we don't show there are the Ov ertone Pulsars, although you can find the information on the Overtone Pulsars in the Dreamspell text. There is also a lot of information in the last section of the Arct urus Probe. The Overtone Pulsars are made by the number relations: in other words there is the one-dot Pulsar, that connects the one- dot numbers: 1, 6, 11. The two-dot Over tone, which connects the numbers with two dots: 2, 7, 12; and then the three-dot Over tone Pulsar, which connects the numbers with three dots: 3, 8, 13 and you notice the differenc e in the numbers is always five - which is why it is called \"Overtone.\" Five is the Overtone number. Then you have the two final overtone pulsars, the four-dot numbers which connect the 4 and the 9, and the bar which is the fifth one, connecting the 5 and the 10. These are the two different sets of Pu lsars, and all together they create a great aggregate of relationships in time. Now in the Arcturus Probe it talks about creating what are called \"Pulsar bombs,\" which are the actual activation and connection of the Pulsars as they occur in real time over a Wavespell. Now, so far we have not been able to make any Pulsars bombs, because we haven't had a large enough organization of the kin into Earth Families. Do you underst and where I am going with this? That with the Earth Families that we are creating here, to wards the end of our time, perhaps we can"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 14 of 20 begin to experiment with how the Pulsar bombs might work - because of the interaction of the Earth Families operating over a Wavespe ll in actual time. So that is something to look forward to. Now on the other side you have your Adventur e Wavespell {Graphic}. Again, we see the Wavespell has many different functions. Fo r instance, we have the Planetary Service Wavespell, which actually describes the Thirteen Moon Calendar. We see the Wavespell and the Pulsars describing the ac tual cosmology of Time. Then we have what we call the Adventure Wavespell, and each of the positions of the Wavespell has particular qualities and questions. When they ar e all connected together, they create a total adventure experience. In this Adventure Wavespell you have the Magnetic Gate, which is always where you enter. Then you have three chambers, which hav e different experiences, and also those experiences connect to the pulsars as well. Then you have the two towers. Today, because we are in the fifth tone, we are in Overtone Tower. So through the first four days of the Wavespell we establish a quality of adventure. Then we get to the Overtone Tower where we command how we want to extend that experience. Then after extending the experience we get to the Sola r Tower. From that point we see how we want to manifest and convert this experience, so that when we get to the twelfth position - which we said earlier is the number of physical completeness. This is when we hold the Court of the Kin, to see what was the qua lity of our experience in this Wavespell and to plan the quality of experience that we want to have in the next . Then when we get to the Cosmic Gate that is where we tran scend, before we are magnetized back to the next Magnetic tone one. So that is a little bit on those parts. One thing we can say is basically you use the back side of the Oracle Board to study the front side of the Journey Board, and you use the back side of the Journey Board to study the front side of the Oracle Board. Now we are dealing with the Oracle Board itsel f. We see, as I said, that the very design is information. We are dealing with the Fifth Force, so we have a red, white, blue and a yellow leaf. It is like we took the center of this Color Cube and folded it out, and then in the center is the green. The red leaf of t he Oracle Board corresponds to the First Time Cell; the second, the white leaf, corresponds to the Second Time Cell; the blue leaf corresponds to the Blue Time Cell; and the yellow leaf to the Yellow Time Cell. So you can see: Input, Store, Process, and when you get to the yellow that's where you Output. When you get to the center, that is the Matr ix. In some way the Matrix is the basic pattern of it all. But, you see, everything is in this fractal order; everything goes always from the red to the white to the blue to t he yellow, then to the Green Chromatic Matrix. Then it commences with the red once again. So that's why we say the red initiates, the white refines, the blue transforms, the ye llow ripens, and the green self-regulates. You see there is a tremendous order, and this is called the Fifth Force oracle. In each of these leaves there are again four patterns, and each of the patterns is in the shape of this board. That is why we say the very design of the board is information, and you can"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 15 of 20 really see what \"fractal pattern\" means, bec ause each of the oracles is the same pattern as the board. Each of the leaves always goes : red, white, blue and yellow; and if you look at the center of the oracle pattern, it always follows the same order - red, white, blue, yellow. Today, for instance, this is our Oracle Pattern, which is as I said the Warrior, code number 16, three bars and the one dot. And that pattern shows us all of the relations that we have here. At the right side is a lways the analog relation. It says here that blue and yellow are always analog; is that blue on the right side? (Showing the cube) Then the antipode color should be white, the occult color for that should be red, and the guide is always the same color. Then we can s ee by the code numbers there, we can look them up and we would see that the 6 is the same as the World-Bridger for the antipode; for the analog 3 is the Night; the occult 5 is the Serpent, and the guide, we look up and find out, is Seed - that is also yellow. If we l ook at the seals there are five seals for each color, so it is going to be always one of those five seals, including itself, that is in the guide position. Now, this was probably one of the most am azing mathematical developments in the Dreamspell: Any one of the 20 Seals has it s own number that has a perfect set of relations according to color, and in relati onship to each other within the whole program. For instance, in any analog relation the numbers always add to 19. So you take here your three bars and one dot, add those three dots - that's 19. The difference between what is called the Destiny Kin and the Antipode Kin is always a difference of 10, which is if you take away 2 bars of the Warrior, you will see they are equal to the 6. The sum relationship between the destiny and the occult is 21, no matter which of these you look at - that is an absolutely amazing mathemat ical perfection, and I can't remember how I arrived at it. It just took over my brain, stuffed it in there, and then brought it out! One other mathematical aspect to this is that the analog and the antipode will always add up either to 9 or 29. There are 10 of the oracles where the antipodes and the analogs add up to 9, and there are 10 of the oracles where the analogs and the antipodes add up to 29. So your key number s going across are 9, 19, 29. And your occult number is 21, so this is just a little bit of the demonstration of what are called the Fifth Force oracles, which you should actua lly follow and read every day. These little chips are designed so that you can place them on the Board. For instance I've picked up here the one that has the Star, and you c an see it has a bar and three dots, so we say, \"Where would I find that destiny kin?\" Right there {Showing the position for the Star on the oracle board}. Every day the oracle should be studied, and, as with all these things, it is much more profound than it looks. The beauty of the fourth dimension mathematics is how perfect it is and how deceptively simple. There is one thing we didn't touch on here, and that is the Destiny Castle. The Destiny Castle is based on the fact that there are f our colors and 13 tones. Each of these colors accounts for five Seals or, I should say, it codes five Seals. But it doesn't matter what the Seal is to use the Destiny Castle. For instance Blue Spectral Monkey is going to be in the 11 Spectral position of the Red Cast le. In the Destiny Castle there is only one"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 16 of 20 place where you are going to find a blue Tone 11; it doesn't matter if you are a Blue Spectral Monkey, a Blue Spectral Eagle, Blue Spectral Night - you always find only one position for a blue tone 11. When you go back to the Journey Board, you will find it doesn't matter which blue eleven it is, it is always in a Red Wavespell. {Referring again to Destiny Castle Graphic}That means when I was born, on the date of my birth, it was blue tone 11; when I was one year old it was yellow tone 12, which is Crystal Warrior; when I was two years old, I was Cosmic Dragon; when I returned again to be fifty-two, I was once again in this position {pointing at the spectral Tone position of the first Wavespell of the Destiny Castle} and then when I was 53 I wa s here {showing the 12th tone of the same Wavespell}, when I was 54 I was here {kin 13 of the same, first Wavespell)}, and so on. When I was 3 years old then I went from this position into the next Wavespell, so when I was 3, or 55 years old, I was Magnetic World-Bridger. Now today I know it is my Earth Family day , and it is the Overtone Warrior, which is a yellow five. So I say, \"where is the yellow five?\" and I see that is right there, fifth position yellow Wavespell. Okay? How old was I? Now it is easy to find that out, because, for instance, here is where I was born and here is the exact antipode, which is always going to be the opposite color in the same pos ition, and that means I was 26, which is half of 52. Then 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33! (He counts from his 26th birthday), so this day I was 33 years old or if I want to be old, 85. So every five days you advance five years, until you go around. Actually, you are everyone in your Earth Family; everyone in your Earth Family is you at some time in your life, and this is a very important point: when we say we are all one, we really mean it. What we have found is that following the De stiny Castle is one of the most profound forms of self-therapy, because you go back and you say, \"Hmm, what was I doing when I was 33?\" You can remember certain things - certain things good, certain things bad– and you can deal with it, because you are focused on it for that day. So I can go back and say, \"Hmm that was in the year 1972, \" and I say, \"What was going on then?\" So that was a very, very interesting year. I say, \"What seeds do I see in that year that I am fulfilling now? What problems was I having then? Have I overcome those problems now? How I'm dealing with that?\" And so on lik e that. And I know that then, because it follows a pattern, that five days from now, when it is Planetary Dr agon, that represents five years later. Then I would have to go back and see how I was doing when I was 38. And right now I can tell you I prefer 33. So that is a very, very important point, that every Planetary Kin should actually be following their life. Now in case where you are just a 28-year-old Planetary Kin, for instance, when you come to years that you have not experienced yet, you can use those days to project what that would be t hat year, that Seal and Tone. \"How do I want to set my goals to get there in the right way? \" So this is how to use the Destiny Castle. Remember: Once you are identified in your Earth Family, and you know the different Seals or Tribes in your Earth Family, then you know that every five days you are going to experience one of the years of your life. We've been following the Destiny Castle for"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 17 of 20 quite a few years now, and it never gets boring. We all only live with ourselves, ultimately, so that all we really have to deal with is ourselves. The Destiny Castle is how we can enrich ourselves, so that in all of our relations we become better reflections of each other. Now the Journey Board: it represents the map of Galactic Time. The Oracle Board represents the power of the Fifth Force, t hat is the simultaneous power. The Journey Board actually represents the journey in time . The journey in time is an interplanetary journey, so what you have on the front side of the Journey Board is the Galactic Solar 0- 19 code, where the actual mathematics 0-19 are translated into the movement of the different planets. On the outside you have t he galactic flow, which goes from Pluto to Mercury. Then you have the next flow, that is the solar flow, which goes the other direction out from Mercury on the inside. In other words, each planetary orbit manages two flows; a galactic flow that comes in fr om the galaxy, which is represented by the green circle there, and the solar flow, whic h goes from the Sun, and is represented by the red circle. This is to show the two movements of the two flows. Then you see again that in each set of two or bits are sets of four of the seals or numbers, so you have the same color pattern - red, white, blue, yellow. These sets are grouped into planetary cells: The first cell is the galactic terminal, because that is by the galaxy. The second cell is the Uranus trans fer, like going to the subway station and saying \"Please, I want the Uranus transfer. \" And you get your Uranus transfer ticket; that happens when you get to the Uranus Tr ansfer Cell. Then the central one is the Midway Transfer. Actually when you get here and you say, \"I want the midway transfer,\" and you get the transfer ticket, you go directly to the AA Midway Station. That's because this cell includes the fifth and the sixth planet s, the one's midway between the five inner and the five outer planets, and that's exactl y where you connect with the AA Midway. It's part of the great mystery. A nd then when you get to the third and the fourth planets you get the Earth transfer. You say, \"OK, I'll get off here, I think I'll reincarnate; I'll try to be a Planetary Kin this time. Then if you want to continue you get to the Solar Terminal and you say, \"I need to have a conversation with Kinich Ahau,\" for which you'd better be in your fourth-dimensional body - because it gets hot there. This is a very advanced play, but we will get there. On the other side, which is right here, {Dreamspell Genesis Graphic} we take the journey down to Earth. You notice that bot h the Solar-Galactic 0-19 code (that journey we just took), and this one, which is the Dreamspell Genesis Code, have the same mathematical form, which is called the binary pentad. Pentad means \"five parts'\"and binary means \"two.\" We have again an outer and an inner. We take the outer journey here, and that creates what is called the Dragon Genesis. Each of these positions here represents one Wavespell, but where a Wave spell represents 1,300 years rather than 13 days. So we see that the Dragon Genesis has 10 Wavespells in it, and that means that it lasts 13,000 years. Remember the dream I told you where the Dreamspell came to me: I was some time at the end,13,000 years ago, when somethi ng happened, because when you get to this"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 18 of 20 point, there is a jump to make that takes you from the Dragon Genesis to the Monkey Genesis. And then we start the journey goi ng this way again but on the inside. Then when we complete six Wavespells, we have to make another jump right here to go to the four Wavespells of the Moon Genesis - at this point the famous theft of time occurred. So this is the whole 26,000-year cycl e. We are right here which is represented by the Star, and this represents the last 1, 300 years, approximatel y from the year 713 up until 2013. That's the Dreamspell Genesis, which also has cells. The Genesis cells concentrate radial time. Okay, for instance, where we are right here is in this final cell which includes the previous Wavespell of the Moon Genesis and the last two Wavespells of the Dragon Genesis. So there is a lot to c ontemplate in these–these are radial time cells, which concentrate large fractal sections of time. You can see, for instance, that from the time we are in, we have a lot of karma that is occurring and manifesting on he planet, which takes the last two Wavespells of the Moon Genesis as well as the last two Wavespells of the Dragon Genesis. Then you notice in the center there are the 13 moons and the symbol of the star, which is in th is case, the Shield of Arcturus. It is also interesting that the crescent moon and star are the symbols of Islam, which historically began precisely at the beginning of this last St ar Wavespell. Here, however, the star is in the form of the Shield of Arcturus - becaus e all of this is a program of the Arcturus Dominion. On the top and bottom of the Journey B oard you have the Chromatic Arrangement, where you have four verticals with five units in them; while in the Harmonic Arrangement we have five verticals with four units in them. At the center, you have the Human Holon, because this is the one who is making the journey on the Planet Holon, and is trying to realize himself or herself as the Fifth Force. This should be studied very well so that we can understand all the relati ons. For instance, the four Clans: the Fire Clan, the Blood Clan, the Trut h Clan and the Sky Clan; or the color families, which are the four Root Races. You can study this with the Oracle Board when you study the Fifth Force Oracle, and see which families and which chromatics are in play. Finally we get to the inside. This is what we call a complete map of fourth-dimensional time, the Galactic Spin and the five Castles of Time: the Red Castle on the red leaf, just as we have the Red Time Cell on the Or acle Board; the White Castle which corresponds to the White Time Cell; the Blue Castle to the Blue Time Cell; and the Yellow Castle which corresponds to the Yellow Ti me Cell. Then in the center there is the Green Castle, which corresponds to the Matrix Time Cell. This famous movie Matrix is again like modern science and mathematics it has some glimpses of what is supposed to be, but it ends up creating a totally fantas tic description, which is not quite right. It is true, we are supposed to be in the matrix, but the Galactic Matrix. {Graphic: Dreamspell Journey Board} You can see the whole journey on the Jour ney Board. The Dragon Genesis goes right to the middle, and it's completed by the 13 Dog right here; and then the Monkey Genesis begins right here with Magnetic M onkey. I told you I had a dream about a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rev 10.9-3.18-1 Meditation 7  Page 19 of 20 break at 13,000 years, but also it corres ponds to the experience I had with the death of my son, who was killed on this day {point ing at Kin 129}; was cremated on this day {points at Kin 130}; and then on this day I awoke to be what I am. That corresponds to a point in time 13,000 years ago as well. So we see that the Monkey Genesis has two Wavespells in the Blue Castle and four Wavespells in the Yellow Castle. This is the famous \"lost time,\" the time that we equate with Camelot. When we look at the Journey Board like this,{folds Journey Board into cube form},this is the actual demonstration of radial time. You are dealing with the five sides of the cube, and, you, as the perceiv er, are the sixth side. You are the one who completes the perception of radial time th rough your own experience. And I would like to say one more thing, \"Go Earth Families!\" Bolon Ik: Only to say that in this epic struggle of histor y that we want to really correct it for the Galactic Epic of Free Will, which is all of us in our Earth Families as a way of correction, the way we correct the memory virus. So in our meeting in our Earth Families we cannot underestimate how powerful it will be if we rea lly stay true to the form, because, as it was described, we are all in our Earth Familie s, we all participate in the same positions of the same four Seals and the same 13 Tones. So the Dreamspell speaks of three ways you can become in your Earth Fam ily, the Earth Holon: You must be autonomous, self-organizing and self-synchr onous. And what it means by self- synchronous is to be obedient to the synchronic order. So we all must become more aware of where we are, when we are doing something and why we are doing it, so we are aware within ourselves. Again, as I ment ioned in the beginning, we all actually came to the seminar to learn personal discipline. So we can say the participation in your Eart h Family is obligatory because if you are not in your Earth Family, you are not here. So pl ease establish yourself in your Earth Family for all activities. I made only a brief list of some examples, so that today maybe you can self-organize better, and these are just s uggestions, that you organize small study groups and also organize yourself with what you want to discuss in the groups, whether it is the whole group or small groups. And I th ink after our experience yesterday, the Kali Day, which is the central day between the tw o sets of teachings, we should designate it as a study day. You can study in any form t hat you decide within your group, so that in that Kali day we don't do extra activities. T hose activities can be performed by the Earth Family on the two days off. These are diffe rent days from the teachings and the Kali day. But they should still be days that are obedient to the synchronic order.
