I come from a large family of 4 brothers and 1 sister. My whole life from birth to teenaged years did involve a religion. A religion I honestly hated so much. It was the religion of the Jehovah’s witnesses. The ex perience of being in such a religion, which I think is a compliment to w hat I feel it really is in all honesty tarnished my feeling of spirituality so muc h, that I had no more interest in spirituality. It affected me so much, I didn’t even want to believe that a God existed. Because if God was personified with the way he was personified through that religion, I didn’t want to believe in such a concept of God at all. So I guess you could say this almost made me an Atheist in most respects. Spirituality is something I thought I would never g et into. The path I have been seeking out now was something that was never m y original intention to do. But one day it just clicked in. And it all b egan on the idea of a novel. I was always heavy into science fiction. Ever since I was a kid, I would always gaze up at the stars and have that feeling t hat one day, my experiences in the future would lead me up there. I didn’t know how at the time, but it’s as if the feeling of being out there past this earth was within my grasp in the distant years ahead. I decided I wanted to create a novel that was widel y entertaining and based on very factual events admitted to a selection of f ormer Black Ops personnel or channelers, or psychics or experiencer s. These things always fascinated me. So I went on YouTube one day and I w anted to start researching information for the novel I was going t o create called “Day Zero.” As I continued to research all this informat ion from various sources on YouTube, I started to become addicted to these e xperiences that so many have had. What was stranger was that I found s o many commonalities in what was being talked about. It in trigued me so much. After about a solid week of non-stop research onlin e, something was starting to happen to me. Its as if I was being fil led with a cup of knowledge. Like the cup was having liquid knowledge added to i t every time I would research more and more. It finally reached the poin t where that cup of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 knowledge overflowed and something inside of me cam e alive. I woke up. I was changing. For the first time ever in my life, I had finally found the answer I have been looking for my whole life. Why a m I here? Who am I really? And why are we even in such an existence? T his began my quest towards a spiritual evolutionary path. And it has b een a non-stop rollercoaster for the past five months. I started 10-14-08.blogspot.com as that was the beg inning of my new form of evolution. I strongly resonated for whatever rea son regarding the October 14 th prediction that stated that a large light ship wou ld appear in our skies on that date. Now even though this did no t occur, for me, it really was a golden moment. Not because it didn’t come tru e, but the whole experience of such an event awoke me and shifted me in areas I could not possibly have imagined. And what was even more exci ting was that more people were waking up from the inspiration of my ex citement. When I look back on the October 14 th event, I know people may say they were disappointed or deceived on that day. But when I th ink back to that day, I just smile because I knew that if it wasn’t for tha t event, I wouldn’t be what I am today. And I could not be more excited to be ali ve in this time now than any other time in history. And I’m also proud to kn ow that many woke up alongside me. After October 14 th , I grew even more stronger with knowledge. Shortly before that event, I started to take up meditation. I read meditation books, I research meditation thoroughly online, I used audio tools to help evolve myself further with my new passion. I was gaining k nowledge every single day and I have not stopped doing what I have been d oing for the past five months. It is 24/7 passion. So as I continued to meditate, I started receiving more and more energy everyday. I’d receive knowledge from meditation th at helped me to understand the truth to why we are here, why I am h ere and what is the purpose of existence. I was accelerating with knowl edge like crazy. It was non-stop. I received dreams of teachings from entit ies I had no idea who they were yet. But it was like being in an astral c lassroom. I would receive these teachings from such a high intelligence and w ake up the next morning and instantly know information on such a to pic. This ranged from such topics as oneness, spiritual evolution, synchr onicity, the higher densities, and the list went on and on. All within only two months of my progression. I was getting more information then I could truly handle. And at times it was overwhelming because I was attempti ng to sort out all the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 info I’d get from higher consciousness. To this day I’m still learning new things. I’m definitely not an all knowing person, b ut the information I posses now just astounds me and what shocks me even more i s the acceleration factor in all of this. My Days of Channeling So it was around the three and a half month time fr ame of my progression into this new passion of mine. And it was a certain friend of mine who I grew a very strong bond with online that began to t each me personally how one can channel. Now channeling of course has a lot of controversy behind it mainly because it’s a personable experience that really can’t be proven in the minds of others. But what I find is that it’s n ot really so much about wondering where the authenticity is, it’s truly abo ut if the message delivered from such a communication resonates with such an individual. The only person who can truly believe that their ch anneling is 100% authentic is that channeler themselves. Now people can resonate it and adapt that information into their truth, but again, there’s always minor doubt within even the highest resonating individual. So t hat’s why I always tell those about channeling that its about resonanance a nd choice of adapting what is said into their truth, because in all hones ty, there is no one great truth. Everyone has their own truth as we are all c o-creators within the grand scheme of existence, but of course more on th at later in this book. So I began to start my training of channeling. I st arted out with connecting with my higher self. Now everyone can do this. This is an ability that we all possess within ourselves simply because there is no one on this earth that is without a higher self. To state that would mean you’re nothing more than a robot. So it took about under a week for me to connect to higher self. I tried once per day for about a five day period and I was conne cted. It was after I connected to higher self that I was informed by my higher self that my quest here on earth is to become that of an all sel f status so that I may bond with all that I have been in the past and merg e with Oversoul to become a whole being. It is necessary for me to be on this path as my whole existence has been based on becoming a guide or a teacher to civilizations. This was the reason for my intense a cceleration. I am receiving information all the time, I must sort it out and do my best to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 educate those that resonate with the same path that I follow. Connecting with Multidimensional Selves Again with my good friend online who has been such an inspiration to my evolution, I was shown exactly how I could reach ou t and connect with all the multidimensional souls within my oversoul. Agai n, oversoul will be explained in strong definition later on in this boo k. So where I started with was a collective consciousness that had ties with m y oversoul. This was the Pleiadian Collective Consciousness that existed within the 8 th density of existence. Now again, some people may confused on d ensities and such, and of course, more on that later on. But the Pleia dians as some may be familiar with, are a race of humanoid beings that e xist in within the section of the Pleiades contained with the Taurus constella tion. Now of course, the point of this book is to discuss this origin, so th is will of course again be explained in detail later on. So through the idea of visual meditation, I literal ly went on a deep meditative journey through my consciousness to conn ect with the Pleiadian 8 th dimensional consciousness. My third eye literally created the experience of going on a meditative manifested quest to seek a guidance download from the Pleiadian consciousness. And it wasn’t unt il I discovered visions of sacred geometry to where I received an energy downl oad through the Pleiadian consciousness through the means of two di stinct symbols: A glowing blue orb and a glowing blue merkabah (other wise known as a tetrahedron). When I visualized these symbols and m anifested my hands to touch these symbols in my meditation, energy flowed through me like a river nearly instantaneously. I literally felt as i f the top of my head literally opened up and blue glowing light just flooded the i nside of it. I was literally in ecstasy that lasted about five minutes in durati on. It was an exceptional, life changing experience that just changed my whole understanding of the new revealed forms of our true existence. I was in just an overwhelming sense of joy and ecstasy that nothing I’ve ever exp erienced could possibly compare to. Through more guidance, I connected with several oth er multidimensional beings through my oversoul such as Sirians, Androme dans, Arcturians, Inner beings of Planet Earth, and several more. I b egan to adapt the ability to connect with certain aspects of my oversoul with ease as the weeks went by."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 How Connection Works Now everybody connects through channeling using th e style that is appropriate for them so to speak. With channeling f low, it can come into terms of visualizations or emotions, to telepathic voice connection, or in my case linked consciousness flow where information is downloaded to me directly and it’s like I have access to a vast libr ary of information through this connection. My channeling ability is in the st yle of automatic writing, so when I channel, I am literally guided by that conne ction and a relationship forms mentally and physically between knowledge and my hands’ functions when typing out the information I receive. Not real ly taking over the hands, but a guidance of typing is what I receive. So this is known as flow. I first started out getting into a deep meditative state gi ving the intention to connect. Currently, it is a lot easier for me to co nnect as I’m reaching the point where I just ask a multidimensional version o f my oversoul a question, energy forms within me and the link up is there. Th is is what I am starting to develop at. Relationship With The Lyrans I’m what is known as an ancient spirit within this universe. Being this ancient spirit, I have lived past incarnations goin g back in our concept of three dimensional time to the time of the Lyrans wh ich goes back billions of years. This was the next phase in becoming more who le with my oversoul. It was instructed to me that I get in contact with a Lyran soul collective consciousness which exists in all higher densities. It’s through this collective consciousness that exi sts within these densities simultaneously that have communicated with me in th is manner. To this very time where I write this book, I still am curio us of where there exact origin point is to these multi-densities of Lyran c onsciousness. But again, it’s the matter of the information received from th ese beings that truly stand out to me. Through this book, I spent over a solid week channe ling with the Lyran Consciousness every day with a large set of questio ns to be answered through each session. The information they share is really special and unique to me as I now have a good personal understa nding of where"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 humanity originally came from. And as your about to read, there’s a lot of information here that could throw you for a loop. N ow again, it’s simply a matter of keeping an open mind through what you rea d in this book. There’s a lot of information and what’s important f or you to remember is to accept it if it resonates with your truth. For me, this fully resonates entirely. But again, keeping an open mind is key within infor mation such as this. I feel that this information is quite important and n eeds to be shared with many. Hence why this book is free as knowledge shou ld always be something that shared and never charged for in my o pinion. At any rate, I hope you enjoy the knowledge that ha s been shared with me within this book and I hope it is able to strike a chord with you and helps to expand your understanding of how existence and expe rience truly works. Thank you again for taking the time to read this e- book and I hope you find the answers your looking for within it. Love, Light and Abundance to you, Brad Johnson.  "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 The Beginnings of Lyra and the Birth of Humanity How did the beginning of Lyra begin? In other words , what was the beginning level that brought about the populace of the human civilization? Similar to what you may refer to as your beginnings . Like Earth, Lyra had a beginning. Like Earth's population, Lyra's populati on was genetically manufactured. We were an experiment just like your kind on earth. An experiment to attempt on the world of Chak'ta. Ther e were patterns of evolution that Lyrans experienced to attempt to per fect our design. As this was the beginning, many attempts had to be tried un til the proper \"template\" as you might call it was suitable enough for our own evolution. This lead to the be beginning of our civilization. The beginning of our existence on Chak'ta and the remaining eighteen wor lds within Sclalona. Can you tell me what life was like on Lyra and what my role was there? Lyra was a peaceful utopian society as you would ca ll it. It was a world where everyone contributed. There was no duality. I t was a world where everyone was at peace. No wars or conflicts with ea ch other. Our cities were that of living light. Our people were always b ecoming more higher evolved throughout the different densities of exist ence as you say. We taught our children the ways of experience. The way s of life. The children would surpass the elders in their learning. It is n ot like on your planet now where the children have been “dumbed” down by corru ption and manipulation. Children are born to surpass their le arning from elders as the elders taught them the knowledge and they would sur pass that knowledge with new experience. Our world was very beautiful. Very similar to your earth. Oceans, vegetation, abundant agriculture. Ou r technology was that which benefited Lyra, and did not poison it in any form. Your role Brad, was that you were a teacher. You we re one of the prime elders of Lyra. You taught many of the young ways o f experience. Starship design, living in abundance, evolutionary teachings , spirituality, oneness with creation. You were a highly experienced elder that helped many on"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 their path to oneness and love. Your name during yo ur last incarnation on Lyra was known as Mackdec. You were a wise elder t eaching others and continue to evolving yourself in the process. You w ere highly valued amongst the group of elders to teach our young ones the ways of Lyran society. How was humanity created? Who was responsible for d eveloping the human genetic body template? These beings are known by several different names a cross the galaxy as Game Masters, Divine Architects or Master Architect s. These beings were creators of many different forms within this galaxy . From the creation of worlds to the creations of stars, to the creation o f many biological, as you would call it, creations, these beings, these divin e creators of highly evolved consciousness were responsible for developi ng what you may know as the source code as you may call it for the seed of life. These beings were responsible for developing the seed of life for humanity. An extension of them that allowed them to experience n ew phenomenal forms of experience through an experiment. This experimen t was humanity. It was through these highly evolved beings that allowed th e creation for the seed of life. The genuine source of all human existence. And not just human, but many other biological technologies that you are fam iliar with such as non- humans. It is technology. We are all technology. We were created through these higher beings as an experiment for soul. For soul to inhabit and experience. It is all part of our divine learning. It is all part of our evolution and experience through the wondrous forms of all cr eation. How did these beings known as the Game Masters come into being as well as this universe? All life as you know it did not originally originat e from this universe. This universe was a creation from Source energy. What yo u may know as the “guts” of this universe came from beings such as th e game masters which came from another universe that reached completion. All creational energies of this universe came from elsewhere. Othe r completed universes. The game masters as well as the race tha t was responsible for donating their DNA to the game masters known as the Felinoids. A feline/human mixed race that existed in another uni verse that came here to assist in developing the first experiment with huma nity‘s creation. It is these"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 very beings who’s DNA infrastructure were the found ation of our race, and who’s DNA is one of many races that also exists wit hin your genetic code as well. Did the home system of Lyra have a name that we cou ld have translated in English? Again, it is symbols that we had used as this is th e origin form of translation through many races across the universe based on tel epathic communication; however, we can roughly translate th e name of the system Sclalona. Again, this is a rough translation based on the context of your language. Whereabouts in the Lyra Constellation was the home star where humanity originated? Based on your knowledge of constellations, our star of Sclalona was placed approximately 22 light years in the northern direct ion of the Vega star system. Did Lyra look exactly like Earth, in other words, i s Earth a cloned world of Lyra with land mass the same configuration as Lyra? This is correct to an extent yes. Our original plan s for earth were based on the “blueprints’ you might say based on our home sy stem. Earth had similar land masses, but of different configurations in som e forms. Obviously, with land mass separation now, it differs much to the co nfiguration of Lyra. But understand that in our time, we had much more contr ol of seismic tectonic shifts based on our technology and advanced form of consciousness to prevent any form of natural disasters on our world, as they are often caused mainly by unbalanced forms of consciousness on your world. And as well as with the earth, as her attempt to ascend herself is underway and she must form these natural catastrophes such as ea rthquakes, floods and other disasters you know on your world to help clea nse her of heavy energies anchored deep within her interior surface. Are you able to translate the name of the planet to our homeworld in"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 the English Language? There were several worlds that we had colonized in the system that had become destroyed. However our main world was known as Chak’ta. This may not be the proper form of translation in your l anguage as all Lyran terminology as you call it is based on symbols rath er than letters in your language. Why did the Lyrans have a connection with nature an d how did it effect the consciousness? We are always one with nature at all times. Nature is the path to all of love and oneness. By connecting with the equilibrium of such nature, you are accessing a living library of information based on that of oneness, balance and purity of soul and spirit. No other life force is more aligned to the ways of such traits than that of nature on worlds and of existence itself. To achieve this balance, this equilibrium of such onen ess, understanding the fundamental sciences of nature in all its forms gra nts you the ability of understanding your role as you may say with such ba lanced between love and nature. Your consciousness attunes to the teachings nature provides. Nature is a teacher in its own form. It teaches you harmony, on eness and love as previously stated. When you connect with nature, yo u are balanced. You are open to wisdom of such a vast living library th at understands the equilibrium of such balance. This grows your consci ousness to new forms of understanding that many on your earth have yet t o achieve, though will achieve in the future. Why did the Lyrans have only some emotions and not all? Our emotional state is astute that we worked to dev eloped overtime. There were emotions within out state that were not develo ped or even encountered at the time of our genesis. Our emotion s that we sustained were mainly that to contain of love,, unity and one ness. There were emotions we did not experience due to the fact of l ack of experience for such emotions. Which is what lead to our growing on a fundamental level to higher dimensions of consciousness and unity. Can you give detail regarding the Lyran Family Stru cture?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 Our family structure is quite unique in comparison to that of Earth's humans. Our structure is based on guidance and grow th rather than direct upbringing and direct teaching. Children will alway s out surpass their parents, their elders in all forms. Mainly because they're experience based on guidance given by elders is what allows them to grow, to sustain, to evolve with oneness. Children are meant to be guide d, and not forced to be taught in such ways similar to Earth's teaching sys tems. It is in their nature to explore who they are. To become one with all tha t is based on the path they choose, when only receiving guidance when deem ed appropriate and suitable for them. This was the way of Lyran cultur e. By allowing your children to have that open exploration and understa nding the path they choose to follow, you are allowing their experience , their oneness and love for their passion flourish. It is how all children, all elders, from that of the time of beginning through Lyra structured itself ba sed on its family guidelines. This is very similar to how we guide yo u. Never truly giving you the answers you seek, but pointing you in the right direction so that experience and knowing of the isness can be achieve d and reachable within your grasp based on your own self-exploratio n. It is self-exploration at all ages that matter. It is who you are. I wish to know more about source and the whole scop e of existence itself. What can you tell me about this? Source is creation. Sources is existence. Source is where you and all come from. It is the mother to our creation. It is refer red to many as source, or to you as god, or to others as creator. Source is what surrounds us. We are all children of source. The purpose of source is for its own internalness t o connect and receive information, experience and data from its extension s. We are these very extensions of source. It is of love and it is that to which we strive to become. The ultimate knowledge. The ultimate experi ence. It is existence yet we are existence. Source is within all of us. W e refer to source as the isness. We are all one with all that is. This is so urce. The primary purpose to existence is the experiences you achieve lifetim e after lifetime. Information relayed directly back to source. How long has Interstellar travel existed in our gal axy?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 Through your measurement of time, your understandin g of interstellar travel based on this system would estimate it to be 4.3 billion years. How were crops grown on Chak'ta? Was there a secret to how they were grown? Our consciousnesses assisted with their growth. By forming an equilibrium with nature and forming a partnership, a oneness wi th all that is around your on your world, the collective consciousness of our connection with the crops that fed us stayed in as strong balance. Mani festation of crops was possible based on the consciousness we became one w ith. that of nature. Support nature through consciousness, through your love through your gift of manifestations and become abundant in all its su rroundings to continue to allow it to grow plentiful in nature. It was all consciousness. How did Lyra fall? How did it meet its fate? Like your world, like Atlantis, like the early stag es of Earth prior to your existence on this third dimensional plane, Lyra enc ountered the same fate as Atlantis , as the early stages of your world, Ea rth. It encountered Duality. Duality influenced by those of darkness as you may say. When the reptilians as you call them arrived and made their presence to our people, duality followed. Our people began to break apart. There was duality and war on every side. Influenced by the reptilians bas ed on their hunger for dominance. Our kind separated, broke off from much of our teachings and became plagued with duality, with conflict. This le ad to a great war that ravaged our homeworld and our star system itself. I t lead to the destruction of all that we had. All that we once lived within i n such peace and prosperity was ravaged with that very duality. Were the reptilians responsible for the death of th e Sclalona star? No, they were partially responsible for much destru ction, but our star was at the hands of a fate of duality.

When did the migrations to other star systems ensue between the Lyran population? during the beginning of the war. There were those w ho foresaw what was happening and many left to other star systems prior to during and after the great fall of our Lyran kingdom. What events ensued after the fall of Lyra? Lyra was lost. Once this occurred, those that migra ted to other sectors of the galaxy took upon new homes amongst the stars. T he wars between humanity and the Reptilians continued to wage on fo r hundreds of thousands of your years. After the fall of Lyra, th e races that you are aware of now such as the Andromedans, Pleiadians, Arcturi ans, Sirians, Vegans, Centaurians and many more began their legacy of one ness with the universe. New homes were founded, new races were de veloped and humanity took refuge amongst the stars facing the t yranny of duality to those looking to escape it. it was a very long peri od of war based on your time. Did I die in my incarnation at the time when the st ar exploded? Yes you did. Others evacuated the planet to migrate in numbers across thousands of other stars. You remained to assist th ose who were attempting to leave the world. You and many other e lders were responsible for planetary evacuation. Our young survived and th e Elders stayed behind to perish with the world. What was the population amount of Lyra? Our population was in the billions. It was estimate d about approximately"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 nine billion before our world fell. What is it that made Lyra stand out so much that it s teaching could be reflected to that of earth? Oneness. And Love are the teachings of Lyra. The un derstanding that we are all equal. The understanding that all can contr ibute. The understanding that all are equally balanced in this universe. Tha t all are capable of evolving themselves to untold levels. This is the w ay of Lyran culture. By benefiting the world you live on and living in that illustrious harmonious nature with all that is. You are the future of the Lyran society on Earth. Utopian civilization is very much within your grasp . The governments within your world are crumbling now and making way for the se new Lyran systems to take effect on your world. It is an exci ting time for you all and we look onto you, our children of earth wish such happ iness. You make us all very proud. Teach those about love. Teach those about oneness a nd experience. For all that is the balance of creation. All is experie nce. There is no duality, it is illusion created by manipulation. You are all creat ed from love.

This was the entire plan from the beginning. W hen Lyra fell and our constellation became raged by war from the Alpha Dr aconians as you call them, a new plan was being developed by several rac es to initiate the construction of a new Lyra. This was Earth’s plan. Staged development occurred on the world you once knew as Maldek. It w as the staging ground, or the preparation ground you might say where the p lans for earth were being created. Earth was to be the new Lyra.

The Alpha Draconians What was the encounter like with the Alpha Draconia ns, was there any attempt at negotiation? What ensued? They did not negotiate although it was attempted. T he Alpha Draconians as you know them are not interested in negotiation. Th ey simply took what they believed was theirs. They were condemned with darkness in their mind. They saw what we had to offer the universe an d they wanted to take it. It was their nature at the time. Rather than ne gotiations, destruction ensued and the Alpha Draconians swept through many of our colonized worlds to eliminate and conquer. There was no succe ss at any form of peace as that is not what they wanted. It was to co nquer. There was dying on both sides. The Alpha Draconians wanted to estab lish their dominance one step further and this lead to the destruction o f our star. Regarding the Alpha Draconians, have we any idea wh ere they came from? It is uncertain to all races, including the Alpha D raconians themselves where they ‘re origins lie. What is known is that t hey were placed here from the opening of a black hole leading to a universe t hat is unknown to us. They were contained in a form of stasis during this travel through this black hole that was located in the proximity of Alpha Dra conis. Due to their hydrogen based breathing capabilities, the Alpha Dr aconis sector as known by you, was the only area in this galaxy to which t hey were issued the best chance at adapting to. But prior to their existence here in our universe it is unclear even through them where their origins lie. What is the mindset of the reptilians to conquer an d enslave? It is of their nature to do so. The reptilians as y ou mention are a race that has yet to learn any lessons based on their belief structure. There has not"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 been any race of their equilibrium to inform them h ow to behave otherwise. They will not listen to negotiation. They establish means of domination through suffering and enslavement. There are no oth er civilization in existence that have been able to dominate in the fo rm that they do in order for them to “experience” that change. Their dominan ce is their power. It is all they know. However, it can be said that all not all of the reptilians are that of a negative aspect as you may call it. Altho ugh we see all as one spectrum, in your condition with your phase of dual ity, we can inform you that not all reptilians are of this negative nature . There are reptilians that are on your positive side as you call it. There are reptilians that have individually learned and experienced new learning o f divine consciousness. That have understood the fundamentals of oneness wi thin all that is. They have come to terms with isness and have begun to ev olve themselves lifetime after lifetime through the higher densitie s of consciousness. This goes to show that all are capable of change. And as you may see these particular reptilians as dark we love them dearly a s they are us. They are that of which is the all. The whole. And we see gre atness coming in to many of them even if they fail to see it for themse lves. Are the reptilians able to enter the fourth and fif th dimensions through technology? It is true that the reptilians are able to enter th e fourth density using technology yes. They have attempted to enter fifth density consciousness with their devices but have been unsuccessful for i f you are attempting to reach that higher point in density, what is require d of you is that of love. The fourth density on a technological standpoint frame of reference can only be achieved by those that are not of love and light, t hat are not Christ conscious. Anywhere beyond that, and you will not b e able to partake in such en existence in fifth density or higher densit y without divine love in your soul. Can you give information on the Greys and how they were constructed as well as their role? There are many different variation of the race that you have come to know as Greys.

They are programmed w ith certain directives to follow and are operated to function based on a p articular radio signal frequency issued out by their commanding masters, t he Alpha Draconaians. However again, remember that there are many different forms of “Greys” as you have addressed them that ar e not that of mechanical, that are biological and many of them ar e of love and light and exists in harmony with many other loving races of o neness and light. Were there sub-species developed by the Alpha Draco nians? This is correct. There are sub-races that the Alpha Draconians themselves did manufacture such as the Greys, and also added t heir own genetic information into the human body type. The Alpha Dra conians are master experts in genetics and they have developed several sub-races based on their own genetic template as well as the template of the universal human to develop other reptilian sub-races combing these templates to enable sub-race development to serve under their own rule and jurisdiction across the colonized star systems they inhabit. Is it true that the reptilians value genetics above anything else? Yes. The reptilians are rarely interested in anythi ng else other than genetics. They are geneticists of a masterful natur e. Their intelligence is paramount and they’re knowledge of such systems bas ed on that of genetics is absolutely admirable. They will value g enetics above anything else. It is third nature. More on Lyra (Chak’ta) With the structures or rather the shelters on Lyra, how were these constructed? "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 The shelters as you may refer to them were based on holographic technology. We did not build structures or other ti mes that you know by physical energy effort. We are amazed that your rac e is abundant in doing this; however, through many races across the galaxy , and across many other galaxies, all is created through holography. Holographic shelters, technologies, items, are all manifested and placed on many worlds across all over as our way of developing such forms of liv ing environments. Even our spacecraft that we once had back in the days of Lyra were that of holographic creation. Did Lyra look exactly like Earth, in other words, i s Earth a cloned world of Lyra with land mass the same configuration as Lyra? This is correct to an extent yes. Our original plan s for earth were based on the “blueprints’ you might say based on our home sy stem. Earth had similar land masses, but of different configurations in som e forms. Obviously, with land mass separation now, it differs much to the co nfiguration of Lyra. But understand that in our time, we had much more contr ol of seismic tectonic shifts based on our technology and advanced form of consciousness to prevent any form of natural disasters on our world, as they are often caused mainly by unbalanced forms of consciousness on your world. And as well as with the earth, as her attempt to ascend herself is underway and she must form these natural catastrophes such as ea rthquakes, floods and other disasters you know on your world to help clea nse her of heavy energies anchored deep within her interior surface. A friend of mine that I was talking to earlier was able to tap into some consciousness feelings and visualizations of Lyra a nd mentioned that the Lyran homeworld was slightly hotter than that o f Earth, what type of star or stars existed within the human home syst em of Lyra? We are aware of such friends that you have Brad, an d we smile as we are honored that such friends have helped you out this far. And yes, this was to do with the previous temperature of our flourishing sun and our approximate temperature in average climatic tropica l zones could be measured on average to be within the 50 degrees cen tigrade area based on your temperature system. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 How many chakras are contained within the Lyran for m? There are four. We don’t have as many as the humans of your earth as you were genetically engineered through a multitude of volunteers from our civilizations. Our four chakras contained that of a crown, third eye, solar plexus and root chakras. What can you tell me about healing? Did you have en ergy technologies to assist with healing? Our energy healing technology could be compared int o the familiarity of how your pyramids work. It harnesses energy from th e electromagnetic grid of our world. The energy technology was always powe red by electromagnetic grid. Energy technology harnessed t hat energy and we allowed healing to take place in such forms. Not to all mention that the majority of healing that took place on our world wa s through divine consciousness with self through nature and our coll ective consciousness. What were the forms of local transportation that yo u used on Chak’ta? All of our transportation did not run on anything u npleasant for the environment. Our conveyances were that of anti-grav itational. It contained their own electromagnetic field below the conveyanc e of suspending approximately one foot in your metric system off th e air. Speeds for such conveyances in your system of miles reached up four hundred miles per hour. What type of starships did you have? Can you descri be them? Our starships were triangular in appearance. The av eraged as size to fifteen to twenty of your meters in length. Our lar ger triangular shaped craft of which you may refer to as a mother ship, spanned a maximum capacity of three miles in length. They were silver metallic craft. Smaller scout vessels occupied up to fifteen of us at once. Mothe rships were capable of holding up to one thousand of us at any given time. Why were your ships triangular in appearance?

Much of what we have designed is very similar to the appearance of what you know as pyram ids. It is in representation to the merkabah: The symbol for comp letion. The symbol for all that is made up within creation. Our craft, our homes, our temples an dour pyramids were all based on the shape of merkab ah. What is the lifespan of a Lyran? Our average lifespan ranged from 500 to 700 years i n age. What sort of wildlife was on Chak’ta? Can you descr ibe some of the animals? There were a series of animals that could be consid ered close to the style and traits of your mammals of our world. Such anima ls which we considered pets were often very beautiful similar t o how you have dogs. Imagine thicker fur. You could best describe them a s a cross between a dog and a sheep. There were that you know of birds on our world in various different shapes and sizes. Our wildlife that was c ontained on our world were not indigenous to our planet. They were from o ther worlds. As Lyra is similar to that of your world, your animals that ro am the surface are not from there as well. They have come from different w orlds upon many different star systems genetically altered to meet the habitat of our world. Were there animals on Chak’ta that we could find on Earth today? This is correct. Not all animals on our world can b e found on your earth, but there were similar animals such as aquatic creature s, birds and mammals that you may recognize on your world. Chak’ta was a n earth-like planet and needed to sustain creatures to maintain the habitat . This is very similar to many other earth-like worlds. Similar animals must be generically altered onto maintain the equilibrium balance of the world’ s habitat. What does the physical appearance of a Lyran look l ike? Our race is of the felinoid nature. Think of what y ou know on your planet as cats, and intermix that with a humanoid form, and t his is what we are. We had hair like a human, such as on the females often had long flowing hair"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 that ranged from blond to brown, black and amber. W e contained fur like a cat. We were bipedal in nature. We possessed no tai ls at all. At least not the race that you represented Brad. Furs ranged fro m white, to brown and black. As again, our races were multicultural. But our genetics were directly from the felinioid race. We averaged anywhere from four to eight feet tall in height. There was a mixture of clothed and non-clot hed Lyran on our world depending on the territories you would travel to. O ur eyes are very cat like and we have a snout similar to that of a feline on your world. Can you describe the domiciles you lived in and how they were structured? Our domiciles ranged from various shapes and sizes. There were some domiciles that were configured through sacred geome tric shapes. Triangles, squares, hexagons and more. The inner pe rimeter of our domiciles were hollow as we constructed our homes a round nature using holography. The environment was never harmed during our holographic construction of our homes. Nature was always within our surroundings. Inside of our home’s structures and surrounding our structures. We also built monuments and temples spanning several miles high. We also had pyramids just as you but in much higher demand as p yramids existed from regions of Chak’ta. Can you describe some of these monuments? We can describe one particular monument that was ho lographic ally represented through one of our central locations in the northern hemisphere which contained what you may be familiar with as a sphinx. This sphinx that you maybe familiar with also exist s on your world. It is a tribute to the felinoids, the template race who gen erously donated their DNA to the creation of our existence. Sphinxes are a paid respect to these beings of such astounding love and light. Were there any physical activities on your planet s imilar to what we call sports on Earth? The sports as you call them were such that didn’t i nvolve competition. Competition was never a driving force within us.

This is the realm to where the beings of Chak’ta consciousness existed to formulate the soul if you will of Chak’ta, much similar to how Earth contains a similar collection of divine beings to merge that of earth’s soul. Did all families on Chak’ta have pets and what was the relationship between them? We did not consider them to be “pets” as you call t hem. All Lyrans in nature communicated with nature. Pets was not an appropria te terminology. We have a partnership, a oneness with nature and with wildlife. We shared our world with the animals, with the wildlife and natur e itself. All was partnership. The wildlife and nature itself was tel epathic and we learned much about the balance and oneness of how such equi librium exists in perfect balance with the surrounding environment. A ll was partnership, all was one. What form of density structures existed on Lyra dur ing that time? As what you know of years in your time, many of the se years past through the existence of third density Chak’ta. Our plains of existence during that time as you know it spanned back billions of years and allowed us to develop a hierarchical structure of our own conscio usness that existed up to the eighth density of existence. Tell me about the felinoids and their role with the development of humanity? The felonoids are not originally from this universe . They existed from another universe that had reached completion.

Can you tell me about the game masters, who are the y? The game masters are a highly evolved race containe d in realms of existence far beyond your comprehension. They have a strong connection with source energy. It was these game masters that literally crated this game. This universe. All that you see from planets, stars, galaxies and more phenomena were implemented and constructed by the game masters. They are the architects of this universe. They are the creators of the human race. History of Earth Now that Lyra was destroyed and human beings scatte red across the galaxy with new races forming such as the Andromeda ns, Pleiadians, Sirians, Arcturians and more. When did Earth come i nto play and who got involved with this next experiment? Earth became a factor twenty five thousand years la ter the fall of Lyra. It was what you may call a grouping of human civilizat ions that came together to initiate this experiment. A second experiment br ought forth a new universal body type. Through this participation inv olved the Andromedans, Arcturians, Pleiadians, Sirians, and several other human races part of conglomerate of research developers. The intention for the creation of Earth was staged on the planet you known as Maldek. On Maldek, the plans began to begin the engineering of Mother Eart h as you know her. Volunteered races that were committed to this new e xperiment gave samples of their DNA and contributed to the develop ment of this new universal body type human in which souls of both hu man DNA non-human nature could use Earth as an intergalactic exchange center. Where all beings through this galaxy could incarnate on the p eaceful loving planet Earth and complete their cycles as humans incarnate . It was a graduation planet.

This was our new home to which we w ould start all over again and bring harmony, oneness and love to those who contributed to the development of earth. How many races participated in this next experiment with humanity? Main races involved were Pleiadian, Andromedan, Arc turian, Sirian, Centaurian, Vegan. Of course, later, when what you know as the “reptilians changed and altered your genetics, their genetic in formation was added to your universal body type as well. What was the goal of Earth? In other words, what wa s it’s purpose? Earth was to be the new Lyra. It was multicultural world that literally and the majority of the galaxy’s attention focused upon it. Its location was intentional as this was a central area for beings a cross the galaxy to easily access it, not to mention other beings from other g alaxy’s that would be able to enter the system as it is easily located on the tip of the Milky way galaxy as you call it. Easily accessible by all rac es in this galaxy and in others. Again, Earth’s purpose was to allow the ease of hum ans and non-humans to incarnate on its plane to achieve full graduatio n and completion. It was second chance to restore balance and oneness to the galaxy without the tyranny of any other races interfering with the pla ns of this new Lyra. By amalgamating all contributing race’s dna together w ithin the universal body type, we only saw right in this and did not foresee any wrong. However, this clearly became an oversight as your time progressed further and further into the days of Altantis. What information can you share in regards to Atlant is? Atlantis was the first city containing the new expe rimental human body type. And for a time as you may call it, it was a t echnological city of great prosperity. At this point in time, Earth was vibrat ing within the fourth density. During this time, there were several different body types amongst your earth, you may have known them as Neanderthal human s. These were earlier versions of your kind that were later genet ically engineered to finally become finalized as the universal body type that yo u are now. The new"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Earth human was completed and for a long time, the people of Atlantis lived in a very Utopian way of life. The days of Lyra wer e revisited once again and there was much harmony within the Atlantis City . Until the plan shifted and the dark age began to make its presence known u pon your world. What caused Atlantis’ downfall? The earth was meant to be lowered to third density vibration in order for all incarnate life forms to truly begin a graduation pr ocess as completed human beings. This was of the first cycle period to where a harvest of such incarnate human beings would be produced at the end of the first cycle. During this shift downwards into the third density, this begun the dark times of Earth. There was a group of Pleiadian students t hat grew what you may call an “ego.” They believed they had the talents o r knowledge as it were of masters and begun to intervene in affairs of Atlant is. This intervention of ego lead to yet another form of duality amongst the Atlanians. This eventually lead to a war between the Altantians and the Pleiadian rebel group. It was during this time period that not only were this rebellious Pleiadain group pre-creating the duality experience d on Lyra in similarity, but they became an allegiance with those you know a s the Reptilians. A battle ensued between the forces of the corrupt a nd our ancestors amongst the stars. The corrupt forces won the terri tory of earth in the third density. It was taken over. Our planet, our experim ent backfired once again as we had allowed duality to sweep through the star s to where Earth was placed, and allowed it to be taken over. The Pleiad ian group caused the tyranny of duality to unfold and Earth officially e ntered the dark times. The dark age. After the territory was won by the new ow ners, the Annunaki as you know them began to tinker with your genetics an d deactivate the twelve chakra system contained within your DNA syst em. A two strand double helix DNA system was contained in the univer sal body template leaving very little memory and abilities in tact. T his allowed them to conceal the truth there from the human species. The human r ace would never be able to recall what transpired during this time of duality. Is it true that the reptilians added their DNA to o ur universal body type as well as the race known as the Greys? As we mentioned above, this is correct, the Greys a s you know them did involve their genetics into your universal body typ e as well, this is correct."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 Is it true that mainly the Sirians were known as ou r Egyptian culture? Yes, this is correct. In other words you may say th e Sirian Nation was the Egyptian culture entirely. Their starships are shap ed like pyramids and they assisted in the construction of all the pyramids on Earth. How were the pyramids built? Sound vibrations allowed the atom re-structuring of the material contained within the pyramids to change shape and levitate. T hrough this medium, workers would easily be able to forge the rocks int o position as well meld themselves together as the sound vibration alters t he molecular structure of the building rock. What can you tell us about the moon around our Eart h? During the time of the Reptilian takeover, a moon c onstructed by the Alpha Draconians as you call them was constructed from a previously colonized star system owned by the Alpha Draconians. The moon was brought here through the means of a wormhole that brought forth the anchoring of this satellite base in which the Alpha Draconians constr ucted. Its purpose was to monitor earth through its technology as well as provide direct remote teleportation link ups to earth’s surface so that b eings on the moon could easily transport from the surface of the moon to th e surface of earth instantaneously. You could consider the moon as a s tar craft as it did possess propulsion. However, the moon you possess n ow is no longer this particular artificial moon from the Alpha Draconian s. The particular moon has been completely dissolved out of existence due to the assistance of your intergalactic family. A new natural moon with no artificial technology has ben solidified into your reality existing in th ird dimensional state.

What form of technology is used to travel from star to star? You may have been familiar with such technologies b ased on videos from several programs on your earth as they reveal such technology. Many of the technologies found in spacecrafts are powered t hrough thought. We shall give you the example of a simple scout craft. Using a basic Lyran scout craft involved being seated in a chair that l iterally was controlled by consciousness. By being “linked up” to this chair, your consciousness would be connected to the spacecraft. Through the p ower of your thought, you would be capable of traveling anywhere through space based on where you wanted to travel to simply by that very p ower of thought energy.

Time in your third density perspective is what you use to progress. Through higher densities of consciousness , time is no longer a driving force through progression. In actuality, al l is synchronous. Time is an illusion created by consciousness continuity to make your reality experience appear “real.” This is mainly because yo ur mind in third density is of a dense nature and time needs to exist to fue l and create continuity and a “realistic” feeling in order for you to progr ess throughout your third density existence. When you are synchronous, which is your true nature, the past, the present and the future are all one. T his is the now moment as you call it. Through the now moment, you could cons ider yourself to be in an analogy where you are always read in a timeline. Consider yourself to be a long strip of film if you wish. The past, pres ent and future scenes of that film can be read with ease. This is synchronic ity. This is timelessness and this is what you can define as being in the now moment.

You will all ascend and you have once again completed t he tasks, or shall we say, are about to complete the tasks that you were brought her e to accomplish. Our deepest love and light to all of yo u brave souls of Planet Earth. When do you foresee the first initial first contact in person with our civilization? When your civilization is ready to accept us on a g lobal level, or rather a higher majority level. We do see this happening at some point very soon,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 but we will not put a date on it, dates as you know them are not important. You will understand the day that first contact will occur when it comes. You will feel it, all will feel it. And it will arrive soon. How will ascension work? Who will ascend and who wo n’t? We see all on your planet ascending. Everyone ascen ds, simply because Earth can no longer exist in this third density pla in of existence. So all will ascend. Those you know as the power elite, are stil l souls themselves and even though they’re intention is not to ascend, the y are still souls, and they will come to terms with another enriching experienc e in their next life after this. Believe us when we say that an experience of this dualistic nature needed to happen for all of you. Remember that your existence is all about experience. You have all learned great knowledge, y ou have all gained such wisdom from this experience, and you have even more to gain as the days continue. Experience is the game. And you have overcome what you know as a negative form of duality, although this i s not what we see, we understand that your souls within you are excited a t this wild ride as you may call it through an adventure that you could def ine as good triumphing over evil. Although no such polarities exist on the higher realms, the human side of you resonates with such a statement. You ha ve achieved such an experience that very few souls have. You are all en riched with such experience and you will become even more enriched t o know that there are more prosperous days of experience ahead that will evolve your soul to new levels of consciousness when this fall of duali ty ends. Will ascension occur on an actual date or could it occur prior to such a date? There is no set date for your personal ascension or even the earth’s. This can occur at anytime, if you are referring in regar ds to the date of 2012 in December, understand that is mainly the date that e nds your concept of time in this dimension of existence as well as the end of quarantine around this planet. Can you define how quarantine works and does it end on December 21 st , 2012? "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 Quarantine does end on December 21 st 2012 as you understand time, this is correct. Quarantine itself contains that of an e nergy field contained around your earth preventing any other off world be ings from interfering in a progressing planet’s affairs. We understand the A nnunaki and their allied races have found ways around this before. And attem pts in the past have been made to secretly remove those that have violat ed the laws of quarantine. However, understand that the quarantine laws are in effect and many that are observers or are of light and love ar e up above your skies observing your situation while at the “edge of thei r seats.” How have the Annunaki or their allied races slipped by from time to time? Their moon played a large role in this deception of slipping through the barrier of the quarantine energy field. As their mo on contained teleportation technology to create a direct site to site transpor tation of Annunaki and other allied races to deep underground/underwater b ases stationed on your earth. However, as their moon is now gone, this is no longer a threat to the intrusion of the quarantine field. Why does our sun appear like it is turning brighter and whiter? Because it itself is evolving to a new form of cons ciousness, to a new form of evolution. Remember that you have within your so lar system three suns. The central sun itself is evolving into a larger, m ore powerful sun as new energies continue to flourish as your solar system passes into the galaxy further and further and deeper and deeper. Expect m ass changes to occur within your solar system within the next progressin g days, weeks and months of your time. Is it true that Jupiter will be transforming into a sun? Jupiter is in a state of transformation that will e volve its form of being into that of a sun, this is correct. The effects of such a transformation are occurring now on its surface as Jupiter is preparin g to ascend itself. What is the status of the “Greys?” Have they comple tely left our"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 world? This is correct. The Greys as you know them have le ft your Earth as they have been successful in collection all the data the y need based on your genetics. They will no longer be a threat to you, i f you considered them as such any longer up to and even past the phase of gl obal and civilization’s ascension. Are their still Reptilians contained on the surface of earth, and if so, will they be leaving soon as well? Yes, although many of them have already left Earth. The higher families of royalty from the Annunaki have vacated quite some t ime age, this has allowed the lower class of third and fourth density Reptilians associated with this negative polarity to vacate Earth as well . All that remains are those you may know as middle class Reptilians who are sti ll remaining in hopes that all will continue to abide in their favor, how ever, they are seeing their grasp weaken across Earth’s population and are cons idering leaving earth very soon as well. After the ascension, what do you see humanity becom ing and where do you see Earth becoming? We see you becoming self-responsible. We see you be coming that once again to what you were prior to incarnation on the planes of earth, but much more enriched, evolved and experienced. You wi ll no longer be known as human beings, but known as beings of love and light. You will become re-united with your galactic families and ma ny more exciting experiences await your civilization after the ascen sion occurs. What will our roles be as we become members of a ne w galactic society? It all depends on that paths you wish to choose. Th ere are many of you who will remain with Earth and reconstruct it into hat of a new world. The new Chak’ta as we know it. The new Lyra where the o riginal intentions of our world can finally come to life free of tyranny and duality.

Additional Information From My Other Multidimensional Selves Message from the Essassani 5 th Dimensional Consciousness Topic: Beginnings of Humanity and Your Future We are here fellow humans of earth We are happy at this time to tell you the story as it were, regarding the beginnings that you have had. And no, we shall not dive too deeply into it as we have obv iously saved that jobs for the Lyrans. What you need to understand is that all the experiences you have had from the very beginnings of your time form the current moment of your now moment, is all orchestrated. All is as it should be. You are in duality now at this moment for that experience. The Lyrans were in duality at that time for that experience. For if duality di d not exist, what you know now would not be knowing in that now. The Lyrans ar e bench markers as you may call them for ushering in an adventure thro ugh duality. This adventure is very important for all beings in creat ion to experience. You need to understand that there is no true good o r evil, bad or good, love or hate in that sense of duality. There is only one polarity. There is only one form of consciousness that truly exists on all plai ns of existence. The Lyrans were indeed the first experiment towards cre ating a universe of adventure. It is all part of what you know as the g ame. The game is here, it is the now, it is future, is it past. It is all. It is what makes existence so exciting. There needs to be duality in this density that you are in now in order for progression of soul to take place. Let th e teachings of the Lyrans that you have received sink in deep as this is the story of your ancestors. This is the story of how duality began. This is the story of your origins as well. For you are soul. And whether you have been h ere a long time, or you are new to this universe, this is now your history of the universe you now exist in. As for your future, understand that there is a lot of changes occurring on your world now. Understand that it is you who decid es what path you take in this current incarnation. There is no right or w rong path because there is no right or wrong. You are in control of your desti ny as you may say. See"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 the world changing.

Conclusion I am happy to announce that there will be a second book coming out very soon that focuses on a lot of our Intergalactic his tory beyond Earth. From many of the races that tie into our history to the start of duality and wars that have ensued across the galaxy for eons as we u nderstand time. The full channeling sessions occurred over a span o f 9 days and yet there is still more information that has hardly been touc hed on, but will be explained more thoroughly in the next upcoming book . I hope you have been enlightened by the information contained within this book. Again, I only ask that you keep an open mind on what has been expressed here as this is not about scientific expl anations, mainly information coming from sources that Science hasn’t really been able to explain as all knowledge truly comes from within al l of us. Special thanks to the Saviors of Earth Community, 2 012evolution.com, my loving inspirer who’s been there for me, my good fr iend Clinton, and all awakeners, acquaintances, family, friends that have stood by me through this exciting journey I have been pursuing during t his time of acceleration. Until next time. Be in love and light always. ~Namaste, Brad Johnson "}]
