Thank you for being angels upon the earth, to help us all! Crystal Children are the new generation that has come to the Earth plane after the Indigo Children. They are approximately ages newborn through five, although some members of the first wave of Crystal Children are as old as seven. These kids are like Indigos - highly psychic and sensitive - but with out the dark edge and the anger energy. Crystal Children are beautiful inside and out - one look in their eyes and you can see Divine love and wisdom. Their auras are bright, radiant, and opalescent - they seem to gl ow from the inside! They talk about past lives, distant galaxies, and profound insights concerning peace and love. This book covers many issues that affect these special kids (such as healing abilities, connections to nature, eating habits, and so on) and also includes interviews with the Crystal Children themselves an d their parents and teachers. It points out ways to keep these kids happy and healthy, and how to avoid the pitfalls that could spoil their special gifts."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Introduction: Who are the Crystal Children?

Introduction: Who are the Crystal Children? The first thing you notice about Crystal Children (whom I'll also refer to as \"Crystals\") is their eyes - large, penetrating, and wise beyond the ir years. Their eyes lock upon yours hypnotically, while your soul is laid bare for these children to truly see."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Perhaps you've met this special new \"breed\" of kids who are rapidly populating our planet. They're happy, delightful, and forgiving. These new lightworkers, roughly newborn through age seven, are unlike previous generations. Ideal in many ways, they poi nt to where humanity is headed... and it's a positive direction! The older kids (approximately age 7 through 25), called \"Indigo Children,\" share some characteristics with the Crystals. Both generations are highly sensitive and psychic, and they have important life purposes. The main differenc e is their temperament. Indigos have a warrior spirit, since their collective purpo se is to mash down old approaches that no longer serve us. They're here to quash governmental, educational, and legal systems that lack integrity. To accomplish this end, they need ho t tempers and fiery determination. Adults who resist change an d who value conformity may m isunderstand the Indigos. They're often mislabeled with the psychiatr ic diagnoses of Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Sadly, when they're medicated, the Indigos often lose their beautiful sensitivity, spiritual gifts, and warrior energy. I wrote about the Indigos at length in my book The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children ; and the subject was thoroughly explored in The Indigo Children , written by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober (both published by Hay House). In contrast, the Crystal Children are blissful and even-tempered. Sure, they may have tantrums occasionally, but these kids are largely forgiving and easygoing. The Cryst als are the generation who benefit from the Indigos' trailblazing. F irst, the Indigo Children lead with a machete, chopping down anything that lack s integrity. Then the Crystal Ch ildren follow the cleared path into a safer and more secure world. The terms Indigo and Crystal were given to these two generations because they most accurately describe their aura colors and energy patterns. In digo Children have a lot of indigo blue in their auras. This is the color of the \"third-eye chakra,\" which is an energy center inside the head located between the two eyebrows. This chakra regulates clairvoyance, or the ability to see energy, visions, and spirit s. Many of the Indigo Children have this gift. The Crystal Children have beautiful, multicolored, opalescent auras, in pastel hues like a quartz crystal's prism effect. This generation also harbors a fascination for cryst als and rocks, as you'll read about later in this book. Henc e, the name \"Crystal Children.\" The characteristics of Crystal Children are as follows: • Are usually born in 1995 or later"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• Possess large eyes with an intense stare • Have magnetic personalities • Are highly affectionate • Start talking late in childhood • Are very musically oriented, and may sing before talking • Use telepathy and self-invented sign language to communicate • May be diagnosed with autism or Asperger's syndrome • Are even-tempered, sweet, and loving • Are forgiving of others • Are highly sensitive and empathetic • Are very much connected to nature and animals • Exhibit healing abilities • Are quite interested in crystals and rocks • Often discuss angels, spirit guides, and past-life memories • Are extremely artistic and creative • Prefer vegetarian meals and juices to \"regular food\" • May be fearless explorers and clim bers, with an amazing sense of balance Children of the Millennium Shift The year was 1995, a time when many of us felt a gnawing restlessness in our bellies. On the heels of the materialistic '80s, we were searchin g for meaning, and avenues to contribute to the worlds well-being. It was the beginning of a ne w spiritual renaissance, as we learned to look inward for answers and fulfillment. Many individuals had profound spi ritual experiences that year. I sh ould know: It was on July 15, 1995, that an angel's loud, booming voice help ed me escape unscathed from an attempted armed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"carjacking. Since that experience , I've devoted my life to teaching others about spirituality. And I've met countless people worldwide who also had major wake-up calls that year. No wonder, then, that the Crystal Children started to arrive at that time. They knew that adults were finally ready for children's higher vibrat ions, and their purer way of living. Some older Crystal Children already existed on the planet. They were the scouts - the first generation of Crystals who came to check out the situation an d report home during dreamtime transmissions. The earliest Crystals were the on es who signaled that 1995 was the year when the coast was clear for a large infusion of high-level babies. The numb er of Crystals born continues to escalate. And each year's crop of freshly born Crystal Children reveals increa singly profound spiritual abilities. Misunderstood Gifts As mentioned earlier, the generation preceding the Crystal Children are referred to as the Indigo Children, and they paved the way. One of the spiritual gifts of the In digos is their ability to sniff out dishonesty, like a dog senses fear. Indigos know when they're being lied to, patronized, or manipulated. And since their collective purpose is to usher in a new world of integrity, the Indigos' inner lie detectors are integral. Again, this warrior spi rit threatens some adults. Additionally, the Indigos are unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home, work, or school. They don't have the ability to dissociate fr om their feelings and pretend that everything's okay... unless they're me dicated or sedated. Crystal Children's innate spirit ual gifts are also misunderstood - specifically, their telepathic abilities, which often cause them to start talk ing long after most toddlers begin to do so. In the new world that the Indigos are ushering in, we'll all be m uch more aware of our intuitive thoughts and feelings; we won't rely so much on the spoken or written word. Communication will be faster, more direct, and more honest, because it will be mind-to-mind. Already, increasing numbers of us are getting in touch wi th our psychic abilities. Our interest in the paranormal is at an all-time high, fueled by books, TV shows, and movies on the topic. So it's not surprising that the generation following the Indigos are incredibly telepathic. As touched on above, many of the Crystal Children have delayed speech patterns, and it's not uncommon for them to wait until they're three or four years old to be gin speaking. But parents have no trouble communicating with their silent children - far from it! Parents engage in mind- to-mind communication with their Crystal Children; and the Crystals use a combination of telepathy, self-fashioned sign language, and sounds (including song) to get their point across."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The trouble starts when the Crystals are judged by medical and educational professionals to have \"abnormal\" speaking patterns. It's no coincidence that as greater numbers of Crystals are being born, the number of diagnoses for autism is at a record high! It's true that the Crystal Children are differe nt from other generations, but why do we need to pathologize these differences? If the children are successfully communicating at home, and the parents aren't reporting any problems... then why create trouble where it doesn't exist? The diagnostic criteria for autism is quite clear: The autistic person lives in his or her own world and is disconnected from other people. The aut istic person doesn't talk because of an indifference to communicating with others. Crystal Children are quite the opposite. As you'll read later on, they're among the most connected, communicative, caring, and cuddly of any generation. They're also quite philosophical and spiritually g irted - and they display an un precedented level of kindness and sensitivity. For example, I received more storie s than I could fit in this book about Crystal Children spontaneously hugging people in n eed. An autistic person wouldn't do that! There are plenty of stories about great historical fi gures who started talking later in life - Albert Einstein being among the most famous. Einstein's si ster, Maja, noted that her brilliant brother didn't begin speaking until he was well over two years old. According to U.S. News & World Report (December 9, 2002), Einstein first uttered a sentence to complain that his milk was too hot. His stunned parents asked why he hadn't spoken earlier. \"Because,\" the little genius supposedly replied, \"previously everything was in order.\" In my book The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children , I wrote that ADHD should stand for \"Attention Dialed into a Higher Dimension. \" This would more accurately describe that generation of kids. In the same vein, Crystal Children don't warrant a label of autism. They aren't autistic - they're awe -tistic! That's right - these children are worthy of aw e, not labels of dysfunction. If anyone's dysfunctional, it's the systems that don't accommodate the continuing evolution of the human species. If we shame these children with labels or medicate them into submission, we'll have undermined a heaven-sent gift - we 'll crush a civilization before it takes root. Fortunately, there are many positive solutions and alternatives. And the same heaven that sent us the Crystal Children can assist those of us wh o are advocates for these kids. The How and Why of This Book"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I first became aware of the Crystal Children as I traveled around the world giving workshops about the angels. I noticed the Crystals' eyes and magnetic personalities. I held mental conversations with the children and could clearly hear them answering my questions telepathically. I'd watch them smile in respo nse to my mentally projected compliments. These kids hear my thoughts! I realized. Over the next few years, I interviewed children and parents for my book The Care and Feeding of Indigo Children . I've always been fascinated with finding patterns among human behavior. Although we're all as unique as snowflakes, the snowflakes share co mmonalities. With the Indigo Children, I noticed the traits described earl ier. With the Crystal Children, my research took even more interest ing twists and turns. During this time, I received five or six unsolicited psychic readings from students and psychic associates who all told me the same thing: They saw that I was pregnant with a very special child. Well, I definitely wasn't pregnant; however, I now know that my psychic fr iends were seeing the Crystal Children around me. Th ese Crystals were giving me messages that they wanted included in this book. I found myself falling in love with each young Cryst al Child I met. Their hearts were as open and loving as any angel with whom I'd interacted. I found them to be unguarded and unpretentious. I'd go to sleep thinking about the children, an d wake up with volumes of information given to me by the spirit world (perhaps by the Crystals themselves?) while I slept. Each morning I'd wake up knowing more about the Crystal Children than I'd previously known the evening before! I began lecturing about the Crystals and found my audiences very receptive. Many of them were parents, grandparents, or teachers of these special youngsters. They instantly recognized their children's characteristics as I described them. I went on to ask audience members and sub scribers of my newsletter to complete a questionnaire about their Crystals. Within one day of my putting out that request, I received hundreds of replies. For this book, I reviewed nu merous stories submitted to me by people who are raising and teaching these remarkable children. As I reviewed the survey results, two things happe ned. First, I felt my heart swell with love and gratitude. Just reading the stories made me feel as if I were in the presence of mighty angels! I felt a sense of ecstasy as I acknowledged these a mazing kids' presence on our planet. I also felt reassured about our collective future. God wo uldn't have sent this special breed of humans to Earth if we were on our last legs as a civilizat ion or planet. Just as humans have evolved from ape-like postures, the Crystal Ch ildren provide concrete evidence that we're progressing from an evolutionary standpoint. Second, I found clear - might I say crystal clear? - patterns among each"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"survey respondent. I read dozens of similar stories about the Crystals an d their relationships to animals, plants, rocks, and the elderly, for inst ance. I pored over many st ories with eerily similar accounts about children telepathically communicating with their parents... while eschewing verbal communication. Many parents told me, \"I could never relate to the descriptions of Indigo Children. My youngster seemed different. But the Crystal Child profi le - that one perfectly fit my child!\" Most parents reported a happy relationship with their Crystal Children marked by very few problems. I heard from parents and grandparents around the globe who described their Crystals as \"angels,\" \"the loves of my li fe,\" \"true joys,\" and so on. I noticed that not only were the Crystal Children highly spiritually sensitive, but so were their parents. The souls of Crystals were obviously selecting moms and dads who could raise them in a spiritually nurturing environmen t. Occasionally I met children who came through spiritually unaware parents. In these cases, their grandpar ents were highly evolved lightworkers who helped protect and hone the childr en's spiritual knowledge and gift s. Most parents told me that their Crystal Children were profound spiritual teachers who taug ht them a great deal about being exceptionally loving and kind. One day I was lecturing about Crystals in Sydn ey, Australia. During the midday break, Reid Tracy, the president of Hay House (who was ther e selling my other books), asked me, \"What's this book that everyone's asking me about? Th ey all want to buy a Crystal Children book.\" I laughed and told him that there was no such book yet; I was simply reporting the data I'd gathered from interviews and my own channelings. Reid remarked, \"Well, they obviously want the book. Will you write it?\" Without hesitation, I heard myself reply, \"Yes, of course I will.\" You now hold the results of that decision in your hands! Whether you're a parent, a parent-to-be, a grandp arent, an educator, a health-care provider, or someone who's simply interested in children an d spirituality, may this book provide validation and guidance for you and your Crystal Children! Doreen Virtue, Ph.D., Laguna Beach, California Chapter 1: In the womb"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It seems that everything involving Crystal Ch ildren is extraordinary, beginning with their conception. Several letter writers described ho w easily they conceived their Crystals. Mothers also told me that they communicated with their children prior to conception. Katharina, for instance, is a new mother of a nine-week-old boy. She says: \"My son contacted me prior to his conception to let me know that he wanted to be born. He was conceived in Glastonbury, England, on e of the sacred places of this planet, which is often called Earths heart chakra. \"I've heard that magic surrounds the Crystal Children, and this is certainly true for my son. Since his conception, many wonderful th ings have manifested for us on the physical plane, including a house in a very specia l place and an increas ed flow of money.\" I also received several letters from grandmothe rs who had telepathic conversations with their unborn grandbabies. Many of the women I surveyed and interviewed told me that their pregnancies were challenging, yet filled with magical spiritual experiences an d personal growth. Several mothers described having telepathic communication with their unborn Crystal Children: • One woman said that during her pregna ncy, she received many messages from her unborn baby. The mother explained that while carrying her now four-month-old daughter, \"she told us countless times that she was a girl, but we stubbornly didn't believe her. She also told us the exact date on which she would be born, and she was!\" • Another mother, Danica Spencer, said she had very potent dreams about powerful priestesses throughout her pregnancy (she later gave birth to a daughter). • And Lori, the mother of 12-week-old Isabelle, had a physical healing during her pregnancy that she credits to he r unborn child. Lori recalls: \"I just knew from the moment of conception that my baby was very special and had so much love and light within her. Before becoming pregnant with Isabelle, I had some problems with abnormal cells found in my cervix, which were going to have to be removed after I gave birth."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"While I was pregnant, they ran a Pap smear every couple of months to make sure that the cells weren't changing. After the first test, all the abnormal cells were gone, and in every test thereafter, the cells couldn't be found, without any evidence th at they'd ever been there! I know this happened because of the very special child growing inside of me. \"Often, Isabelle would come to me in my dreams and during my meditations. I could communicate with her long before she was born . There was also an amazing energy that you could feel radiating from my belly. The only way I can describe this energy is very bright, warm, glowing, an d overflowing with love.\" The Crystal Children have amazingly intense connections with nature, as you'll read about a little later. Cynthia Berkeley had a foreshadowing of her daughter's love for the water while she was pregnant with her. Cynthia says: \"I went swimming with the dolphins when I was pregnant with Leah, and ever since, she's had a natural affinity for water. While she was in the womb, Leah seemed to have conversations with the baby whales we saw on two separate days. She was just twisting and turning and kicking an d vibrating in there! I've taken her swimming in the pool several times since she was an infant, and she always wants to put her head under the water. Leah loves it! At 15 months old, she's already trying to swim on her own.\" Giving Birth I received several letters from mothers who said that their Crystal Children telepathically communicated their correct date of birth. Kathy DiMeglio had a magical experience with Mother Mary that seemed to influence her daughter Jasmyn's birth date. Kathy said that during her pregnancy, she felt very connect ed to Mary, and learned that he r birthday was September 8. Since this was eight days before Kathy's expected due date, she prayed to Mother Mary to help her give birth on September 8 instead. Kathy says: "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"\"I remember simply praying to Mary that our ch ild be born on her birthday and letting it go at that. I forgot all about my prayer until I was in full hard labor at the hospital. At one point, I asked my husband what the date was, and he said, 'It's Thursday, September 8 th .' I knew it was a miracle. I knew it was a gift. I even had a statue of Mary in the birthing room.\" Several mothers said that they were struck by their newborn Crystal Child's eyes and magnetism from the moment of birth. For example, Andrea Kiger recalls: \"My three-year-old daughter, Abbie, has been different from the moment she was born. When I delivered her, they laid her on my chest and I was overcome with emotion, more so than with my first baby. As I sobbed, she calmly folded her hands and interlocked her fingers and just stared into my eyes. She didn't cry at a ll! The nurses were a little disturbed over this, as they all thought it was quite strange. I was almost frightened by the experience. I felt as though I were l ooking into the eyes of an ancient being. She never blinked, but just looked into me. I defin itely felt that she was communicating with me.\" The Crystal Children have an au thoritative air about them, as if they're wise adults in little bodies. Even more, they seem like seasoned sa ges... little sorcerers and high-priestesses. The power that they exert from infancy can hold sw ay over adults. This power doesn't come from brute force, though, but from st eely determination and crystal-cle ar intentions. When parents first encounter their children's power, it can take them aback. Lisa Roulet is the mother of 20-month-old Kaitly n, who exhibited remarkable personal power just days after she was born. Lisa explains: \"Kaitlyn was born three and a half weeks earl y. She slept almost all the time for the first three weeks. When she was just six days old (and should have still been in the womb), I first became aware of her extraordinary pres ence and power. On that day, against my better judgment, I listened to other people's ad vice to try to keep her awake more. When I nudged her, Kaitlyn gave me a strong look communicating power, confidence, and authority that told me in no uncertain term s to stop bothering her and let her sleep. I honestly felt that I was in the presence of a deity that night.\" "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Crystal Children do share characteristi cs such as charisma an d magnetism with deities, which you'll read about in the next chapter. These traits are undoubtedly part of the package that will make them great leaders in the future. Chapter 2: Oh, those eyes! As I touched on earlier, the most distinctive trai t of the Crystal Children is their intense, wide- eyed stare. They seem to see everything with those big eyes! Sometimes their gaze is unnerving, as they seem to lay bare your soul's secrets. As they lock eyes with yours, it feels like a high-level being is scanning you. Penny describes her two-year-old daughter, Samantha, as having \"eyes that seem to go straight through to your soul.\" Many mothers reported that their Crystal Child had intense eyes from day one. Keli Carpenter says that from the moment of her son Dakota's birth six months ago, he's looked intensely into people's eyes \"as if he 's speaking to you. Eve ryone comments on it.\" Dakota's grandmother, Wynona, adds, \"He looks very deep ly into my eyes, and it feels as if he can see into my very soul. Just a couple of days aft er he was born, he stared into my eyes for more than 20 minutes.\" Wynona said that she found herself speaking to him in her mind, and it felt as if he were communicating with her in some way - that he \"kne w the truth of me and all things. It felt strange and exciting at the same time.\" Another Crystal Child's mother, Pam Ca ldwell, expressed similar sentiments: \"Since the second that Hannah came out, she just stared at me with her dark and piercing eyes, sea rching my eyes and soul. It was ve ry penetrating - not uncomfortable at all, but deep. She was so aware even from he r first minute! She's made many people in the grocery store uncomfortable because of her intense gaze. It's not creepy. It's just so obvious that Hannah can see right through people and read them.\" These observations about the Crystal Children's eyes aren't just rooted in parental pride. Kelly Colby-Nunez has five children, and she notices a definite difference in the eyes of her three younger children (ages 6, 4, and 15 months). Ke lly says about her younger children, \"One look"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"into their eyes and you know they're highly intelligent and have more wisdom than the older children and us adults. Th eir eyes just sparkle like light re flecting off crystal. People comment on this all the time.\" Crystals' eyes reflect their deep spiritual understanding. They're loving, patient, and kind eyes - like those of angels. Nadia Leu is the mother of Celeste, age 18 months. Nadia recalls, \"From the first look she gave us, Celeste seemed to be so wise and compassionate, so understanding, and at the same time so above all human suffering. From the time of her birth on, she's had a very strong and knowing look in her eyes, and her demeanor has always been very calm and assured in all situations.\" These expressive and intense eyes are one reason wh y Crystal Children start talking later in life, as they communicate so much through their eyes alone. Their eyes are part of the mesmerizing power that Crystal Children have over grown-ups as well. Many parents told me that their children's eyes hypnotized adults. For instance, Phillipa said that her 18-month-old daughter, Isabella, creates quite a stir with her eyes. She sa ys, \"No matter where we go, people stop in their tracks to come close to Isabella, to be in her energy and to look into her crystal-blue eyes. In most instances, they become totally captivated. Once Isabella locks eyes with someone, it's very hard for them to look away - until my daughter is good and ready to let them go.\" Magnetic Personalities The Crystal Children's magnetism is reminisce nt of those old-fashioned hypnotists who would say, \"Look into my eyes... deeply, de eply, look into my eyes!\" Howeve r, the Crystals' stares aren't manipulative. These children are merely gathe ring information about humans and the planet. They're also sending out messages of love throug h their eyes, and this energy is a gift that we desperately need right now. The Crystal Children see past th e surface of people. They see the inner Divine light, and their eyes are open in awe as they take everything in. The love radiating from the C rystals is irresistible. Even people who normally shy away from kids are drawn to the warm pers onalities of the Crystal Children. Lori, the mother of 12-week-old Isabelle, whom we met earlier, says the attention her daughter attracts is unusual - even for a cute baby! Lori explains: "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"People are very attracted to her. Now I know that people love babies and are very interested in them, but this is different, Isab elle seems to draw others to her like a magnet of pure love and light. Everyone alwa ys seems to have the same comments about her. They always say how beautiful she is, and yes, all babies are beautiful... but not like this. There's something so special about her that just radiates from within, a truly loving glow about her that makes her especially beau tiful. Isabelle also has the most incredible eyes. They're so filled with l ove, understanding, and wisdom.\" The Crystal Children are giving healing doses of love to people wherever they go. They're like mobile energy healers, pushed in strollers by parents who may not realize the important function they're playing in taki ng their children out in public. Stephanie and Mark Watkeys of New South Wal es, Australia, are the proud parents of 13- month-old Bryn. The Watkeys say: \"Bryn magnetically attracts people wherever he goes. All sorts of people speak to him and just want to be around him. Our son is an abso lutely delightful child, full of laughter and light, and he has the full attention of people wherever he goes. He's very sociable and animated. Everyone who meets him comments on how alert he is. It's as if his eyes are drinking in everything and everyone around him. At 13 months, he has the look of a wise old man, yet the lightheartedness of a happy baby!\" And Victoria's grandmother reports that her three-year-old granddaughter has always been aware of things, and that she's bright and sensit ive far beyond her years. \"Victoria is always the center of attention, even when she doesn't say a wo rd,\" her grandmother says. \"Perfect strangers are drawn to her and speak with her without any apparent provocation.\" This phenomenon points to the origination and purpose of the Crystal Children. Their high- level spiritual frequencies and their ego-free person alities indicate that they're very spiritually evolved. Where did they come from? They share similarities with the accounts of extraterrestrials who have large eyes and small mouths and who communicate telepathically. Yet, the warmth of the Crystal Children exceeds the reports of the mechanical energy emitted in most extraterrestrial (E.T.) encounters. Perhaps we're meeting a hybrid type of incarnat ed angel, masquerading as beautiful little boys and girls. Yet one things certain: These children are here to both teach us and to save us... from"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ourselves. But we must help the Crystal Children to help us. The first step is to understand their uniquely wonderful qualities. Chapter 3: Late-talkers, telepathy, and trances At age two, Harry was diagnosed as \"autistic\" when it was apparent that his speech development lagged behind normal. At first, his parents and doctor thought that Harry had a hearing problem, so they had grommets (protective loops) placed in his ears. But Harry still didn't speak. His mother, Karenanne, says: \"Harry has always had a very sunny temperament and showed no angst at being unable to speak. It was like talking was something he 'd do when he was good and ready. It was the same with his reading skills. He showed no interest in baby books, yet when he got interested in Pokemon, he rapidly showed that he indeed knew how to read, and he just pored over those handbooks.\" At age five, Harry began to speak. It was as if his reading and writing ski lls were awakened after lying dormant for many years. Now at age nine, Harry reads children's encyclopedias for fun and has developed a good general knowledge for his age. Was Harry autistic previously? His personality doesn't indicate that. Remember that autism describes a condition where people live in their own little worlds, disconnected from others. They don't speak because they don't notice others. Harry, in contrast, quite frequently asks strangers questions, and he'll approach other children to inquire about a toy they're carrying. Harry's mother says that she's gotten used to her son approaching strangers now. \"And the surprising th ing is,\" she remarks, \"that people sense his loving energy and accept it without getting an gry at the invasion of their space. He's showing them how to be more open.\" So why was Harry diagnosed as auti stic? Does speaking or reading later than expected warrant such a serious diagnosis? Why not call these sensitive children \"late-talkers\" instead of pathologizing them with psychiatric diagnoses and making them feel ashamed of themselves?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Hundreds of parents around the globe have subm itted stories for this book, telling about their Crystal Children who \"took their sweet time\" to begin speaking. Perhaps instead of labeling this phenomenon \"an epidemic of autism,\" as the media and medical establishment has done, we should examine it for indications of humankind's evolution. Who knows - maybe we don't need speaking anymore! Perhaps it's as antiquated as the toes that we once used for climbing trees! Could telepathy be akin to the opposable thumbs we developed through evolution - that is, a necessary new tool for a changing world? Truly, speech does seem clumsy and imprecise compared to mental communication. Many scientists at large univ ersities such as Stanford, Princeto n, and Yale have studied the phenomenon of mind-to-mind communication. Thes e studies yield verifia ble data supporting the premise that telepathy is a measurable behavior that definitely exists. I wrote about this scientific research in my book The Lightworker's Way (Hay House, 1997). I remember my initial (big) experience with telepathy. I was 17, and my beloved grandfather had just been killed in an auto accident. An hour aft er his death, his apparition came to me. I was wide-awake, sober, and in full communication with him. He had a bluish-wh ite glow around him but otherwise looked just like he always had. Then he began speaking to me - not with his mouth, but with his mind. I heard his voice inside my head as plainly as if he were alive and talking into my ear. He told me not to grieve for him, that he was fine. We communicated a bit more, and then he was gone. My grandfather's br other, who lived in a d istant city, also reported seeing his spirit that same night. That incident taught me to trust the menta l communications that I'd regularly received throughout my life from angels and the spirit world. It helped me when I became a full-time psychic medium years later. And it continues to assist me in my writing and speaking work. When people compliment me on my psychic abilit ies or prolific writing ab ilities, I always reply, \"Thank you. I'm a good listener.\" Being a parent to a Crystal Chil d means being a good listener as well. In fact, just having a Crystal seems to awaken latent psychic abilities in parents. Andrea Kiger calls her three-year-old daughter, Abbie, \"a classic Crystal Child\" be cause she matches the des cription so perfectly. Andrea says that not only did she give birth to th is special little being, but she also gave birth to her own psychic abilities. She recalls, \"Out of no where I was able to know things, and see and communicate with those who have passed over. Th is all came about the very day after Abbie's birth. I'm certain that it was an awakening for me.\" Those who have had near-death ex periences report an increase in psychic abilities afterward. Many also say that being in the presence of great love, such as that which exists in the afterlife"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"plane, opens us up psychically. So it's not surprisin g that parenting a super-loving Crystal Child would have this same effect. C rystals also choose psychically sen sitive parents and grandparents as part of their \"survival on Earth\" techniques. Aft er all, if kids aren't going to communicate verbally, they need to choose telepathic moms and dads to ensure that their needs are met. As I've mentioned, it's very common for Crystal Children to begin speaking at age three or later. This was the case for Teresa Zepeda, whose six-y ear-old daughter is fittingly named \"Crystal.\" Teresa says: \"Crystal only spoke three words ( Mama , Dada , no ) up until age three, when she suddenly started using complete sentences. Prior to that age, she used grunts and charades. We called her 'cave baby.' But she also had a wa y of letting us know what she wanted without saying anything. I guess she was communicating with telepathy. It had to be. How else would I know what she was thinking?\" Teresa's daughter exemplifies a pattern that many parents describe, wh ereby the children go from minimal verbalization to more comprehen sive speaking skills virtually overnight. Catherine Poulton says that her son Kylan, age five, was about three years old before he could talk. \"Kylan didn't speak, didn't even form nouns, and then sudden ly one day he started talking in complete sentences.\" The issue of late-talking only seems to be a problem for those who worry. For more relaxed parents, it's a non-issue. Such is the case for Beverly Moore, mot her of Ethan, age five. Beverly says that \"Ethan didn't talk until he was about age three. He never had the 'baby talk' sound either. I wasn't too concerned, as I figured he'd speak when he had something to say. I never had a problem knowing what Ethan wanted.\" However, it's not always easy for parents to nonchalantly accept that their children are \"different.\" One woman told me that she feel s embarrassed around other mothers because she suspects that they judge her for h aving a \"mute\" son. So some parents take the matter into their own hands, doing research, reading all the books ab out late talking, and instituting behavioral and dietary modifications to spur their children's language development. Evie says that her two- year-old daughter, Mei, responded po sitively to homeschooling. She says: \"Mei was a happy and alert baby who walked at ten months, yet she decided not to speak until later, and we had to evaluate her for speech impairments. She tested very highly in the social and cognitive areas, but she just wouldn't speak. At around 15 months, she"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"spoke a few words here and ther e. In fact, her first word wa s 'Hi!' The doctor said that she was about four months behind in speaking . So I worked with her at home, and now she talks a lot. At age two, she knows all of her colors, letters, and the numbers one through ten.\" Several mothers told me that their Crystal Children appreciated the extra attention that homeschooling provided, and that the kids' vocabularies grew as a result. Still, there are many ways to communicate. Ma ny parents commented that their children created their own form of sign language. One woman said that her child went through deliberate motions to teach her this self-styled way of comm unicating so that they could understand each other. Kelly Colby-Nunez says that her youngest children prefer to communicate through drawings: \"My children (ages 6, 4, and 15 months) prefer drawing to speaking and will spend hours doing so. My six-year-old also told me that he often commun icates with his friends without talking.\" Perhaps one reason why Crystal Children speak later than previo us generations is that verbal speech is foreign to them. This is what Sue Jali l suspects about her four-year-old son, Sean: \"Sean's very telepathic, and his speech was late in developing, so late that he had a grommet put in to help him hear better. It's only recently that he's managed to overcome some of the speech difficulty. Even now, though , some letters are very hard for him to form. I believe that this is his first time on planet Earth, and that to use his mouth and tongue to communicate is very foreign to him, where in the past he was just telepathic. By the way, the grommet made no difference whatsoever.\" Many parents and doctors suspect that late-t alkers have a medically based hearing problem. Penny said that both of her daughters didn't talk until they were three years old. She had both girls' ears tested, which revealed that their hear ing was fine. Penny says that she hadn't really been worried, though: \"Something told me that the problem wasn't with their hearing. My instincts told me that my children just didn't feel an overwhelming need to talk yet. My oldest seemed to have a language all her own. We didn't understand what she was saying, but she was talking all the time. And with both girls, I always seem ed to know what they wanted or needed.\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Penny says that her biggest challenge with he r Crystals was how othe rs perceived them. She recalls: \"People would ask my kids qu estions about things, and they wouldn't answer or didn't know. There are certain expect ations when people talk to a child that age, but my children didn't fit those. For example, I woul d try to teach them how old they were or where their nose was, and they were totally uninterested in learning these things.\" Penny remembers feeling embarrassed and judged wh en her children woul dn't answer people's questions. She recalls that the baby-sitter turned her in to Children's Protection Services because her daughters didn't talk much and were barking and pretending that they were dogs. Like many Crystal Children , Penny says that her daughters' motor skill development was right on track, but their verbal skills lagged behind, in comparison to the norm. Yet, when each girl reached the age of three, they suddenly opened up and began speaking normally. Penny says, \"I never had any doubt that they were bright kids. I have to keep reminding myself that it's okay that my children are different. They're going to be very special people. I just know it.\" The parents who seem to have the easiest time with their late-talking children are those who learn to communicate telepathically, and who re cognize and use body language. A mother who's actually named Crystal says, \"My daughter's al most two. She doesn't speak yet and doesn't feel the need to. We can look at each other and know what the other wants, so for now it seems that speech isn't necessary.\" Another mother named Misty Rose had an easy time communicating nonverbally with her daughter, Leah. However, Misty says, \"When Leah was 12 months old, we had to remind her that not everyone could communicate with her telepathically, so she had to use her words.\" That bit of information seemed to help. Now two, Leah speaks at the level of three- and four- year-olds. Part of the pact that parents have wit h Crystal Children is sho wing them \"the ropes\" of living on Earth. Telepathic Communication"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Crystal Children are born psychic. As babies, their heads and eyes turn as they clearly see angels and spirit guides. With inborn spiritual gi fts, it's normal for them to be profound mind- readers as well. Many parents told me stories similar to Natarsha's. Natarsha is the mother of five-year-old Tyrique. She says that her son's statements have always stunned her. Natarsha exclaims, \"I swear he reads my mind!\" One day the two were riding on a bus in sile nce. Natarsha mentally wondered whether Tyrique would spend the upcoming weekend with his dad. Suddenly, Tyrique blurted out, \"Dad's picking me up on Friday to go to his house.\" The following day, Natarsha was thinking about what to make for dinner when Tyrique said, \"Mom, I have a good idea. Why don't you make that rice dish for dinner?\" When Natarsha asked Tyrique how he knew what she was thinking, he replied, \"God told me in my head.\" Tyrique's spiritual listening skills have proven handy on more than one occasion. Natarsha was dressing for work one day, struggl ing to zip up her pants. They weren't tight; they just weren't zipping. Just then, Tyrique entered the room and said, \"Mommy, you have to button your pants first and then the zipper will work.\" Natarsha wondered how Tyrique even knew that she was having problems with her zipper. She says, \"I thought I'd humor him by complying with his statement, so I buttoned my pants as he watched me, and then tried the zipper, thinking, This isn't going to work. \" The zipper went up without a hitch! When Natarsha asked Tyrique ho w he knew to come to the bathroom to help her, he simply stated, \"I just kno w. I listen to my mind,\" and he walked off. To this day, Natarsha has to button those pants for the zipper to work. * * * The Crystal Children teach us to trust our intuitive thoughts and feelings. Like Natarsha, Carolyn asked her six-year-old daughter, Haley, ab out her telepathic abilities. Haley replied that she could see into her mother's br ain and also see her thoughts. I've taught psychic-development cl asses worldwide since 1996, and I've found that one of the most important things to do when trying to dev elop psychically is to notice and trust the thoughts, feelings, words, and visions that enter your mind. The Crystal Children are brilliant role models for doing so. Jaimie says that he r 18-month-old daughter, Isabella, confidently"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"announces, \"Daddy, Daddy\" moments before her fathe r arrives home. Often when the telephone rings, she says, \"Nanny,\" and sure enough , her grandmother is on the phone. One reason why children are so psychic is their indifference to whether they're merely imagining these intuitive messages. They don't anguish about whether something is make-believe or real. To children, it's all real! The Crystal Children are clearly mind-readers. Magda says that her four-year-old daughter frequently verbalizes what she's thinking. \"For instance,\" she recalls, \"one evening I saw her sleeping in bed and thought, I love you , and she replied in her sl eep, 'I love you, too!'\" As Crystals grow up, this telepathy can either be polished or squelched. The former happens when parents praise the child's gift and learn how to develop it in themselves. The latter occurs when parents show fear or anxiety in response to their child's ability to read minds. Telepathy is part of the Crystal Children's Divine arsenal to help rid the earth of deceit. When someone is fully telepathic, no one can lie to them. As the Crystal Children progress into adulthood, they'll know with certainty if a politician or salesperson is deceiving them. Collectively, they'll compel the inhabitants of our planet to live with integrity. Telepathy has a more immediate benefit as we ll. Crystal says that she uses telepathy to communicate with her three-year-old daughter, Zoey, in emergency situati ons. For instance, if Zoey strolls away from her, Crystal telepathically shouts \"Stop!\" and Zoey immediately halts and turns to look at her mother. Going into Trances Sometimes Crystal Children go into trances where they seemingly don't hear their parents. This can happen particularly when they 're outside in nature. This tran celike state is a characteristic often used to diagnose autism. But with Crystal Children, this woul d be an inaccurate diagnosis, because these kids are just tuning out the world temporarily . Not only that, but Crystal Children are very empathetic, connected, and loving with other people. Truly autistic kids exhibit no sense of connection at all with the outside world. Personally, I go into trances when I'm channeli ng or receiving infor mation. Before I fully acknowledged my spiritual gifts, I actually received many angel messages while watching television. That's because television focuses the mi nd on a single spot, in much the same way that scrying mirrors (black mirrors used for divina tion) and crystal balls are focal points."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Andrea says that her three-year-old daughter, A bbie, also goes into trances when she watches television. Andrea explains: \"When the television set is on, Abbie gets 'suc ked in' to the point where she can't hear anyone around her. We really have to limit her TV time. Abbie is a gentle soul and healer who's one with nature and animals. As much as technology goes against who she is, she seems to get sucked into it and can't escape its grip. We have to turn off computers and TVs to get her to interact with the family again.\" Another mother, Denise Bunning, said that her da ughter Alice used to go into trances when she was younger. Denise would use her hands to turn Alice's face toward her to get her full attention. Now at age five, Alice uses the s ame method with her mother. Whenever Denise ignores her daughter, the little girl t urns her mother's face toward her own! As touched on above, many parents told me that th eir children become incredibly focused - as if they're in a trance - when they'r e outside in nature. The Crystal Ch ildren sit and stare at bugs or leaves for minutes at a time. This focusing ability is a gift that the Crystals will find useful in the future as they assume leadership roles as adults. Chapter 4: A high degree of sensitivity Crystal Children rely on their intuition to discern the truth about people and situations instead of making assessments based on physical appearance or judgments. Their intuition is like radar, constantly scanning their surroundings. Nobody can hide their true thoughts, feelings, or intentions from the Crystal Children's exquisit e awareness. Nor can these kids hide from an awareness of the truth, even if they'd rather not know it. Sometimes sensitivity can seem more like a curse than a blessing. Sensitive people may inadvertently absorb negative energies, and they can be adversely affected by them. Danica says that her son, Koa, is three years old and hig hly sensitive. Danica's greatest challenge is figuring out how to help her son when others' energy affects him. She says: \"Koa is so sensitive that if anyone's ang ry, frustrated, or experiencing any strong emotions (even if no one else would notice or if they're concealing it), he'll act it all out."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"It's difficult parenting highly sensitive ch ildren because they're so affected by their surroundings. Now that we have a wonderful home with exce llent energy, our son is a dream. In some of the previous places we've lived, the ener gy of the house alone was often cause for crying and confusion. Koa does best when surrounded by positive ener gy, and it's crucial for him to be in a house with good energy flow.\" One way to ensure that your home projects good energy is to practice the ancient Chinese art of room placement called Feng Shui. Space-clearing is another method. Th e former is described in wonderful detail in The Western Guide to Feng Shui by Terah Kathryn Collins, and I write about the latter in my book Angel Therapy (both are published by Hay House). Sensitive to World Energies The Crystal Children are very much affected by th e collective energy of the planet. When masses of people become afraid, or if a world-chan ging event is afoot, Crystals may become depressed or agitated. Sara says that her son, Zak, was two years old on September 11, 2001. They live in London, so the attacks occurred at about 10 P.M. their time . Zak had been asleep since 7:00 P.M. Sara heard the news about the Twin Towers on the news as it happened, and moments later, she heard strange noises coming from Zak's bedroom. Sara ran to her son's room and recalls the terrifying moments that followed: \"He was in a terrible state, clawing at his ne ck and fighting for breath! I'd never seen anything like that before! I heard a disemb odied voice say, 'Call an ambulance!' which I did. When the ambulance arrived, the em ergency team took one look at Zak and said, 'Code blue!' and rushed him to the hospital . Inside the ambulance, Zak struggled to breathe, and I feared he was about to leave the planet.\" Zak was turning blue by the time they arrived at the hospital, and the docto rs said he was having a life-threatening croup attack. Sara recalls, \"I kn ew it was terribly serious as I looked around at the doctors, who were ashen. I was guided to re move my crystal necklace and hold it over Zak,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"praying that he would heal. And he did. The doct ors later told me that it was the worst case of croup they'd ever seen.\" An American Crystal Ch ild named Chad was also highly empathetic to the global situation that was precipitated by Se ptember 11. A first-grader, Chad wrote about his feelings: \"My dream is to help the people of Afghanistan . They're dying. Even though they have killed many of the people in our country, you should treat other people the way you want to be treated. You should help your neig hbors. They have many sickne sses. It is sad that a ton of people did that, but I forgive them.\" Parents who worry that their children are depresse d, hyper, or anxious should check to see if world events are affecting them. Many children are impacted unconsciously by the world's energy. Invoke Archangel Michael to watch over your kids, or ask Mother Mary (both are nondenominational) to comfort them. Talk to your children, and allow them to express their fears and frustrations openly. The Nature of Sensitivity The generations prior to the Indigos and Crystals had the ability to pretend that everything was great even if it wasn't. The new children - especi ally the Crystals - don't have the option of going into denial. They feel others' emot ions as if they were their own. Catherine says that her three-year-old daughter is one of the most observant people she's ever met. She points out, \"Nothing slips by her. My daughter is very attun ed to people and their emotions. In fact, my husband and I must be ve ry careful if we disagree in front of her, because she tries to mediate for us and isn 't content until everyone is at peace. She keeps asking, 'Are you happy?' until we truly are.\" The Crystal Children are here as peacekeepers, and they tune in when someone isn't at peace. According to their mothers, Taylor, Emily, William, and Zoey are all three-year-olds who reflect this characteristic: • Taylor stops whatever he's doing when another ch ild cries. He'll ask, \"What's wrong?\" and inquire how he can help. Every day, he reports to his parents which children were crying at preschool, and why. It's as if his focus is on helping those who are sad."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"• Emily doesn't have a huge vocabulary, but when she does speak, she tends to focus on emotions. Her mother, Wendy, says, \"Emily is highly perceptive about the emotions boiling up in grownups, and somehow she possesses the language and the skills to label them and point them out (despite my efforts to shield my emotions and thoughts from her).\" • William gets his feelings hurt easily, and he's crushed when he thinks he's done something wrong but wasn't aware of it. • Zoey hugs and consoles anyone she sees crying. She says to them, \"It's okay, it's all right, want me to kiss you better?\" And she tells everyone she meets that she loves them. Rihana and Isabelle are acutely sensitive as well: • Rihana, 12 months, cries terribly whenever she believes she's hurt someone else, emotionally or physically. • Isabelle, 12 weeks old, gets upset very quickly if she's around angry or negative people, yet her mother adds: \"Isabelle brings a peace and ca lm to people. Her energy is so strong and loving that she has an instant calming effect on them.\" Sensitive Bodies Not only are the Crystal Children emotionally sensitive, but they're also physically sensitive. They can easily become overwhelmed by too much stimuli. • Crystal Children are sensitive to loud noise. Penny says that her two- and four-year-old daughters become very upset if someone raise s their voice in ange r. She says, \"I'm more careful now about how I communicate with the girls if I'm upset. Knowing that they feel emotions so strongly, I have to be careful about the volume or the intensity of anger in my voice.\" • Crystal Children are sensitive to crowds. Beth says that her three-year-old son, Taylor, can't handle being in large crowds. She reca lls, \"He's had this trait since birth. His preschool recently had a back-to-school nigh t, and Taylor wanted nothing of it - too much activity and noise, so he just ran outside and stood under a tree eating a cookie.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"• Crystal Children are sensitive to temperature. Cathy notices that her son, William, age three, feels cold more easily than other people. • Crystal Children are sensitive to clutter and disorganization. When Haley, six, feels that her room is too messy, she cleans it an d announces: \"I need a space clearing!\" Her mother then gives her a special bell to ring to clear the energy. After Haley ceremoniously rings the bell, she says, \"Mom, now the energy in my room is awesome! • Crystal Children are sensitive to chaotic environments. Mei, age two, becomes hyper when she's in a place with heightened activi ty, like a shopping ma ll at Christmastime. Her mother says that at ho me she's never hyper. • Crystal Children are sensitive to art ificial ingredients and chemicals. Jaimie says that her 18-month-old daughter, Isabella, has very sensitive skin. Jaimie explains: \"I only use natural ingredients on her skin now because it becomes dry when exposed to commercial soap. We use Evening Primrose Oil s oap instead. She always reacts better to natural remedies, and luckily my local ph armacist creates herbal remedies for many childhood ills. Isabella always vomits when she takes over-the-counter medication. She can't keep it down; her little body always rejects it like a reflex. However, she tolerates herbal medicines just fine.\" Seemingly Unbreakable Fortunately, angels watch over the sensitive Cr ystal Children. Many of them seem to be unbreakable, impervious to harm. Tori's mother says that even though her four-year -old daughter plays ro ugh with their pets, she always emerges unscathed. For example, Tori will lie on the floor while the family's big dogs trample about her, but she's only gotten a coupl e of minor scratches. And her large male cat bites at her but never leaves a mark. And Andrea reports that her six-month-old da ughter, Abbie, once escaped harm against all odds. Andrea explains, \"I was carrying Abbie when I slipped on some black ice in a parking lot.\" Andrea was horrified as her baby daughter lay facedown on the pavement, not moving at all. So Andrea quickly turned Abbie over, only to find th at her daughter was smiling, without a scratch on her."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Andrea says that Abbie has had many close calls when it comes to accidents, but somehow has never been hurt. \"It's almost like she's unbreakable physically, although emotionally she is 50 sensitive. She doesn't like loud noise, people fighting, violence, rough play, or red meat.\" So, Crystal Children can afford to be sensitive... they're protected - their ever-so-important life purpose ensures that heaven watches over them. Those who do get injured may go through that experience as part of their contract for spiritual growth. Many of the parents who wrote to me said that these children are not only impervious to injury, but they're also fearless. Perhaps one reason is that they expect the best. Their optimism attracts experiences of safety and protection. No Fear The little boy was amazing! As I sat outside at a re sort hotel in Kona, Hawaii, I couldn't take my eyes off this one kid. Dressed in an outfit so colorful that it would have made Joseph's dreamcoat look dull by comparison, the boy was walking on walls - I mean, literally! I figured that this kid was about seven years old, and he walked along the edges of the hotel's three-foot concrete wall like he was a four-whee l-drive truck. The wall's edge was narrower than the boy's foot, but no matter. The boy confidentl y walked without hesitation and didn't even come close to falling. Finally, his grandfather gr ew tired of watching the gravity-defying boy and asked him to come down. And down the boy jumped, bouncing as if he had spr ings in his feet as he and his grandpa walked off into the Hawaiian sunset. Since that day, I've noticed that Crystal Childr en have amazing motor skills. This mirrors recent trends with Intelligent Quotient (I. Q.) tests that measure two types of intelligence: verbal and nonverbal. The I.Q. rates for verbal skills are down, while nonverbal I.Q. 's are soaring high. And overall, the collective I.Q. scores are up, since both types of I.Q. scores are tallied together for a cumulative score. Many Crystals show remarkable motor-skill functioning, even in the face of lagging verbal skills. And these sparkling motor skills are combined wit h a brash fearlessness, which results in these children being brave explorers! The fearlessnes s seems to match the confidence that Crystal Children show in other areas, such as approaching wild animal s and making psych ic predictions."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Since fear is a function of the lower self - the ego - their fearlessness is one more indication of the high evolution of Crystal Children. They trus t, love, and enjoy themselves while exploring this planet! Cynthia Berkeley says that her 15-month-old daughter, Leah, is very comfortable in her body and has an amazing sense of exploration. Cynthia remarks: \"It's almost as if Leah doesn't have any fear at all! She climbs all over everything and can problem-solve how to maneuver things with th e greatest of ease. People comment about how physically advanced she seems to be. He r sense of spatial relationship is wonderful, and she was climbing up and down the sta irs by herself at nine months. We play at Gymboree, and she just loves to climb on everything! She has no sense of fear.\" Harry, whom you met in the previous chapte r, has always been free of fear. His mother, Karenanne, says this was a source of worry when he was small, but (more for his mother's sake than his own) he's learned to be careful. She sa ys, \"I believe that Harry kn ows that he's safe, and he never worries about anything. He tells me, 'I' ll be fine, Mummy.' Of course worry and fear are not part of his makeup if he's a higher vibrational soul.\" Not only are the Crystal Children fearless, but th ey seem to gain great pleasure from exploring their physical surrounding s. Tara says that her 16-month-old son, Grant, is very daring. She told me that \"Grant loves to balance! The other day I found him standing on his fire truck, balancing on the seat. Next, he balanced himself on the stee ring wheel! He held his arms high up in the air and was extremely proud of his accomplishments.\" Natural Instincts Perhaps these children are more natural, more in stinctual. They're more in touch with their bodies. After all, that's what the angels tell me our future looks like. Ever since childhood, I've seen visions of a world that's more natural, where technology is replaced with our own God- given abilities to communicate with telepathy. It 's a world with fresh air, clean water, a tropical atmosphere, and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. The new Crystal Children are a sneak preview to that world. They're definitely more in touch with their bodies!"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Ellen Welch recently purchased a yoga videotape for relaxation. She says, \"Since you're supposed to watch the tape before you do the poses, I put it on while I did some housework.\" Her four- year-old daughter, Erin, plopped right down in front of the television and performed all of the poses, stopping only to ask for certain props to help her with a particular pose. The videotape has two yoga sessions totaling about 70 minute s. Erin did yoga nonstop the entire time. While doing the poses, she said, \"Mama, this is 50 good for you. We shou ld do this every night before bed.\" Erin's right - we should. Chapter 5: Natural-born healers Crystal Children carry so much love in their hear ts that their mere presence has a healing effect, yet they also possess astonishingly innate skills in this area. Even very young Crystal Children seem to instinctively know how to direct en ergy with their hands, th oughts, and even with crystals to effect profound healings. The follo wing stories speak for themselves, offering us glimpses into a future characterized by natural and spiritual healing. Infant Healer Andrea's daughter's natural healing abilities we re evident during infancy. One day, Andrea was bedridden with an illness when her husband brou ght their seven-month-old daughter into the bedroom. Andrea says that her daughter sat ther e on the bed next to her, stared into her eyes, and then laid both of her hands on her stomach. \"This went on for almost ten minutes, and my husband was a bit freaked out over it. When she was done, she snapped back into being a 'normal baby' and wanted to play. I was floored.\" Taught by Angels When Haley was five, she began telling her parents about the angels she was seeing and hearing. She told them that she mostly worked with the Archangel of Physical Healing, Raphael. Haley said that the Knowledge Angel and the Love An gel taught her, too. She described the angels"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"bringing a machine into her room that taught he r how to heal people's bodies. She also talked about seeing shadows around people who were sick. Now at age six, whenever Haley is around an angry person, she puts her hand out an open window and flicks negative energy from th e room. Haley's mother, Carolyn, says: \"I love it when Haley places her hands on my shoulders, gently presses down on them, and I become calmer. Once during a ceremony we were holding, Haley got up, took the Tibetan singing bowl, and moved it over the tops of our heads. Then she came back and used her hands to open the top of our crown chakra. She did this so knowingly. She'd never done anything like this before, yet it felt so right and it was done with such gentleness, love, and compassion.\" A Boy Heals His Dog Magda says that she and her two children were devastated by the news that their dog, Gator, had a potentially fatal health condition. As Magda's daughter cried over the situation, her six-year- old son, Austin, calmly went into his bedroom an d retrieved the energy wand his grandmother (a spiritual healer) had given him. Austin then waved the crystal st one at the end of the wand over the dog. Amazingly, Gator laid down, as if the two were speaking to each other, and agreed to le t the healing begin. Austin waved the energy wand over Gator for abou t 30 minutes, telling him that he wasn't going to die and that he was making him better. When he was finished, Austin said to his mother gleefully, \"Mom, Gator's going to be fine. I us ed my magic wand on him, and he's better now.\" Austin (whose grandmother initiated him as a Reiki energy healer) continued to do Reiki treatments, using his energy wand on Gator for the next month. Magda reports, \"Gator's now perfectly healthy without any side effects, an d he and our family are happy and complete!\" She Heals Herself and Her Mother Teresa Zepeda says, \"My six-year- old daughter, Crystal, is definitely a healer!\" Teresa says that Crystal has instantly heal ed herself more than once."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"When the family went camping at a beach to cele brate Crystal's fourth birthday, the little girl started complaining of an earache. Teresa told her daughter to heal herself or they'd all have to leave the beach to take her to the doctor. This news upset Crystal, so Tere sa instructed her to go in the motor home and lie down, put her hand on her ear, and ask God and Jesus to heal her. Ten minutes later, Crystal came out of the motor home and was fine. No pain, no earache! Teresa says, \"Crystal is a strong-willed person. She wanted to stay at the beach so much that she made it happen.\" Another time Teresa's back ached, so she asked Crystal for a hands-on healing. She placed her little girl's hands on her back, but Crystal pulled them away and said, \"I don't have to put my hands on you to heal you.\" Teresa reports, \"The relief from the pain was immediate, as if it was never there in the first place. I've had severe back pain since I herniated some discs 14 years ago. Before Crystal's healing, I was often bedridden with back pain. Since the he aling, I haven't been bedridden once, and my back only bothers me a little now and then.\" Absolute Faith All types of healing have a faith component, whethe r it's traditional or alternative medicine, or spiritual healing. Studies show that the healer's and the patient's faith are important variables in determining the outcome of treatments. The Crystal Children have extraordinary faith in their abilities to heal, and this is undoubtedly on e reason why they're so effective at it. Three-year-old Victoria refers to herself as \"Dr. Toria,\" and she's alread y established a successful track record in alleviating headaches and ba ckaches for friends and family members. Since infancy, Victoria's been aware if someone is injured or not feeling well, and wants to kiss it away or touch it until it's all better. Victoria's grandmother says, \"Victo ria believes that you can 'throw bad things away,' and during her healing treatments, she mimics reaching into your boo-boo, snatchin g it up, and tossing it away, into the air. She's always been so aware of other people and their problems, and she's so certain she can fix them!\" One time Victoria and her gr andmother visited a nursing home . Of course, Victoria wanted to heal all of the residents. Her grandmother recall s that it was very difficult to convince her granddaughter that she couldn't cure a very old, infirm person of all their problems; or that a person in a wheelchair might be in God's hands. Victoria said, very solemnly, \"But Grandma, I"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"talk to God!\" Her grandmother notes that Victoria's belief in herself and her ability to change the world is amazing, and \"a beautiful thing to see.\" Comfort from the Crystal Children Not only do the Crystal Children heal physical bodies, they also mend peoples hearts. For example, they provide: • Emotional healing. After four-year-old Lois O'Neill's brother, Jack, passed away, 50 guests attended a wake at the family's h ome. Lois's dad, Mick, says that instead of attending to her own grief, his little daught er spent her time walking grieving adults around the garden. Lois explained to each perso n that Jack wasn't really gone. Mick says, \"Lois lightened their hearts with her explanation of our garden, the angels, and the fairies who live there.\" • Comfort. Four-year-old Colin intuitively knows how to comfort a person in need. One time when Colin and his parents were visit ing some relatives, one of the women became ill. Colin insisted on sitting with her in her bedroom. Even though she slept most of the time, Colin quietly sat by her side. Whenev er she'd awaken, Colin brought her cold drinks, or alerted the family if she needed something. He was a true source of healing energy and assistance. • Compassion. Studies show that children often avoid contact with disabled children, yet this new generation seems to break that mold. They show natural c ompassion for people with physical challenges. For instan ce, three-year-old Zoey makes friends predominantly with physically disabled children. One of Zoey' s playmates was born unable to walk and has a slight droop on one side of her body. Crystal, Zoey's mother, sa ys, \"This little girl has made a considerable amount of progress since beginning school with other children, an d also since her play dates with Zoey. It's been a very rewarding experience to know that there are no prejudice barriers in the eyes of our Crystal Children.\" • Counseling. Crystals have a knack for saying just the right thing to inspire, comfort, or uplift people. Naturally optimistic, they help others see the silver linings in life's clouds. At five years of age, Carter is already sho wing natural counseling abilities. Carter's"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"mother recalls the time her friend Ingrid came for a visit. Ingrid, a gifted hypnotherapist and artist, was feeling blue. Little Carter went up to her and said, \"You're a beautiful and talented therapist, Ingrid.\" Carter's mother remembers: \"Ingrid thought I' d coached Carter to say that. But I told her I hadn't, and that I'd never before heard Carter use the word therapist or talk about the concept of being talented. All I know is that Carter can psychically pick up who needs love, and then offer it.\" And offering that love is the collective mission of Crystal Children. They teach us to receive love. As their adult guides, our job is to nurture them so they'll be unafraid to love, to help them know that it's safe to talk about and feel deep emotio ns. We need to guide them, especially during the adolescent years, to remain their naturally loving selves. Chapter 6: Magical, spiritual children Even in households without any formal religious or spiritual focus, Crystal Children talk about profound, esoteric topics. Sometimes they learn ab out God, prayer, angels, ceremonies, and such from their parents. But very often, Crystals possess innate knowl edge about spirituality. They're little philosophers, high-priests, and priestesses. Cl early, they're tuned in to the Divine. They're also bringing in this knowledge from other lives. Erin, three years old, strolled into the living room as her parents were watching the movie Speed . The film was just finishing up, an d there was a scene depicting an airplane and a bus colliding in a huge, dramatic explosion. Erin thought it was a news program and that people had really been hurt. So she turned to her parents with a stunn ed look, got down on her knees, and exclaimed, \"We gotta pray to God!\" Erin's mother says, \"I wa s impressed that a three-year-old would leap so quickly from, 'Oh, no, this is awful,' to 'We need to seek Divine intervention to help these people.'\" Erin's reaction to tragedy - even though it wasn 't \"real\" - is heartening. It's one more indicator of where we're headed. Imagine a world where everyone turns to prayer - instead of fear or worry - in response to crises."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Crystal Children are highly philosophical, often talking about spiritual topics that seem more the domain of elders. Melissa says that her seven-year- old son, Liam, constantly asks questions that she wouldn't expect someone his age to wonder about. For instance, Liam frequently asks what a \"soul body\" is, who God is, and other such questions. Liam sometimes answers his own questions himself. Perhaps his queries trigger a channeled response. For instance, he'll say, \"We're all God.\" Melissa is grateful for Liam's spiritual quests. She says, \"As long as Liam continues to be the soul he is, then the world is a better place.\" Moon Energy The Crystal Children have strong connections to the energy of the earth, nature, and the moon and stars. Like ancient Druids, Babylonians, and Eg yptians, they're fascinated with starry skies and full moons. Perhaps their super-sensit ivity makes them acutely aware of th e powerful healing influences of the moon. Many Crystal Children can see the moon and stars at night before they become visible to adult eyes. In fact, moon was the first word that a Crystal Child named Isabella ever uttered! Her mother, Jaimie, explains, \"Isabella loves the moon and ca lled it 'moon the first ti me she saw it. This was before she said 'Mummy' or 'Daddy'! I'd taken he r outside on a beautiful inky-blue night, and Isabella gasped and pointed at the full moon in the sky and said, 'Ooooh, moon!' She was about nine months old at the time.\" Crystal Children are clearly enamored of th e moon. While other kids play with toys, Crystals are entertained by moonlit skies. Beth says that her three-year-old son, Taylor, loves to sit and gaze at the stars and moon. He'll spend hours just sittmg in h is bedroom in the dark, looking out his window at the night sky. These kids are also affected by the moon's cycles. Pe tra reports that her three-year-old daughter, Julie, normally sleeps all night without any pro blems. But on evenings when there's a full moon, Julie is awake for one to two hours a night. Magical Abilities"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Not only do Crystal Children have spiritual le anings and innate healing abilities, but some of them are also alchemists and Divine magician s. They defy laws of gravity, and move matter with their thoughts! Many parents shared detailed sto ries of their children's magical feats with me. In some cases, I was only granted permission to re late the stories under condition of anonymity. The parents feared repercussions if their children's gifts were widely discovered. Yet, as the witness to these stories, it's my opinion that they 're truthful. They have the emotion, detail, and authenticity that distinguish them from tall tales. I'll present some brief examples and let you be the judge. First, psychokinesis is the ability to move physical objects with one's mind or strong emotions. It also occurs when someone's personal power interrupts the electrical power of appliances, watches, batteries, or even streetlights. As you'll read here, some Crystal Children are performing amazing psychokinetic feats. For example, there's a seven-year-old boy who li ves in France whom I'll call Adam, since his mother and grandfather asked me to protect his identity. Adam speaks of li fe on other planets and several past lives, with details about culture, ethnic background, and language. Adam's mother says, \"When he was three years old, he sa t me down and told me, 'You know you weren't my first mommy. I chose you and Papa to be my parents now, and you're doing a good job.'\" Adam has frequently exhibited profound psychic ab ilities. For example, wh en he was four years old, Adam told his mother, \"Oh, your father didn't go to work today. It was stormy out, so he went for a walk instead.\" Adam's grandfather li ves in America, where there's a six-hour time difference. Since it wasn't yet Monday in America, and Adam's grandfather doesn't work on weekends, Adam was seeing the fu ture! When Adam's mother called her father the next evening, she wasn't surprised to discover that her son's vision was true. Adam's mother says that he also has powers over material objects. She says: \"One day Adam showed me how to light and relight a candle without a match - when we were outside in the wind! Adam has amazing powers of concentration and can make a rubber ball levitate. I knew that he'd been trying to do this for some ti me, and he finally succeeded. I heard the ball bounce on the floor and went up to his room to see what he was doing. He'd done it at least two times before I entered the room. He wanted to show me, and he did; I couldn't believe my eyes! The ball levitated a coupl e of centimeters off the covers of his bed and fell with a big thump, like someone had just thrown it there!\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Adam's mother told me that she's wary of other peop le's opinions about her son's abilities, since they live in a religiously fundamentalist comm unity in France. Additionally, she's concerned because she believes Adam becomes depleted an d vulnerable after he levitates objects. Hopefully, her fears won't be transferred to Adam and cause him to abandon his Divine magic. * * * Another woman (who also asked to remain anony mous) recounts a similar story about her four- year-old son and four-month-old daughter. She recalls that her daughter, who was only a few weeks old, caused a wooden toy to fly through th e air and land several yards from its original position. This occurred in full view of four adults and two children. The mother believes that her daughter caused the psychokinesis because she was upset that she wasn't being nursed right away. She also notes that her son was a very alert baby, able to manipulate matter around him. She recalls, \"I distinctly remember that on more than one occasion as a babe-in-arms, he 'turned the TV off' when he wanted our undivided attention and we weren't giving it to him quickly enough.\" * * * Similar to the story above, Tina's eight-week -old daughter can also manipulate electronic equipment. Tina explains: \"I take my daughter to work with me, and if I have her too close to my computer, it freezes. My office partner lost her monitor the other day, and we also had problems with our printer. I'll be placing crystal clusters on all my electronic equipment to disperse the strong currency waves that my daughter emits.\" A Soul Visitation The loving souls of the Crystal Children can also magically visit us in our dreams or meditations, like guiding angels delivering Divine message s. Laura Ainsworth was with her four-year-old granddaughter, Beth, meditating on the bedroom fl oor. At first, Beth sat by Laura's side. Then, as Laura continued to meditate, she heard Beth quietly leave the room. Laura says: "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"\"I don't know how long I'd been into the medi tation when I heard Beth calling to me in a soft voice: 'Nana.' And again a bit louder: 'Nana!' I opened my eyes and gazed upon her wrapped in a blanket outside the bedroom door , and smiled. She said with a penetrating gaze and heartwarming sincerity, 'I'm here for you if you need me.' I went back into the meditation, and not one minute later, I heard very deep breathing, almost snoring. Beth was sound asleep across the hall in another bedroom.\" If your children aren't acting like little wizards or sorceresses, it doesn't disqualify them from the Crystal Children category. Not all of these kids perform feats of magic. However, isn't it great to know that some of them display talents that, mos t likely, all humans are capable of? Once again, the Crystal Children point the way to humanity's possibilities... and model the high road for all of us. Chapter 7: Connecting to nature, animals, and rocks As much as the Crystal Children seem to be fr om other planets and realms, they sure do bond deeply with Earth, nature, and animals. These children would ra ther be outdoors playing among trees, rocks, flowers, and water than anywhere else! Some parents ac tually have difficulty keeping their kids indoors. Other parents say that an outdoor excursion is an instant mood elevator if their Crystal Children act grumpy. Like little Sa int Francises, these kids display a purity that makes animals trust them. You can practically i magine the flowers, birds, and sun singing with joy - so happy to be in the company of a delightful Crystal Child. Four-Legged Friends Just as music tames wild beasts, Crystal Children have a hypnotic effect upon animals. As mentioned earlier, they can roughhouse with big d ogs and sharp-clawed cats and never get hurt. Animals sense the innocence of these kids' hear ts. Animals and Crystal Children communicate with one another on the wavelength of l ove, and understand each other perfectly. Leah, at 15 months, has already forged deep friend ships with her family pet s. In fact, her mother, Cynthia, says that Leah's best friend is their dog, Yogi. Cynthia says, \"The first time Leah stood by herself was when she'd pulled up on Yogi to stand. Then Yogi walked away, and she stood on"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"her own. It's amazing, because most animals let her touch them and pull on them or pet them roughly. It's like magic. Animals adore her!\" In a similar fashion, three-year-o ld Abbie attracts animals. Her mot her, Andrea, reports: \"I often find her sitting with our dog or cats, just holdin g her hands on them and not speaking. I'll watch as this goes on for minutes at a time . She seems to calm the animals.\" Isabella, age 18 months, has twice swum with wild dolphins in Kona, Hawaii. Phillipa, her mother, says that during both swims, dolphins were very attracted to Isabella. \"The dolphins came straight to her, dove down under her, and kept coming back time and again.\" Wild and domestic animals alike are attracted to Crystal Children, sensing the love and trustworthiness of these special yo ungsters. When 18-month-old Hannah Caldwell went to the zoo with her mother, Pam, the an imals stared at the little girl, instead of vice versa! A mother gorilla at the zoo had a baby about Hannah's age. Pam says, \"The gorilla and I were both breast-feeding mothers, and I felt a tremen dous bond with her.\" The mother gorilla noticed Hannah and walked right up to the glass that se parated the zoo pen from them. The gorilla and Hannah locked eyes and stared lovingly at each other. Pam recalls, \"Then the gorilla looked at me and gently put her hand on the glass right by my face. I put my hand against hers. It was an incredible connection - she was so drawn to Hannah.\" Eventually, Hannah and Pam bid their new friend farewell and walked to the zoo's lion area. Mother and daughter stared through the glass wall at the lions, who were sprawled out over a very large area. Pam remembers: \"Suddenly a lioness looked up at something th at caught her attention. She got up and walked over to the area, totally drawn to what ever was on the other side of the concrete wall from me. She came all the way over and was so intent and focused. I looked to see what she was so interested in, and it was my daughter! They were face-to-face, separated by the zoo's glass wall, but totally connected. She was so drawn to Hannah! It was like Hannah was the zoo attraction, not the othe r way around. The spectacle drew a huge crowd, and everyone wondered what was so special about this little girl that she'd capture the complete attention of this beautiful lioness.\" Empathy for Nature"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In addition to befriending animals, a key char acteristic of Crystal Children is their profoundly deep empathy, which is particularly directed toward nature. Crystal Children feel the emotions and sensations of animals, bugs, and plants. They give voice to nature, and remind us that everyone and everything has feelings. • Andrea says that her three-year-old daughter, Abbie, won't let anyone kill bugs - not even big, scary spiders. \"God made them,\" Abbie te lls adults who are about to exterminate insects. We often think of bugs being the domain of little boys, but female Crystal Children don't discriminate among their nature friends. They like bugs as much as they like other living creatures. • When six-year-old Robert's parents had a pool installed in their backyard, two willow trees had to be removed for the project. At the sight of the chainsaw, Robert ran to the trees, hugging each one in turn , and cried huge tears for them. • Chad, age seven, has shown empathy toward na ture since he was a toddler. Once, when a leaf fell from a tree, Chad said to his mother, \"Oh, that poor leaf that's falling to the ground - it left its family!\" • When lizards get into his family's house, seven-year-old Liam gently catches them and takes them outside. As he do es so, Liam tells the lizards th ings like, \"You must go home; your babies are waiting for yo u,\" or \"You need to go outsid e and get some food; I know you're hungry.\" Liam's mother says that the boy knows what lizards are thinking and feeling. He tells them not to be afraid, and they listen. • Someone once picked a flower and handed it to two-year-old Crystal, and she became very upset Crystal went to the stem still in the ground and tried to reattach the cut flower. • Alice, age five, has a great love of plants an d can become upset when her mother prunes plants or removes dead or dying leaves or flowers. • Six-year-old Isaac showed his Grandma Laura a smooth pebble that he held in his hand. Isaac explained that he'd picked up the pebble from the road because he didn't want it to be run over by a car. • Zoey, three, hugs trees and kisses leaves that have been torn or dried up."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Great Outdoors With their wide-open hearts and sunny dispositions, it's no wonder that Crystal Children prefer to spend time outdoors with animals, plants, and fr esh air. Crystals are partial to natural beauty over artificiality. For example, they like to take their clothes off, dig in the dirt, and inspect ant colonies. Crystal Children find beauty in nature's details, and sit transfixed for long periods just staring at plants blowing in the wind. Conchita says that her 20-mo nth-old son, Nathan, is a true nature lover. \"We have to lock all our doors to keep him in. He prefers to have his cl othes off in nature when he can. He loves playing in water and mixing it with dirt and eating it.\" Perhaps one reason why Crystal Children love nature so much is that they communicate with plants and animals. Magda says that her four-ye ar-old daughter, Taylor, constantly talks to flowers. \"Taylor tells the flowers how beautiful they are,\" explains Magda. \"She also talks with little bugs and tries to comfort them.\" Crystal Children teach us about the magic of nature , and make us aware that everything is alive. Shawn and Keli Carpenter say that their thr ee-year-old son, Corbin, has very significant relationships with trees. \"Corbin tells us what th e trees are saying, feeling, and doing,\" the Carpenters explain. \"He's also awar e of the spirit in all life and can communicate with birds, fish, plants, insects, and rocks, although it seems strongest with the trees.\" And when four-year-old Colin was taking a walk outdoors with his mother one day, he stopped, looked at a tree, and leaned against it. Colin sighed and said, \"Mom, I feel the tree's love; I feel its heart!\" Nature is a great mood elevator for everyone, in cluding Crystal Children. Amanda says that if her 14-month-old daughter becomes whiny, all sh e has to do is take her outside. \"Immediately she becomes happy and peaceful just by wa lking on the grass or picking up dirt.\" No elaborate toys are necessary to entertain th ese special kids. Just take them outdoors and they're transfixed by watching rustling leaves, spiders, and birds. Rihana, 12 months, becomes cranky when she spends too much time indoors. Ri hana's mother says that the little girl is endlessly fascinated by touchin g the trees, feeling the grass, and chasing blowing leaves. Even older Crystal Children prefer nature to man-made toys. Six-year-old Haley wanted to de- clutter her bedroom and get rid of her unused toys, so she sold th e toys at a family garage sale. Haley and her sister netted $192 from the sale. Instead of purchasing more toys, they bought a red maple tree for the family's backyard."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"With this much love for the outdoors, it's no surprise that Crystals develop environmental concerns at young ages. Many of these youngste rs are protective of Mother Earth. For example, five-year-old Nicky constantly reminds his mothe r not to waste water. He's also conscientious about electricity's effect on the environment. N icky turns off lights when he leaves a room and won't turn them on until the sun goes down. Crystals and Rocks It's fitting that Crystal Children are fascinated by crystals and rocks. They'r e so sensitive to life- force energy. These children kn ow that the mineral kingdom is just as alive as God's other kingdoms. To a Crystal Child, a beautiful ro ck formation is as deserving of affection and attention as a person or animal. They're all God's living creatures in the eyes of a Crystal Child. When three-year-old Victoria visited the ocea n tidepools of Southern California with her father and grandmother, she was in her element! She put her ear to the ocean rocks and talked and listened to each one. Her grandmother says, \"She dr ew a crowd, since it was so clear to everyone that Victoria was having co nversations with those rocks.\" Crystal stones have long been used in spiritual ceremonies and healing work to direct and amplify Divine energy. Quartz crystals are also used in electronics, such as radios and watches, to increase electrical signals. S ome people believe that ancient civilizations used crystals for transportation and lighting, and there are th eories that the Ark of the Covenant consisted of crystals infused with focused i ntentions of perpetual energy. Crystal Children feel the impulses emitted by crystals, and are respectfu l of the crystals' magical properties and powers. Many of these children i ntuitively know how to work with crystals in healing work, with no formal training. Carri Lineberry is the mother of two daughters, Shailyn, age four; and Maia , age three. Carri says that both girls love to handle their collection of polished crystal stones. Several times, the girls have displayed an uncanny awareness of the power of these crystals. For example, Maia keeps an amethyst geode crystal under her bed. Carri sa ys, \"I found it there one day and put it away. Maia promptly discove red it was gone, put it back, and informed me that it was to stay there.\""},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Another time, Shailyn climbed into bed with Ca rri. Shailyn saw a rose quartz crystal on her mother's nightstand and picked it up. Carri reca lls, \"I had just purchased that crystal, and Shailyn had no knowledge of it.\" Shailyn placed the point of the crystal on the center of Carri's forehead and said, \"Mommy, I can fix people with this. You can do surgery with this, you know.\" Shailyn continued placing the crystal on different parts of Carri's body with th e same degree of confidence you'd see in a seasoned energy healer. Carri finally asked Shailyn where she'd learned how to use a crystal for he aling, and she replied matter-of-factly, \"From Jesus.\" Carri remembers that the energy in the room wa s incredibly calm and serene. She says, \"I had goose bumps. I'll never forget that morning, and the glimpse I had of another time and place.\" Judy Springer's four-year-old son, Isaac, also has an inexplicable knowingness about crystals. One time, for instance, Isaac told his mother ou t of the blue: \"You know, crystals wear out if they're kept in the house too long. If they do th at, then you have to put them outside for a long, long time.\" Some Crystal Children receive information abou t the use of crystals from their guides and angels. But other Crystals recall knowledge from past lifetimes. Stephen and Karen Williams say, \"Our five-year-ol d daughter, Sabrina, immediately developed a love for crystals when we first introduced them to her. She quickly learned the different types of crystals. Now she helps us sele ct crystals to purchase.\" One evening, Sabrina said she needed a crystal healing. After she'd selected some crystals, her mother began teaching her about the chakra system in the human body. Karen was about to tell Sabrina how to place crystals on her chakras when Sabrina said , \"Mummy, I know where they go, I've done this all before,\" and proceeded to pl ace the crystals on her body for self-healing. Karen said that watching her little girl work with crystals that evening convinced her that Sabrina's connection with crystals extended beyond this lifetime. Perhaps the Crystal Children's connection to ancient lives is one reason why they gravitate toward time-tested healing instruments such as crystals, labyrinths, and medicine wheels. A six-year-old girl showed uncanny knowledge about these wheels one day. Carolyn says that she was outside mowing the lawn when her daug hter, Haley, said she wanted her mother to see the meditation space she'd created. Inside Haley' s bedroom, Carolyn saw that her daughter had tied blankets to her bedroom furniture to create a sacred space. In the middle, Haley had placed"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"her crystals and special st ones in a circle. Haley explained to her mother that she'd been sitting in the center, meditating. Carolyn recalls: \"The room was so peaceful, and the sacred ci rcle she'd created was beautiful. A few nights later, Haley asked me if I'd sit in the circle of stones with her, and she told me all about healing. She shared the importance of the circle with me, had me hold a quartz crystal in my hand, and then instructed me to hold it next to my heart. Then she got up and invoked angels around the circle and ask ed Archangel Raphael to come into the center with us. She placed a small heart-shape d rose quartz next to where she saw Raphael so that the loving, healing energy was front and center. Haley knew what she was doing - it was incredible!\" Even if your child isn't performing healing ceremonies with crystals, you may notice that he or she has an affinity for these magical stones. Mary Marshall told me that her four-year-old son loves crystals so much that he carries them around and even sleeps with them. Mary says, \"He's in preschool, and for a class project, he had to bring something to school that started with the letter C . He decided to take some crystals.\" Petra says that when her three-year-old daughter, Julie, began having sleep difficulties, crystals saved the day. Petra recalls that Julie suddenly di dn't want to sleep alone and was waking up five or six times a night. Finally, Petra had a conver sation with Julie and learned that her daughter was seeing ghosts in her room. Petra solved the problem by performing a nightly bedtime ritual with Julie. Petra now lovingly commands the ghosts to leave the room, and then she places a rose quartz and amethyst crystal in Julie's bed, as well as a clear quartz crystal on the window. This keeps the energy of the room clear of untoward visitors, and now Julie sleeps through the night. Another mother also found that crystals helped he r son sleep better. Laura Halls, a professional psychic healer, received an intuitive message to build a crystal energy grid in her son's bedroom. She placed a hermatite crystal in the exact center of the bedroom, and four rhodochrosite crystals in each corner of the b edroom. Laura then visualized an en ergy grid with lines of energy running between each crystal, forming a high po int in the center above the hematite. She then asked that an etheric mirror be built across the top of the pyramid to reflect negativity upward, away from the room. Afterward, Laura invoked her child's angels and guides to protect him."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Laura says that her children now go to sleep faster and sleep through the night. She recalls, \"The temperature went up in my son's bedroom for two days after we made the crystal energy grid because it created so much positive energy in the room!\" Some Crystal Guidelines Since Crystal Children have a symbiotic relati onship with crystals, you may want to introduce your kids to these amazing stone s. You can purchase crystals at metaphysical bookstores, crystal specialty shops, and gem shows. And keep in mind that natural crystals have stronger energy currents than the man-made varieties. Connie Barrett, who has owned a crystal shop fo r many years, recommends allowing children to select their own crystals. She says that many times, kids know exactly which stone will help them feel calmer and more peaceful. Connie says: \"One time a mother and son visited my store. The mother began telling me about the child's various problems, and the boy kept trying to tell her that he'd found the crystal he wanted. The mother finally turned to him, and said, 'W ill you be quiet for a minute? I'm asking the lady what crystal would be best for your asthma.' I asked to see what crystal the boy had chosen. He showed me a rhodochrosite, a stone, which, because it's believed to help relax the muscles of the solar plexus, is recommended for asthma. I told the mother that her son had done a fine job of choosing the crystal he needed.\" Children have intuitive abilitie s when selecting their own crystals. This doesn't mean that you can't give them crystals that you think they'd li ke. They'll probably like just about any crystals you give them. If your child is still very young, remember that small stones can be swallowed. Don't leave babies alone with crystal stones, and place them out of reach. Or, purch ase a large crystal with smooth edges so that a baby can't fit the crystal into his or her mouth or get cut by sharp edges. Also, explain to young children not to throw stones!"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Connie says that, as important as it is for children to have freedom to choose stones that feel right, there are particular crystals that can be helpful for ce rtain childhood conditions and issues. • Nightmares / insomnia: Amethyst - place it on the child's nightstand or beneath the pillow. • Heartbreak or grief: Rose quartz - hold it over the child's heart, or let it be worn as a pendant that hangs over the chest. • Self-esteem and self-confidence issues: Citrine - can be worn as a ring or necklace, or placed anywhere in the room. • Concentration, focus, and studying: Cornelian (for being grounded in the present) or sodalite (for clearing up mental confusio n) - place in the child's study area. • Emotional overwhelm: Moonstone - to be worn as a neck lace pendant, or rub the moonstone over the forehead and temples. • Patience: Rhodonite - the child should rub the stone in her hand when feeling impatient. • Communication: Turquoise (if your child has difficulty in asking others for help); blue lace agate (helpful for peaceful communication); amazonite (helps to promote the courage to speak the truth) - especially effe ctive when worn as a necklace or on a necklace pendant. After purchasing a crystal, clear the former owner's energy by placing the stone out in the sunlight for at least four hours. In the absence of sunlight, you can submerge the stone in water mixed with sea salt. Don't soak the stone long in the water, as salt can erode crystal. Then, ask your Crystal Child to hold the crystal next to the heart and think of wishes or intentions to infuse into the stone. For example, he or she might intend that the cry stal help with physical healings, or a better night's slee p. If any negative energy surround s the crystal, cl ear the crystal again with sunlight or sea saltwater. This can be done on a regular basis. Divine Nature"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Poet Dorothy Frances Gurney wrote: \"One is nearer God's Heart in a garden than anywhere else on earth.\" Crystal Children instinctively know this and are in tune with the Divinity of nature. Nature is their church, their temple, their place of touching, smelling, and being aware of God. When four-year-old Colin and his mother went for a walk in a beautiful Japanese garden, the boy stopped and exclaimed, \"Mom, this is so wo nderful! I feel God and the angels here!\" Kate Mitchell, who owns a crystal shop in Los Angeles, reports that a five-year-old boy named Alex recently visited her store with his mother. Alex saw a large quartz crystal cluster priced at $500, and he exclaimed to his mother, \"This is wh at I want Santa to bring me for Christmas!\" His mother hesitated and said, \"Wouldn't you like a Nintendo set like the other kids?\" Alex answered with a determined \"No!\" Then she asked him, \"Alex, why do you want this crystal so bad?\" He replied, \"Because it's natural, and God made it.\" Rest assured that Santa brought sweet little Alex his crystal cluster for Christmas. Chapter 8: Angels and invisible friends You might see baby Crystals staring off into space, eyes and heads focused and moving as they gaze at angels. Often these stares are accompanied by unintelligible \"conversations\" with the unseen world. Many parents with whom I spoke are convinced that their Crystal Children babies (who are sometimes referred to as \"Crystalmes\") are seeing angels and deceased loved ones. Well, of course! Why wouldn't one of the mos t psychic generations of all time be born clairvoyant? Many generations of humans have produced psychic babies and children. The Crystal Children generation, however, is poised to re tain their spiritual gifts into ad ulthood. One reason is that, in this new age of spiritual openness, parents are mor e supportive of Crystal Children's psychic abilities. Previous generations, frightened by all-things-psychic, condemned people who saw or heard angels. Tara Jordan and her family customarily say grace as they sit down for sup per. Shortly after her son turned 13 months old, he started calli ng out for Jesus during the dinner prayer. Tara says: "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"\"Grant will look up as we say grace, and you can te ll that he sees Jesus or angels or spirits on a different level. He'll look up and wave to what seems to be nothing. He calls out Jesus' name and says 'Hi' as if greeting him. He'll then look over at the picture we have of Jesus at The Last Supper and wave again. Ther e's no doubt in my mind that Grant sees and feels the spirit world.\" Thanks to their supportive pare nts and grandparents, Crystal Children retain their psychic abilities as they age. Crystal Children naturally f eel an affinity for angels, since they can sense the unconditional love of the celestial beings. They al so love it when their parents teach them about the angels, and they use this knowledge to tap in to heaven in an even deeper way. Carolyn took my book Healing with the Angels with her during an emergency trip to the hospital when her five-year-old daughter, Haley, broke her arm. As Carolyn read a prayer for healing, she asked Haley to call upon Archangel Raphael (the Angel of Physical Healings) to be with her and help her heal quickly and take away pain. Ther eafter, whenever Haley's arm began to hurt, the little girl called upon Raphael. By the time the doctors examined Haley, they expressed astonishment at the little girl's calmness. Carolyn and her husband, Mike, were al so amazed by how relaxed Haley was, and also by how peaceful they themselves felt. After all, Carolyn normally becomes tearful and very frightened when one of her children gets hurt. The angels were obviously influencing everyone in a positive way. As the doctors put a cast on Haley's arm, Caro lyn noticed a tremendous feeling of peace in the emergency room. Afterward, Haley said, \"Look, Mom, my cast is gr een, and green is the color of Raphael for healing!\" Ever since, Haley has been talking to her angel s, working with, and learning from them. Carolyn kick-started the process, and then Haley and he r angels took it from there. One night, Haley began sharing the wisdom she'd learned. She sa t on her knees, almost in a prayer pose, and began telling her mother the wonderful insight s and great knowledge she'd gleaned from the angels. Carolyn says, \"I felt like Haley was an angel, channeling this wisdom.\" Carolyn related the information that Haley sh ared about Archangels Raphael, Gabriel, and Michael: \"First, Haley said that these were big angels, and their feet went all the way down into the ground, and they were like giant trees rising up to heaven. Haley admitted that the first"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"time she saw the angels there were many in her room, and she feared they were ghosts. But then she saw their wings and knew they were angels, so it was safe. She said that the Angel of Knowledge was wo rking with her. One night, she asked this angel what the word activity meant. The angel told her it meant 'many things happening.' Haley said the angels teach her reading and math. Her kindergarten teacher corroborated this by telling me how impressed she was with Haley's vocabulary. On another occasion, Haley asked me what the word anesthesia meant I asked Haley where she'd heard the word, and my daughter replied that Raphael had used it while teaching her about healing the previous evenin g. Haley says that sometimes when she's playing in her room, she's not alone. She's playing with Raphael and the other angels.\" Psychic Children, Psychic Parents Angels are all around each of us, and the Crystal Children are confidently communicating with them. If you know a Crystal Child, then yo u've got access to your own psychic-development teacher! \"As soon as Zoey was born, I started seeing ange ls and deceased relatives,\" says Crystal, Zoey's mother. \"My psychic abilities rea lly opened up.\" One of the reasons why Crystal Children are catalysts for others' psychic abilities has to do with their powerful love energy. This love opens our chakras, especially the heart area. We become unafraid of love, which leads us to be more aware of the loving angels' presence. Crystal says that she began seeing orbs of li ght around Zoey. The orbs even show up in photographs of the little girl! Many of the parents and grandparents with whom I spoke discussed seeing sparkling lights, aura glows, and even angels around their Crystal Ch ildren. Cindy Goldenberg says that she noticed bluish-white orbs of light around her sleepin g daughter. Cindy says, \"If I moved Kirsten's blanket, the orbs would fly under the blanket, still shining.\" Cindy has encouraged Kirsten's clairvoyance, an d says that her daughter, at age five, is very accurate in \"reading\" people based upon their aura colors. Cindy and Kirsten sprinkle \"angel and fairy dust\" over newspaper headlines so that the situations and people in volved will heal. They're a good example of a parent and chil d pooling their spiritual gifts."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Invisible Friends It's perfectly normal and even healthy for children to have \"invisible friends\" - that is, beings who are usually their guardian angels or spirit gui des. When parents are supportive or encouraging of children's relationships wit h invisible friends, then children feel validated for having natural and God-given abilities. Sometimes the invisible friends are archangels who help the children with important life purposes. Or, the invisible friends can be guardian angels, helping children let go of their fear. The invisible friends can even be depar ted relatives, friends, or even pets. Several years ago, a woman named Melissa became pregnant by a man she adored and loved. However, the man wasn't interested in a relationsh ip or a baby. Melissa didn't tell her young son, Liam, that she was pregnant. However, one da y Liam drew a picture and handed it to his mother, explaining that it was a po rtrait of his little brother (Mel issa only had one child at the time). Ultimately, Melissa made the difficult choice to terminate the pregnancy, without telling Liam. About a week later, Liam said that his little brother told him, \"I decided not to come yet, but I'm okay, and I love you.\" The little brother said that he was taking care of Melissa like a guardian angel until he was ready to be born as a child. When that time came, both the little brother and Liam would take care of their mother. Melissa says that Liam is profoundly clairvoyant. One time Melissa did a meditation to discover who her \"power animal\" was (some traditions beli eve that we all have an animal spirit guide who's not necessarily a deceased pet). During the meditation, Melissa discovered a lioness around her. She was sitting in her big leather chair, enjoying this meditation, when Liam walked into the room. He asked how the big scratches on the chair's arms came to be. When Melissa said she didn't know, Liam answered his own question. \"Mom, you know it was your lion that put them there!\" he said. \"My lion?\" Melissa asked. \"Yes, the lion that follows you around, Mom. Don't you see her?\" Liam explained that he always saw the lioness with his mother, and that the big cat slept at the end of his mom's bed at night."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Melissa says, \"I was amazed!\" She then adds, \"Tha nk God. I'm so blessed and honored to have my son. He's my light and my strength.\" One reason why parents needn't worry about their children's psychic abilit ies is that these gifts can help kids heal from emotional and physica l pain. They're God's self-healing abilities established in each of us. For instance, five-year-old Sabrina was grief-stricken when a friend of hers died. She received some comfort from the angels with whom Sabrina has had a lifelong relationship. Yet, she was immediately relieved of emotional pain when she clairvoyantly saw her friend in the spirit world. Sabrina said that, during her sl eep, she'd talked with her friend, who was smiling and standing under a rainbow. Sometime later, Sabrina's mother relayed this message to the friend's parents, who shared that her daughter's last painting was of herself standing beneath a rainbow. Past-Life Memories Some of the Crystal Children spe ak of vivid memories of other lifeti mes. This in itself isn't too unusual, as kids often talk about past lives. The new and exciting development is that adults now give more permission and validity to their children 's discussion of prior li fetimes. This allows the kids to keep these memories alive without wallowing in them. When we realize that life is eternal, we lose our preoccupation with death. We also release the anxiety perpetuated by some re ligions about hell and damnation. And when we release those fears, we're truly free to live fully. Here are some examples of children who remember other lifetimes: • Six-year-old Robert frequently talks about his \"old parents,\" the ones he had before he came into Mommy's belly. He's described his life with them in detail. Robert told his mother that he watched from heaven as she sh ook the thing in her hand and it turned blue (a pregnancy test kit), and then he came into her belly. • Beverly Moore says that her five-year-old son, Ethan, seems to remember many of his past lives. Beverly says, \"Ethan talks abou t past lives a lot. He always says, 'Do you remember when I was your age, an d you were mine?' He's told me that he was my mother once and my father once.\""},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"• Five-year-old Evan was discus sing the topic of girls with Na than, his older brother. Suddenly Nathan said, \"Evan, how would you know anything about girls? You're only five years old!\" Evan immediately retorted, \"Oh, for goodness' sake, Nathan. I've been a woman at least 60 times!\" Some of the Crystal Children are on this planet for their first lifetime, and Earthly living can seem foreign or unsettling to them. Cathy says that her three-year-old son, William, would sit on her lap and ask if they could go home. Cathy repl ied to William, \"But we are home,\" to which he'd say, \"We are?\" Finally, Cathy realized that William was referring to an unearthly preexistence, so she gently told her son, \"We're here on Earth because we need to be, and home won't be that far away.\" Th at seemed to satisfy William. * * * Part of our jobs as adult guardian s of Crystal Children is to show them the ropes of Earthly life. That includes helping them stay open psychically, teaching them to clear away lower energies, and empowering them with knowledge. Like beau tiful flower buds, we're the adult gardeners who must nurture Crystal Childr en into fully open bouquets. Chapter 9: A gift for music, art, and entertainment The Crystal Children are multital ented. Not only are they loving , psychic, and sweet, but they're also naturally gifted in the arts. Many of thes e children have musical talents and artistic capabilities. A few show protege-like talents witho ut having had any formal training. Once again, the Crystal Children are role models, sh owing us the very best of human nature. Songs in their Heart Many Crystals begin to sing before they speak word s. In fact, Saharah's grandmother says she came out of the womb humming. Now, at six mo nths old, Saharah doesn't say any words, but she hums in perfect tune."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Evie, another mother of a Crystal Child, says th at her daughter learned how to speak through music. Evie recalls, \"When Meishan , who's now two years old, started speaking, she'd just sing little songs to communicate with us. She absolutely loves music!\" Many of the parents surveyed for this book told me that their Crystal Ch ildren were innately musically gifted. For example, Cindy says that her five-year-old daughter, Kirsten, has a beautiful singing voice. This is surprising, since, according to Cindy, nobody in the family can carry a tune. However, Kirsten can instantly mimi c any song she hears, with perfect pitch. Several parents told me that their children sin g constantly. For instance, three-year-old Emily continually makes up tunes, sings traditional so ngs and nursery rhymes, and re-creates the melodies she hears on the radio. She dances a ll the time, moving to any music (or sometimes no music at all!). Her mother, Wendy, plans to enro ll her in a dance class when she gets a little older. Musical aptitude is often where we see evidence of the Crystal Children's high intelligence. For example, three-year-old William knows the words to every song played on the Radio Disney station. And 15-month-old Erin taught herself ho w to harmonize with songs on the radio as she sings along in perfect unison. Creative Artists The Crystal Children also love to draw, paint, and create. They can entertain themselves for hours with a mere drawing pad and crayons. The hi gh creativity of Crystal Children reflects their right-brain dominant style, which also includes being: • aware of their emotions, • intuitive, • advanced in motor skills, • philosophical, • spiritually minded, and • musical. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Right-brain dominant individuals think in pictures and feelings, as opposed to words. Their visual orientation gives them an artistic flair and a photographic memory. Some of their artwork comes from copying the images th ey see in their mind's eye. Rosa McElroy says that her five-year-old daughte r, Audrey, shows a real gift for artwork. \"No one taught Audrey how to draw,\" says Rosa. \"She's always been able to draw beautiful pictures that only a real artist would th ink to create. She seems above he r age level when she draws, in the way she blends colors just rig ht. Her artwork is breathtaking!\" As you can see, Audrey's mother is highly supportive of her artwork. With Rosa's encouragement, Audrey will likely blossom into a confident and highly skilled artist. One delightful aspect of Crystal Children is how they're entertained by ordinary items. While previous generations seemed dependent upon elabor ate and expensive toys to keep them happy, Crystals are content with a flower, a puppy, a pen and paper, or a moon lit sky. It's the same thing with their artwork. No expensive craft kits are necessary. Truly, this is a generation of kids who appreciate simplicity and basics. How refreshing! For example, seven-year-old Jacob Daurham treks into the desert near his home and finds \"treasures\" to make crafts with. He brings home ol d horseshoes, railroad ties, and anything else he can use. Then he makes his own patterns for craft projects and b uilds them himself. Budding Thespians The Crystal Children may not talk a lot - espe cially when they're young. However, they're definitely expressive people! They express strong emotions and opinions through their eyes, body movements, songs, and artwork. They also express themselves through dramatics. Not the temper-tantrum drama-queen or -king-type of dramatics. No, the Crystal Children use drama as a playful form of expression, in the way th at humans must have enjoyed Shakespearean productions before radio and television. Thes e children take us back to our roots. Many of the parents and grandparents surveyed for this book said that their Crystal Children showed no shyness in front of audiences. Most were like three-year-old Victoria, whose grandmother said: \"Victoria has infinite poise and self-confiden ce. She's taken gymnastics and dance classes since she was one year old. She loves to perform, especially dance. She's never"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"experienced shyness or stage fright, whether the audience is made up of hundreds or thousands or a few dozen people. It has always been a joy to watch her dance or do gymnastics, as she loses herse lf in it and is so happy that she glows. She practices endlessly, lost in the joy of the music and the movement.\" Crystal Children are fun to be around, and one reason is that they're highly entertaining people. One woman said that she's enthralled by her three-year-old daughter's ability to do impersonations. She told me that her daughter can pick up the most dramatic voice inflections, mannerisms, and phrases someone uses, and then incorporates these elements in order to imitate the person. \"She's so good that we can immediately recognize wh o she's imitating. She doesn't do it in a mean or even humorous way; it 's done purely as an observation, or for her own entertainment.\" And it's not just little girls who enjoy dressing up and performing. Male Crystal Children are getting into the act as well. Catherine Poulton sa ys that her five-year-old son, Kylan, is always getting into character, and changes his clothes about ten times a day! \"I'm constantly picking up his clothes off the floor be cause he pulls everything out of his drawers to look for costumes for whatever character he's being,\" says Catherine. \"He also cuts up his pillowcases, clothes, sheets - whatever he can find to create new costumes. He just loves to act.\" Catherine says that Kylan also draws every day, often sketching pictures of the characters that he plays. \"He makes up his own super-heroes with th eir own magical powers. These characters are often based on himself.\" It sounds like Kylan remembers his magical capabi lities and may be practicing for the time when Crystals are the superheroes of our world. After all, they 've got what it takes! Chapter 10: Angel babies \"Delightful,\" \"A real angel,\" \"A gift from Go d.\" This is how parents and grandparents describe their Crystal Children. And while everyone has Di vine qualities, these kids seem to express their higher selves more than previous generations. He re are some characterist ics that Crystals bring to the world: "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Affection: This is another reason why delayed speaki ng isn't enough to warrant an \"autism\" label. These kids are super-affectionate, almost to the point of being clingy. Autistic people are physically distant, definitely not cuddly. Mary Marshall notes that her five-year-old son s eems to be happiest when the two of them are together, just hugging and laughing. He loves to snuggle with his mom. Mary says, \"He was very clingy when he was little and still reverts back to that behavior at times. For instance, if we're in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable place, he wants me to pick him up and hold him, and then he buries his head in my shoulder.\" Crystal Children don't limit their affection to family members. Stephanie and Mark Watkeys say that their 13-month-old son, Bryn, wants to kiss most people he meets. \"He's very loving and affectionate to everyone,\" they explain. Happiness and joy: These kids emit positive energy via their facial expressio ns, postures, words, and actions. They're a joy to be around because they uplift those around them. Lauren Stocks says that her six-year-old son, Carter, has a completely positive demeanor. She says, \"It's as if Carter is just he re to love.\" On almost a daily ba sis, Carter says, \"Oh, Mom, it's a beautiful day!\" and he'll cheer her up when she's down. Everyone comments on Carter's cheerful attitu de, which is common in Crystal Children. For instance, Beth and Michael's son, Taylor, has ha d three different baby-sitters. All of them have said the same thing about the three-year-old boy: \"He's such a bright spirit!\" Everyone says that Taylor warms their hearts. His parents say, \"Overall, Taylor's a delightful child who brings us nothing but joy and love. When we sense his spirit, we have hope that th e human race will find peace, and that violence will be eliminated on this planet.\" I received more stories on this joyful aspect of Crystal Children than any other. And lest you think that these are parents who are gushing because it's their offspring, many of these moms and dads have other children whom they find challenging. Here are some of the comments I received from parents talking about their Crystal Child: \"A lot of people say that being with Celeste makes them feel more peaceful. Often, she spontaneously goes to people who suffer in some way and sits by them or plays with them.\" From Nadia Leu, regarding her 18-month-old daughter, Celeste."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" \"She's the sweetest, most loving spirit I've ever encountered. She goes right up to strangers, takes their hands, and you can just f eel the love she's sending! A very sensitive, passionate, attentive person.\" From Wendy Weidman, regarding her three-year-old daughter, Emily. \"My Robert is a six-year-old 'angelheart.' He has love for all people. He wants to comfort every person he sees in need. If a friend's hurt, Robert's totally caring. He wants to give something to every homeless person on the st reet. Robert's a sweet, loving soul, and it seems as though the sun radiates from wit hin him.\" From Michelle, regarding her six- year-old son, Robert. Love and respect for elders: As if sensing the wisdom and peacefulness that comes with age, Crystal Children are magnetically drawn to older people. They adore their grandparents, and also bond with elderly strangers. Mary and her three-year-old daughter, Haley, freq uent an ice-cream parlor that has an outdoor eating area. During their last th ree visits there, various elderly people have been seated outside eating by themselves. In each case, Haley walk ed right up to the elders and sat beside them. She didn't speak until she was spoken to, but Mary says that Haley was practically cuddling each of the seniors. She obviously sensed their need fo r love and companions hip, and volunteered to meet that need. In the same vein, Conchita Bryner says that her two youngest children (a son, 20 months; and a daughter, 5 years) are attracted to senior citizens as if there's a special kinship. Conchita's family recently held a memorial for the ten-year anniversary of their children's paternal grandmother's death. She recalls: \"Since my youngest daughter didn't know he r grandma, she asked me lots of questions about her before the memorial. She knew we were taking flowers to the grave, so she made her own bouquet. To my surprise, she al so asked her older sibling to write down a poem that she'd created on her own. As she read the poem at the memorial, my husband and I were in tears - she told her grandma sh e missed her and that she was in her soul.\" "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Forgiveness and peace-keeping: What the world needs now is forgiveness and compassion, and the Crystal Children are shining examples of turning the other ch eek. Where their older Indigo Children brothers and sisters h ave a warrior spirit that keeps them fighting for causes, the Crystal Children have adopted a Gandhi-like style of dealing with conflict. For example: Gloria Powell-Frederickson, the mother of tw o Crystal Children and one older Indigo Child, says that during conflicts, she sees glaring differences between the generations. She says, \"During arguments, my Crystal Children will give in and walk away, completely unbothered and full of forgiveness. But my Indi go Child prefers to stick to the argument and fight it out.\" Corbin, age three, has learned about conflict resolution through his connection to nature. He always talks about the trees and the things they say or do. Whenever he hears people speaking in a negative tone of voice, Co rbin says, \"Please talk like the trees.\" By that, he means to speak with gentleness and love. Mei, age two, never hits any of her playmate s, although they hit her. She simply retorts, \"No, don't hit me - I'm your friend!\" Denise Christie says that her five-year-ol d daughter, Alice, can become very hurt if someone is cruel or spiteful to her: \"Alice has no comprehension of why someone would want to do such a thing. She's so pure that I don't even think she realizes when she's being bullied.\" * * * The Crystal Children emanate love in all their actions and deeds. They'r e indicators that the human race is evolving above petty differences and squabbles. They've living examples of operating from the higher self and not the ego. Yet, Crystal Children aren't entirely problem-fr ee offspring for their parents. I asked parents to tell me about any challenges they'd encountered with these kids. For the most part, the issues"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"reported were minimal. Even so, a few showed up re peatedly, as you'll read about in the next chapter. Chapter 11: Eat, sleep, and be picky Any human characteristic can be viewed in a negative or positive light. For instance, stubbornness can also be called tenacity or \"stick -to-it-iveness.\" And asse rtiveness can also be called \"pushiness.\" I think you see my point. A similar observation can be made about Crystal Children and the choices they make. On the one hand, anyone who's operating from higher chakras holds high standards for themselves. When people open their heart chakras and truly l ove, they tend to attrac t (and be attracted to) situations and persons with loving energy. An open-hearted person is repelled by situations or relationships involving violence, negativity, impurities, loudness, or anything jarring. The Law of Attraction holds that we draw peop le and situations to us that mirror our dominant thoughts and beliefs. For example, if we believ e that people are basically good-natured, we'll attract sweet and loving friends. As we travel the spiritual path, we may change our circle of friends, the way we eat, and other lifestyle choices. Our new choices mirror our evol ving self. And Crystal Children, who are born far along the spiritual path, are naturally attrac ted to - and attract - situations of the highest spiritual energy frequencies. This results in the Crystal Child appearing to be fussy or picky. However, another way to look at it is that the child is \"discernin g.\" A discerning person has high self-esteem and cares enough to choose friends, meals, movies, jo bs, homes, and such that feed an d nurture the body and soul. Diet and the Crystal Children Once I fully immersed myself in spiritual studie s, my appetite for food and beverages shifted almost immediately. I received strong inner guidance to eat more organic fruits and vegetables, and fewer animal products. I've be en a complete vegan (meaning I don't eat any meat, fowl, fish, or dairy products) since 1997, and I'm extremely happy with this lifestyle choice."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Many of my students, audience members, and re aders report having received similar inner guidance. Although they may not leap to vegan ism, people on the spiritual path generally eat fewer processed foods; and avoid red meat, white sugar, and refined flour. The angels say that humans are evolving toward becoming less dependent on eating for energy and nourishment. According to the angels, we'll first become vegetarians, then we'll become \"raw foodists,\" eating only uncooked fruits and ve getables. Next, we'll switch to juices, which are easier to digest. Finally, we'll become \"breatha rians,\" and receive all of our nutrition from the prana life-force in the air. All of this will enable us to become more intuitive, and also help us adapt to Earth's changing food supplies as we get away from processed foods and move toward harvesting fresh produce. Well, the Crystal Children are already there. They've already evolved their taste buds to very high levels. Uncooked organic fruits and vegetable s have the highest life-force energy of any foods. So, it's no surprise that C rystals prefer vegetarian diets. Yet, it's all in how you view this situation. Some parents see it as a problem. For instance, on e mother told me that she struggles to get her four-year-old son to eat \"real meals.\" She's going against the natural grain of these children, which is to \"graze\" on smaller, more frequent meals of healthful foods and juices. Nutritionists say that grazing is a healthful way of keeping blood-sugar levels balanced and to avoid binge eating. Many eating patterns reported by parents of Cryst al Children show that they're very much in tune with their bodies. So if parents can trust that their kids' natural appetite preferences balance out with their nutritional needs, then po wer struggles at mealtimes won't occur. These children's predilections for food can be trusted, judging by the stories I've received. For example, many of the Crystal Children are se lf-made vegetarians. Seven-year-old Jacob, for instance, refuses to eat meat - ev en though his mother isn't vegeta rian and tries to get him to eat it. The main reason why Crystals won't eat beef, fish , or fowl has to do with their empathy for animals. One two-year-old boy said, \"Eating fish is bad because they die when they're taken out of the water.\" And Shailyn, age four; and Maia , age three, are self-proclaimed vegetarians because they say it's not nice to kill animals to eat them. Two-year-old Mei says, \"Yuck, dead chicken,\" or \"Yuck, dead cow,\" wh enever she sees fowl or meat. Parents who worry about their children's nutrit ional needs will be happy to know that the American Dietetic Association has deemed vegetarian ism to be a healthful and balanced way to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"eat. Vegetables, grains, soy products, nuts, and legumes contain sufficient protein for a healthy youngster's body. Most dietitia ns, nutritionists, and medical doctors also recognize that vegetarianism is healthful. After all, animal pro ducts are associated with heart conditions, high cholesterol, obesity, osteoporosis, and other health concerns. Three-year-old Corbin's parents constantly receive compliments on how calm and relaxed their son is. They partially attribute Corbin's relax ed temperament to his diet of organic foods with no refined sugar. Many parents report that their children woul d rather drink their meals than eat them. For example, Kelly, mother of five (three of them young Crystal Children), sa ys, \"My children are vegan and eat little sugar. They have a very liquid diet. They show a natural aversion to meat and heavy foods and constantly want water.\" And three-year-old William prefers drinking juice to eating solid food. Parents who worry about their children's diet can always make smoothies in a blender, with soy or rice-based pro tein powder containing vitamins and minerals (available at most stores in the health-food se ction, or over the Internet). Along the same lines, quite a few mothers report that their Crystal Children want to breast-feed beyond their first year. And most parents report that eliminating sugar from the diet helped their children's moods and energy le vels to stabilize. One mother said that if her five-year-old daughter eats anything contain ing chocolate, she becomes wild and practically uncontrollable. Sleep Patterns In my survey, I asked parents to describe any challenges they've had with their Crystal Children. By far, the single most frequent answer given invol ved sleep patterns. These children have high energy and don't want to miss a thing while they 're sleeping! They may also be reflecting a higher state of evolution when humankind needs fewer hours of sleep. Re gardless of the reason, there's definitely something going on in this area. Crystal Children are so sensit ive that anything stimulating can lead to insomnia. Thirteen- month-old Bryn's sleep pattern is the only cha llenge his mom has faced with her son. She says, \"Since birth, he's been very alert. Bryn takes in everything around him with great intention. This leads to him getting overstimulated, and then he finds it hard to settle down to sleep.\" To nap or not to nap seems to be a very individual decision. Erin's parents found that if she took naps, she was up all night. Since they eliminated her naps, Erin now sleeps through the night and"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"seems happier in the mornings. Her mother sa ys, \"We now use the afternoons as structured playtimes for making treats, craft proj ects, or watching a favorite video.\" Other parents said that naptime was essential. If V ictoria, age three, skips a nap, it takes days for her to recover so that she's feeling well and in sync. This is an area where care takers will want to personalize a sleep program according to the child's individual rhythms and needs. For other sleep concerns, pare nts have come up with some unique solutions: • Colin, age four, is very psychically connected to his mother. She says, \"As a baby, and until about a year ago, he'd wake up crying immediately after I'd wake up from a bad dream. So I started a nightly routine of visuali zing the cord between us as a chain, and I'd separate it at two of the links (it didn't feel right to me to sever a cord between us).\" This ended the nighttime wake-ups. • Another mother, who'd tried everything to ge t her daughter to bed, also tried cord cutting, and says there was an immediate im provement. She says, \"If I notice the old bedtime antics returning, I cl ear my chakras, and things return to normal! It was an amazing discovery for us!\" [Note: To cut the cords of fear that can cause problems, just hold the intention and ask the angels to snip th em for you. That's all it takes. However, if you want details on cord cutting, please consult my book Chakra Clearing , published by Hay House]. • Robin Rowney is the mother of twin Crystal Ch ildren sons who didn't sleep through the night as infants. One night, exhausted from a sleepless night with her twins, Robin prayed desperately for help. She soon noticed a so und coming from her son Zack's crib. She thought he was waking again for another feeding , so she quietly listened to see if he'd start calling for her. She looked over at the crib and noticed a light growing brighter and brighter hovering around his bed. At the same instant, Robin realized that Zack was actually giggling. She sat forward to make sure what she was seei ng was real, and the giggling grew so loud she th ought he'd wake his brother. Robin says, \"The light looked to me like a golden-yellow haze. There was no defined shape, but I knew with my heart and soul th at this was one of Zack's angels. A feeling of calmness and peace came over us.\" Robin and her boys slept soundly after that. • For a while, four-year-old Shailyn refused to go to bed, so her mother began giving her Reiki energy treatments while tucking her into bed, saying, \"Now, I'm tucking you in with"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"beautiful, golden light, and the angels are here to protect you and stay with you.\" Shailyn now goes to bed without any struggles. • Crystal's mother discovered that if her daught er had sugar close to bedtime, she wouldn't go to sleep. So sugar at this time of night has been eliminated - as have the sleeping problems. • Haley was plagued with nightmares about witch es and dark images, so her mother taught the little girl how to clear her energy space. Now Haley says to any untoward spirits: \"If you're not of God, you must go!\" Haley also visualizes a bubble of white light around her home, along with a golden dome of protection. This has alleviated the nightmares and has empowered young Haley. • Kathy DiMeglio used a combination program to help her daughter, Jasmyn, to sleep. Kathy says that Jasmyn's sleep problems st emmed from a combinat ion of fear of being harmed during the night and separation anxiety from her parents. So Kathy began playing the Chakra Clearing audiotape at night (many parents find it soothing, and it clears the energy of rooms quickly). She also began praying with her daughter, and talking to her about the archangels at bedtim e. Then Kathy took Jasmyn to the store and let her select a stuffed animal to sleep with. Afterward, Kathy cut her cords of fear to her daughter. Jasmyn now sleeps beautifully, and her parents don't worry about this area anymore. Potty Training There wasn't a clear pattern regarding toilet trai ning Crystal Children. Some parents said it was a breeze, and that kids practically taught themse lves what to do. However, other parents are still struggling. Abbie's mother says that her daughter takes he r time with most things. She says, \"Abbie spoke late for the most part, walked after her first birthday, and refused to be potty trained until she was more than three years old.\" Another woman told me that her son's toilet training was challenging because he wants to do everything for himself. She said, \"He's extremel y stubborn, making potty training a challenge. He's quite aware of the ability to do i t; he just chooses his own ways and when.\""},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Parents said that giving clear explanations to their Crystal Children helped them to understand why toilet use is important. Some Crystal Children refuse to c omply until they understand why. Picky or Super Organized? Are the Crystal Children intuitively trained Feng Shui artists who know that disorganization creates energetic discord? Or ar e they just prone to neurotic perfectionism? Again, I would opt for the answer signaling spiritual progress. However, when you actually live with a Crystal Child who insists that everything be just so , you might agree with the latter explanation during moments of frustration. I received dozens of stories about Crystal Childr en's organizational ski lls, and how particular they are about their rooms, their belongings, and their clothing. For instance, seven-year-old Hannah is very sensitive about the comfort of he r clothing. Her socks and shoes must be positioned perfectly, and her clothe s must be soft or she won't wear them. True nature children, many Crystals prefer nudity to clothing. Crystal Children like neat and organized bedr ooms, and some of them don't mind doing the work themselves. Three-year-old Victoria keeps her room very clean, which is no small accomplishment given the piles of toys, clothe s, books, and stuff ed animals she owns. Crystals also enjoy organizing their toys during playtime. For instance, three-year-old Taylor loves to line up his blocks and toys into shapes of crosses, airplanes, or alph abet letters. One time he placed all of his toys into a continuous line throughout the house. When it was done, he exclaimed, \"It's beautiful!\" Two-year-old Mei loves to place things into cate gories, like grouping together her baby dolls and Mommy dolls. She loves to put her dinosaur models into a long line, from the smallest to the biggest. Sometimes the Crystal Child's organizational le anings border on perfectionism. For example, three-year-old William won't use a crayon if it's broken, and he won't eat food that's \"messy\" with sauce. And seven-year-old Jacob insists th at building blocks be placed into precise positions. Again, it's all in how you look at the situation. You could call it perfectionism - which has a negative tone. I like the way Wendy Eidman calls it \"high creativity\" when she describes her three-year-old daughter, Emily. Wendy says:"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" \"Emily's attention span is unlike anything I 've ever witnessed befor e. She'll get into a groove coloring or playing, and she won't be disturbed until she's do ne. This works to my advantage when we're picking up pine cones in the backyard . We have this giant pine tree that drops hundreds of cones every fall. Wh en we pick them up, Emily stays on task better than anyone else in the family. My so n gets bored after five minutes, but an hour later, Emily's still out there picking up cones! It bothers her to leave a job unfinished. Aft er we'd cleaned the yard one day, she was playing on the swing set, and ev ery once in a while she'd spy a stray pine cone that had escaped our attention earlier. She'd get off the swing, or stop playing basketball or whatever else she was doing, then she'd walk over to the pine cone, pick it up, and deposit it in the cart! Emily is all about con sistency. She likes to know what to expect; she likes to have things the same way all the time. Emily gets upset, for example, if her brother decides he wa nts to sit in her seat at dinnertime, that sort of thing. Every night at the table, we have the same conversation. We go back and forth across the table, asking each other, 'So, how was your day?' Usually my husband, Kirk, answers, 'My day was very work-y.' But the other night, Kirk answered, 'My day was very bu sy!' And Emily got upset. She said, 'No, Daddy. Your day was very work-y!'\" Crystal Children love consistency. In a world where everything seems in flux, who can blame kids for wanting stability and predictabilit y? Sounds refreshingly healthy to me! Taking Their Time In the new world, we won't run our lives by clocks and calendars. We'll use inner timing to direct our actions. Through synchronicity, not appointme nts, we'll arrive at exactly the right place at the right time. Well, the Crystal Children are already ruled by inner clocks instead of outward time mechanisms. This can be frustrating to parents who need to keep a schedule. One thing's for sure: Parents of Crystal Children must develop a lot of patience - which is one of the lessons these children help us adults to learn."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Jennifer says that her seven-year-old son, Jacob, takes his time and doesn't rush for anyone or anything. Jennifer says that it's not that Jacob is mentally slow, it's just that he does things deliberately because he wants them a certain way. He operates from his own schedule, not others'. Three-year-old Abbie is the same way. Her mothe r says, \"She does things in 'Abbie Time,' and not necessarily when her preschool teacher wants he r to. She hates schedules and prefers to be a free spirit. I'm not sure how that will work with her school time.\" Crystal, the mother of three-year-o ld Zoey, says, \"I find that yo u need a lot of patience with the Crystal Children, because they're old souls who take their time l ooking at everything, inspecting it, and then giving you feedback on what they think. Zoey sits unti l she figures out how to tie her shoes, do her buttons, brush her ha ir, and such. I try to maintain a high patience level because I understand her need to take her time. She's neve r in a hurry and doesn't like to be rushed.\" The Crystal Children know that it's healthier to stay centered and calm rather than getting lathered up over the fear of being late. They already know that time isn't real, and that it can be bent and warped so that you'll always arrive on time - even when appearances suggest otherwise. Deep Bonding and the Need for Attention Crystal Children have a special bond with on e or more of their parents or grandparents - whoever can understand them on a deep level. Once that bond is formed, the Crystal Child doesn't like to be apart from that person. Crys tals are dependent on that adult for comfort, understanding, and cuddling. Thes e kids may develop separation anxiety because they're afraid that other people won't understand. These kids may also fear that other children or adults may be mean-spirited, and the sensit ive Crystal Children try to avoid pain by sticking with a trustworthy adult. Timothy says that his six-month-old daughter, Julia, always wants to be held. \"We can't lay her down for a minute,\" he says. Pam says that her daughter, Hannah, age four, \"came in with huge abandonment issues. She doesn't want to be alone at all, especially when it comes to being away from me.\" Some parents see the metaphysical basis of this s eeming clinginess. Carri Lineberry says that her three-year-old daughter, Maia, is extremely attached to her. Carri says, \"I sense that my"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"relationship to her is very important. I think of m yself as her 'grounding force' or something like that.\" Chapter 12: Advice from parents, teachers, and the crystal children themselves As a parent, grandparent, or teacher of a Crystal Child, you have a sacred and vital mission. You spiritually contracted to guide this soul through the delicate balancing act of retaining a high spiritual frequency with amazing gi fts of telepathy and sensitivity... while at the same time assimilating into Earthly life. Your job isn't ea sy, but fortunately you have lots of help from Earthly and celestial angels. Those whom I surveyed for this book were happy to pass along their tried-and-true advice based on their own personal experiences. Angels and prayer: Cynthia Berkeley says she's found it very effective to mentally ask her children's guardian angels to help soothe and calm her kids when they become overly irritated, especially when driving. Understand that they're visual: Right-brain dominant people have visual memories instead of language-based ones. For instance, they'll me morize how spelling words look, instead of how they sound phonetically. Catherine Poulton says it helps her to remember that her five-year-old son, Kylan, processes information differently. When he was two years old, Kylan struggled to remember his alphabet, but then one day he was flipping through a magazine and stopped and pointed to a picture. \"That's George Washingto n,\" he said correctly. This is when Catherine realized the extent of Kylan's visual processing. Explain, don't force: Forcing a Crystal Child only leads to a power struggle. Pam Caldwell says that her four-year-old daughter, Hannah, is very sweet and easy to get along with... unless you try to force her to do something against her will. \"But once you explain the logic behind it, Hannah will usually comply, or come up with a bette r solution,\" says Pam, who's found that it works best to talk to Hannah as if she's an adult, using age-appropriate language. Penny, mother of a Crystal Child, agrees. \"Allow them to be different, and don't force them into the 'normal' mold. Don't force them to talk, since it's possible to communicate with your"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"children more instinctively. They 'll talk when they're ready, when they see a need to talk verbally. Usually that will occur when they're i nteracting with other people who don't seem to understand their unique way of communicating.\" Attachment Parenting: Several of the parents whom I surveyed credited \"Attachment Parenting\" as a style of upbringing that was particularly helpful for their Crystal Children. Attachment Parenting is a philosophy that advises parents to physically and emotionally bond with their child through being sensitive and responsive when the child cries, breast-feeding, carrying the infant in a baby sling, sleeping with the child, and providing a gentle home environment. Many books and Internet sites discuss this parenting style. Bring animals into the acting-out situation: Here's a clever idea from Misty: \"Whenever my two-year-old daughter, Leah, acts out, I tell her, 'The cats are watching you!' This calms her down immediately.\" Leah doesn't want to lose the felines' respect! Live and let live: Melissa, mother of seven-year-old Liam, says, \"I'm not strict. I'm not a slave driver. I allow my son to be who he is. Liam instinctively knows what chores need to be done, and he does them. There's no arguing or yelli ng. I'm honest and forthright with him, and he returns the favor. We're a happy, casual, and loving family, an d we're functional in our dysfunctions.\" Another mother named Sue, concurs: \"These chil dren need freedom to run and be. When they come home from school angry, it's because they're fed up with being caged all day; they need the freedom to feel their feelings.\" Take care of yourself: Kathy says, \"Parents of Crystal Chil dren need to engage in their own routine of yoga and or meditation, and have mome nts of quiet reflection to become aware of their own Divine guidance. Keep a journal. Writ e letters to your Crystal Children - they'll not only be an amazing gift for when they're older, but it would also assist you with keeping a record of the miraculous incidents th at occur over the years.\" Talk to , not down: Crystal says that her three-year-old daughter, Zoey, acts out if she senses that someone's patronizing her or talking down to her. It's important to have discussions with Crystal Children using the same degree of respe ct that would be accorded to a dear friend."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Toning and chanting: Sue, the mother of two Crystal Children, says that she and her husband, Darren, do nightly chanting as their children go to sleep. The children now request it, saying, \"Mummy, can you please do that oohhh stuff on me?\" Schooling: Parents who can provide home-schooling, or send their children to Waldorf or Steiner schools, report great success with their Crystal Children's level of happiness and learning potential. A mother of a four-year-old Crystal Child says that her son attends a Waldorf kindergarten, and that she's noticed positive change s in his self-esteem, sense of so cial order, and imagination. (For information on Waldorf and Steiner schools, please see awsna.org in North America; steinerwaldorf.org.uk in the U.K., steiner-australia.org in Australia, and consult the Internet directories for other countries.) If schedules or budgets don't allow for these options, Michelle is a great example of taking another approach. She says that her six-year- old son, Robert, is way ahead of a lot of his classmates. \"He's very bright and inquisitive, so we do extensive homeschooling in addition to his schoolwork.\" Michelle says that Robert loves anything creative and thrives on having structure and schedules. Several parents said that when they helped the ir child with studying, the results were immediate. Meditation: Catherine, mother of five-year-old Kylan, says, \"My son loves to meditate and pray.\" Eastern exercises: Tai chi, qi gong, yoga, an d karate are wonderful outlets for youthful energy, and good tools for teaching Crystal Children to work with their own and others' energy. Catherine's son, Kylan, loves his karate classes. \"It teaches him to use his inner power effectively,\" she explains. \"He has a great teacher, and they're not doing it competitively. Plus, karate teaches Kylan how to build a protective force field around his body so he can be empathetic without taking on othe r peoples stuff (he's highly se nsitive). It teaches him great grounding and clearing exercises, too.\" Pay attention and tell the truth: Denise, mother of Alice, age five , says, \"Always pay attention. These kids don't like to be igno red. Never bend the truth or lie to them; they know a lie every"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"time and can get upset if they catch you in on e. Never break a promise; keeping your word is very important to them.\" Patience: Andrea, mother of three-year-old Abbie, ad vises parents to have patience with their Crystal Children. She says, \"They're not like other kids, and probably have much more to offer if given the chance - that is, not medicated to 'fit in with what society thinks kids should be like.\" Consistency: Many parents say that their Crystals do better with a consistent eating and sleeping schedule. Studies show that children feel safe wh en they know what to expect Mary, mother of a five- and six-year old, says, \"Getting my children to bed at the same time each night, along with lots of affection, makes a positive difference.\" Learn from them: Cynthia, mother of two Crystal Childr en, reminds us that Crystals are our teachers. She says, \"We can teach these kids how to function in this third-dimensional reality and how to play the game, but really, they're he re to teach us so much more beyond that. If you're not coming from the heart, the kids kno w. If you expect the kids to be naughty, guess what? They will be. Watch your own integrity and expectations. They can read you like a book and play with that.\" Visualization: Since Crystal Children are highly visu al, you can help them manage their moods and manifest their intentions by using visualizati on exercises. Here's a wonderful one that Rosie Ismail, a primary school teacher in En gland, uses in her classroom. She says: \"During the past four years, I 've worked with healing and co lors, using visualizations in my personal life. When I realized how effe ctive visualizing the color pink is, I began introducing this into my classroom and watch ed the wonderful and effective results it yielded for young children. Pink is a healing, loving color that creates peace and harmony for oneself and projects this to others. \"This simple technique of visualizing I call 'The Magical Pink Light.' I ask the children to close their eyes and take five or six deep breaths along with me, slowly releasing the breath on the exhale. Next, I ask them to visualize pink magical light at the bottom of their feet, going round and roun d their body. I tell them it doesn't matter if they don't see the magical pink light, but that it's powerful and to just think about it. I tell them to imagine this pink light as very magical and see it going around them like a warm blanket."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"I ask them to make a wish in this very magical pink light and to breathe it in, and then we end by taking two very deep breaths. I then g uide the children to op en their eyes, stretch their arms, and say, 'That felt good!' I find th at children are much calmer, happier, and more loving after the visualization.\" Energetic assistance: These sensitive, psychic children need our help! They're like sponges, absorbing other people's energies (including those of well-meaning parents). David Morelli is a professional psychic who teaches chil dren's spirituality classes at the Psychic Horizons Center in Boulder, Colorado. He also works as a Montessori schoolteacher. David says: \"One of the methods I teach children in my class is to imagine making a bubble in between their two hands, putting the 'yucky' energy in the bubble and clapping their hands to pop it. They can put the energy of an ything - their parents, teachers, or friends - in a bubble and pop it. After they make the ir bubbles and pop them, I then ask them to imagine happy golden energy above their head s filling in their wh ole bodies. This puts new energy back in to replace the other energies.\" Just love them: Gloria, the mother of two Crystal Children and one Indigo Child, puts parenting into perspective when she says: \"I've learned that love is the most important th ing of all. It's important to be patient and nurturing. Keep in mind that we aren't really here on this earth to master mathematics. Smiling and laughing with your children is just about the best feeling there is, so do it! When milk spills on the floor, make funny faces . When it rains outsid e, dance in it with your children. Love, love, love them!\" From the Mouths of Babes Several Crystal Children also offered words of wisdom for adults: Audrey, age five: \"I would like this b ook to get people to understand us.\""},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" Crystal, age six, was asked by her mother what she'd like to tell people. She said, \"Love. Love and help people, and be kind.\" Robert, six: \"All I can say is that I wish everyone in the universe (if there is life on other planets), good life, good heart, and good food. For all you grown-ups to help Crystal Children, you must protect them, play with them, and read with them.\" When his mother asked Colin, age four, what he'd like to tell people, he said, \"That God and the angels are with them always , even when they're scared.\" Haley, age three: \"I ask my angels to bring me dreams full of light before bed when I say my prayers.\" Hannah, age seven: \"The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow disappears, so be thankful for what you have.\" Jacob, age seven: \"For the future, everyone needs to know that they'll come back after they die.\" Kylan, age five: \"I would like to say about the plan et, that it has love in it and joy and a heart. People can help themselves by pu tting up signs on their walls like to be happy and tape it on the wall. The sign should say: BE HAPPY!\" About the Author Doreen Virtue, Ph.D., is a clairvoyant metaphysic ian who holds Ph.D., M.A., and B.A. degrees in counseling psychology.
